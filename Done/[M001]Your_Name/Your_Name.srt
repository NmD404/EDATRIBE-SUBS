1
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,024
Some mornings,

2
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,379
I wake up crying without knowing why.

3
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,846
That sort of thing happens now and again.

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,789
Whatever the dream was I had,

5
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:05,697
I can never remember it.

6
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:06,992
But...

7
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:08,665
But...

8
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,999
The only thing that does last when I wake up

9
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:13,693
This is a sense of loss

10
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,009
which lingers for a long time afterwards.

11
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:26,049
I'm always searching for something,

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,725
or someone.

13
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:31,207
I've been consumed by this feeling

14
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:33,241
ever since that day.

15
00:01:34,658 --> 00:01:38,044
The day a star fell.

16
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:40,071
It was almost like...

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,477
...like seeing something out of a dream.

18
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:45,279
Nothing more or less...

19
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:48,922
...than a breathtaking view.

20
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,868
Taki.

21
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:46,729
Taki.

22
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:48,840
Taki.

23
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't you remember?

24
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:56,420
My name is...

25
00:03:58,275 --> 00:03:59,255
...Mitsuha!

26
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:37,784
Sis, what are you doing?

27
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:41,166
Whoa. They're so realistic feeling.

28
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,755
"Sis"? Me?

29
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:45,703
Are you still asleep?

30
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,802
Breakfast time!

31
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,860
Hurry up!

32
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,253
Wha...? What?!

33
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,305
Do you wanna have any a last night's fish, Grandma?

34
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,419
You can eat it.

35
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:25,349
Morning.

36
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:26,138
Morning.

37
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:27,864
Lazy butt! You're so slow!

38
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,631
I'll fix breakfast tomorrow.

39
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,983
Oh, that's a lot.

40
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:38,149
Oh, well!

41
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,612
You're back to normal today.

42
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:43,137
You were so crazy yesterday.

43
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:44,970
What do you mean "crazy"?

44
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:48,543
Attention citizens of Itomori.

45
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,315
Good morning.

46
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:53,869
This is an official announcement from Itomori Town Hall.

47
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,767
It is in regards to the mayoral election.

48
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:59,875
The election will be held on the 20th of next month.

49
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:03,673
The election committee would
like to remind everyone that...

50
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,916
A comet that comes only once every 1,200 years

51
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:12,353
will finally be headed our way in a month.

52
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,006
The comet will be visible to the naked eye for
several days once it approaches the Earth...

53
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,105
Just make up with him already, okay?

54
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:20,393
It's an adult matter.

55
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:24,825
According to JAXA's spokesperson, they're
preparing for The celestia show of the millennium.

56
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:42,620
We're leaving!

57
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,905
I can't wait till the festival!

58
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,434
It's gonna be so much fun!

59
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,244
Study hard, Sis!

60
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:08,910
Ow!

61
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,958
Mitsuha!

62
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:14,243
Good morning, Saya. Morning, Teshi.

63
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,023
Morning.

64
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,834
Come on! Would you get off already?

65
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,109
What for, meanie?

66
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,056
'Cause you're heavy.

67
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,931
Hey, that's rude.`

68
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,187
You know, I've gotta say, you two make a great couple.

69
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,186
No we don't!

70
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,368
No we don't!

71
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:28,489
Oh, I see you actually bothered to do your hair today.

72
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:29,705
Wait, what?

73
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,770
Oh, yeah, what happened?
Did your grandma exorcise all your demons?

74
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,552
Exorcise?

75
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,668
Something totally possessed your body.

76
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:38,691
Would just give it a rest with all this occult nonsense?

77
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:41,346
Mitsuha's gotta be feeling stressed enough as it is,

78
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:41,712
Right?

79
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,368
What're you guys talking about?

80
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,863
Are you feeling okay?

81
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:47,978
And above all,

82
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:53,496
restoring the town's fiscal health so we
can continue our revitalization project!

83
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,074
It's only when all these things are achieved

84
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,424
that we can create a safe and secure community!

85
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,206
As the incumbent, my administration has...

86
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,012
Miyamizu's gonna get another term anyway.

87
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,604
I hear he's been doling out the pork, just between us.

88
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,634
Hey, Miyamizu.

89
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,868
Morning.

90
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,718
Looks like the mayor and the
contractors' kid are pretty cozy too.

91
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,126
Ew.

92
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,905
...and improve the quality of
life of each and every resident.

93
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:22,125
Mitsuha!

94
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,304
Stand up straight when you're walking!

95
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,343
Oh, he's tough on his family.

96
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,717
Well, that's the mayor for ya.

97
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,861
Awkward.

98
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,183
Sucks to be her.

99
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:33,345
Mitsuha.

100
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,283
In front of everyone...

101
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,579
"Two-light" That's the origin of the word "twilight."

102
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:56,070
I'm sure everyone here knows that word.

103
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,875
It's dusk. A time when it's neither day nor night.

104
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,331
When the border between worlds blur,

105
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,233
and one might encounter something not human.

106
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:09,839
Another older term for it is "dusk-light."

107
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:13,187
Some people also call it "golden hour."

108
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,493
What about magic hour?

109
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,207
It's something my grandma says.

110
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,755
Well, golden hour and magic
hour are technically the same.

111
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,523
But it's a term that mostly photographers use.

112
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,694
Well, she does take a lot of pictures.

113
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,584
Okay, next, Miyamizu!

114
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,225
Uh! Yes!

115
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:35,544
Well, I can see that  you remember your own name today.

116
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:40,798
You don't remember?

117
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:45,440
Well, believe it or not, you forgot where
your own desk and locker were yesterday.

118
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:49,460
Plus you had the worst case of bed head,
and you didn't have your ribbon on either.

119
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,309
What? No way!

120
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,798
Yeah, it was like you had amnesia or something.

121
00:09:57,085 --> 00:10:01,697
Now that you mention it, I do feel like
I've been having weird dreams lately.

122
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,524
Like a dream about someone else's life?

123
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:07,408
Ugh... It's all so fuzzy.

124
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:10,341
Wait a sec. I've got it!

125
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,462
It's memories from a previous life!

126
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,252
Or maybe your subconscious linked to the
Everett interpretation of the multiverse!

127
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,488
Keep your fool mouth shut!

128
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,955
Wait a minute, Teshi! Don't tell me
you're the one who wrote in my notebook!

129
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,876
Forget it.

130
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:28,692
But you really were acting just a
little funny yesterday, Mitsuha.

131
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,121
You been feeling okay?

132
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:33,426
That's what's weird.

133
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:35,331
I feel fine.

134
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:36,973
Maybe it's from stress.

135
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,545
Y'know, you've got that ritual coming soon, don'tcha?

136
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,550
Aww! Don't remind me!

137
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,878
I can't stand this place anymore.

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,178
It's too small and towny.

139
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:49,827
I wanna graduate already and
go to Tokyo as soon as I can!

140
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:52,264
Can't say I blame you.

141
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:55,233
There really is nothing at all in this town.

142
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,653
There's only one train that stops here every two hours.

143
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,452
And all the store closes at nine o'clock.

144
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:03,450
No bookstores, no dentists.

145
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,084
But two cocktail lounges for whatever reason.

146
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,189
No jobs in town.

147
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,220
No one datable.

148
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,210
Even the days are too short!

149
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,348
You know what?!

150
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,577
No, what?

151
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:18,325
Forget that stuff. Why don't we go to a café?

152
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:18,686
A café?

153
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,560
Really?

154
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,209
Where!?

155
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:26,749
Hello, kids.

156
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:27,704
Hi there!

157
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,683
How is this a café?

158
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,730
Like this town's got a café'.

159
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,007
Mitsuha just went straight home.

160
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:42,988
Things have gotta be really rough for her right now.

161
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:45,414
She's on center stage and all.

162
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,296
Yeah.

163
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,224
Hey, Teshi.

164
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:55,476
What're you gonna do after you graduate high school?

165
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,076
Where'd that come from?

166
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,702
You talking about the future?

167
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,486
I don't know.

168
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,396
I think I'll probably just end up living in this
town, you know? Same as ever.

169
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:23,709
I wanna do what you're doing.

170
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:26,504
It's still too soon for you to try, Yotsuha.

171
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,891
Listen to the thread's voice.

172
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,263
When you twine it round and round like this,

173
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:35,583
feelings will start flowing between you and the thread.

174
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,295
It's not like threads talk.

175
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,167
She's telling you to focus.

176
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:46,228
Etched within our braided cords is a
thousand years' worth of Itomori's history.

177
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,238
Listen, something happened 200 years ago.

178
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,926
Here she goes.

179
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:56,225
The bathroom of sandal maker
Mayugoro Yamazaki caught on fire,

180
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,751
and this whole area burned down.

181
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:01,906
The shrine and old documents were destroyed.

182
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,143
This is known as...

183
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,884
Mayugoro's Great Fire.

184
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,095
They named the fire after him?

185
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,990
I feel bad for Mayugoro.

186
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:14,888
The meaning behind our festivals
was lost because of that.

187
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,108
Only the surface was left.

188
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,601
But even if those words are gone,
the tradition shouldn't fade.

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,041
That's the Miyamizu Shrine's duty, our important task.

190
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:32,619
Despite all that, that son-in-law of mine...

191
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:38,244
Abandoning the Shinto priesthood and leaving
this house were bad enough, but politics?

192
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,167
Oh! He's hopeless.

193
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:42,978
Have another, Mr. Foreman.

194
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:45,288
The site we've got is a tricky one, that's for sure.

195
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,607
Whoa!

196
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,174
I'll be counting on your help again for this election.

197
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,289
Leave it to me.

198
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,201
You'll get the votes from the Kadoiri
and Sakagami districts, guaranteed.

199
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,596
How's the dating scene?

200
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,976
It ain’t easy, that's for sure!

201
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,185
Smells like corruption in there.

202
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,138
What're you talking about?

203
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:05,838
We're gonna need two or three more bottles.

204
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,256
Yes, dear.

205
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,903
Katsuhiko, you're gonna help
out at the site this weekend.

206
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,920
We'll be using explosives, so you better study up.

207
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:14,409
What was that?

208
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:15,311
Got it!

209
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,678
Guess we both can't stand things here.

210
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,644
Is that Yotsuha?

211
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,036
She's all grown up.

212
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,852
They're lookers all right, just like their mother.

213
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,204
Hey-a.

214
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,559
Hey.

215
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,417
World's oldest kind of saké.

216
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:40,520
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and then
letting it ferment naturally, it becomes alcohol.

217
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,560
<i>Kuchikamizake.</i>

218
00:15:42,716 --> 00:15:44,966
Do the gods really appreciate that?

219
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,841
The way it's...

220
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,266
Yeah! Of course they do!

221
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,619
Hey, check it out. It's Miyamizu.

222
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,486
Uh! I'd never do that!

223
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,622
And in front of everybody.

224
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:03,184
Embarrassing, right?

225
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,247
You should try to cheer up, Sis.

226
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:22,870
Who cares if a few of the kids
from your school saw all that?

227
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,672
It must be nice for you, not being a teenager.

228
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:27,427
Hey, I know,

229
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:29,519
you should just sell <i>kuchikamizake</i>

230
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:30,877
and move to Tokyo.

231
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,664
I bet you could sell it with all sorts of
stuff, like photos and making-of videos.

232
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,347
Oh! And then you could call it "Shrine Maiden Saké."

233
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:40,983
You'll make butt-loads!

234
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,507
I can't! There are liquor laws!

235
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,987
That's what you have a problem with?

236
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,242
I hate this town!

237
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,187
I hate this life too!

238
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:04,976
Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!

239
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:11,721
What a jackass.

240
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,273
Ouch...

241
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,090
Where?

242
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,332
Somethings... there.

243
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:23,383
Ow!

244
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,083
Taki! You up?

245
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,018
It was your turn to cook breakfast, wasn't it?

246
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:31,169
Did you sleep in?

247
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:32,526
Uh. I'm sorry.

248
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,475
Uh, I'm heading out.

249
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,045
Finish the miso.

250
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:38,648
O-Okay.

251
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:41,455
Make sure that you go to school even if you're late.

252
00:18:41,793 --> 00:18:42,377
See ya.

253
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,668
Have a nice day!

254
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,424
What a weird dream.

255
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:07,495
Huh? It's from... Tsukasa? Who's that?

256
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,638
I gotta go pee.

257
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:29,104
Way too real.

258
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,376
I'm in Tokyo!

259
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:51,162
Where did you get this?

260
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:51,622
Daikanyama.

261
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,670
Guess who's opening our next gig?

262
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:56,579
Hey, it's skip club stuff today and catch a movie.

263
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,679
Taki.

264
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,869
Can't believe you got in at noon.

265
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,309
Come on, let's grab lunch!

266
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,381
You ignored my text too.

267
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:12,367
Uh, Mister Tsukasa?

268
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,516
"Mister"? You don't have to go that far.

269
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,052
You got lost?

270
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:18,752
Yeah.

271
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,921
Wait a second,

272
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,702
how'd you wind up getting lost on the way to school?

273
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,641
Uh, well, a girl...

274
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,409
A girl?

275
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:27,380
Uh, a gal.

276
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,253
I mean...

277
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:30,991
A guy!

278
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,162
You know, guys just wanna have fun!

279
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:39,075
Every day's a festival when
you're living in Tokyo. As a guy.

280
00:21:39,553 --> 00:21:42,018
Hey, you sound funny.

281
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,398
And where's your lunch?

282
00:21:44,224 --> 00:21:45,119
Seriously?

283
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:46,759
What is up with you?

284
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:47,927
We can share something.

285
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:50,189
Let's make a croquette-egg sandwich.

286
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:52,057
Yes! Ha, ha!

287
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:55,626
Thank you.

288
00:21:57,805 --> 00:21:59,066
Wanna hit the café later?

289
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:01,862
Oh, that one? Sure. You in, Taki?

290
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,427
What? What?

291
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:04,938
What!?

292
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:06,096
A café!?

293
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,302
They've got nice timber-work in here.

294
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,656
Yeah, it's pretty intricate.

295
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:15,071
Taki, all set?

296
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:20,381
I could live for a whole month
on what these pancakes cost!

297
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:23,714
Uh, maybe a decade ago.

298
00:22:25,724 --> 00:22:27,872
Oh, well! It's only a dream!

299
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,145
Dreams are great.

300
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:42,761
What? Oh, no!

301
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:44,642
I think that I'm late for work!

302
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,522
You've got a shift today?

303
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:48,230
Guess you'd better get going.

304
00:22:48,257 --> 00:22:48,922
Uh, Right.

305
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:52,583
Uh, sorry, but uh...

306
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:56,444
Where exactly do I work?

307
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,880
Tables six, seven, and ten are waiting!

308
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,376
Three new diners!

309
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,074
Table 12! Taki!

310
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:09,376
Got it!

311
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,875
Here you go.

312
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:13,928
So the zucchini and tomato salad with a side...

313
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:15,528
We didn't order that.
Wha...?

314
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:18,236
Taki! I told you that we were out of truffles!

315
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:20,293
Taki, you've gotta talk louder!

316
00:23:20,318 --> 00:23:20,913
Taki!

317
00:23:22,706 --> 00:23:24,852
When is this nightmare gonna be over?

318
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,393
Waiter. Hey, you!

319
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,853
Uh, yes?

320
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:42,287
See this? Does it look right? A toothpick's in it.

321
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,750
What would've happened if we ate it?

322
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,927
It's really lucky I noticed when I did.

323
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,989
Do something.

324
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,060
Um... it's just that...

325
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:53,515
Well,

326
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:56,818
I don't even think we have toothpicks at this...

327
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,484
What?!

328
00:23:58,751 --> 00:23:59,986
Excuse me.

329
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:02,292
Is everything all right over here?

330
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:03,152
Well...

331
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,448
I'll take care of this.

332
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,634
What's wrong with you today?

333
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,896
We truly apologize.

334
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,633
Your meal is on the house tonight.

335
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:13,462
Why, thank you.

336
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:15,642
You weren't hurt, were you?

337
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,211
Um...

338
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,688
Okudera...

339
00:24:28,788 --> 00:24:30,076
That's "Miss" to you.

340
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:32,885
Miss Okudera, about before...

341
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,484
We just had some bad luck is all.

342
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:35,549
No, I...

343
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,718
Those guys were definitely scamming us.

344
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:40,423
I handled it according to the manual, but still...

345
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:44,100
Miss Okudera, your skirt!

346
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:46,818
Are you all right?

347
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:47,759
Did something happen?

348
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,438
Looks like someone cut it.

349
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:50,907
That guy.

350
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:53,603
What now? Do you remember what he looked like?

351
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,046
No...

352
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,634
Come with me.

353
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:58,176
Hey, Taki!

354
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:00,828
Okay, take off your skirt!

355
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:01,533
What?!

356
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,201
I'll-I'll look the other way!

357
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:09,431
Hold on. This won't take long.

358
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:15,702
All done! Ta-da!

359
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,937
You're really good, Taki!

360
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,893
It's way cuter now!

361
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,888
By the way, I wanted to thank you for
all your help with that customer earlier.

362
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:30,290
To be honest, well, I was worried about you.

363
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,018
You aren't that strong,
but you're quick to pick a fight.

364
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:36,426
Heh. I like you better today.

365
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,547
You've got a feminine side. Who would a guessed?

366
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:54,532
I gotta say, this dream sure does seem real.

367
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:01,139
Ah, looks like he keeps a journal.

368
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,510
So organized.

369
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,999
I wish I lived in Tokyo.

370
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:15,748
One of her!

371
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:22,510
Unrequited love?

372
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,875
What is this?

373
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,446
Wha–? What?

374
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:16,583
What is going on?

375
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:19,905
So café today?

376
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,746
Thanks, but I gotta go to work.

377
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,356
Ha! Do you remember where to go?

378
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:30,408
Wait a second, was that you, Tsukasa?
Are you the one that's been messing with my phone?

379
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,324
Uh. Never mind. Later.

380
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:37,384
Well, he's back to normal.

381
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,448
I think he was kinda... cute yesterday.

382
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,120
What's up?

383
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:48,507
Don't play dumb! What about bro code, huh?

384
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,447
You walked home with her yesterday, right?

385
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,594
What're you talking about? Me and Miss Okudera?

386
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:57,075
So what did you guys do?

387
00:27:57,216 --> 00:28:00,634
Uh, well, I don't remember actually.

388
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,395
Quit messing around and tell us!

389
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,996
Okudera, reporting for duty!

390
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,283
Don't slack off today, you guys.

391
00:28:07,328 --> 00:28:08,099
Yeah.

392
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,482
We're gonna have a good day today.

393
00:28:11,342 --> 00:28:13,091
Aren't we, Taki?

394
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:29,535
I see you're not touching your boobies today.

395
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:30,959
Breakfast time!

396
00:28:31,302 --> 00:28:32,222
Hurry up!

397
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:36,768
My boobs?

398
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:40,344
Morning.

399
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:49,767
I feel like everyone's staring at me for some reason.

400
00:28:50,193 --> 00:28:52,980
Well, ya did kinda make a scene yesterday.

401
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:53,663
Huh?

402
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:58,115
Did you see all the election posters?

403
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:01,778
Doesn't matter who wins,nothing I change.
Except for who gets the gift bag.

404
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:04,555
Shh! Somebody's daddy's depending on it.

405
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:08,223
They're talking about me, right?

406
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,169
Wait! Mitsuha?

407
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,496
I... I...

408
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,525
I did what?

409
00:29:29,363 --> 00:29:30,175
Mitsuha?

410
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:40,472
Could this...? Could this mean...?

411
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:42,340
No, no, no, no!

412
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,010
Could this mean... that we're really...?

413
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:48,101
That we're...? In our dreams, that guy and I...

414
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,811
That we're...? In our dreams, that girl and I...

415
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:53,599
We're switching places?!

416
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,312
I'm slowly beginning to get what's going on.

417
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,114
Taki's in high school and living in Tokyo.

418
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:38,393
Two or three times a week,
I'll suddenly and randomly switch with Mitsuha,

419
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,291
who's somewhere out in the boonies.

420
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:43,800
The trigger is sleep. The cause is unknown.

421
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:46,109
Any memories I have of the switch

422
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:48,730
get more and more hazy after I wake up.

423
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,714
But there's no doubt that we're switching places.

424
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,697
The reactions of everyone around us prove it.

425
00:30:55,164 --> 00:30:56,088
That's why...

426
00:30:56,543 --> 00:30:58,841
That's why we decided to lay out some rules

427
00:30:58,947 --> 00:31:00,936
so we could protect each other's way of life.

428
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,689
Things to watch out for during the switches,

429
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:05,681
and a list of stuff we should never do.

430
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:10,430
We also agreed to leave each other reports
on our phones on the days we switch places.

431
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,760
So that we can work together to get
through this weird thing that's happening.

432
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,190
And yet...

433
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,637
And yet...

434
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,744
I cannot believe this guy (girl)!

435
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,435
Guys'll stare.

436
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,781
Watch the skirt! These are basics for a girl!

437
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:45,945
Stop wasting my money on sweets!

438
00:31:46,264 --> 00:31:49,019
It's going in your body!
Plus I also work for that money.

439
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:51,000
Braiding cords is impossible!

440
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,000
You work way too many shifts!

441
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,624
'Cause you keep wasting money!

442
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:17,390
Had tea with Miss Okudera on the way home.

443
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:19,343
You two have a good thing going.

444
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,620
Quit messing with my relationships, Mitsuha!

445
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:26,603
Hey, Taki, why's a girl confessing her love to me?

446
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:29,294
Maybe you're just more popular when I'm you.

447
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:32,400
You're so full of yourself! Like you have a girlfriend.

448
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,172
It's not like you have anyone either!

449
00:32:34,197 --> 00:32:34,789
I don't...

450
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,543
I don't...

451
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,767
Because I don't want a relationship!

452
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:00,928
I shouldn't for her sake.

453
00:33:05,365 --> 00:33:07,577
You sure do like your own boobies.

454
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:10,819
Time to go! Get ready!

455
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:17,143
Over the course of the last few days,
the Tia-mat comet has been visible.

456
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,305
But when and where can people see it?

457
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,948
The Tia-mat comet will be moving in the same direction
the sun does, from east to west from our point of view.

458
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,178
So right after sunset. As for where...

459
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,586
Why're you wearing your uniform?

460
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:43,175
Grandma? Why does our shrine god's
relic have to be kept so far away?

461
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:46,348
'Cause of Mayugoro, I don't really know.

462
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:47,759
Who's Mayugoro?

463
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,096
What? He's famous!

464
00:33:58,022 --> 00:33:59,369
Hop on, Grandma.

465
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:04,931
Oh!

466
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,866
Watch out! Careful!

467
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,036
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know about Musubi?

468
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:23,064
Musubi?

469
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,833
It's what we used to call the local guardian
deity long ago and it means "union."

470
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:31,550
This word has profound meaning.

471
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,812
Tying strings together is a union.

472
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:37,642
Connecting to people is a union.

473
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,233
And the flow of time is a union.

474
00:34:40,868 --> 00:34:44,009
These are all part of the god's power.

475
00:34:44,393 --> 00:34:47,477
The braided cords that we make are tied to that.

476
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:52,463
A skill from the god,
they represent the flow of time itself.

477
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,226
They assemble and take shape.

478
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:58,867
They twist, tangle,

479
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:03,293
unravel now and then, break and reconnect.

480
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:07,733
That's what a union is. What time is.

481
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,070
Have a drink.

482
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:13,243
Thanks.

483
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,855
I want some too!

484
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:17,668
That's also a union.

485
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,200
Whether it's water, rice, or saké,

486
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:27,880
when something becomes a part of a
person, it's a union, it joins their soul.

487
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:32,617
Which is why the offering we're making
today is such an important custom.

488
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,580
It connects the god with people.

489
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,444
Hey, I can see it!

490
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,327
This is where it is.

491
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,588
The sacred relic of Miyamizu Shrine.

492
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,437
What lies ahead is the hereafter.

493
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,035
It's the netherworld.

494
00:36:11,645 --> 00:36:13,587
The netherworld!

495
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:22,460
In order to return to this world,
you have to leave behind what is most important to you.

496
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,149
Like the <i>kuchikamizake</i> .

497
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,850
<i>Kuchikamizake</i> ?

498
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,872
You'll offer it at the foot of the shrine god's relic.

499
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,831
After all, it is half of you.

500
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,270
Half... of Mitsuha.

501
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,138
Wow! It's already magic hour!

502
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:03,410
Hm? Magic hour?

503
00:37:13,813 --> 00:37:14,813
Oh, yeah!

504
00:37:14,953 --> 00:37:16,557
Maybe I can see the comet.

505
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:19,165
The comet?

506
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:20,937
Oh,

507
00:37:21,546 --> 00:37:22,578
Mitsuha,

508
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,357
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

509
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,073
I'm crying?

510
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:40,774
But why?

511
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:47,119
Miss Okudera?

512
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:49,362
She's almost where?

513
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:53,010
Oh, Mitsuha, what did you do?

514
00:37:54,323 --> 00:37:55,144
Date?!

515
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:05,620
Tomorrow's your Tokyo date with Miss Okudera!

516
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,487
Meet up at the station at 10:30!

517
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:13,073
Well, that's what I had planned, but...

518
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:28,528
Hi, Taki!

519
00:38:30,412 --> 00:38:31,372
Wait long?

520
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,469
Yeah. Uh, no.

521
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:45,073
I just got here.

522
00:38:45,187 --> 00:38:47,387
Thank goodness. Let's go.

523
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,944
Must be nice.

524
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:53,448
They've probably met up about now.

525
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:58,002
Huh?

526
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,099
Why am I...?

527
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:05,854
Why?

528
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,158
It was a date I wanted to go on,

529
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:16,748
but if it so happens you end up going,

530
00:39:16,974 --> 00:39:19,141
you'd better be grateful and enjoy it!

531
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:23,060
This is a nice. It's my first time here.

532
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:24,919
So is this one of your usual go-to spots, Taki?

533
00:39:24,944 --> 00:39:27,610
At any rate, I bet you've never
even been on a single date.

534
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,076
No wait. It's too expensive!

535
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:32,748
I don't know what to say to her.

536
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:37,734
That's why I've hand-picked some links
below to help you out, you wall flower.

537
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:38,484
For real?

538
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:47,929
She's making fun of me.

539
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,556
You know something, Taki?

540
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:22,874
Today you're... you're like a different person.

541
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,672
Um, Miss Okudera,

542
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:37,336
You getting hungry? We could get dinner.

543
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,712
Uh. Let's call it a day.

544
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,394
All right.

545
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,207
I could be wrong,

546
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,309
and I'm sorry if I am.

547
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:47,973
About?

548
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:52,048
But you used to have a little crush on me, am I right?

549
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,680
But right now, there's someone else you like, huh?

550
00:40:57,068 --> 00:41:00,363
No. No, it's not that.

551
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:01,302
Really?

552
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:04,011
There's no one. It's not like that.

553
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:05,940
Are you sure about that?

554
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:10,527
Well, thanks for today! See you at work.

555
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,350
By the time the date's over...

556
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:30,334
...you should be able to see the comet in the sky.

557
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,237
What does she mean? Weirdo.

558
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,101
Oh, it's you, Teshi.

559
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:08,778
No,

560
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,177
I just didn't feel like going, that's all. I'm fine.

561
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:15,527
What? The festival?

562
00:42:18,296 --> 00:42:19,825
Oh, yeah, the comet.

563
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:22,214
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

564
00:42:23,431 --> 00:42:26,282
Okay, got it. See ya later.

565
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:33,432
You're just looking forward to seeing
Mitsuha in a yukata, aren'tcha?

566
00:42:33,506 --> 00:42:34,706
I-I am not!

567
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,274
I mean, it didn't even cross my mind.

568
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,478
Y'know, she sounded kinda down when I talked to her.

569
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,569
Maybe she just didn't want a call from ya.

570
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:44,938
It's not funny!

571
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:45,691
Sorry to keep ya.

572
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:46,459
Oh, she's here!

573
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:47,199
You're late.

574
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,534
Mitsuha, what happened to...?

575
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:55,167
Your hair!

576
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:58,532
I guess... it's weird.

577
00:43:07,724 --> 00:43:09,537
You think it's gotta do with some guy?

578
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:11,004
Like... he broke her heart?

579
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,960
Guys always just assume that it has to do with a boy.

580
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,497
She said she felt like cutting it.

581
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:20,315
Ya sure about that? You really think she
felt like cutting off that much of it?

582
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,073
Hey, guys! I can see it!

583
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:43,325
Whoa.

584
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:05,770
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network

585
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,249
or has been turned off due...

586
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:13,846
I'll just have to tell her how lousy the
date ended up the next time we switch.

587
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,153
That's what I thought.

588
00:44:17,443 --> 00:44:17,972
But...

589
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:23,240
For some reason, the switches Mitsuha
and I'd been going through until now...

590
00:44:24,486 --> 00:44:25,835
they never happened again.

591
00:46:19,183 --> 00:46:19,638
Wha...?

592
00:46:20,526 --> 00:46:23,206
What're...? What're you doing here?

593
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:28,980
Tsukasa told me, so here I am.

594
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,263
I asked for two things.

595
00:46:34,723 --> 00:46:37,910
To cover my shift,
and to back up my alibi if my dad asked.

596
00:46:37,944 --> 00:46:39,765
Relax, Takagi's gonna take your shift.

597
00:46:39,912 --> 00:46:42,729
Gotcha covered! But you owe me dinner!

598
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:44,777
So you're all in on it.

599
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,643
You've got everyone worried about you.

600
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,192
Huh?

601
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:50,618
We can't ignore this. What if somebody's
trying to pull one over on you?

602
00:46:50,645 --> 00:46:51,631
Like catfish?

603
00:46:51,995 --> 00:46:54,176
I mean you met this person online, didn't you?

604
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,546
No, not exactly! It's kinda complicated.

605
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,676
Could be from a dating site.

606
00:46:57,701 --> 00:46:58,703
She's not!

607
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,824
It's because you've been acting awfully fishy lately.

608
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:03,513
So we're keeping an eye on you.

609
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,282
I don't need a baby sitter, okay?

610
00:47:07,698 --> 00:47:08,966
The switches stopped.

611
00:47:09,713 --> 00:47:12,783
My calls never connected and texts never went through.

612
00:47:12,936 --> 00:47:15,674
That's why I decided to go see Mitsuha in person.

613
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,877
I wanted to see her.

614
00:47:19,563 --> 00:47:20,009
But...

615
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,082
What?

616
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,195
You don't know where she is exactly?

617
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:27,594
The town's landscape is your only clue?

618
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:28,655
Yeah.

619
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:33,165
And you can't contact her?

620
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,048
What's that about?

621
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:37,504
Where are we? You're a terrible tour guide.

622
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:38,949
'Cause I'm not one!

623
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:42,237
Oh, well. Guess we'll help you search.

624
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,174
Ah! It's so cute! Look, Taki!

625
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:46,775
Seriously, guys?

626
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:48,650
It moved! Aw!

627
00:48:18,216 --> 00:48:19,391
This is a lost cause.

628
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:23,231
What? After everything that we've done for you today?

629
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,888
You haven't done anything.

630
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:33,064
One Takayama ramen.

631
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:34,434
One Takayama ramen.

632
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:36,234
I guess I'll have the same.

633
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,172
Sure.

634
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,047
Three orders of ramen.

635
00:48:39,197 --> 00:48:39,727
Got it.

636
00:48:42,023 --> 00:48:44,138
Think we can make it back to Tokyo tonight?

637
00:48:44,163 --> 00:48:46,421
Well, I think we'll be cutting it close.

638
00:48:46,446 --> 00:48:47,246
Let me take a look.

639
00:48:47,363 --> 00:48:48,255
'K, thanks.

640
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,492
Wait, Taki, you sure about that?

641
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:57,330
Yeah. I kinda feel like maybe I've been
barking up the wrong tree this whole time.

642
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,604
Hey. That's a sketch of Itomori, isn't it?

643
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,899
It's drawn really well.

644
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,180
Come take a look at this, Hun!

645
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:13,263
Yeah, that's Itomori.

646
00:49:13,814 --> 00:49:14,955
It takes me back.

647
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:17,306
My husband was born and raised there, you know.

648
00:49:17,673 --> 00:49:18,730
Itomori?

649
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:23,414
Yes, of course! That's the place!

650
00:49:23,655 --> 00:49:25,069
It's nearby, right?

651
00:49:25,776 --> 00:49:26,732
You don't...

652
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,556
Itomori was...

653
00:49:29,005 --> 00:49:30,333
Itomori?

654
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:31,455
Wait!

655
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:31,881
But that's where...

656
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:33,648
Isn't that the area where that comet...?

657
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,041
Hey, is this place really where she's from?

658
00:50:27,261 --> 00:50:30,700
No way. Taki must've just
confused this with somewhere else.

659
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,069
No, I didn't.

660
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:34,403
This was the place.

661
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:37,560
This schoolyard. These mountains.

662
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,442
Even this high school here! I remember it all!

663
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:42,212
There's no way you could.

664
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,769
You've gotta know about that
disaster three years ago, right?

665
00:50:46,633 --> 00:50:48,393
Hundreds of people died.

666
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:49,135
They died?

667
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,030
Three years ago?

668
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:54,000
It can't be.

669
00:50:56,116 --> 00:50:57,123
There's no way.

670
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,798
I mean,

671
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,315
I still have the memos she wrote.

672
00:51:19,026 --> 00:51:20,127
They're fading...

673
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:34,952
Comet Tia-mat, with an orbital period of 1,200 years,

674
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:38,449
made a close approach to Earth
three years ago in October.

675
00:51:39,677 --> 00:51:42,881
Nobody foresaw that its nucleus
would split at its perigee.

676
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:53,254
The fragment that broke off of it
became a meteor and struck Japan.

677
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,999
It looks like that day was the
same date as the autumn festival.

678
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:01,577
The point of impact was here.

679
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,976
At 8:42 p.m. it fell right around where
people were gathered for the festival.

680
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,641
Over 500 died.

681
00:52:14,182 --> 00:52:16,192
It was a third of the town's population,

682
00:52:16,746 --> 00:52:18,995
and now nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

683
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,317
Teshigawara...

684
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,889
and Sayaka.

685
00:52:35,703 --> 00:52:37,272
Huh? That's her?

686
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,544
You were wrong. You gotta be.

687
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,887
After all, this girl here died three years ago!

688
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:47,899
Just two or three weeks ago she said
that I'd be able to see the comet.

689
00:52:48,673 --> 00:52:49,593
That means...!

690
00:52:50,623 --> 00:52:52,188
You're dreaming right now.

691
00:52:52,914 --> 00:52:53,320
I...

692
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:54,284
aren't you?

693
00:52:56,318 --> 00:52:57,094
I...

694
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:01,206
What... was I?

695
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,421
Sounds lively over there.

696
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,707
They only have one room left. I'm really sorry.

697
00:53:19,814 --> 00:53:20,866
It's not a problem.

698
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,275
How's Taki?

699
00:53:23,508 --> 00:53:25,748
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

700
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:29,848
He's going through all those newspapers
and magazines at random. Seems obsessive.

701
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,029
What is it?

702
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,216
Oh, sorry. You smoke, huh?

703
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,541
Yeah. I did quit at one point.

704
00:53:42,912 --> 00:53:45,256
What do you think about what Taki's been saying?

705
00:53:48,806 --> 00:53:50,676
I had feelings for him, you know.

706
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:53,092
The way he's been recently.

707
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:55,661
I mean, he was a nice guy before,

708
00:53:55,828 --> 00:53:57,442
but he's even nicer now.

709
00:53:58,278 --> 00:54:01,702
Kind of... frantic. It was cute.

710
00:54:02,703 --> 00:54:06,655
Although I do think what he's been
telling us is definitely strange sounding.

711
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:11,971
But in the end,
the fact remains that Taki's met someone,

712
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:14,194
and that someone is the reason he changed.

713
00:54:15,816 --> 00:54:17,319
That much is for sure.

714
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:34,495
It was all just a dream.

715
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:38,058
I recognized the landscape

716
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:41,403
because I unconsciously remembered
the news from three years ago.

717
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:46,713
If it's not that, is she... a ghost?

718
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:47,849
Or...

719
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,720
did I just make it up? The whole thing.

720
00:54:55,649 --> 00:54:57,302
What was her name?

721
00:54:58,116 --> 00:54:59,324
I can't remember.

722
00:55:01,933 --> 00:55:04,457
Tsukasa said he was gonna go ahead and take a bath.

723
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:05,883
Miss Okudera.

724
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:08,191
Uh... I, um...

725
00:55:08,924 --> 00:55:11,622
I realize I've been saying a lot of strange things.

726
00:55:12,492 --> 00:55:14,469
I'm really sorry, and thank you.

727
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,475
Braided cords. Pretty.

728
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,945
That band on your wrist,

729
00:55:28,432 --> 00:55:29,499
that's one, isn't it?

730
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,693
Oh, this thing? Guess so.

731
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:36,048
Somebody... Someone gave it to me.

732
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:39,540
I wear it sometimes as kind of a lucky charm.

733
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,605
Who was it?

734
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,133
It's late. Why don't you go down and take a bath too?

735
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,825
Sure. Wait.

736
00:55:54,152 --> 00:55:56,692
Yeah, someone who makes these.

737
00:55:57,034 --> 00:55:58,701
They once told me something.

738
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:01,578
The cords represent the flow of time.

739
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:05,086
They twist and tangle, unravel and connect.

740
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,837
And how that's what time is.

741
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:11,341
Maybe if I could...

742
00:56:37,844 --> 00:56:38,971
Taki.

743
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,750
Taki.

744
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,596
Taki!

745
00:56:44,553 --> 00:56:45,902
Don't you remember?

746
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,019
Taki...

747
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:36,369
Eat this bento up there.

748
00:57:37,516 --> 00:57:39,258
Your drawing of Itomori,

749
00:57:40,174 --> 00:57:41,451
you did a real good job.

750
00:58:19,212 --> 00:58:21,105
They assemble and take shape.

751
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,167
They twist, tangle,

752
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,979
unravel now and then, break and reconnect.

753
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,918
That's what a union is.

754
00:58:30,749 --> 00:58:32,333
What time is.

755
00:58:43,722 --> 00:58:44,821
There it is!

756
00:58:47,281 --> 00:58:48,423
It's really there.

757
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:51,893
It wasn't a dream.

758
00:59:23,153 --> 00:59:26,337
What lies ahead... is the netherworld.

759
00:59:49,136 --> 00:59:50,470
It's still here.

760
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:54,435
This was Yotsuha's,

761
00:59:55,279 --> 00:59:56,546
and this was mine.

762
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,809
This was before the comet.

763
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,600
So when I switched places with her,

764
01:00:04,196 --> 01:00:06,176
it was also three years in the past.

765
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:11,031
Our times got tangled somehow.

766
01:00:12,523 --> 01:00:14,683
This is half of her.

767
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:30,559
Musubi.

768
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,815
If it's true, and time can be unraveled,

769
01:00:35,876 --> 01:00:37,747
just give me one chance.

770
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:53,777
A comet!

771
01:01:59,203 --> 01:02:01,852
Your name's going to be Mitsuha.

772
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,105
Both of you are my treasures.

773
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:13,321
You're going to be a big sister.

774
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,396
I'm so sorry, me dears.

775
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:23,604
Dad, when is Mommy coming home?

776
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,027
I couldn't help her.

777
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,060
Get a hold of yourself!

778
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,644
Who cares about the shrine?!

779
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,204
But you're in charge now!

780
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:33,525
I loved Futaba! Not Miyamizu Shrine.

781
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,805
Get out!

782
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:41,587
Now listen to me, girls, starting today,

783
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:44,016
you'll be living with Grandma.

784
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,259
Who am I?

785
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:51,434
Who are you?

786
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,235
Don't be full of yourself!

787
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:55,131
Like you have a girlfriend.

788
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,369
Must be nice.

789
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,934
They've probably met up about now.

790
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,369
Why am I...?

791
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,844
I'm going to Tokyo.

792
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,864
What? Wait, Sis!

793
01:03:07,394 --> 01:03:08,147
Grandma.

794
01:03:08,962 --> 01:03:10,720
would you mind doing me a favor?

795
01:03:11,837 --> 01:03:13,483
Oh, yeah, the comet.

796
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,283
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

797
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:20,103
Mitsuha! Don't go there!

798
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:25,200
Mitsuha, You've gotta get out of
town before the comet strikes!

799
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:29,692
Mitsuha, run!

800
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,353
Mitsuha. Mitsuha!

801
01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:36,163
Mitsuha!

802
01:03:53,764 --> 01:03:56,385
Mitsuha. She's alive.

803
01:04:07,509 --> 01:04:09,451
Let me guess, you're touching your boo...

804
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:13,754
Her sister!

805
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,541
Yotsuha!

806
01:04:21,552 --> 01:04:23,867
I think she's finally lost it.

807
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:27,179
Just for today, I'm gonna head out first.

808
01:04:27,386 --> 01:04:28,465
She's lost it.

809
01:04:28,758 --> 01:04:32,491
Really lost it. Totally, totally lost it.

810
01:04:32,642 --> 01:04:38,005
For all you star-gazers out there, the comet Tia-mat
has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now.

811
01:04:38,316 --> 01:04:41,911
Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 p.m.

812
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:44,086
and be at its maximum brightness
when viewed from the Earth's surface.

813
01:04:44,609 --> 01:04:47,192
It's tonight. There's still time left.

814
01:04:48,053 --> 01:04:49,647
Morning, Mitsuha.

815
01:04:50,093 --> 01:04:51,192
What's this?

816
01:04:52,414 --> 01:04:55,855
Hold on. You're not Mitsuha, are you?

817
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,393
Wait, how did you...?

818
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,634
You already knew?

819
01:05:00,023 --> 01:05:05,864
No, but watching the way you've been
behaving lately stirred some memories up.

820
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,277
When I was a young girl,

821
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:12,577
I had some pretty strange dreams myself.

822
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,066
Though it's been so long,

823
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:19,811
the memories of who I became in those
dreams have pretty much faded at this point.

824
01:05:20,554 --> 01:05:21,578
Faded.

825
01:05:21,869 --> 01:05:23,698
Treasure the experience.

826
01:05:23,751 --> 01:05:26,291
Dreams eventually will fade away.

827
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:29,695
I went through similar times myself,

828
01:05:29,945 --> 01:05:31,658
and so did your mother.

829
01:05:33,091 --> 01:05:36,512
What if... all those dreams
that the Miyamizu people had...

830
01:05:36,818 --> 01:05:38,465
...it had to do with today?

831
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:41,929
Grandma, you have to listen to me!

832
01:05:42,932 --> 01:05:46,574
Tonight, the comet is going to fall on Itomori.

833
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,109
You're all gonna die!

834
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:56,815
"Nobody's gonna believe that"?

835
01:05:57,215 --> 01:05:59,658
I didn't expect that out of Mitsuha's grandma.

836
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:01,289
It doesn't matter!

837
01:06:01,356 --> 01:06:03,528
There's no way I'm gonna let them all die!

838
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:07,767
Mitshua! What happened to...?

839
01:06:09,013 --> 01:06:11,448
What'd you...? You're hair!

840
01:06:11,495 --> 01:06:14,189
Ah, the haircut? Looked better before, huh?

841
01:06:14,214 --> 01:06:15,958
No! I-It's good!

842
01:06:15,983 --> 01:06:19,693
Never mind that! If we don't do
something about tonight, we'll all die!

843
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:20,401
What?

844
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:24,397
It's up to us to save everyone!

845
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:31,101
Wait! Shouldn't you be in school?

846
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:35,590
Well, we sort of have to save the town, or something.

847
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:38,819
The warning system?

848
01:06:38,902 --> 01:06:40,786
Yeah, those speakers all over town.

849
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,909
I get it. It could work!

850
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,817
Nice job, Teshi!

851
01:06:49,951 --> 01:06:52,547
Hey, I don't think you should be sitting so close to me.

852
01:06:52,572 --> 01:06:54,866
What's wrong? Uh-oh! You shy?

853
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:57,830
Would ya quit it? It ain't proper! And you know it!

854
01:07:01,753 --> 01:07:02,979
Such a gentleman!

855
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:08,523
I bought all the snacks, guys! Here's the change.

856
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:09,887
Sorry for the trouble.

857
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,464
I didn't mind.

858
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,836
We ought be getting paid.

859
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:13,909
Quit complaining.

860
01:07:15,376 --> 01:07:17,499
So? What'd ya come up with?

861
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,277
Got an evacuation plan?

862
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:25,584
A... A... A bomb?!

863
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:30,303
Yeah, we have water gel explosives we
use for construction at our storage site.

864
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,864
And the warning system?

865
01:07:33,111 --> 01:07:36,974
A start up frequency can hijack the
town's warning system pretty easily.

866
01:07:37,114 --> 01:07:40,958
So we can broadcast an evacuation warning
for the whole town right from school!

867
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,452
Look, we're outside the disaster area here,

868
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:46,146
so we'll just make an announcement
to evacuate to the school.

869
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,184
It's... It's totally a crime.

870
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,923
You'll be in charge of the broadcast, Saya.

871
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:51,711
Why me?!

872
01:07:51,736 --> 01:07:53,238
You're in the broadcast club.

873
01:07:53,498 --> 01:07:55,258
And I'll be in charge of the explosives.

874
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:57,128
While I go have a word with the mayor.

875
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:57,513
Why?

876
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:02,124
'Cause if the evacuation order's not coming
from town hall, then nobody's gonna go anywhere.

877
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:05,095
But if I talk to the mayor,
as his daughter, I can convince him.

878
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:06,810
It's the perfect plan.

879
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,980
Fine, I don't really care one way or the other.

880
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:13,128
This is just a theory of yours, right?

881
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:15,623
Uh. Well...

882
01:08:15,776 --> 01:08:17,373
Theories can be based on reality!

883
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,986
Like, do you know the story of
how Itomori Lake was formed?

884
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,318
It's a crater!

885
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:25,498
That means a meteor hit this area
at least once a thousand years ago!

886
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:27,503
Right! That's why...

887
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,473
Nice one, Teshi!

888
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:35,470
Let's go evacuate the town!

889
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,611
What on earth are you talking about?

890
01:08:43,603 --> 01:08:47,383
Like I said, we have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or else...

891
01:08:47,408 --> 01:08:48,783
Enough. Shut up!

892
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:57,645
The comet is going to split in two and strike the town?

893
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:00,538
Over five hundred will die?

894
01:09:01,127 --> 01:09:04,024
How dare you stand there and spout such nonsense!

895
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,275
If you're serious, you must be sick.

896
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:10,863
I guess recklessness is a Miyamizu trait.

897
01:09:12,742 --> 01:09:16,099
I'll have a car take you to the
city hospital for an examination.

898
01:09:16,356 --> 01:09:19,636
We will continue this discussion
after you've seen a doctor.

899
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,601
You!

900
01:09:24,499 --> 01:09:25,734
You son of a...

901
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,241
Mitsuha?

902
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:37,658
No...

903
01:09:38,769 --> 01:09:39,863
Wait a minute...

904
01:09:41,559 --> 01:09:42,430
Who are you?

905
01:09:57,897 --> 01:09:59,263
I'll see you guys at the festival.

906
01:09:59,288 --> 01:10:01,715
We'll meet you at the steps to the shrine!
Don't be late, okay?

907
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,569
Bye-bye!

908
01:10:02,594 --> 01:10:03,156
See ya.

909
01:10:03,249 --> 01:10:04,049
Later.

910
01:10:05,851 --> 01:10:06,971
You shouldn't go!

911
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:10,154
You've gotta leave town! Tell all of your friends!

912
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,606
What's wrong with ya?

913
01:10:11,762 --> 01:10:12,576
Mitsuha!

914
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,586
What was that about?

915
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:14,828
Come on. Let's go.

916
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,249
What're you doing, huh?

917
01:10:17,903 --> 01:10:19,216
If it was Mitsuha,

918
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:21,891
would she have been able to convince him?

919
01:10:22,196 --> 01:10:23,572
Is all this my fault?

920
01:10:24,037 --> 01:10:27,614
Yotsuha! Promise me that you'll
leave town with Grandma before dark!

921
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,405
What?

922
01:10:28,518 --> 01:10:30,172
You're gonna die if you stay here!

923
01:10:30,224 --> 01:10:31,487
What're you talking about?

924
01:10:31,599 --> 01:10:34,109
And why'd you suddenly go to Tokyo yesterday?

925
01:10:34,134 --> 01:10:36,595
You've been acting really strange lately!

926
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,517
Went to Tokyo?

927
01:10:39,686 --> 01:10:42,121
Hey, Mitsuha!

928
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:45,966
How'd it go with your old man?

929
01:10:48,643 --> 01:10:50,326
Hey! Mitsuha!

930
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:52,559
What's with your sister?

931
01:10:52,727 --> 01:10:53,776
Dunno.

932
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,614
Could she be over there?

933
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,568
What's that? What's over there?

934
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:10,665
Let me use your bike, Teshi.

935
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:13,149
Hey! Mitsuha!

936
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,526
And what do we do?

937
01:11:15,937 --> 01:11:17,690
Get things ready like we planned!

938
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,447
I'm counting on you!

939
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,338
Oh my gosh! I'm Taki again.

940
01:11:51,423 --> 01:11:53,868
But what was Taki doing out here?

941
01:12:03,493 --> 01:12:04,424
The town...

942
01:12:05,193 --> 01:12:06,856
It's gone.

943
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:19,575
So does that mean...

944
01:12:22,186 --> 01:12:24,013
...they died?

945
01:12:34,613 --> 01:12:35,586
Taki.

946
01:12:36,433 --> 01:12:37,275
Taki!

947
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,523
Don't you remember?

948
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,220
I'm going to Tokyo for a few hours.

949
01:12:56,542 --> 01:12:57,915
What? Right now?

950
01:12:58,388 --> 01:12:59,284
But why?

951
01:12:59,693 --> 01:13:00,485
For a date.

952
01:13:01,099 --> 01:13:03,083
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

953
01:13:03,108 --> 01:13:05,217
I didn't say it was a date for me.

954
01:13:06,437 --> 01:13:07,997
I'll be back tonight.

955
01:13:11,373 --> 01:13:12,760
If I suddenly show up,

956
01:13:12,907 --> 01:13:16,177
will it be a nuisance? Or a surprise?

957
01:13:16,941 --> 01:13:18,765
He might not like it if I do.

958
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:30,860
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network.

959
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:32,801
I guess it won't happen.

960
01:13:33,536 --> 01:13:35,604
But what if it did?

961
01:13:36,484 --> 01:13:39,552
What would I do? Would I annoy him?

962
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:41,787
Would it be awkward?

963
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:46,517
Or maybe... he'd be glad to see me.

964
01:13:48,183 --> 01:13:51,840
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network.

965
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,857
I guess we won't meet.

966
01:13:56,879 --> 01:13:57,410
But...

967
01:13:58,573 --> 01:14:00,893
...there's one thing I'm certain of.

968
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,716
If we see each other,

969
01:14:04,263 --> 01:14:06,546
we'll definitely know right away.

970
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:10,275
That you were the one who was in me.

971
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,377
And that I was the one that was in you.

972
01:14:15,404 --> 01:14:15,853
Sorry.

973
01:14:19,325 --> 01:14:23,180
The train will be arriving momentarily.
Please stand behind the line.

974
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,006
When entering the train, please mind the gap.

975
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:48,627
Excuse me.

976
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:51,206
The doors are now closing.

977
01:15:21,363 --> 01:15:25,415
That time three years ago, before I even knew you...

978
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,638
Yotsuya. The platform will be on the right.

979
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:30,319
Taki.

980
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,759
Taki.

981
01:15:34,676 --> 01:15:35,634
Taki.

982
01:15:37,109 --> 01:15:39,002
Um, it's me!

983
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:43,718
Don't you remember?

984
01:15:45,021 --> 01:15:46,513
Sorry, who are you?

985
01:15:51,274 --> 01:15:52,541
I-I'm sorry.

986
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:01,820
But he's Taki.

987
01:16:03,519 --> 01:16:04,773
What a weird girl.

988
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:09,067
Yotsuya. Yotsuya. Stand clear of the doors.

989
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:14,653
Hold on!

990
01:16:15,482 --> 01:16:17,116
But what's your name?

991
01:16:18,377 --> 01:16:19,278
Mitsuha!

992
01:16:19,692 --> 01:16:22,294
My name is... Mitsuha!

993
01:16:28,934 --> 01:16:32,034
Three years ago, you showed up.

994
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:35,924
It was... to see me!

995
01:16:47,523 --> 01:16:48,287
Taki?

996
01:16:57,525 --> 01:16:59,150
Mitsuha!

997
01:17:00,223 --> 01:17:00,975
Taki!?

998
01:17:16,138 --> 01:17:17,511
Mitsuha!

999
01:17:18,215 --> 01:17:21,872
You're here, right? Inside my body!

1000
01:17:22,386 --> 01:17:23,297
Taki!

1001
01:17:24,695 --> 01:17:25,893
Taki, where are you?

1002
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:27,989
That was Mitsuha.

1003
01:17:29,118 --> 01:17:30,798
I can hear her voice, but...

1004
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,368
Taki, where are you?

1005
01:17:35,162 --> 01:17:36,182
Taki!

1006
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:51,856
Taki, are you...?

1007
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,059
Are you there?

1008
01:18:19,716 --> 01:18:20,782
Magic hour.

1009
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:36,828
Mitsuha.

1010
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:44,410
Taki.

1011
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:46,565
Taki!

1012
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,720
You're really here.

1013
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:54,618
Taki!

1014
01:18:54,742 --> 01:18:56,413
I came all this way to see you.

1015
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:58,495
Which wasn't easy,

1016
01:18:58,728 --> 01:19:00,870
since you were pretty far away.

1017
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:03,749
Huh? How is that even...?

1018
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:05,957
Because back then...

1019
01:19:06,183 --> 01:19:08,543
Well, I drank some of your <i>kuchikamizake</i>.

1020
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:14,617
You... You drank that?

1021
01:19:15,841 --> 01:19:17,358
Stupid pervert!

1022
01:19:17,383 --> 01:19:18,069
Wh-What?

1023
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:19,220
Yeah! That's right!

1024
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:21,802
You were touching my boobies, weren't you?

1025
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,475
Wh...?! H-How do you even...?

1026
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:24,882
'Cause Yotsuha saw you!

1027
01:19:24,907 --> 01:19:28,865
I-I just... I couldn't help myself!
But it was just the one time.

1028
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,397
Just the one time?

1029
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:34,665
How many times isn't the issue!

1030
01:19:35,136 --> 01:19:36,086
Sorry.

1031
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,637
Wait, is that...?

1032
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:42,981
Oh, yeah, it's yours, but you visited before I knew you.

1033
01:19:43,596 --> 01:19:45,131
So I didn't know who you were.

1034
01:19:46,195 --> 01:19:46,968
Here.

1035
01:19:47,799 --> 01:19:49,578
I kept it for three years.

1036
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,950
But I think it's time you got it back.

1037
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:03,596
What do ya think?

1038
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,582
Oh, uh, well... It's not bad.

1039
01:20:06,821 --> 01:20:08,335
Oh, you're lying!

1040
01:20:09,635 --> 01:20:10,604
Busted.

1041
01:20:10,698 --> 01:20:12,544
Why you gotta be like that?

1042
01:20:27,264 --> 01:20:31,657
Hey, Mitsuha, you still have a lot to do. Listen.

1043
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:33,640
It's coming.

1044
01:20:34,169 --> 01:20:36,664
Don't worry. You still have enough time.

1045
01:20:36,855 --> 01:20:38,764
I'll do my best.

1046
01:20:40,406 --> 01:20:42,982
It looks like magic hour's almost...

1047
01:20:43,309 --> 01:20:44,091
...over.

1048
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:47,679
Hey, Mitsuha.

1049
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:50,449
Just so we don't forget things when we wake up.

1050
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:56,758
Let's write down our names.

1051
01:20:57,710 --> 01:20:58,512
Here.

1052
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,790
Mitsuha?

1053
01:21:14,456 --> 01:21:16,802
Hey, Mitsuha?

1054
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:27,110
I was planning to tell you...

1055
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:30,571
...that wherever you are in the world,

1056
01:21:30,744 --> 01:21:33,641
I swear that I'll find you again, no matter what.

1057
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:39,499
Your name... is Mitsuha.

1058
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,184
It'll be okay. I'll remember.

1059
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:47,697
Mitsuha, Mitsuha, Mitsuha! Your name's Mitsuha!

1060
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:49,179
Your name is...

1061
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:01,039
Who

1062
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,008
are you?

1063
01:22:04,966 --> 01:22:07,896
And what did I even come here for?

1064
01:22:08,801 --> 01:22:11,705
I came... I came all this way to see her!

1065
01:22:12,076 --> 01:22:13,673
I came to save her.

1066
01:22:13,863 --> 01:22:15,576
I wanted her to be alive.

1067
01:22:15,986 --> 01:22:17,368
Who was it again?

1068
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:18,307
Who?

1069
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:20,094
Who did I come to see?

1070
01:22:20,498 --> 01:22:21,855
Someone precious.

1071
01:22:21,964 --> 01:22:24,011
Someone that I don't wanna forget.

1072
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,850
Someone I shouldn't!

1073
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:27,531
Who was it?

1074
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,142
Who was it?

1075
01:22:29,579 --> 01:22:31,577
Who? Who?

1076
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:33,283
What's your name?!

1077
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,664
Taki. Taki. Taki!

1078
01:22:52,164 --> 01:22:55,787
It'll be fine. I'll remember. I'll never forget!

1079
01:22:56,281 --> 01:22:58,367
Taki. Taki!

1080
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:01,553
Your name is Taki!

1081
01:23:16,193 --> 01:23:17,391
Teshi!

1082
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,462
Mitsuha!

1083
01:23:19,187 --> 01:23:20,684
Where the heck have you been?

1084
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:22,529
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

1085
01:23:22,655 --> 01:23:24,403
Wha...? Who did?

1086
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,190
I did!

1087
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,599
You're gonna have to explain it to me later.

1088
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:35,907
That thing is going to fall, right? For real?

1089
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:38,392
For real. I saw it with my own eyes!

1090
01:23:38,526 --> 01:23:40,439
What? You did, huh?

1091
01:23:40,969 --> 01:23:43,025
Well, I guess it's settled then.

1092
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:46,175
We're both officially criminals.

1093
01:23:47,876 --> 01:23:51,189
What? Do I really have to?

1094
01:23:51,222 --> 01:23:52,919
Once the town's power goes out,

1095
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:55,130
the emergency generators will kick on right away.

1096
01:23:55,237 --> 01:23:57,341
Use the broadcast equipment once it does.

1097
01:23:57,506 --> 01:23:58,674
Don't be scared, Saya.

1098
01:23:58,853 --> 01:24:01,002
And repeat it as many times as you can.

1099
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:03,495
You can do it!

1100
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,749
Aw, nuts. It's do or die!

1101
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,485
Shouldn't it be going off?

1102
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,674
Hell if I know!

1103
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,692
What was that?

1104
01:24:27,717 --> 01:24:29,648
That was pretty loud too. Look over there!

1105
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:56,784
Hey, look! Up there!

1106
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:09,421
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1107
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,872
Reports of an explosion at the substation are coming in.

1108
01:25:11,897 --> 01:25:12,832
Explosion?

1109
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,035
Did I just hear that right?

1110
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:18,802
Wildfires are possible,
as well as the threat of more explosions.

1111
01:25:19,424 --> 01:25:21,617
Residents in he following areas,

1112
01:25:21,812 --> 01:25:25,372
please evacuate to Itomori High School immediately.

1113
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:27,932
Kadoiri District

1114
01:25:28,537 --> 01:25:30,033
Sakagami District...

1115
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,160
Honey, we should go.

1116
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:32,962
The broadcast isn't coming from us?

1117
01:25:33,054 --> 01:25:34,336
Well, who the hell is it then?

1118
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:36,330
Miyamori District.

1119
01:25:37,189 --> 01:25:39,032
Oyazawa District.

1120
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:41,335
Let's go, Mitsuha!

1121
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:44,442
Teshi!

1122
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:54,445
Everyone, run! There's a wildfire!

1123
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:56,575
Wildfire! Please run!

1124
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,464
Get outta here! Run!

1125
01:25:58,489 --> 01:26:00,848
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

1126
01:26:01,512 --> 01:26:04,944
It's not working. We're running outta time! Mitsuha!

1127
01:26:06,433 --> 01:26:07,275
What's wrong?

1128
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:09,608
What is it?

1129
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:12,942
I can't remember what his name is anymore!

1130
01:26:15,010 --> 01:26:16,508
What is with you?!

1131
01:26:16,681 --> 01:26:18,636
You're the one who started all of this!

1132
01:26:19,229 --> 01:26:21,862
We can't evacuate everyone without firefighters!

1133
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:24,816
Get going! You gotta convince your old man!

1134
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:29,038
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1135
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,066
Reports of an explosion at the substation are coming in.

1136
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:36,231
Everybody! Get to the high school! Hurry!

1137
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:40,593
Oh, it's Mitsuha.

1138
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:45,843
Why would terrorists attack way out here?

1139
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:46,909
What is Chubu Electric saying?

1140
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:48,248
They're still checking.

1141
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:50,827
Any update? No wildfires yet?

1142
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:52,581
You're sure? Got it.

1143
01:26:54,421 --> 01:26:56,630
Make them stop this broadcast immediately!

1144
01:26:56,687 --> 01:26:58,462
Haven't you located its source yet?!

1145
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:01,242
Mayor! The Takayama sensor station just called!

1146
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:03,674
From the high school?

1147
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:07,258
Once again, residents in the following areas,

1148
01:27:07,377 --> 01:27:10,145
please evacuate to Itomori High... Ah!

1149
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:12,269
What're you doing? Turn that off!

1150
01:27:15,015 --> 01:27:16,068
They got Saya!

1151
01:27:16,299 --> 01:27:17,107
Oh, no!

1152
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:23,434
What were you doing, Natori? I swear.

1153
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:29,556
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1154
01:27:30,652 --> 01:27:34,107
We are currently confirming the reports of the accident.

1155
01:27:35,196 --> 01:27:40,116
We instruct all residents to remain calm
and stay where they are till further notice.

1156
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:41,557
I guess we have to stay put.

1157
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:42,901
What is going on?

1158
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:44,385
So stay on standby.

1159
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,971
Come on, they said everyone should evacuate!

1160
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:50,398
The high school's the evacuation center!

1161
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,410
Katsuhiko!

1162
01:27:54,697 --> 01:27:57,283
Tell me. What do you think you're doing?

1163
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:01,846
Sorry, Mitsuha.

1164
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:04,566
This is the end.

1165
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:10,257
Oh my god. It's actually splitting apart.

1166
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,556
Look at that! The comet has split into two large parts,

1167
01:28:20,581 --> 01:28:23,314
and meteors are now falling to earth!

1168
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:26,068
I don't believe anyone could've predicted this.

1169
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:28,278
Either way, we have quite the mystical view here.

1170
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:31,576
So what does the comet's nucleus splitting mean for us?

1171
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,444
The comet's not within the Roche limit,

1172
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:37,263
so the nucleus itself must've had a
structural weakness for this to happen.

1173
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:42,539
Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart
and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

1174
01:28:42,956 --> 01:28:43,676
There were at least 21 fragments then.

1175
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:45,086
I'm going outside to take a look.

1176
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:46,486
The fragments will likely burn up

1177
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,896
well before reaching the ground,
The probability of a meteor actually landing...

1178
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:54,444
Scientists were already intently examining the
comet, but never foresaw this development.

1179
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:56,114
To predict the trajectory...

1180
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,123
As we stand here witnessing this spectacle,

1181
01:28:58,558 --> 01:29:01,382
unassisted and with our bare eyes,

1182
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,668
it strikes me that living in such an age
has never felt more fortunate than now.

1183
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:13,272
Hey. Who are you?

1184
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:19,195
Who? Who?

1185
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:21,367
Who is he?

1186
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,567
Someone precious.

1187
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,371
Someone I shouldn't forget.

1188
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:27,768
Someone I didn't want to!

1189
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:32,737
Who? Who? Who are you?

1190
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:34,757
What's your name?

1191
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,755
Oh, no.

1192
01:30:01,556 --> 01:30:03,821
So that we don't forget things when we wake up,

1193
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,785
let's write down our names.

1194
01:30:14,683 --> 01:30:18,576
"I LOVE YOU"

1195
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:38,482
Writing this... doesn't help. I won't know your name.

1196
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:52,999
Dad!

1197
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:55,333
Mitsuha?

1198
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,558
There you are!

1199
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,344
Don't tell me you're back.

1200
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,474
It was almost like seeing something out of a dream.

1201
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:09,928
Nothing more or less than a breathtaking view.

1202
01:32:44,186 --> 01:32:45,599
Why am I here?

1203
01:32:47,063 --> 01:32:48,409
What am I doing?

1204
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:01,257
Next is Yoyogi. Yoyogi.

1205
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:17,540
The doors are closing. Please be careful.

1206
01:33:20,487 --> 01:33:22,654
I'm always searching for something.

1207
01:33:23,326 --> 01:33:28,021
This feeling has consumed me for some time.

1208
01:33:30,213 --> 01:33:32,173
The reason I applied for this position...

1209
01:33:32,276 --> 01:33:35,572
The landscapes people live in...
To build a city's landscape...

1210
01:33:35,727 --> 01:33:38,478
Even Tokyo, it might vanish too one day.

1211
01:33:38,699 --> 01:33:41,362
And so, I wanna make landscapes that

1212
01:33:41,603 --> 01:33:42,885
How should I put this?

1213
01:33:43,073 --> 01:33:46,524
That can continue to warm people's hearts.

1214
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,427
That bad? How many does that make it?

1215
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:51,866
I've stopped counting.

1216
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,365
Doesn't sound too promising.

1217
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,152
Who asked you?

1218
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,942
That suit could be the problem.

1219
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,584
It looks just like yours!

1220
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,036
Well, I have two offers.

1221
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,486
I have eight myself.

1222
01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:10,709
Is what I'm searching for... someone? Or somewhere?

1223
01:34:11,919 --> 01:34:14,590
Or am I just searching for the right job?

1224
01:34:15,243 --> 01:34:16,648
I don't even really know.

1225
01:34:17,924 --> 01:34:20,504
Oh, You're job hunting, huh?

1226
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:22,291
I haven't had much luck though.

1227
01:34:23,014 --> 01:34:25,182
Hey, maybe it's the suit that's killing your chances.

1228
01:34:25,255 --> 01:34:27,081
Does it really look that bad on me?

1229
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:34,211
So why the sudden call today?

1230
01:34:34,724 --> 01:34:39,260
I was in the area for work and I figured
it had been a while since I saw your face.

1231
01:34:42,068 --> 01:34:45,614
Remember that one time when we
went all the way to Itomori?

1232
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:49,037
You were still in high school back then, so it was...

1233
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:50,939
Five years ago.

1234
01:34:51,044 --> 01:34:52,137
That long?

1235
01:34:53,058 --> 01:34:55,893
It seems like... I've forgotten a lot.

1236
01:34:57,252 --> 01:34:59,297
I don't remember all that much either,

1237
01:34:59,779 --> 01:35:00,819
about back then.

1238
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,322
Maybe we argued.

1239
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:06,712
She and Tsukasa went back to Tokyo without me.

1240
01:35:07,939 --> 01:35:10,331
I spent the night alone on some mountain.

1241
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:12,965
That's about all I remember.

1242
01:35:16,317 --> 01:35:18,264
But at one point in time,

1243
01:35:18,606 --> 01:35:22,503
I found myself strangely drawn to
the incident involving that comet.

1244
01:35:25,427 --> 01:35:28,616
A fragment of the comet destroyed
a town in that disaster.

1245
01:35:29,385 --> 01:35:33,262
But miraculously, most of the people
living in the town were unhurt.

1246
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:37,337
The town happened to be holding
an emergency drill that day,

1247
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:40,633
and most of its residents were outside the impact zone.

1248
01:35:42,488 --> 01:35:46,840
The sheer luck and coincidence of it
all sparked various conspiracy theories.

1249
01:35:48,217 --> 01:35:50,194
I read a lot of articles about it back then.

1250
01:35:51,114 --> 01:35:52,247
I was kind of obsessed.

1251
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:56,240
But whatever the reason I had for my interest,

1252
01:35:56,444 --> 01:35:58,057
is a mystery to me now.

1253
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:02,183
I didn't even know anybody in that town.

1254
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:08,633
Thanks for today. This is far enough.

1255
01:36:10,103 --> 01:36:15,519
I do hope that at some point, you'll find happiness too.

1256
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:21,775
I feel like I'm always searching.

1257
01:36:22,504 --> 01:36:25,331
For something. Someone.

1258
01:36:36,936 --> 01:36:39,948
I feel like I do wanna go to one more bridal fair.

1259
01:36:40,047 --> 01:36:41,335
They're all the same.

1260
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,805
A Shinto wedding sure sounds nice too.

1261
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:46,100
You said you wanted to be married in a chapel!

1262
01:36:46,533 --> 01:36:48,042
Oh! That reminds me, Teshi.

1263
01:36:48,297 --> 01:36:50,992
Would ya please shave before the ceremony?

1264
01:36:51,112 --> 01:36:52,900
I'm going on a diet for it, ya know?

1265
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:55,250
She says as she's eating a cake.

1266
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:57,068
I'll get serious tomorrow.

1267
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,847
The landscape of a town that's no longer there.

1268
01:37:59,569 --> 01:38:02,816
Why does looking at it make my heart feel so tight?

1269
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:25,236
I was always searching.

1270
01:39:25,637 --> 01:39:26,643
Searching for...

1271
01:39:28,078 --> 01:39:29,231
...someone!

1272
01:40:26,923 --> 01:40:28,101
Excuse me!

1273
01:40:28,539 --> 01:40:29,459
Haven't we...?

1274
01:40:30,026 --> 01:40:32,473
Have I met you somewhere?

1275
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,747
I thought so too!

1276
01:40:47,599 --> 01:40:50,132
Can I ask you... your name?
