1
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,211
Ha ha ha!

2
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:52,506
- Ha ha ha!

3
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,123
Mayday! Mayday!

4
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:08,484
- Pirates!

5
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:21,889
- Hold them off!

6
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,398
Sheeta, stay out of the way
and you won't get hurt.

7
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,758
Aah!

8
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:55,293
- Come on!

9
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:06,802
Hurry up!
Break the door down!

10
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,539
SHEETA: Aah!

11
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:14,139
Yaah! Oof!

12
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:19,553
- Where is she?

13
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:20,816
No!

14
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,983
Hey, I found her!
She's hiding out here!

15
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:26,153
Don't let her escape!
Quick, get her!

16
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,459
LOUIE: Whoa, Ma!
Don't let me go!

17
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:29,964
DOLA: Quit your whining!
I got you!

18
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:31,465
Aah!
She's wearing the crystal!

19
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,559
- Now, go get her!
- Right!

20
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:36,469
I want that crystal!

21
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:43,975
Aaah!

22
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:47,482
DOLA: Oh, no!
There goes my crystal!

23
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,780
Oh, no!

24
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:28,946
I need some meatballs
for the boss, please.

25
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:31,144
All right. You're sure
working late tonight, Pazu.

26
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:33,585
Things are finally busy
for a change.

27
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:36,351
- Still working?
- Yep. Bye!

28
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:42,220
Huh?

29
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:48,127
What is that?

30
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:57,336
Looks like a body! Whoa!

31
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:01,543
Whoa!

32
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:04,312
Aah! Whoa! Whoa!

33
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,627
Yaah!

34
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:21,297
Huh?

35
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,139
Aah!

36
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:52,262
BOSS: Pazu!

37
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,233
What are you doing up there?

38
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:55,894
Did you bring my dinner?

39
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,267
Yeah, I did!

40
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,363
But this girl
came down from the sky!

41
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:06,675
Ohh...

42
00:08:06,748 --> 00:08:08,147
BOSS:
Blast these old pipes!

43
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:09,774
Aah! Whoa.

44
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:11,512
Uh, here you go.

45
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:13,349
Boss!

46
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:16,356
BOSS:
Come on! Come on!

47
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,257
Listen, Boss!
A girl came--

48
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,799
What? Not again!

49
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:27,130
Just when I get
one thing fixed--

50
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:29,363
Listen to me!
A girl came down--

51
00:08:29,437 --> 00:08:31,462
BOSS: Tighten
the second valve, will you?

52
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,063
There's no time to lose!

53
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:35,803
Ah, this machinery's too old!

54
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,544
- I think I need a bigger wrench!
- I'll get it!

55
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:50,551
Go run the hoist
while I fix this!

56
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,717
Huh?

57
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:54,921
- You think you can do it?
- Yeah! Here!

58
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,590
BOSS: Just stay calm
and use your head!

59
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:00,065
Right.

60
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,417
- Hit the brake!
- What?

61
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:27,927
PAZU: Whew.

62
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:29,588
Well, how'd it go, boys?

63
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:32,758
No silver,
not even any trace of tin.

64
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,927
We're just not having any luck.

65
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:36,436
Maybe we would
if we tried digging...

66
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:37,766
the mines just east of here.

67
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,771
I don't know.

68
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,398
Those mines are worse
than this one.

69
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:42,204
We just have to start
all over again.

70
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,768
Let's call it a day.
Good night.

71
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:47,280
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

72
00:09:57,592 --> 00:09:59,184
Shut off the boiler, Pazu.

73
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,490
We're not gonna find
anything today.

74
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:06,364
If things keep going like this.
we'll all be starving soon.

75
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:09,665
And, Pazu, maybe you can oil
that blasted machine!

76
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:12,467
- OK!
- Thanks. Good night.

77
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,871
PAZU: 'Night!

78
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:27,513
SHALULU: Mom, it's no use.
Let's call it off.

79
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,819
There's too much cloud cover.
It's too dark!

80
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:31,984
- What?!

81
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,084
Mom, don't worry.
I'll find her!

82
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:34,628
DOLA: We'll all find her!

83
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,643
Ohh!

84
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:15,218
PAZU: Hello!

85
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:17,484
It's about time you got up!

86
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:23,052
How are you feeling?

87
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,261
Hi, there!
My name's Pazu.

88
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:29,064
I'm really glad to see
you're doing all right.

89
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:30,365
You had me worried there.

90
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:33,100
Go ahead. Feed them.

91
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:34,869
- Don't be shy.
- Aah!

92
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:39,545
These guys are really happy
we have a visitor.

93
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,510
Well, thank goodness.

94
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:45,518
You laugh
like a regular person.

95
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:47,349
The way you fell from the sky...

96
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,356
I thought that maybe you were
an angel or something.

97
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:51,358
Thank you very much
for saving me.

98
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:53,291
Oh, I'm sorry.
My name's Sheeta.

99
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:55,522
Sheeta--
what a beautiful name.

100
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:58,064
I had to catch you.
You were just floating.

101
00:13:58,132 --> 00:13:59,895
- What? Floating?
- Yeah.

102
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:02,435
Well, I remember an airship...

103
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:04,869
but I can't remember
anything else.

104
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:06,463
That's all you remember?

105
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:09,940
Mm-hmm. I'm not sure
how I survived.

106
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:11,308
PAZU: Hmm.

107
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,971
Well, I think I might
have an idea about that.

108
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:14,981
May I see your necklace
for a second?

109
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,641
This?

110
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,283
My grandmother gave it to me.

111
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:24,381
It's been in my family
for generations.

112
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:25,892
Wow, it's beautiful.

113
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,587
Could you hold this?

114
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,399
- Oh.

115
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:38,332
Thanks. Heh.

116
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:40,567
Get a load of this! Watch!

117
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:42,165
Here I go-o-o!

118
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,608
Pazu! Are you all right?

119
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:59,387
Unh!

120
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,791
Ha! Well, so maybe
I had the wrong idea...

121
00:15:03,865 --> 00:15:05,492
about this necklace. Aah!

122
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:08,868
Oh!

123
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:23,783
Aah! Aah!

124
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,751
Whoa!

125
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:30,122
I'm so sorry, Pazu.

126
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:32,955
- Ohh.
- Are you OK?

127
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:34,119
I'm fine.

128
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:36,129
Oh, you scared me.
Does it hurt much?

129
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:38,631
Are you kidding?
If my head were any harder...

130
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:39,825
you could use it
as a cannonball.

131
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,469
Whoa! The kettle!
It must be boiling over!

132
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:50,033
Come on! Let's go!
Follow me! This way!

133
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:52,807
I'll get breakfast started.
You can wash up over there.

134
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:55,648
There's a clean towel, too.

135
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:57,183
SHEETA: Great. Thank you.

136
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:17,263
"Laputa."

137
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,038
Sheeta!
It's time for breakfast!

138
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:35,188
My father took that picture
from an airship.

139
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:36,587
He loved to fly.

140
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:38,955
It's Laputa--
the floating island.

141
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:40,994
An island
that floats in the sky?

142
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:43,223
Yep. Most people think
it's just a legend...

143
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:45,026
but my dad actually saw it.

144
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:47,329
That's a picture
of his airship.

145
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:09,485
PAZU: It looked like a castle
just floating there in the sky.

146
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:12,856
He said it was the most amazing
thing he'd ever seen.

147
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:25,898
And that's the only picture
he was able to take.

148
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:28,305
But take
a look at this, Sheeta.

149
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,071
Dad kept a journal,
and he made all sorts...

150
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:31,736
of drawings of Laputa, see?

151
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,837
There it is.
He drew the castle...

152
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:36,644
and also what he thought
the people'd look like.

153
00:17:36,717 --> 00:17:38,912
He was sure the castle
was filled with treasure...

154
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:41,352
but nobody believed him.

155
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:42,753
They called him a liar.

156
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:46,486
Being called a liar
is what killed him.

157
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,858
But I am gonna prove that
my dad was no liar, Sheeta.

158
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:56,869
As soon as I'm done building
this plane...

159
00:17:56,937 --> 00:18:00,873
I'm gonna take off
and find Laputa myself.

160
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:09,010
Hmm.

161
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,448
Ohh!

162
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:13,282
It's a real automobile!
You don't see many of those around here!

163
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:15,686
- Those people are pirates Pazu.
- What?

164
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:18,156
SHEETA: They're the ones
who attacked the airship.

165
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:22,161
They're probably after you.
Come on!

166
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:29,464
PAZU: Good morning!
Good-bye!

167
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,300
LOUIE: Hold it! Wait up!

168
00:18:31,372 --> 00:18:33,397
PAZU: Yes?
How can I help you, mister?

169
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,374
Young man, query--

170
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:36,910
Have you seen a little girl
around here?

171
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:38,205
Let me see now.

172
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,611
There are about 100 girls
in this town. Which one?

173
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,114
Thanks for nothing, kid!

174
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:43,343
Bye!

175
00:18:44,952 --> 00:18:47,386
They are definitely
after you, Sheeta.

176
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:51,090
Louie, go tell your mother!
She's in disguise!

177
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:53,456
So, she's in disguise!
Go tell my mother!

178
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:02,759
Haven't seen her.

179
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,270
That's what you keep saying...

180
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,329
but I want you think
really hard about it.

181
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:07,669
PAZU: Boss!

182
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:09,505
Boss!

183
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:14,004
She'd be about the age
of those two.

184
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,412
Aah! Oh, no!

185
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:19,918
There she is!
Don't let her get away!

186
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:21,181
Now!

187
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:22,586
Yeow!

188
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:26,353
Hey, boss, they're pirates!
They're after her!

189
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:32,065
Pirates? I want to see!

190
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:36,228
You can stop right there,
my friend.

191
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:37,861
Think you're tough, don't you?

192
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:40,236
- I'm tough enough.
- We'll see about that.

193
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:43,242
BOSS: Just go away.
We're honest folks here.

194
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,607
What did you do that for?

195
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:46,270
Quick, leave from the back.

196
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:47,780
No, I'm gonna fight 'em!

197
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:49,748
Pazu, what if you wind up
getting yourself hurt?

198
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,409
So?!

199
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:53,419
So, somebody's got
to protect your friend.

200
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:56,752
Hmm? Oh. Mm-hmm.

201
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,792
Why don't you get
out of our way?

202
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,884
Why don't you
just try and make me?

203
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:02,553
Maybe I will!

204
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,224
HENRI: Oh, yeah!
Make your shirt explode.

205
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:19,169
MAN: Hey, Boss, show him
what you're made of!

206
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,476
Ha ha ha!

207
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:29,489
Mm-hmm.

208
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:31,718
MAN: You showed him, boss!

209
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:34,488
I'm not mending that,
I hope you know.

210
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,798
Take that, you landlubber!

211
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:40,527
- He took it.
- He certainly did.

212
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,500
LOUIE: Come on, Shalulu!

213
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:48,599
Give him
something for nothing!

214
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:50,075
Ooh!

215
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:51,668
You go get him, boss!

216
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:52,769
Unh!

217
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,441
BOTH: He said Mom was ugly,
now go get him!

218
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:56,608
- Oh!
- Raah!

219
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:58,083
That's it! Get him!

220
00:20:58,152 --> 00:20:59,642
- That's it!
- Punch him!

221
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,449
Come on, you got it!

222
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:04,013
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Hey, loudmouth!

223
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,389
No... Unh!

224
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,758
Get in there!
Give him a right, a left!

225
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:19,301
DOLA: Whoa! Oh...

226
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,611
They're headed for
the railroad tracks.

227
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:32,709
Let's move it!

228
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:40,358
Hey! Hey!

229
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:42,156
We're gonna jump on, Sheeta!

230
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:43,856
SHEETA: Right! Unh!

231
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:45,660
PAZU: That's it!

232
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,167
- Come on!
- Unh!

233
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:51,227
DRIVER: Hey, Pazu,
who's your friend there?

234
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:54,331
PAZU: Her name is Sheeta!
Pirates are after us!

235
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:58,941
- It's the Dola gang!
- Pirates?

236
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:01,538
Can you drop us at the police
station in the next town?

237
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:03,549
DRIVER: Sure.
Help me stoke up the engine!

238
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:05,710
PAZU: Will do!

239
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:12,088
- Huh?
- Hey, it's Mom!

240
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:17,560
You chowderheads!
Get your brother and hop on!

241
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:20,065
But Sheeta's hiding
inside that house.

242
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:22,932
Lame-brain! They made an escape.
Now, step on it!

243
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:24,231
They escaped?

244
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:25,966
- I want to come!
- Mommy!

245
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:33,773
Unh! Hey!

246
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:36,111
Well...

247
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,165
Hey, Pazu, here they come!

248
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:58,932
Can't this engine go any faster?

249
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:01,201
This is the best she'll do!
She's old!

250
00:23:04,044 --> 00:23:07,502
Floor it! Move over!

251
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:17,153
I'd really prefer
to be in the car, Mother!

252
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:34,640
DRIVER: Increase the steam!
They're gaining on us!

253
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,142
- We got 'em!

254
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:39,145
- Yaah!

255
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:41,147
We need you in here!

256
00:23:42,716 --> 00:23:45,617
- Help with the fire!
- OK!

257
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:51,518
Aah!

258
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:53,184
Yaah!

259
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:55,622
Uh-oh!

260
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:57,857
Unh! Charge!

261
00:23:57,931 --> 00:23:59,523
- Look out!
- Aah!

262
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:06,565
DOLA: Come on!
Get 'em! Get 'em!

263
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:20,820
Hey, come back here!

264
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:27,250
You'll get yours!
Don't just stand there!

265
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:28,453
Push this train
over the cliff!

266
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:29,689
BOTH: What?

267
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:33,597
DRIVER: Ha ha ha!
We sure showed them!

268
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,931
- I can do it now.
- You were amazing!

269
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:42,175
- Heave! Heave!
- And heave...

270
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:44,005
- Wait.
- And stop.

271
00:24:47,448 --> 00:24:49,916
You think maybe it's Muska?

272
00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:53,419
Yeah it's Muska, all right.
We gotta find those kids.

273
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:02,395
Huh?

274
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,964
Well, What do you know about that?

275
00:25:09,036 --> 00:25:10,628
It's the army to the rescue!

276
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,802
Hey! Could you kindly help
these two young people?

277
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,440
Pirates have been
chasing them all day!

278
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,026
Huh? What's the matter?

279
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:35,425
Good-bye, Pazu!

280
00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:37,054
Young lady, come back here!

281
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:40,066
- Unh!
- Oh!

282
00:25:40,134 --> 00:25:41,726
Sheeta, wait!

283
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:44,100
Halt, or I'll shoot!

284
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:45,638
- Aah!
- Ow!

285
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:50,634
LOUIE:
It's an armored train, Mother!

286
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:52,975
DOLA: And we're
the Dola gang! Attack!

287
00:25:53,046 --> 00:25:55,810
PAZU: No! Hey! Sheeta!

288
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:58,215
SHEETA: Don't follow me!
You'll get hurt!

289
00:25:58,285 --> 00:26:00,082
Aah!

290
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:05,619
ALL: Whoa!

291
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:19,267
Aah!

292
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:21,830
- Don't let go!

293
00:26:27,848 --> 00:26:28,974
Come on!

294
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:41,627
- Where are they, Mother?

295
00:26:41,695 --> 00:26:43,629
DOLA: Be quiet!
Just watch them.

296
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,808
SHALULU: Ohh!

297
00:27:00,714 --> 00:27:02,409
Ahh!

298
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,819
Huh? Oh!

299
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:10,218
Sheeta, we're floating!

300
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:13,686
You see?

301
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,728
This was what happened
the first time I saw you.

302
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:18,196
See that?
It's the power of the crystal.

303
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,562
I knew it!

304
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:23,728
I knew there was something
special about your necklace!

305
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:26,671
- Oh!
- Whoo!

306
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:42,945
The necklace will let us down
nice and easy.

307
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:51,293
Boys, I want that crystal!

308
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,299
SOLDIER: Fire!

309
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:03,374
It's fantastic!
Incredible!

310
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:06,276
I must have that crystal!

311
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:26,694
It's going out!

312
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,997
Ah, wait. Just a minute.

313
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:38,808
I guess your necklace
must come to life...

314
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,346
whenever you're in trouble.

315
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:44,677
PAZU:
Wow, that's a long way up.

316
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:46,651
I hope they're all right--

317
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,018
your boss and his wife
and that nice train engineer.

318
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:50,215
My friends are all miners.

319
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,882
They can take
care of themselves.

320
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,654
I wouldn't worry about them
if I were you.

321
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:55,194
Come on, Sheeta. Let's go.

322
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,664
This has been
a mining town...

323
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:01,826
as long as
anyone can remember.

324
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:05,133
Most of these tunnels
aren't even used anymore.

325
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:16,611
PAZU: Here you go.

326
00:29:16,683 --> 00:29:18,776
Thank you. I'm glad
you brought some food.

327
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:20,410
I'm starving.

328
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:22,785
And for dessert, I've got
a green apple and some candy.

329
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:26,553
Really? You know that bag of yours
must be magic.

330
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:28,753
It's always
got just what we need.

331
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:33,833
Ha!

332
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,102
Mmm!

333
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:45,204
Sheeta, where exactly
do you come from?

334
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,770
I come from Gondoa--
deep in the northern mountains.

335
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:50,840
I used to live there
with my parents...

336
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:52,908
and we were very happy.

337
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:55,978
But when my mother
and father died...

338
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:58,354
I was all alone.

339
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,751
The only thing
that kept me going...

340
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:05,286
was the farm and
taking care of my animals.

341
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:08,357
But one day.
everything changed.

342
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:11,404
That was the day
the men came and took me away.

343
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,239
Whoa, wait a minute.
They kidnapped you?

344
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,436
Yes.

345
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:20,878
It was that man
in the dark glasses.

346
00:30:20,947 --> 00:30:22,380
I wonder who that guy is...

347
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:24,349
and what
he's doing with the army.

348
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:28,720
I think Dola and that man
are both after your necklace.

349
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:30,518
I think you're right,
but I had no idea...

350
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,354
my crystal was
so incredibly powerful.

351
00:30:33,427 --> 00:30:37,488
It's been in my family
as long as I can remember.

352
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:39,998
Mother gave it to me
before she died...

353
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:41,728
and she told me
never to show it...

354
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:43,599
or give it away to anyone.

355
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,570
PAZU: Huh.

356
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:49,173
We orphans should stick
together, don't you think?

357
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:50,766
SHEETA: I'm really sorry.

358
00:30:50,844 --> 00:30:53,335
It's my fault getting you
mixed up in all this.

359
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:54,846
PAZU: Are you kidding?

360
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:56,644
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

361
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:59,446
I wouldn't miss an adventure
like this for the world!

362
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:05,050
What?

363
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:16,294
Are you some sort of goblin
come to torment me?

364
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:20,499
It's Uncle Pom!
Don't worry. He's a friend.

365
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:23,304
Uncle Pom,
boy, am I glad to see you!

366
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:25,503
I can't see you
clearly yet, goblin...

367
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:27,877
but you sound like Pazu.

368
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:29,973
And if these old eyes
don't deceive me...

369
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,881
there's a she-goblin with you.

370
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:33,419
There are pirates
chasing us, Uncle Pom.

371
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:36,615
- Oh?
- The army's right behind them.

372
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:41,093
Ha ha ha! That sounds
absolutely splendid!

373
00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:53,271
UNCLE POM: The tea is ready.
Help yourself.

374
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,365
SHEETA: Thank you.
This is great.

375
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:58,707
Don't you get lonely down here
underground, Uncle Pom?

376
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:01,804
Never, my dear.

377
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:03,611
All of these rocks
are my friends.

378
00:32:03,683 --> 00:32:05,514
They often talk to me.

379
00:32:05,585 --> 00:32:08,486
Ever since last night, they've been
especially restless.

380
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:11,547
- The rocks talk to you?
- Oh, yes, Pazu.

381
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,525
The earth
speaks to all of us...

382
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:16,528
and if we listen.
we can understand.

383
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,263
The rocks speak
in a very small voice.

384
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:39,643
Huh? Oh, my!

385
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:47,551
- Whoa!

386
00:32:57,971 --> 00:32:59,768
Amazing!

387
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,898
Pazu, look above us!

388
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:03,704
Huh? Wow!

389
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:16,182
It was just a hunk of rock
a while ago.

390
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:18,451
SHEETA: Oh, my!

391
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:21,494
UNCLE POM: The answer
lies inside these rocks.

392
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,926
Let me show you.

393
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:32,361
SHEETA: Pazu, you see?

394
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:36,632
All the rocks around here
contain a bit of aetherium.

395
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,940
PAZU: Really?

396
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:42,743
Mankind once knew
how to mine aetherium...

397
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:44,875
but no longer.

398
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:48,083
Wait!

399
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:51,724
Look, my stone's glowing!

400
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:54,885
Well, goodness!
Bless my soul!

401
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:57,452
That's a pure
aetherium crystal!

402
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,792
There hasn't been one...

403
00:33:58,865 --> 00:34:02,961
since before
my great-grandfather's time.

404
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:06,403
No wonder
the rocks were restless.

405
00:34:06,473 --> 00:34:09,067
This stone possesses
incredible power.

406
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:12,339
Legend has it
that only the people...

407
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:14,380
of the floating city of Laputa...

408
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:15,812
knew how to make
such crystals.

409
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:17,850
They made this crystal?

410
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:21,978
They used aetherium to make
Laputa float in the sky.

411
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:23,647
PAZU: I knew Laputa
wasn't just made up!

412
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:26,317
You see, Sheeta?
It's just like my dad said!

413
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:32,925
What's the matter?

414
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:36,628
I'm sorry, but would you
put that crystal away?

415
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:39,035
It's too strong for me.

416
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:41,437
Oh, sorry.

417
00:34:41,508 --> 00:34:43,373
What is it, Uncle Pom?

418
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:58,189
Great-grandpa used to tell me
the rocks become restless...

419
00:34:58,258 --> 00:35:01,250
when Laputa
appears over the mine.

420
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:02,761
Wow! So that must mean...

421
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:04,660
Laputa's over the mine
right now!

422
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:07,723
Listen! Sheeta, now I can prove
that the legend is true!

423
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:11,202
Sheeta, I must tell you
something.

424
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:12,465
SHEETA: Yes?

425
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:14,507
What is it?

426
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:18,510
That crystal
is extremely powerful...

427
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:20,603
but with a power
that rightfully belongs...

428
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,376
to the earth
from which it came.

429
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,680
To forget that,
and then to try to use...

430
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:27,481
the crystal's power
for selfish reasons...

431
00:35:27,554 --> 00:35:29,886
will bring great unhappiness.

432
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:31,548
- You understand?
- Yes.

433
00:35:31,624 --> 00:35:36,152
Your crystal should remind us
that we come from the earth...

434
00:35:36,229 --> 00:35:38,561
and to the earth
we must return.

435
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:41,259
Come on, lighten up!

436
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:42,733
Two times already,
that crystal's gotten Sheeta...

437
00:35:42,802 --> 00:35:44,565
out of some really big trouble.

438
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:46,229
And I have a feeling...

439
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:48,570
that crystal's gonna
help us find Laputa.

440
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,008
LOUIE: It's flying away!

441
00:35:58,084 --> 00:36:00,416
HENRI: Mom, can we go back
to the ship now, please?

442
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:02,079
DOLA: It's too quiet.

443
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:04,020
We better just stay put
for the time being.

444
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:08,351
SHALULU:
Does this mean no lunch?

445
00:36:08,428 --> 00:36:12,364
The coast is clear.
Let's go.

446
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:14,229
Uncle Pom, thank you.

447
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,825
Be careful, my dear.

448
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:38,247
Wow, look up there!

449
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:54,931
Beyond that cloud
is a floating city...

450
00:36:55,008 --> 00:36:59,638
that no one here on earth
believes exists.

451
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:03,739
But I swear--I am going
to be the one to prove it!

452
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:05,216
- Pazu?
- Huh?

453
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:09,153
Listen, there's something
I haven't told you yet.

454
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:12,385
You see my family has a very old
traditional name...

455
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:15,087
and when the stone
was passed on to me...

456
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:17,288
I inherited that name.

457
00:37:17,363 --> 00:37:22,300
And the name I inherited was
Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa.

458
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:26,628
Laputa? You mean you're...

459
00:37:30,276 --> 00:37:32,642
They found us, Sheeta!
Let's go!

460
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:39,009
- Head back to the mine!
- Stop them!

461
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:41,781
- Unh!
- Aah!

462
00:37:41,855 --> 00:37:43,186
Hands up!

463
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:44,188
Don't you touch her!

464
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:50,025
- Let me go!
- Aah!

465
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:51,893
Oh, no!
Are you all right, Pazu?

466
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:53,660
You have to wake up, Pazu!

467
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:57,898
- Sir, we've captured them.
- And about time.

468
00:38:22,562 --> 00:38:24,962
Ohh!

469
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:26,157
Huh?

470
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:34,099
Huh? Hey, let me out!

471
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:35,504
Unh!

472
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:38,174
Unh!

473
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:41,304
Where am I?

474
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:45,109
Unh!

475
00:38:45,184 --> 00:38:47,379
SOLDIER: Forward, march!

476
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:02,931
Aah!

477
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:19,615
We're wasting time!

478
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:23,417
You twist an arm or two, and
I guarantee the girl will talk.

479
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:25,616
I respectfully disagree.

480
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:29,389
Such military tactics risk
wasting more time, general.

481
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:32,863
If my military tactics
had been used to begin with...

482
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:35,127
Dola wouldn't have had a chance
to interfere with us at all!

483
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:39,763
It was a military transmission
that the pirates decoded.

484
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,740
You've bungled things, sir.
and now I must fix them.

485
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:45,107
Your job, general...

486
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:47,738
is to mobilize the troops
when it becomes necessary.

487
00:39:48,781 --> 00:39:51,215
Muska, just don't forget...

488
00:39:51,284 --> 00:39:53,479
that the government put me
in charge of finding Laputa!

489
00:39:53,553 --> 00:39:56,488
Don't forget that as
the government's secret agent...

490
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:59,184
I am in charge of you, general.

491
00:40:01,761 --> 00:40:04,924
Blast.
I really hate that man.

492
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:18,269
Huh?

493
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:23,507
I trust you slept well?

494
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:26,177
Where is Pazu? Is he
all right? I want to see him!

495
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:28,345
Now, this is fit for a princess.

496
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:30,321
Don't worry, Sheeta.

497
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,121
Your friend is being treated as
if he were the guest of royalty.

498
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:37,128
I want you to see something
before you see him.

499
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:53,306
Please step inside.

500
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:13,126
What is it?

501
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,759
An artificial life form.

502
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:17,359
It's called a robot.

503
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:20,565
Laputa was just a legend
until this dropped from the sky.

504
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:26,737
Huh?

505
00:41:26,813 --> 00:41:29,043
- Aah!
- Oh! Ohh!

506
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:38,020
MUSKA:
Now the government wants me...

507
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,082
to unlock Laputa's secrets.

508
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,458
For example, what's this fellow
made of--metal or ceramics?

509
00:41:43,529 --> 00:41:46,362
With our limited technology,
we have no idea.

510
00:41:46,432 --> 00:41:48,263
But he does tell us one thing.

511
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:50,268
Come and see.

512
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:54,067
Don't be afraid, Sheeta. He's
really quite dead, you know.

513
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:02,078
Look there.

514
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:09,154
It's the same emblem...

515
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:11,747
that decorates the fireplace
in your home.

516
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:13,621
And your crystal.

517
00:42:13,693 --> 00:42:17,789
You see, Sheeta, this crystal
also comes from Laputa.

518
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,068
And I believe the powers
locked inside it...

519
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:26,628
are capable of leading a person
back to that city's treasures.

520
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:29,641
Then why?
Why don't you just take it?

521
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:32,269
Just take it and keep Laputa's
treasures for yourself...

522
00:42:32,345 --> 00:42:35,781
but leave Pazu and me alone,
please!

523
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:40,346
You think I'm doing this
for money?

524
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:42,080
You understand nothing.

525
00:42:42,155 --> 00:42:45,090
According to the legend,
the same technology...

526
00:42:45,158 --> 00:42:47,683
that kept Laputa airborne
also made it...

527
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,197
a major power that once
dominated the entire planet.

528
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:55,632
If such a horrible thing
is still floating up there...

529
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:57,328
you can understand
what a threat it is...

530
00:42:57,403 --> 00:42:59,132
to the peace of the world.

531
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:03,403
Sheeta,
the stone only works for you.

532
00:43:03,476 --> 00:43:06,309
You must know of some way
to make the stone...

533
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:08,643
point out
the location of Laputa.

534
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:13,174
I really don't know anything.
Please let me see Pazu!

535
00:43:13,252 --> 00:43:16,449
I don't want to see
any harm come to anyone...

536
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:19,719
but I simply can't control what
the military might do to him.

537
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:21,657
What?!

538
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,854
In the event
that you cooperate...

539
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:27,331
I'm sure whosever is in charge
will grant Pazu his freedom...

540
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,837
Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa.

541
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:33,667
You know my real name.

542
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:36,936
"Ul" means "ruler" in Laputian.
"Toel" means "true."

543
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:38,977
You are the legitimate heir...

544
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:41,673
to the throne of Laputa,
Princess Lusheeta.

545
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:56,852
Aah!

546
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:58,590
Unh!

547
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:02,861
SOLDIER: Let's go! Out!

548
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:06,863
Sheeta!

549
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:08,839
Are you all right, Pazu?

550
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:11,809
I'm OK, but what about you?
They didn't hurt you, did they?

551
00:44:11,878 --> 00:44:15,177
Pazu, I'm so sorry. There's
been a grave misunderstanding.

552
00:44:15,248 --> 00:44:18,183
We had no idea
how nobly you fought...

553
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:21,186
to protect our little Sheeta
from those awful pirates.

554
00:44:21,254 --> 00:44:22,687
What's he talking about?

555
00:44:22,755 --> 00:44:26,623
Pazu, do this for me.
Forget about Laputa.

556
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:28,455
What are you saying?

557
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:30,757
It's been decided
that the search for Laputa...

558
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,661
will be made secretly
by the army...

559
00:44:32,732 --> 00:44:34,290
with Sheeta's cooperation.

560
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:35,595
Really, the best thing
you can do...

561
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:37,693
is forget
you ever heard of the place.

562
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,704
Forget about Laputa?

563
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:42,263
I'm sorry I caused you
so much trouble.

564
00:44:42,341 --> 00:44:44,741
I hope someday
you can forgive me.

565
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,744
I can't forget! No way!

566
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:49,212
Laputa means too much
to both of us!

567
00:44:49,282 --> 00:44:51,443
- Good-bye!
- Sheeta!

568
00:44:51,517 --> 00:44:53,382
Aah! Come back!

569
00:44:53,452 --> 00:44:55,443
Now, behave, little boy.
Use your head!

570
00:45:05,898 --> 00:45:08,696
Here, take this--
a little something...

571
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:11,862
to show our appreciation
of your efforts.

572
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:48,832
Only you can do it.

573
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:52,400
Remember the words
that bring the crystal to life.

574
00:45:52,478 --> 00:45:55,379
Keep your promise,
and you too will be free.

575
00:46:16,836 --> 00:46:19,498
Unh! Huh?

576
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:27,171
Hey, mommy! Mommy, it's Pazu!
Pazu's outside!

577
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:30,409
Oh, my! Pazu!

578
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:32,815
Where have you been?

579
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:34,409
We were all very worried
about you, Pazu.

580
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:37,149
What happened to your friend?

581
00:46:37,223 --> 00:46:40,420
- It's over now.
- What?

582
00:46:40,493 --> 00:46:42,154
Pazu! Come back!

583
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:49,399
Unh!

584
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,897
Welcome home, sonny.

585
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:26,597
PAZU: Get out! Aah!
Get out, or I'll throw you out!

586
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:28,299
This is my house!

587
00:47:28,374 --> 00:47:31,502
Oh, you don't scare me.

588
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:33,943
You can't even protect
one small girl!

589
00:47:34,013 --> 00:47:35,105
What do you mean?

590
00:47:35,181 --> 00:47:36,614
Hey, Mom,
can I keep this money?

591
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:40,209
Up and sold the little girl,
did you? I know your type.

592
00:47:40,286 --> 00:47:42,083
PAZU: You don't know
what you're talking about!

593
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:44,782
They offered you money,
and you took it, didn't you?

594
00:47:44,857 --> 00:47:48,293
I only left
because Sheeta told me to!

595
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,657
That's why.

596
00:47:49,728 --> 00:47:54,461
So, you believed her,
and you came back here, right?

597
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:57,001
You're just a scared little boy
who runs away!

598
00:47:57,069 --> 00:47:58,696
Says you!

599
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:01,001
You don't even have the guts to
stand up to Muska and the army!

600
00:48:01,073 --> 00:48:06,010
He who turns and runs away can
steal the treasure another day!

601
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:08,508
Don't you think
it's kind of strange...

602
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:11,982
that the army's gotten into
the kidnapping business?

603
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,754
Do you really think
they'll keep her alive?

604
00:48:16,822 --> 00:48:19,017
Don't you see that
they forced her to make a deal?

605
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:21,525
Huh?

606
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:28,432
She saved your life. Get it?

607
00:48:30,102 --> 00:48:32,696
LOUIE: Mommy, you amaze me.
How do you know these things?

608
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:35,604
DOLA: Well, you can't be
a sensitive woman like me...

609
00:48:35,674 --> 00:48:37,369
without leaning a few things.

610
00:48:37,443 --> 00:48:39,172
Sheeta and I
are exactly alike--

611
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:42,043
all warm and mushy and sensitive.

612
00:48:42,114 --> 00:48:44,173
Now, so when you boys
get married...

613
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,808
You go find a gal like her.

614
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:48,877
Huh?
She's gonna end up like mama?

615
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,052
- Aw, Mom, that was--
- The ham! Gimme that!

616
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,223
Hmm.

617
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:04,565
Well, it won't work
changing the code on me.

618
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:06,935
They're calling
for air destroyer Goliath.

619
00:49:15,814 --> 00:49:17,577
They're planning
to take off with Sheeta.

620
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,982
We've got to hurry,
or it'll be too late!

621
00:49:20,052 --> 00:49:22,577
Come on, boys! Stop eating!

622
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:24,987
I'm going!

623
00:49:25,057 --> 00:49:27,651
Wait! Are you going
to rescue Sheeta?

624
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:30,422
No, you little squirt.
We want her crystal.

625
00:49:30,496 --> 00:49:31,656
Wait a minute!
You've got to have Sheeta...

626
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,061
to make
the aetherium crystal work.

627
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:34,224
Otherwise, it's useless!

628
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,235
Please let me come with you!
I need to save her!

629
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:39,237
Sheeta means everything to me.

630
00:49:39,305 --> 00:49:40,738
You know something?

631
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:43,240
You're acting like
a sniveling little crybaby.

632
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:45,607
Maybe you're right. I should
have protected Sheeta...

633
00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:47,578
but instead,
I was stupid and angry.

634
00:49:47,646 --> 00:49:48,738
But let me come with you...

635
00:49:48,814 --> 00:49:49,906
and I swear
I'll protect her this time!

636
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:51,745
Pazu loves Sheeta

637
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:53,842
- Be quiet!

638
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,944
Hmm.

639
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,687
Guess you'll be useful in
getting Sheeta to cooperate.

640
00:50:04,763 --> 00:50:07,596
You might never
come back here again, Pazu.

641
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:08,758
I know.

642
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,734
- Ready for what might happen?
- Mm-hmm.

643
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:14,739
We leave here in one minute!

644
00:50:22,948 --> 00:50:25,610
Now, you guys be good.

645
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:34,989
- Here, fasten this.
- Right!

646
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,962
Let's rendezvous
at the Tiger Moth.

647
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:10,819
What a superb ship!

648
00:51:10,896 --> 00:51:13,387
Muska, has the girl
surrendered the information?

649
00:51:13,465 --> 00:51:14,796
It will take a little more time.

650
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,494
More time?

651
00:51:16,568 --> 00:51:18,593
Well, you'll have plenty
of that aboard Goliath.

652
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:20,866
We set out with her
at first light.

653
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:44,519
Hurry! We have to get there
before sun up!

654
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:51,528
Sheeta.

655
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:18,559
Well, well, now,
what shall we do?

656
00:52:20,566 --> 00:52:25,333
Sheeta, maybe grandma
should teach you a spell--

657
00:52:25,404 --> 00:52:27,964
one that will help you
when you're in trouble.

658
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,530
A spell?

659
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:32,509
Yes, my dearest.
An ancient secret spell.

660
00:52:32,578 --> 00:52:38,517
Leetay latuparita ulus
arialos balu netoreel.

661
00:52:38,584 --> 00:52:41,519
Leetay a...

662
00:52:41,587 --> 00:52:44,283
The words mean "save me."

663
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:48,292
"save me
and revive the eternal light."

664
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,956
So, leetay latuparita ulus
arialos balu netoreel.

665
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:56,997
Leetay latuparita ulus...

666
00:52:57,069 --> 00:52:59,560
arialos balu netoreel.

667
00:53:05,177 --> 00:53:07,509
Aah! Aah!

668
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:14,014
Aah!

669
00:53:22,227 --> 00:53:25,663
Ahh. I knew it!

670
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:34,066
It's the sacred light!

671
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:36,937
The ancient documents were true!
It's not just a legend!

672
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:39,102
What are you talking about?

673
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:41,544
Aaah!

674
00:53:41,613 --> 00:53:43,547
Oh!

675
00:53:43,615 --> 00:53:47,051
Tell me the spell!
What are the secret words?

676
00:53:56,061 --> 00:53:58,723
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

677
00:54:03,635 --> 00:54:05,500
- Huh?
- Huh?

678
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:16,981
I'm telling you,
this thing is alive!

679
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:19,984
Do you hear me? Alive!

680
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,055
What?

681
00:54:28,327 --> 00:54:31,728
GUARD: Help, it's alive!
And it's after us!

682
00:54:31,797 --> 00:54:34,960
- Run for your lives!
- It's the robot! Go! Run!

683
00:54:38,804 --> 00:54:40,795
It's come back to life!

684
00:54:40,873 --> 00:54:44,832
Hurry! Hurry! Sound the alarm!
Quick! Quick!

685
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,037
SOLDIER: He's moving!

686
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:52,350
- What's happening?
- Sir, it's the robot.

687
00:55:02,294 --> 00:55:04,228
It's coming toward us!

688
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:11,731
Shut the fire door! Hurry!

689
00:55:16,174 --> 00:55:17,801
- Pull back!
- Look out!

690
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,214
- Aah!
- The power!

691
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:32,849
Yes, I understand.

692
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:35,849
It's your crystal.

693
00:55:35,928 --> 00:55:37,657
The force
of the sacred light...

694
00:55:37,729 --> 00:55:39,356
has brought the robot
back to life!

695
00:55:39,431 --> 00:55:41,991
The way to Laputa
has been opened!

696
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:44,558
Let me go!

697
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:48,864
- Ohh!
- Unh!

698
00:55:51,944 --> 00:55:53,741
Aah!

699
00:56:04,289 --> 00:56:05,415
It's going to fly!

700
00:56:13,398 --> 00:56:15,093
Aah!

701
00:56:22,874 --> 00:56:24,000
Oh!

702
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:36,112
Oh! Oh!

703
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:53,704
Oh! Oh!

704
00:56:57,843 --> 00:57:00,334
It's Laputa.

705
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:07,617
Finally.
I now know the way to Laputa.

706
00:57:07,686 --> 00:57:09,551
Hurry! No time to waste!

707
00:57:09,621 --> 00:57:11,111
What do you mean, robot?

708
00:57:11,189 --> 00:57:13,123
I want to know who's trying
to blow up my fortress!

709
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:17,453
Are you there?
Somebody answer me now!

710
00:57:17,529 --> 00:57:20,464
- We're ready.
- You're connected now, Colonel.

711
00:57:20,532 --> 00:57:23,126
This is Colonel Muska.
We have an emergency.

712
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:24,691
You'll take your orders
from me now.

713
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,203
Huh?

714
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,154
Hurry! I need that shell now!

715
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:05,902
- Fire!
- Fire!

716
00:58:08,246 --> 00:58:09,838
Aah!

717
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:26,060
Let's get up there now!

718
00:58:28,266 --> 00:58:30,200
- We demolished it!
- We got him!

719
00:58:30,268 --> 00:58:31,565
Go get the girl!

720
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:33,035
- Over there!
- Yes, sir.

721
00:58:33,105 --> 00:58:34,970
SOLDIER: Make sure
it doesn't move, now.

722
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,440
Is she dead?

723
00:58:37,509 --> 00:58:39,136
Hey, get up.

724
00:58:40,378 --> 00:58:42,744
Nah, she's only fainted.

725
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:43,906
- Come on.
- Oh, no!

726
00:58:55,026 --> 00:58:56,288
Aah!

727
00:59:29,928 --> 00:59:32,021
Wow

728
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,693
Must be some kind of war
goin' on!

729
00:59:37,769 --> 00:59:40,431
- Take her down, Dola!
- Call me captain!

730
00:59:40,505 --> 00:59:42,973
Whee!

731
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,440
Ha ha ha!

732
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,672
Just keep your big head down,
Shalulu!

733
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:05,052
Huh?

734
01:00:07,465 --> 01:00:09,695
Stop it!
You're destroying everything!

735
01:00:09,768 --> 01:00:11,702
Please, stop!

736
01:00:19,811 --> 01:00:22,746
Captain Mother, Goliath
is moving! Goliath is moving!

737
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,521
If we stay on this heading,
we'll be in the line of fire.

738
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,149
- Change course!
- Look! There she is!

739
01:00:34,226 --> 01:00:35,352
- It's Sheeta!
- What?

740
01:00:37,229 --> 01:00:39,925
- Where'd you see her?
- Steady as she goes, captain!

741
01:00:39,998 --> 01:00:42,398
PAZU:
She's on top of that tower!

742
01:00:50,242 --> 01:00:52,403
One for all and all for mom!

743
01:00:52,477 --> 01:00:54,172
- Cover me!
- Good luck!

744
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:08,254
Sheeta!

745
01:01:09,527 --> 01:01:11,552
My hand--take it!

746
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,359
Pazu!

747
01:01:14,766 --> 01:01:17,098
I've gotta get in
a little closer, Dola!

748
01:01:17,168 --> 01:01:20,604
Aah! Uhh!

749
01:01:20,672 --> 01:01:22,936
Pazu!

750
01:01:23,008 --> 01:01:27,138
But they're here to help me!
Please, put me down!

751
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:38,088
Aah!

752
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,464
Sheeta!

753
01:01:47,532 --> 01:01:49,295
Uhh!

754
01:01:50,568 --> 01:01:52,559
PAZU: Dola!

755
01:01:55,473 --> 01:01:57,441
No! They're falling!

756
01:02:04,716 --> 01:02:07,651
No.

757
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:09,016
Help!

758
01:02:15,827 --> 01:02:16,987
Come on!

759
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:31,431
Oh, come on, pull up!

760
01:02:31,509 --> 01:02:32,771
Uhh!

761
01:02:36,948 --> 01:02:38,381
It's now or never, Pazu.

762
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:39,883
I'll take us in,
and you grab her.

763
01:02:39,951 --> 01:02:41,248
PAZU: Right!

764
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:42,809
Over here!

765
01:02:42,887 --> 01:02:45,185
- OK, captain!
- Go!

766
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:48,884
What are you doing? Fools!
Don't let her escape!

767
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,155
Aaah!

768
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,736
An entire army,
and they're getting away!

769
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:05,833
It's not over.

770
01:03:18,656 --> 01:03:22,057
Muska, Muska! What on earth
happened to the robot?

771
01:03:22,127 --> 01:03:24,459
We destroyed it,
and the girl's gone.

772
01:03:24,529 --> 01:03:26,656
What?! Ohh!

773
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:29,222
Look at this. It's a disaster.

774
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,201
I think we may have found
what you've been looking for.

775
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:35,398
Extinguish the fire!
Organize a pursuit team!

776
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:52,449
It still possesses
its sacred light...

777
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:56,654
pointing to Laputa.

778
01:03:56,728 --> 01:03:58,923
You may now go tell
the general for me...

779
01:03:58,997 --> 01:04:00,760
we will be departing on time.

780
01:04:38,736 --> 01:04:40,067
Sheeta, you OK?

781
01:04:40,138 --> 01:04:41,901
If I did something wrong...

782
01:04:41,973 --> 01:04:44,567
I'd really like
to apologize for it, Sheeta.

783
01:04:44,642 --> 01:04:46,337
DOLA: We all did
something wrong...

784
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,572
wastin' our time
on these two kids.

785
01:04:48,646 --> 01:04:51,012
Here's your valley up ahead.

786
01:04:51,082 --> 01:04:53,073
I'll drop you off there,
and that'll be that.

787
01:04:53,151 --> 01:04:54,448
It's allright.

788
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:57,454
Dola, will you let us sail
with you and the boys?

789
01:04:57,522 --> 01:04:59,217
Call me captain, darn it!

790
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:01,121
I don't see what the heck's
in it for me...

791
01:05:01,192 --> 01:05:02,659
since you've lost
the aetherium crystal!

792
01:05:02,727 --> 01:05:04,490
We can work.

793
01:05:04,562 --> 01:05:06,291
And I have to find out
the real truth...

794
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:08,992
about Laputa for myself,
captain.

795
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:16,333
So, you're not interested
in money...

796
01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:18,637
but you want to find out
the truth about Laputa.

797
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:20,405
Heh heh. Well, I guess
there's worse reasons...

798
01:05:20,478 --> 01:05:22,070
for you wanting
to become a pirate.

799
01:05:22,147 --> 01:05:23,944
LOUIE: Mother,
I say let 'em come along.

800
01:05:24,015 --> 01:05:27,041
DOLA: Tow the line and
work hard, or overboard you go.

801
01:05:27,118 --> 01:05:28,210
PAZU: Yes, captain.

802
01:05:28,286 --> 01:05:30,584
Yes! No more
swabbin' the decks! Hooray!

803
01:05:30,655 --> 01:05:32,054
I won't have
to wash the dishes!

804
01:05:32,123 --> 01:05:35,490
I've peeled my last potato!
Yee-haw!

805
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:39,326
- Whoopee!
- Whee!

806
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:41,331
CHARLES:
Sheeta, can you make pudding?

807
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:42,661
I love pudding!

808
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:44,827
I get to lick the spatula!

809
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:46,894
And I like chocolate cake
with that--

810
01:05:46,971 --> 01:05:48,836
Oh, what's that frosting?
It's kind of pink and swirly.

811
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:52,035
Will you shut up?
Ah, what can I tell you?

812
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,577
They just really like dessert.

813
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,385
SHEETA AND PAZU: Whoa!

814
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:41,789
And disembark.

815
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:47,587
Uhh! Wow, what is this ship
made out of, cloth?

816
01:06:47,665 --> 01:06:48,859
And don't you rip it!

817
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:50,025
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

818
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:52,069
Come on, we'll go topside.

819
01:06:56,207 --> 01:06:57,469
Ohh!

820
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,808
DOLA: You're goin'
the wrong way! Come here!

821
01:07:00,878 --> 01:07:02,175
I don't like slow-pokes!

822
01:07:05,316 --> 01:07:06,681
- Ohh!
- Pazu?

823
01:07:06,751 --> 01:07:08,309
DOLA: Come on, matey.
I haven't got all day.

824
01:07:08,386 --> 01:07:10,479
LOUIE: Work, work, work.
Busy, busy, busy, busy.

825
01:07:10,555 --> 01:07:12,887
Left, right, left, right.
You're not here to have fun.

826
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,326
Whoa. This engine room
is really amazing.

827
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:20,159
Is that what it's called?

828
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:22,722
Hey, papa! Where are you?!

829
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,994
Oh!

830
01:07:24,068 --> 01:07:27,731
Hey, pop, I finally found you
an assistant!

831
01:07:27,805 --> 01:07:30,399
Stop yelling at me!
I can hear you!

832
01:07:30,475 --> 01:07:32,272
Believe me,
sometimes I wish I couldn't.

833
01:07:34,178 --> 01:07:37,341
Uh, hurry up. He is
even tougher than my mother.

834
01:07:45,223 --> 01:07:46,986
It's too narrow. I can't reach.

835
01:07:47,058 --> 01:07:48,389
It's OK. I got it.

836
01:07:48,459 --> 01:07:49,687
- What's your name?
- Pazu.

837
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:55,822
But the beam from the crystal
was pointing directly due east.

838
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,765
Are you sure about this?

839
01:07:57,835 --> 01:08:01,202
Yes, I'm sure I could see
the sun rising from the tower.

840
01:08:01,272 --> 01:08:03,502
You know, it's the end
of grass-cutting season...

841
01:08:03,574 --> 01:08:05,508
so the sun rose
not from due east...

842
01:08:05,576 --> 01:08:07,168
but a little further south.

843
01:08:07,245 --> 01:08:09,179
The light was pointing
to the left of the hill...

844
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:10,976
from which the sun rose,
you see?

845
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:13,279
Pretty smart.
Found anything yet?

846
01:08:13,351 --> 01:08:15,478
Haven't found a single thing,
captain.

847
01:08:15,553 --> 01:08:16,815
DOLA: They're
jamming the airwaves...

848
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:18,822
so we can't find 'em.
the flying devils.

849
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:21,882
Mom, how can we catch them when
they're faster than we are?

850
01:08:21,959 --> 01:08:25,019
Well, It looks like we're cruising
on the windward side of 'em.

851
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:27,997
So if we manage
to ride the trade wind...

852
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:30,899
Let's see. According
to my calculations...

853
01:08:30,968 --> 01:08:34,199
with wind velocity at ten...

854
01:08:34,272 --> 01:08:37,708
looks to me
like we'll catch 'em.

855
01:08:37,775 --> 01:08:40,209
Attention, all hands!
Now hear this!

856
01:08:40,278 --> 01:08:43,577
Goliath is already underway
for Laputa.

857
01:08:43,648 --> 01:08:45,639
We're gonna set sail
and go after them.

858
01:08:45,717 --> 01:08:47,150
If we can catch the wind...

859
01:08:47,218 --> 01:08:49,413
we'll be on their heels
by tomorrow.

860
01:08:49,487 --> 01:08:52,979
The first man to spy Goliath
will receive ten gold coins.

861
01:08:53,057 --> 01:08:54,490
That's good money!

862
01:08:54,559 --> 01:08:57,153
And if the stories we've heard
about Laputa are true...

863
01:08:57,228 --> 01:08:58,490
there'll be enough treasure...

864
01:08:58,563 --> 01:09:00,258
to make an honest pirate
of us all.

865
01:09:00,331 --> 01:09:03,266
Ha ha! All right!
All hands aboard!

866
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:05,393
Look alive and get to work!

867
01:09:11,709 --> 01:09:13,199
Let her rip!

868
01:09:19,951 --> 01:09:22,886
Course, ninety-eight degrees.
Velocity, fifty.

869
01:09:52,784 --> 01:09:55,810
Now you gotta start
dressing like a real pirate.

870
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:58,447
Let's see... here.

871
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:11,294
And this is
where you'll be working.

872
01:10:16,307 --> 01:10:18,400
DOLA: This is the galley.
I want it shipshape...

873
01:10:18,476 --> 01:10:20,603
sparkling clean, and
ready for action in one hour.

874
01:10:20,678 --> 01:10:22,612
- That's an order.
- But I--

875
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,582
The boys get awful hungry,
so you'll serve 5 meals a day.

876
01:10:33,558 --> 01:10:36,288
You blubberheads!
I'm not runnin' a luxury cruise!

877
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,486
Now get to work!

878
01:10:42,066 --> 01:10:43,829
Mmm.

879
01:11:06,257 --> 01:11:07,349
Hmm?

880
01:11:07,425 --> 01:11:09,416
Hmm.

881
01:11:09,494 --> 01:11:10,620
Hmm?

882
01:11:28,746 --> 01:11:30,179
SHEETA: Come in.

883
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:37,145
I'm afraid I'm still cooking.
Nothing's ready yet.

884
01:11:37,221 --> 01:11:40,850
It took me a long time
to clean everything up.

885
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:43,860
- Ahem.
- Uh, yes? What is it?

886
01:11:45,596 --> 01:11:46,688
Uh...

887
01:11:46,764 --> 01:11:48,356
Yes?

888
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:50,195
I finished my work
for the moment...

889
01:11:50,268 --> 01:11:52,259
and I've come to offer you
my help.

890
01:11:52,336 --> 01:11:53,963
Well, that's kind of you.

891
01:11:54,038 --> 01:11:56,063
Would you please hand me
those plates over there?

892
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,370
With pleasure,
my little ang-- ohh!

893
01:12:01,445 --> 01:12:04,380
I thought you said
you had a stomach ache.

894
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:06,814
I'm in love with you!

895
01:12:06,884 --> 01:12:08,374
- You?
- Hello.

896
01:12:08,452 --> 01:12:10,682
- Move!
- Too crowded.

897
01:12:10,755 --> 01:12:12,620
Hey, what do I look like,
a chair?

898
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:14,089
Hi. Is there anything I can do?

899
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:15,887
- Huh?
- Hey!

900
01:12:23,968 --> 01:12:25,799
What's come over you, my dear?

901
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:28,896
It's not like you to challenge
a ship like Goliath.

902
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:30,907
You know,
the odds are against you.

903
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,705
I'm after treasure. That's all.

904
01:12:33,778 --> 01:12:37,509
Heh heh heh. I must admit,
those kids are cute.

905
01:12:37,582 --> 01:12:40,107
What do you mean by that,
you old fool?

906
01:12:40,184 --> 01:12:41,879
Nothing.
But that little girl...

907
01:12:41,953 --> 01:12:44,444
does remind me of you
not so long ago.

908
01:12:44,522 --> 01:12:46,285
- Who asked ya?
- Nobody.

909
01:12:46,357 --> 01:12:48,917
- Oh, look. Checkmate.
- Huh?

910
01:12:48,993 --> 01:12:50,460
MAN: Fabulous!

911
01:12:54,999 --> 01:12:57,263
Does anyone want any more?

912
01:12:57,335 --> 01:12:59,667
I do believe I will have
a second helping.

913
01:12:59,737 --> 01:13:00,999
- Yes!
- I want some more!

914
01:13:20,213 --> 01:13:21,976
Come on, young pup.

915
01:13:22,048 --> 01:13:23,345
Huh?

916
01:13:24,618 --> 01:13:26,711
Time to go on duty.

917
01:13:26,786 --> 01:13:28,344
It's cold. Take this.

918
01:13:30,423 --> 01:13:31,651
Huh?

919
01:13:45,939 --> 01:13:48,635
- I'll take over.
- Thank you!

920
01:13:57,384 --> 01:13:58,510
Huh?

921
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,385
Sheeta!

922
01:14:03,456 --> 01:14:06,653
Ohh. Whoa!

923
01:14:06,726 --> 01:14:09,422
Ohh! That was exciting.

924
01:14:09,496 --> 01:14:12,021
Wow! You can see forever.

925
01:14:21,942 --> 01:14:23,307
Ohh.

926
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,901
Sheeta? Here.

927
01:14:29,249 --> 01:14:30,511
PAZU: You OK?

928
01:14:30,584 --> 01:14:32,176
SHEETA: That's better.

929
01:14:34,457 --> 01:14:36,526
This is great.
Now we can keep watch together.

930
01:14:40,293 --> 01:14:42,193
- Pazu?
- Hmm?

931
01:14:42,262 --> 01:14:44,230
SHEETA: I'm really scared.

932
01:14:44,297 --> 01:14:47,425
To tell you the truth,
I don't want to go to Laputa.

933
01:14:49,135 --> 01:14:50,762
What do you mean?

934
01:14:50,837 --> 01:14:52,202
Didn't you tell Dola
the truth?

935
01:14:53,506 --> 01:14:55,167
SHEETA:
I didn't lie to Dola.

936
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:57,903
What I said about
the light's direction is true.

937
01:14:57,978 --> 01:15:00,572
But what if someone else dies?

938
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:02,012
PAZU:
You mean, like the robot?

939
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:04,016
SHEETA:
He died to save my life.

940
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:06,018
I feel awful.

941
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:09,749
All this is because of a spell
my grandmother taught me.

942
01:15:09,823 --> 01:15:12,417
She taught me
all sorts of spells.

943
01:15:12,492 --> 01:15:15,222
A spell to use when you're
looking for something...

944
01:15:15,295 --> 01:15:17,024
a spell to cure sickness.

945
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:20,430
There's even one she told me
I must never use.

946
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,435
- What kind of spell?
- The spell of destruction.

947
01:15:23,503 --> 01:15:25,801
SHEETA: She said that
to give power to good spells...

948
01:15:25,872 --> 01:15:27,897
I had to know evil ones, too.

949
01:15:27,974 --> 01:15:30,238
But she told me
never to use them.

950
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:32,904
I was so scared
when I leaned that spell...

951
01:15:32,979 --> 01:15:34,173
I couldn't sleep.

952
01:15:34,247 --> 01:15:37,239
I didn't know the spells
were connected to my necklace.

953
01:15:37,317 --> 01:15:39,251
Uncle Pom was right
when he said...

954
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:42,755
that it was dangerous for us to
misuse the power of the crystal.

955
01:15:42,822 --> 01:15:45,313
And what if Laputa
has the same power...

956
01:15:45,392 --> 01:15:48,156
that can also be used
for great evil?

957
01:15:48,228 --> 01:15:50,788
I wish
I'd thrown the crystal away.

958
01:15:50,864 --> 01:15:52,627
But then we never
would have met.

959
01:15:52,699 --> 01:15:55,930
And anyway, even if you had,
Laputa would still exist.

960
01:15:56,002 --> 01:15:59,165
Airplanes and flying machines
are getting better and better.

961
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:01,639
You know, eventually,
some explorer or another...

962
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:05,144
will come across the city
of Laputa one day and claim it.

963
01:16:05,211 --> 01:16:07,145
I can't say
I know what's best...

964
01:16:07,213 --> 01:16:09,147
but if Laputa really has
such great power...

965
01:16:09,215 --> 01:16:10,546
we can't let it
fall into the hands...

966
01:16:10,617 --> 01:16:13,245
of bad people like Muska.

967
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:18,484
And if we run away now,
Muska is gonna chase us forever.

968
01:16:18,558 --> 01:16:20,719
But Pazu, I don't want you
to become a pirate...

969
01:16:20,794 --> 01:16:22,125
because of me.

970
01:16:22,195 --> 01:16:24,163
I'm not gonna become a pirate.

971
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:26,255
And don't worry.
Dola will understand.

972
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,664
She's much nicer
than she pretends to be.

973
01:16:28,735 --> 01:16:30,566
And when
we've finally found it...

974
01:16:30,637 --> 01:16:32,662
I promise you
we'll go back to Gondoa.

975
01:16:32,739 --> 01:16:34,400
I want to see it all, Sheeta.

976
01:16:34,474 --> 01:16:37,671
The old house where you were
born, the valley and everything.

977
01:16:37,744 --> 01:16:40,178
SHEETA:
Oh, Pazu.

978
01:16:40,246 --> 01:16:43,181
- Sheeta, what's that?

979
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:45,479
Right there. Under the ship.
See it?

980
01:16:53,126 --> 01:16:55,287
Captain, it's Goliath--
right under our bow!

981
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,300
Starboard rudder,
full speed ahead!

982
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:35,526
Why don't you go after them,
Muska? Get them!

983
01:17:35,602 --> 01:17:38,264
It's useless to look for them
in the cloud cover.

984
01:17:38,338 --> 01:17:41,830
I don't need to waste my energy
on a wild-goose chase.

985
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:44,843
Besides, we're running
right on schedule.

986
01:17:56,923 --> 01:17:59,255
It was farther north
than I figured.

987
01:17:59,325 --> 01:18:01,759
Pazu, listen carefully to me.

988
01:18:01,828 --> 01:18:04,854
Everything will be ruined
if we lose track of Goliath.

989
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:06,398
You've got good eyes.
so I want you...

990
01:18:06,466 --> 01:18:07,933
to watch her
and keep us on course.

991
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:09,093
How do I do that, captain?

992
01:18:09,169 --> 01:18:11,034
The crow's nest
can be made into a kite.

993
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:12,594
See the metal handle
on the bulkhead?

994
01:18:12,672 --> 01:18:15,163
- I got it!
- Turn it clockwise!

995
01:18:18,178 --> 01:18:20,009
DOLA: Hook it up
and then turn the handle.

996
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:22,604
That'll make the wings open.

997
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:27,586
Now extend the wire.

998
01:18:27,654 --> 01:18:29,713
You'll have to get the hang
of flying it on your own.

999
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:32,891
Are you up there,
Sheeta, my dear?

1000
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,223
- Yes.
- Best you come down right now.

1001
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:36,660
SHEETA: Why?

1002
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:39,254
Because you're a girl--
a female! That's man's work!

1003
01:18:39,332 --> 01:18:41,129
But you're female, captain!

1004
01:18:41,201 --> 01:18:43,362
I grew up in the mountains.
I can do this!

1005
01:18:43,436 --> 01:18:44,528
Sheeta, no!

1006
01:18:44,604 --> 01:18:48,096
Be quiet.
And Pazu agrees with me.

1007
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:50,199
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1008
01:18:50,276 --> 01:18:52,244
All right, me hearty,
once you take off...

1009
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:54,041
you'll have to use the phone
to communicate.

1010
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:57,912
SHEETA:
You mean this phone?

1011
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:59,178
She is good.

1012
01:18:59,252 --> 01:19:02,187
Right. I think we're set.
Ready for takeoff.

1013
01:19:02,255 --> 01:19:03,813
DOLA: Aye-aye. Anchors away!

1014
01:19:22,775 --> 01:19:24,970
I don't see them.

1015
01:19:25,044 --> 01:19:26,705
They must be hiding
under the cloud cover.

1016
01:19:26,779 --> 01:19:29,145
DOLA: Perhaps. But they
could also be above you.

1017
01:19:29,215 --> 01:19:30,477
Keep your eyes peeled..

1018
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:33,485
- Roger! Whoa!
- Whoa!

1019
01:19:33,553 --> 01:19:34,679
PAZU: Hang on tight!

1020
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:43,329
DOLA: What happened?

1021
01:19:43,396 --> 01:19:45,296
PAZU:
Nothing. Just a gust of wind.

1022
01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:48,493
Didn't bother us at all.

1023
01:19:48,568 --> 01:19:51,162
We're fine.
We'll keep on watching.

1024
01:19:51,237 --> 01:19:53,637
- Afraid?
- Uh-uh.

1025
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,765
I got the hang
of this thing now.

1026
01:19:55,842 --> 01:19:57,309
Storm ahead.

1027
01:20:00,113 --> 01:20:01,512
Sheeta, look in my bag.

1028
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:03,071
There should be some rope
in there.

1029
01:20:03,149 --> 01:20:04,446
OK.

1030
01:20:04,517 --> 01:20:06,849
Let's tie ourselves together.
This storm is gonna be rough.

1031
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,046
Good idea.

1032
01:20:11,124 --> 01:20:13,592
The mercury is dropping
really fast, mom.

1033
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:16,493
Blast our luck, boys.
What a rotten time for a storm.

1034
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:19,053
- When is sun-up?
- In one hour.

1035
01:20:35,281 --> 01:20:36,839
Wait a minute.
Something's not right.

1036
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:39,180
The sun is coming up
in the wrong place.

1037
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:40,549
We're out of position.

1038
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,611
You're right. We're supposed
to be heading east, not north.

1039
01:20:42,689 --> 01:20:44,714
We're going the wrong way.
Captain!

1040
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:47,055
Huh? What do you mean,
we're headed north?

1041
01:20:47,126 --> 01:20:49,287
But the compass needle
is pointing east, mom.

1042
01:20:49,362 --> 01:20:51,091
There's something
confusing the compass...

1043
01:20:51,164 --> 01:20:52,756
and I want to know what it is!

1044
01:20:52,832 --> 01:20:54,060
SHEETA:
There it is! Look!

1045
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:55,964
There what is? Is it Goliath?

1046
01:20:56,035 --> 01:20:57,229
PAZU:
No, it's a cloud...

1047
01:20:57,303 --> 01:20:59,294
and I've only seen
one other like it.

1048
01:20:59,372 --> 01:21:00,737
A cloud?

1049
01:21:00,807 --> 01:21:02,866
It's heading right for us!

1050
01:21:16,856 --> 01:21:18,118
That's it.

1051
01:21:18,191 --> 01:21:20,523
I'm not gonna captain my ship
into the eye of a hurricane!

1052
01:21:20,593 --> 01:21:23,960
Pull back! Pull back,
I tell you! All engines reverse!

1053
01:21:42,081 --> 01:21:44,015
We're being pulled
into the center of the storm!

1054
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,017
DOLA: Sorry, Pazu,
we can't help you!

1055
01:21:46,085 --> 01:21:47,985
You have to ride it out.
Good luck, sailor!

1056
01:21:53,226 --> 01:21:55,251
I can't get it to turn!

1057
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:57,353
Put more backbone into it,
my boy!

1058
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:00,160
Dola, the engine can't take it!

1059
01:22:00,233 --> 01:22:02,098
What do you want me
to do about it?

1060
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:03,601
Just do what you can!

1061
01:22:05,071 --> 01:22:06,436
Clouds are breaking up.

1062
01:22:13,046 --> 01:22:15,446
- Uhh! It's the ocean!
- Huh?

1063
01:22:27,427 --> 01:22:28,951
Pazu, it's a hurricane!

1064
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:31,496
I see it, captain!
We're going in!

1065
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:43,441
Wow.
It's just like dad said--

1066
01:22:43,509 --> 01:22:45,477
two winds blowing
in opposite directions.

1067
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:52,040
DOLA: Shiver me timbers!
What a powerful storm!

1068
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:54,313
CHARLES: Mom, it's no use!
We'll be sucked in!

1069
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:57,447
If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's a quitter!

1070
01:22:57,523 --> 01:22:59,582
PAZU:
Captain, Laputa's in there!

1071
01:22:59,659 --> 01:23:00,990
Laputa's where?

1072
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,994
This is just the kind of storm
my father saw...

1073
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:04,495
and Laputa's
in the middle of it!

1074
01:23:04,564 --> 01:23:08,432
DOLA: It can't be.
It'd be smashed to pieces!

1075
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:10,731
- Pazu! Look there!
- Huh?

1076
01:23:13,306 --> 01:23:15,365
My boys, we have a dilemma.

1077
01:23:15,441 --> 01:23:18,376
It's Goliath off the port bow!

1078
01:23:26,953 --> 01:23:29,046
We're gonna go
into the hurricane.

1079
01:23:29,122 --> 01:23:31,386
My dad made it through alive,
and so will we!

1080
01:23:31,457 --> 01:23:33,618
Ready?
Brace yourselves, gentlemen!

1081
01:23:33,693 --> 01:23:34,887
Aah!

1082
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,732
Aah!

1083
01:23:46,339 --> 01:23:48,864
We did it! Got 'em!

1084
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,273
If we don't turn,
we'll hit that storm.

1085
01:23:51,344 --> 01:23:53,369
- All ahead full.
- Sir?

1086
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:57,382
MUSKA: The light is pointing
to the center of the whirlwind.

1087
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:01,216
Laputa is in that storm.
I won't retreat.

1088
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:04,620
Now go straight ahead--
and that is an order, captain.

1089
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,997
- Ready, Sheeta?
- Yes!

1090
01:24:49,702 --> 01:24:50,896
Huh?

1091
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:00,311
Father?

1092
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:13,672
Huh?

1093
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:19,250
Sheeta!
Hey, are you all right?

1094
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:20,751
Wake up.

1095
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:24,615
Mm.

1096
01:27:26,592 --> 01:27:28,321
Look.

1097
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,066
Laputa.

1098
01:27:44,143 --> 01:27:46,543
- Uhh!
- I'm sorry.

1099
01:27:46,612 --> 01:27:48,671
- Here.
- Wait a minute.

1100
01:27:48,748 --> 01:27:50,682
It's a very tight knot.

1101
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:53,184
And...my... uhh!

1102
01:27:53,252 --> 01:27:55,743
My hands are trembling.

1103
01:27:55,821 --> 01:27:56,913
Whoa!

1104
01:28:17,576 --> 01:28:21,068
- Hoo-hoo!
- Ohh!

1105
01:28:21,147 --> 01:28:23,513
- Aah!
- Whoa!

1106
01:28:35,494 --> 01:28:37,689
Pretty birds.

1107
01:28:37,763 --> 01:28:39,890
They must live here, Pazu.

1108
01:28:42,268 --> 01:28:43,235
Huh?

1109
01:28:50,609 --> 01:28:52,600
I think he must be here
to meet you, Sheeta.

1110
01:28:52,678 --> 01:28:54,646
But I don't have
the aetherium crystal.

1111
01:28:54,713 --> 01:28:56,544
Wait, I've gotta cut us loose.

1112
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:15,656
PAZU: Hey, wait!

1113
01:29:15,734 --> 01:29:18,567
- You're gonna break that!
- Wait!

1114
01:29:18,637 --> 01:29:20,628
Please, Mr.Robot,
don't do that.

1115
01:29:20,706 --> 01:29:22,674
We won't be able to go home
without it.

1116
01:29:38,524 --> 01:29:40,549
It's a bird's nest.

1117
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:43,186
That's why he's here.

1118
01:29:46,765 --> 01:29:50,701
I'm so happy
the eggs are all right, Pazu.

1119
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:52,566
It must be his job
to take care of them.

1120
01:29:59,912 --> 01:30:02,312
- He says to follow him.
- How do you know?

1121
01:30:02,381 --> 01:30:03,643
I just know that's what he said!

1122
01:30:17,463 --> 01:30:18,828
- Ohh!
- Look!

1123
01:30:27,406 --> 01:30:29,397
It's a city.

1124
01:30:56,735 --> 01:30:59,033
I can't believe
we're inside a building.

1125
01:30:59,104 --> 01:31:00,696
Huh?

1126
01:31:03,275 --> 01:31:06,210
- Wow, the walls are invisible.
- Yeah.

1127
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,879
I wonder what happened here.

1128
01:31:16,956 --> 01:31:19,584
This used to be a city
of advanced technology.

1129
01:32:18,484 --> 01:32:20,111
It must be a monument.

1130
01:32:20,185 --> 01:32:22,050
I wish I could read
what it says.

1131
01:32:24,556 --> 01:32:27,252
Someone left some flowers.
Look.

1132
01:32:29,828 --> 01:32:32,695
Did you leave the flowers?

1133
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:35,763
Hey, that's a different robot.

1134
01:32:40,339 --> 01:32:43,433
It looks like it's been
frozen there forever.

1135
01:32:43,509 --> 01:32:44,806
Hey.

1136
01:32:55,054 --> 01:32:58,114
They must've been
protectors of the garden.

1137
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,015
And they've kept on
guarding the place...

1138
01:33:01,093 --> 01:33:03,755
even long after
all the people have gone.

1139
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:19,008
Oh! You've picked
another flower for the grave.

1140
01:33:19,078 --> 01:33:21,376
How kind of you.

1141
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:25,111
Oh, thank you.

1142
01:33:27,186 --> 01:33:28,949
You must be the only one left.

1143
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:30,511
It looks like
all the other robots...

1144
01:33:30,589 --> 01:33:32,022
stopped working a long time ago.

1145
01:33:39,832 --> 01:33:42,096
Ha!

1146
01:33:57,349 --> 01:33:59,909
You know what, Sheeta?
I bet he's not lonesome at all.

1147
01:33:59,985 --> 01:34:03,443
He's got plenty of friends--
the animals and the birds.

1148
01:34:03,522 --> 01:34:05,547
He takes care of them.

1149
01:34:21,206 --> 01:34:22,537
This way!

1150
01:34:33,552 --> 01:34:35,986
The army has destroyed
this part of the city!

1151
01:34:54,673 --> 01:34:57,836
SHEETA: I sure hope Dola
and the boys are all right.

1152
01:34:57,910 --> 01:35:01,073
PAZU: Me, too. Where are they?
Do you see them?

1153
01:35:01,146 --> 01:35:03,910
Wait! There they are!
They've got 'em prisoner!

1154
01:35:03,982 --> 01:35:05,916
SHEETA: They've been captured!
We've got to help them!

1155
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,952
If we don't, they'll hang 'em
from the yardarm!

1156
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:11,148
- What'll we do?
- Come on.

1157
01:35:11,223 --> 01:35:12,952
Hurry!

1158
01:35:13,025 --> 01:35:14,959
Sir! Sir!

1159
01:35:15,027 --> 01:35:18,224
We've managed
to break down the wall, general.

1160
01:35:18,297 --> 01:35:20,959
Just a sample
of what we found inside.

1161
01:35:21,033 --> 01:35:23,968
The city
is full of treasure, sir.

1162
01:35:24,036 --> 01:35:25,663
- Mama!
- Whoa.

1163
01:35:25,737 --> 01:35:28,262
Wouldn't you like to have this?

1164
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,366
Well, I've got a different
kind of necklace for you!

1165
01:35:31,443 --> 01:35:34,139
Have you radioed a report
on Laputa's discovery, Muska?

1166
01:35:34,213 --> 01:35:35,475
I was about to.

1167
01:35:35,547 --> 01:35:38,243
See if you can make it
difficult to decode.

1168
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:41,286
And stop pocketing
those jewels, you scum!

1169
01:35:42,821 --> 01:35:46,348
MUSKA: The perfect thing to
throw those fools off the scent.

1170
01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:04,706
We're up so high.

1171
01:36:04,776 --> 01:36:06,801
I hope you're good
at climbing trees, Sheeta.

1172
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:10,247
I've got a plan.

1173
01:36:12,217 --> 01:36:13,377
Ohh!

1174
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:45,945
PAZU:
What a greedy pack of thieves.

1175
01:36:46,018 --> 01:36:48,987
We can't let them
destroy the garden, Pazu.

1176
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:51,352
We have to find
the aetherium crystal.

1177
01:36:52,925 --> 01:36:54,051
We have to find it.

1178
01:36:54,126 --> 01:36:56,117
It's the only way
we can protect the garden.

1179
01:36:56,194 --> 01:36:57,320
I was wondering why...

1180
01:36:57,396 --> 01:36:58,863
all of the storm clouds
just disappeared.

1181
01:36:58,931 --> 01:37:00,899
Then I realized
if they hadn't cleared up...

1182
01:37:00,966 --> 01:37:02,866
the army
couldn't have made a landing.

1183
01:37:02,935 --> 01:37:05,403
You think it was
because of my necklace?

1184
01:37:05,470 --> 01:37:06,937
I don't know for sure,
but I think...

1185
01:37:07,005 --> 01:37:09,371
the power of the crystal
disintegrated that storm...

1186
01:37:09,441 --> 01:37:11,807
and now the castle
has awakened from its sleep...

1187
01:37:11,877 --> 01:37:14,004
for whoever holds the crystal.

1188
01:37:15,948 --> 01:37:18,883
We can't let Muska figure out
how to use the crystal.

1189
01:37:18,951 --> 01:37:21,818
If he does.
it'll be the end of everything.

1190
01:37:21,887 --> 01:37:24,287
But even if we can get
my grandmother's crystal back...

1191
01:37:24,356 --> 01:37:26,153
how can we use its power?

1192
01:37:26,224 --> 01:37:28,419
The spell, Pazu!

1193
01:37:28,493 --> 01:37:30,518
The spell of destruction.

1194
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:32,062
Sheeta, it may be the only way.

1195
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:33,358
- Huh?

1196
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:44,469
FIRST SOLDIER:
We need help over here!

1197
01:37:44,543 --> 01:37:47,569
SECOND SOLDIER: You, soldier!
Go find the general!

1198
01:37:47,646 --> 01:37:49,238
FIRST SOLDIER:
Somebody give us a hand!

1199
01:37:49,314 --> 01:37:50,713
SECOND SOLDIER:
Move now! You heard me!

1200
01:37:55,354 --> 01:37:56,719
Quickly!

1201
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,759
We need to get down there.

1202
01:38:18,844 --> 01:38:20,436
I'll go first.

1203
01:38:20,512 --> 01:38:22,377
Right. Be careful.

1204
01:38:24,383 --> 01:38:28,149
Unh! Aah!

1205
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:30,154
It's OK-- aah!

1206
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,151
Unh!

1207
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:39,722
Aah!

1208
01:38:39,798 --> 01:38:42,426
MUSKA:
It's around here somewhere.

1209
01:38:50,642 --> 01:38:51,734
MUSKA: Hmm.

1210
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,308
MUSKA:
It should be here. Wait!

1211
01:38:59,484 --> 01:39:00,815
This is it!

1212
01:39:09,161 --> 01:39:11,425
- Huh?
- Unh!

1213
01:39:11,496 --> 01:39:12,827
It's the boy!

1214
01:39:12,898 --> 01:39:15,093
- Aah!
- Aah!

1215
01:39:16,535 --> 01:39:19,163
- Sheeta!
- Stop! Don't shoot!

1216
01:39:20,772 --> 01:39:24,003
Well, well, looks like
we caught a little princess.

1217
01:39:24,076 --> 01:39:26,442
Don't hurt her!

1218
01:39:26,511 --> 01:39:29,002
- Unh!
- It came from over here!

1219
01:39:29,081 --> 01:39:32,539
- Colonel, what's happening?
- We've found another pirate.

1220
01:39:32,617 --> 01:39:34,881
And there's one more
hiding under your feet.

1221
01:39:34,953 --> 01:39:37,148
SOLDIER:
Yes, sir! We'll get him.

1222
01:39:39,858 --> 01:39:41,792
Sheeta, I'll find you!

1223
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:44,488
SHEETA: Pazu!

1224
01:39:44,563 --> 01:39:45,996
Huh?

1225
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,334
Is that Pazu?

1226
01:39:50,402 --> 01:39:51,528
Uhh!

1227
01:39:53,038 --> 01:39:56,405
- Holy smokes!
- Eww.

1228
01:39:56,475 --> 01:39:58,375
That wasn't me!

1229
01:40:02,881 --> 01:40:06,317
- I need the commanding officer!
- That way!

1230
01:40:06,384 --> 01:40:08,181
The general's waiting
over there.

1231
01:40:08,253 --> 01:40:09,811
Guards, on the double! Now!

1232
01:40:09,888 --> 01:40:11,355
SOLDIER:
You men, come with me!

1233
01:40:11,423 --> 01:40:12,515
- Right away, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1234
01:40:12,591 --> 01:40:14,616
- Dola.
- Huh?

1235
01:40:14,693 --> 01:40:15,819
Hmm?

1236
01:40:17,896 --> 01:40:19,193
Hi there.

1237
01:40:19,264 --> 01:40:21,994
Sheeta's been captured.
I'm going to save her.

1238
01:40:22,067 --> 01:40:24,831
When I cut your ropes.
make a run for it.

1239
01:40:32,811 --> 01:40:35,075
Good luck, now, captain.

1240
01:40:35,147 --> 01:40:36,842
Wait a minute, boy.

1241
01:40:36,915 --> 01:40:39,247
You'd better take this.

1242
01:40:40,285 --> 01:40:43,118
Huh? Uhh-- thank you.

1243
01:40:45,657 --> 01:40:48,592
The boy has become a man.

1244
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:52,824
What? What do you mean, Muska's
destroyed all the radios?

1245
01:40:52,898 --> 01:40:56,459
Sir! He must've done it while
most of the men were outside.

1246
01:40:56,535 --> 01:40:59,026
Several of the guards
have been seriously injured.

1247
01:40:59,104 --> 01:41:01,732
We've spotted Muska heading
for the black dome below, sir.

1248
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:04,331
He's not alone. He's got
those other two men with him.

1249
01:41:04,409 --> 01:41:07,503
So, Colonel Muska reveals
his true nature at last.

1250
01:41:07,579 --> 01:41:09,740
Now find him and arrest him!

1251
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:11,509
All right, first platoon, move!

1252
01:41:11,583 --> 01:41:12,743
Second platoon, fall in!

1253
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:15,581
You are to shoot
anyone who resists!

1254
01:41:15,654 --> 01:41:18,122
We must find Colonel Muska now!

1255
01:41:37,209 --> 01:41:41,509
Uh, excuse me, Colonel Muska.
Where are we?

1256
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:43,480
We are in the center of Laputa.

1257
01:41:43,548 --> 01:41:45,482
The castle above us
means nothing!

1258
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:47,848
All of Laputa's
scientific knowledge...

1259
01:41:47,919 --> 01:41:50,479
is contained in this chamber.

1260
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,385
You may wait here, gentlemen.

1261
01:41:57,462 --> 01:41:58,986
- Colonel, please!

1262
01:41:59,064 --> 01:42:00,691
This is a sacred place...

1263
01:42:00,765 --> 01:42:02,995
where only royalty
is allowed to enter.

1264
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:08,005
Huh? What's happened here? Uhh!

1265
01:42:08,073 --> 01:42:11,236
These filthy roots
don't belong in this chamber!

1266
01:42:14,679 --> 01:42:17,978
Horrible things.
I'll have them burned.

1267
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,516
This way. Come!

1268
01:42:32,464 --> 01:42:35,194
There it is! This is it.

1269
01:42:35,267 --> 01:42:36,996
See?

1270
01:42:42,774 --> 01:42:46,141
MUSKA: Not here, too! Aah!

1271
01:42:48,313 --> 01:42:49,746
Roots?

1272
01:43:00,258 --> 01:43:02,886
At last!
At last I have found it!

1273
01:43:04,763 --> 01:43:07,425
The largest
aetherium crystal ever.

1274
01:43:07,499 --> 01:43:11,094
And the source
of all the power in Laputa.

1275
01:43:11,169 --> 01:43:13,467
The amazing thing
is this beautiful stone...

1276
01:43:13,538 --> 01:43:16,439
has been awaiting the return
of its king for 700 years.

1277
01:43:16,508 --> 01:43:17,907
SHEETA:
Seven hundred years?

1278
01:43:17,976 --> 01:43:22,709
700 years is a long time
to be without a king, isn't it?

1279
01:43:25,784 --> 01:43:28,912
It's the black stone,
just as the legend says.

1280
01:43:34,793 --> 01:43:36,727
Get away!

1281
01:43:38,563 --> 01:43:40,724
There it is. It's the same.

1282
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:43,731
Who are you, Muska?

1283
01:43:45,036 --> 01:43:49,996
Yes, my dear.
I, too, have an old secret name.

1284
01:43:50,075 --> 01:43:53,238
My real name is
Romska Polo Ul Laputa.

1285
01:43:55,814 --> 01:43:58,942
You and I
have the same royal ancestors.

1286
01:43:59,017 --> 01:44:00,746
We are both of noble blood.

1287
01:44:00,819 --> 01:44:03,083
But then our ancestors
left Laputa to live on earth.

1288
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:04,246
What a mistake!

1289
01:44:13,832 --> 01:44:17,393
- The explosives have no effect!
- This is no ordinary stone!

1290
01:44:17,469 --> 01:44:19,369
Then use all of the dynamite
we have!

1291
01:44:19,437 --> 01:44:21,530
MUSKA: General.
there is no need to do that.

1292
01:44:21,606 --> 01:44:23,335
You may come in.

1293
01:44:23,408 --> 01:44:24,898
Where are you, Muska?

1294
01:44:32,484 --> 01:44:34,418
- Aah!
- Aah!

1295
01:44:34,486 --> 01:44:36,681
Huh?

1296
01:44:39,758 --> 01:44:41,692
Unh!

1297
01:44:44,496 --> 01:44:46,930
Aaaah!

1298
01:44:49,501 --> 01:44:51,332
Unh!

1299
01:44:59,844 --> 01:45:02,335
Huh? Aah!

1300
01:45:18,363 --> 01:45:19,955
MUSKA:
Really, I don't understand...

1301
01:45:20,031 --> 01:45:23,797
why you hesitate, general.
Please come in.

1302
01:45:23,868 --> 01:45:26,234
Blast him!
All right, follow me!

1303
01:45:37,649 --> 01:45:38,741
Huh?

1304
01:45:38,817 --> 01:45:40,876
After him, men! Hurry!

1305
01:45:40,952 --> 01:45:43,443
Wait, wait, hold on!
Wait a second.

1306
01:45:43,521 --> 01:45:45,580
Just where are you, Muska?

1307
01:45:45,657 --> 01:45:47,989
MUSKA: Please be quiet.

1308
01:45:48,059 --> 01:45:49,549
- What?
- Up there!

1309
01:45:51,229 --> 01:45:53,993
- Whoa.
- What's going on?

1310
01:45:55,967 --> 01:45:57,696
Hold your tongue, commoner!

1311
01:45:57,769 --> 01:46:00,397
You are in the presence
of the king of Laputa!

1312
01:46:00,472 --> 01:46:02,406
The man has gone crazy!

1313
01:46:02,474 --> 01:46:05,375
I thought I would show you
an example of Laputa's power.

1314
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:07,172
We are about to celebrate
the rebirth...

1315
01:46:07,245 --> 01:46:08,678
of the Laputian kingdom.

1316
01:46:08,746 --> 01:46:10,179
Sheeta?

1317
01:46:10,248 --> 01:46:14,184
MUSKA: Prepare yourself
for the thunder of Laputa!

1318
01:46:14,252 --> 01:46:17,187
Sheeta, I'm coming.
Aah!

1319
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:39,943
The fire of heaven
that destroyed...

1320
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:42,411
Sodom and Gomorrah
in the Old Testament.

1321
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:46,416
The Rahmaniya referred to it
as Indra's Arrow.

1322
01:46:46,484 --> 01:46:48,475
The entire world
will once again kneel...

1323
01:46:48,553 --> 01:46:50,646
before the power of Laputa.

1324
01:46:50,722 --> 01:46:55,216
I can only say well-done, Muska.
You're a credit to our country.

1325
01:46:55,293 --> 01:46:57,625
As such,
you deserve this reward.

1326
01:47:00,865 --> 01:47:03,663
Huh?

1327
01:47:03,735 --> 01:47:07,671
I have really had enough
of your incredible stupidity.

1328
01:47:07,739 --> 01:47:10,367
Aah!

1329
01:47:10,441 --> 01:47:12,432
- Run, everyone!
- You little brat!

1330
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:13,943
Good-bye!

1331
01:47:41,072 --> 01:47:42,164
Blimey! More robots!

1332
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:43,468
Yeah, and there's a lot of them.

1333
01:47:43,541 --> 01:47:46,009
Make a run for it!

1334
01:47:49,581 --> 01:47:52,379
- Check the flapters!
- OK, mom!

1335
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:54,645
They're ready to travel!

1336
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:55,845
LOUIE: Time to go, mama!

1337
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,651
Hush up!
They don't know we're here!

1338
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:09,065
Tarnation.
Now, where are Pazu and Sheeta?

1339
01:48:09,133 --> 01:48:10,566
Can't leave without 'em.

1340
01:48:10,635 --> 01:48:12,000
Oh!

1341
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:15,335
You had better be gracious
to the new king, dear.

1342
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:17,169
Ohh!

1343
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:20,836
You and I will be spending
quite a lot of time together.

1344
01:48:23,214 --> 01:48:25,409
Look at the fools.

1345
01:48:25,483 --> 01:48:28,418
Unbelievably stupid!

1346
01:48:28,486 --> 01:48:30,920
Pathetic.

1347
01:48:30,989 --> 01:48:34,925
They simply don't understand.
It is useless to fight me.

1348
01:48:51,509 --> 01:48:54,637
Aah! Uhh!

1349
01:48:54,712 --> 01:48:56,577
Aah! Ah!

1350
01:48:58,049 --> 01:48:59,573
Huh?

1351
01:49:02,487 --> 01:49:04,114
Robots!

1352
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:09,524
Aah!

1353
01:49:40,525 --> 01:49:42,459
Sheeta!

1354
01:49:46,531 --> 01:49:50,467
MUSKA: A superior being such as
myself has only one option--

1355
01:49:50,535 --> 01:49:52,366
burn them.

1356
01:49:52,437 --> 01:49:55,634
Don't you agree,
Princess Lusheeta?

1357
01:49:59,544 --> 01:50:01,034
MUSKA: Ha ha ha ha ha!

1358
01:50:01,112 --> 01:50:04,604
- You insolent little brat!

1359
01:50:04,682 --> 01:50:05,876
Uhh!

1360
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,385
Seize her!

1361
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:12,753
Ahh.

1362
01:50:16,561 --> 01:50:19,826
Be a good girl
and give the crystal back.

1363
01:50:19,897 --> 01:50:24,163
Please open up! Please!

1364
01:50:24,235 --> 01:50:25,896
Uhh!

1365
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:32,767
Sheeta, listen to me.
Be reasonable.

1366
01:50:32,844 --> 01:50:35,677
There's no way you can escape.

1367
01:50:35,747 --> 01:50:37,374
SHEETA: Please open! Help me!

1368
01:50:46,357 --> 01:50:47,688
Ah!

1369
01:50:56,234 --> 01:50:58,395
Sheeta!

1370
01:51:08,279 --> 01:51:09,371
Aah!

1371
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:14,475
PAZU: Sheeta!

1372
01:51:14,552 --> 01:51:17,851
Pazu? Where are you?

1373
01:51:17,922 --> 01:51:20,618
PAZU:
Sheeta! Over here!

1374
01:51:24,095 --> 01:51:26,222
Sheeta!

1375
01:51:26,297 --> 01:51:28,231
- You're alive!
- Stand back.

1376
01:51:28,299 --> 01:51:30,358
I'm gonna blast through.

1377
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:33,369
- Here we go!
- No, Pazu! Hurry! Take this!

1378
01:51:33,437 --> 01:51:35,667
Muska's coming! Hurry!

1379
01:51:40,077 --> 01:51:42,409
SHEETA: Here, take it!

1380
01:51:45,483 --> 01:51:47,417
Throw it into the ocean!

1381
01:51:47,485 --> 01:51:48,611
Uhh!

1382
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:51,888
Aah!

1383
01:51:51,956 --> 01:51:54,652
Better protect that crystal if
you want to see the girl alive.

1384
01:51:54,725 --> 01:51:56,625
Do you hear me?!

1385
01:52:22,453 --> 01:52:24,284
Aah!

1386
01:52:24,355 --> 01:52:27,813
Get up, princess.
The game is over.

1387
01:52:34,165 --> 01:52:37,566
How appropriate that we've
ended up in the throne room.

1388
01:52:37,635 --> 01:52:39,102
Now get over here.

1389
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:41,035
This is no longer a throne room.

1390
01:52:41,105 --> 01:52:43,596
This is a tomb
for the both of us.

1391
01:52:44,909 --> 01:52:46,877
You see, a king
without compassion...

1392
01:52:46,944 --> 01:52:48,673
does not deserve a kingdom.

1393
01:52:48,746 --> 01:52:50,839
You will never
possess the crystal.

1394
01:52:50,915 --> 01:52:54,646
You and I
will die here together.

1395
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:58,348
Now I understand why
the people of Laputa vanished.

1396
01:52:58,422 --> 01:53:00,686
There is a song from my home
in the Valley of Gondoa...

1397
01:53:00,758 --> 01:53:02,157
that explains everything.

1398
01:53:02,226 --> 01:53:04,990
It says,
"Take root in the ground...

1399
01:53:05,062 --> 01:53:06,893
"live in harmony
with the wind...

1400
01:53:06,964 --> 01:53:08,795
"plant your seeds
in the winter...

1401
01:53:08,866 --> 01:53:11,664
"and rejoice with the birds
in the coming of spring."

1402
01:53:11,736 --> 01:53:13,863
No matter how many weapons
you have...

1403
01:53:13,938 --> 01:53:17,066
no matter how great
your technology might be...

1404
01:53:17,141 --> 01:53:19,473
the world cannot live
without love.

1405
01:53:23,681 --> 01:53:27,117
Laputa will live.
I will return it to life.

1406
01:53:27,184 --> 01:53:30,779
Laputa's power
is the dream of all mankind.

1407
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:34,758
Your ears are next...

1408
01:53:34,825 --> 01:53:37,885
unless you get on your knees
and obey me.

1409
01:53:37,962 --> 01:53:40,430
I command you.
Give me that stone!

1410
01:53:40,498 --> 01:53:43,126
PAZU:
Stop right there, Muska!

1411
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:44,792
I've hidden the stone!

1412
01:53:44,869 --> 01:53:46,268
If you do anything
to harm Sheeta...

1413
01:53:46,337 --> 01:53:47,668
you'll never get it back!

1414
01:53:47,738 --> 01:53:49,399
No, Pazu! Listen!

1415
01:53:49,473 --> 01:53:52,408
Run away before he kills you
as well as me!

1416
01:53:52,476 --> 01:53:53,704
Look who's here.

1417
01:53:53,778 --> 01:53:55,746
Why don't you give me the stone,
and the girl will live.

1418
01:53:55,813 --> 01:53:56,973
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

1419
01:53:57,048 --> 01:53:59,881
Are you planning
on fighting me?

1420
01:53:59,951 --> 01:54:03,409
Go ahead. Use that cannon
you can hardly lift.

1421
01:54:03,487 --> 01:54:06,320
You can have the stone
if you let me talk to Sheeta.

1422
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:09,052
No, Pazu! Get out of here
and throw the crystal away!

1423
01:54:09,126 --> 01:54:12,527
I'll give you one minute,
starting now.

1424
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:31,376
Ohh, Pazu!

1425
01:54:33,951 --> 01:54:37,182
Sheeta,
listen to me very carefully.

1426
01:54:37,254 --> 01:54:39,245
Whisper the spell to me.

1427
01:54:40,992 --> 01:54:42,892
I'll say it with you.

1428
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:45,895
Just put your hand in mine
and trust me.

1429
01:54:55,473 --> 01:54:57,907
Dola and the boys are free.
Don't worry about them.

1430
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:04,713
Time's up. What is your answer?

1431
01:55:12,223 --> 01:55:13,952
Huh?

1432
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:17,620
- Balus.
- Balus.

1433
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:22,594
- Aah!
- Aah!

1434
01:55:22,666 --> 01:55:25,100
Aaah!

1435
01:55:46,257 --> 01:55:49,124
Aah! My eyes!

1436
01:55:49,193 --> 01:55:51,855
I can't see!

1437
01:55:58,169 --> 01:56:01,536
No! No!

1438
01:56:11,215 --> 01:56:13,342
We can't wait anymore, mom!

1439
01:56:13,417 --> 01:56:15,647
All right, then.
Let's shove off!

1440
01:56:16,599 --> 01:56:17,599
Hurry Up!

1441
01:56:28,399 --> 01:56:31,099
Look at that!
The whole thing's collapsing!

1442
01:57:22,299 --> 01:57:23,599
Poor kids, I'll really miss them.

1443
01:57:25,099 --> 01:57:27,099
They used the spell of destruction.

1444
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:30,599
They saved Laputa from
the evil hands of Muska.

1445
01:57:42,299 --> 01:57:44,899
Mother look!
What is that big blue light up there?

1446
01:57:45,799 --> 01:57:47,199
It's a big stone

1447
01:57:53,799 --> 01:57:55,999
That tree is getting away with our treasure.

1448
01:57:56,199 --> 01:58:00,599
Get it! Get it! Move!
Come on you stupid little weirdos!

1449
01:58:32,599 --> 01:58:33,399
Sheeta?

1450
01:58:38,399 --> 01:58:38,899
Pazu!

1451
01:58:44,699 --> 01:58:45,999
Looks like these roots saved us.

1452
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:04,999
It looks fine, it should work.

1453
01:59:05,299 --> 01:59:05,799
Ready?

1454
01:59:05,999 --> 01:59:06,499
Ready!

1455
01:59:07,499 --> 01:59:07,899
Now!

1456
02:00:12,999 --> 02:00:15,099
What's going on here?
It's getting away from us.

1457
02:00:27,399 --> 02:00:31,599
Sheeta! Yeah!

1458
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:36,099
Dola!

1459
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:39,399
Thank goodness you're alive.

1460
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,599
So are you! This is great.

1461
02:00:42,099 --> 02:00:45,599
No it's not!
My poor little ship is gone forever.

1462
02:00:46,499 --> 02:00:49,599
Stop it a-cryin' you big baby!
I'll get you another ship.

1463
02:00:51,299 --> 02:00:55,599
Oh poor little thing,
Nothing worse than having your pigtail shove off.

1464
02:00:56,199 --> 02:00:57,199
What have you got under there?

1465
02:00:57,499 --> 02:01:01,399
Oh my fault,
You must have hurt yourself on these.

1466
02:01:01,899 --> 02:01:04,099
Now how'd they get inside my blouse?

1467
02:01:06,499 --> 02:01:08,499
All good pirates listen to their mom.
