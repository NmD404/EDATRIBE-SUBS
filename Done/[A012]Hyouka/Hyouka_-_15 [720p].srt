1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,208
[HOTARO] I appreciate
the lunch and all, Sis,

2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,958
but I have no idea
what half this stuff is.

3
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,750
Here goes nothing.

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,833
[sniffs]

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,166
[ERU]
We're back!

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,125
Thank you for
holding down the fort.

7
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,291
[HOTARO]
Sure.

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,916
[SATOSHI]
Anyway... we were victorious!

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,333
It did come down
to the wire.

10
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,083
Congrats. I'm happy for you.

11
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,000
In a way, it's your victory too.

12
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,166
There's no chance we could
have won without your help.

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,833
No big deal. Really.

14
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,750
[SATOSHI] You know,
I didn't see that coming.

15
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,416
It was very out of character.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,791
Staging a dramatic rescue?
I wasn't expecting that one,

17
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,166
[HOTARO] I guess I was
caught up in the festival mood.

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,583
It won't happen again.

19
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,250
[SATOSHI chuckles]

20
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,083
[ERU]
Can you do me a favor?

21
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,750
There's something I would really
like you to take a look at.

22
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:58,958
[ERU]
Here it is.

23
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,208
[HOTARO] So, somebody stole a
ladle from the Cooking Club?

24
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,333
[MAYAKA] Yeah... Just the one
from our table, though.

25
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,583
Sounds like someone has
too much time on their hands.

26
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,250
[SATOSHI]
It's not just the Cooking Club.

27
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,208
The same kinda thing's
happened to the Go Club

28
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,333
and the Acapella Club.

29
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,708
[ERU]
And the Fortunetelling Club.

30
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,333
A note was left there, too!

31
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's see...
what did it say again?

32
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,833
[HOTARO] Yeah, somebody's
got way too much time

33
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,958
on their hands.

34
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,500
Think I can
finish my lunch now?

35
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,500
[ERU]
Oreki!

36
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,250
[HOTARO]
Oh, no. Here we go again.

37
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,416
There's no escaping
the unbearable curiosity

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,875
of Eru Chitanda.

39
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,208
[ERU]
Who would do something like this

40
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,791
in the middle of
the cultural festival?

41
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:20,458
Why are they appropriating
Jumonji's name?

42
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,250
Why are they stealing
all these random items?

43
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,750
I just... I have to know!

44
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,041
[HOTARO] We don't have
time for a new mystery.

45
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,208
We need to sell these--

46
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,833
[SATOSHI]
Speaking of the anthologies...

47
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,208
...we need a new plan.

48
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,250
We've been publicizing them
during our other events,

49
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,625
but it doesn't seem
to be doing much good.

50
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,875
[MAYAKA]
That's true.

51
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,083
We need to come up
with something

52
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,083
that's going to grab
more people's attention.

53
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,666
[SATOSHI]
Right! That's my point.

54
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,416
What if we pitch
this phantom thievery

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,958
to the Wall Newspaper Club?

56
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,375
And maybe we can have the school
radio do a report about it too.

57
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,791
With that publicity, people will
be dying to read the anthology.

58
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,916
Makes sense to me.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,208
That could be
exactly what we need!

60
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,291
But what kind of pitch are
you going to give them?

61
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,458
This has nothing to do
with the Classic Lit Club.

62
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,208
I'm glad you asked.

63
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,791
[clears throat]

64
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,041
[SATOSHI] The Classic Lit Club's
master detective, Hotaro Oreki,

65
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,958
will set out to catch
the phantom thief

66
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,500
who is plaguing the festival!

67
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,208
To learn more about
his past exploits,

68
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:20,250
check out the Classic Lit
Club's anthology, <i>Hyouka</i> !

69
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,375
[ERU clapping] Who wouldn't
want one after that?

70
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,500
[MAYAKA]
Yeah, it was okay, I guess.

71
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,750
[SATOSHI]
Right?

72
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,875
We'll unmask Jumonji and
publicize the anthology

73
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,666
--at the same time!
--[HOTARO] Count me out!

74
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,250
What do you think I am, huh?

75
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,291
Some monkey that you can use
to lure in customers? Hmph!

76
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,958
Can't we just give it a try?
Pretty please?

77
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,166
[HOTARO]
Oh, come on.

78
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,500
Even if I did
play along with this,

79
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,625
there are a thousand
students here.

80
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,625
Add in all the visitors, and the
number goes up even higher.

81
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,625
How are we supposed to catch
one thief out of so many people?

82
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,500
Is it that hard? Really?

83
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,916
Impossible.

84
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,208
Maybe if we got
involved some other way.

85
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,416
Like if the thief targeted the
Classic Lit Club or something.

86
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,875
Yeah. Well...

87
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,291
[SATOSHI] We could
stage a robbery!

88
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,750
--[SATOSHI] Kidding!
--[MAYAKA] No way!

89
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,583
[SATOSHI] Really! I swear!
I was just kidding.

90
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,208
[HOTARO]
Speaking of targets...

91
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,166
Which clubs have had
things stolen so far?

92
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,916
Go, acapella, cooking,
and I uh... I forget.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,250
[ERU]
The Fortunetelling Club.

94
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,416
Yeah. Right!

95
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,708
[HOTARO]
The Acapella Club,

96
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,500
the Go Club,
The Fortunetelling Club,

97
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,541
and the Cooking Club?

98
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,625
[SATOSHI gasps]
ABC!

99
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,791
[ERU]
Huh? Huh?

100
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,250
[SATOSHI]
Hello, Suzuki?

101
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,083
It looks like the clubs
that could go with "E"

102
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,791
are the Film Club,
the Gardening Club,

103
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,250
and the SF club.

104
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,791
I'm lost. What's going on?

105
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,500
[HOTARO]
The thefts follow a pattern.

106
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,125
And it's not an especially
complex one, either.

107
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,583
The Acapella Club,
the <i>Igo</i> Club,

108
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,791
the <i>Uranai</i> Club.

109
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,583
Skip a letter to
the <i>Oryori</i> Club,

110
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,916
and if an "E" club
pops up next...

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Japanese alphabetic order!

112
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,625
That would be my guess.

113
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,583
The Gardening Club has been hit.

114
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,708
They stepped out for a second

115
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,750
and one of their
water guns was stolen.

116
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,750
A water gun?

117
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,958
Fire safety for
roasting potatoes.

118
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,500
One of their members came
in here with one yesterday.

119
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,750
Just a second.

120
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,708
In Christie's <i>The ABC Murders</i> ,

121
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,416
a person whose name
starts with an "A"

122
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,875
is killed in a town whose
name starts with "A."

123
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,333
An <i>otama</i> was stolen
from the <i>Oryori</i> Club.

124
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,625
[SATOSHI]
Wait, hold on.

125
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,000
Right.

126
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,125
What did the Fortunetelling
Club lose? Do you know?

127
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,375
Oh... yes!

128
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,750
The Wheel of Fortune.
A Tarot card.

129
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,583
[SATOSHI]
Okay. Take a look.

130
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,583
[HOTARO] The Gardening Club's
water pistol was an AK,

131
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,458
wasn't it?

132
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,416
An AK? What's that?

133
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,000
[HOTARO]
A Russian-made assault rifle.

134
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,083
[MAYAKA] So it's an AK (eikei)
for the <i>Engei</i> Club,

135
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,708
and <i>ishi</i> for the <i>Igo</i> Club?

136
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,500
[SATOSHI] That works.
What about the Acapella Club?

137
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,833
[HOTARO] I think we're missing
the most important thing.

138
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,125
[SATOSHI]
And what's that?

139
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,083
[HOTARO]
Our phantom thief's signature.

140
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,833
Yeah, it says Jumonji.

141
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,375
Does it, though?

142
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,666
Wouldn't the usual
reading be "jumoji"?

143
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,750
[gasp]

144
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,875
[SATOSHI, MAYAKA, ERU]
"Tenth letter"!

145
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,916
[SATOSHI] A-I-U-E-O,
Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko,

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,041
up to the tenth letter!

147
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,416
[ERU]
"Ko!" The <i>Koten</i> Club!

148
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,875
[HOTARO] Otherwise known
as the Classic Lit Club.

149
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,250
I don't know about you,

150
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,125
but I'd say that's probably
enough for a pitch.

151
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,958
[ERU] I need to get to
the Wall Newspaper Club

152
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,458
and tell them about this!

153
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,083
She's pretty excited, huh?

154
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:36,583
[HOTARO]
What's wrong?

155
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,833
Huh?

156
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,666
Oh... I just thought of
something, that's all.

157
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,250
This whole thing...

158
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,583
[SATOSHI] You know,
never mind. I gotta go.

159
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,458
That's weird. What's with him?

160
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,750
[MAYAKA]
Who knows?

161
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,125
[HOTARO] Shouldn't you be
getting back to the Manga Club?

162
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,000
Soon enough.

163
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,125
[HOTARO]
Hmm...

164
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,333
Why? You trying
to get rid of me?

165
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,250
Well, are you?

166
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,500
Cranky today.

167
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,875
[growls] No, I am not!

168
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,250
[ERU]
The trick to negotiating.

169
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,208
First, make it seem like
you expect something

170
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,750
of the other person.

171
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,125
Second, downplay the benefit
that you will receive from it,

172
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,291
and third, ask someone
of the opposite sex,

173
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,333
away from public view.

174
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,458
All right!

175
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,625
[NEWSPAPER BOY A]
On it!

176
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,916
I'll go interview
the Gardening Club!

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,208
[NEWSPAPER BOY B]
Hey! What about Acapella?

178
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,500
I'm calling them right now!

179
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,583
[NEWSPAPER BOY B]
Hurry it up, will you?

180
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,833
[STUDENTS chattering]

181
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,125
I'm sorry. Excuse me!

182
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,166
[STUDENTS chattering]

183
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,583
Sorry about this, Chitanda,

184
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,291
but we're a little
busy right now.

185
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,208
Think you could
drop by another time?

186
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,833
Oh, okay. I'll come back later.

187
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,958
Actually, no!

188
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,250
I need to talk
to you right now!

189
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,750
If it's about your club,
I told you--

190
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,958
We need a special angle--

191
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,583
That's just it.
We do have an angle!

192
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,041
Yeah? What's that?

193
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,666
[NEWSPAPER BOY C]
I know that! Stop rushing me!

194
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,083
[NEWSPAPER BOY B] Never mind,
let's change gears.

195
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,458
What are we doing
about that interview?

196
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,666
Do you think we
could hurry this up?

197
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,166
I'm really--

198
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,666
[TOGAITO]
Whoa! Hey!

199
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,875
Where are we going?

200
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,208
[ERU] The thing is,
there's some stuff going on,

201
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,750
and I really felt like I needed
to tell someone about it.

202
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,500
So... uh...

203
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,791
I came here. I trust you.

204
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,166
Oh... Yeah?

205
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,791
Thanks, I guess...?

206
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,166
But honestly,
there's not much in it

207
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,791
for the Classic Lit Club.

208
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,375
'Kay...

209
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,958
What do you think?
Can you help, Togaito?

210
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,041
Is this something
you can do for me?

211
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,041
Uh... well...

212
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,125
Honestly, I'm a little confused.

213
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,833
[ERU]
Oh, sorry.

214
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,833
[TOGAITO] Anyway, like I said,
we're busy right now.

215
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,583
Come back later after
you've gathered your thoughts.

216
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,500
No...

217
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,625
Please wait!

218
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,625
Somebody at the festival
is stealing things

219
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,291
from various clubs
for no apparent reason!

220
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,666
There! That's the story!

221
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,375
Jumonji!

222
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,541
That's who you mean!

223
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,750
Do you know something?

224
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,666
[ERU]
Huh? Well... uh...

225
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,000
Right, alphabetical order.
I see the pattern.

226
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,500
And you say the Fortunetelling
Club got hit, too.

227
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,083
So that's why, then.

228
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,958
So that's why what?

229
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,625
[TOGAITO] Oh.
We're the Kabe Newspaper Club.

230
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,583
[ERU gasps]
They got you too?

231
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,458
Jumonji took our <i>kata</i> knife.

232
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,875
I guess that explains
why all of you

233
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,708
are running around like crazy.

234
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,833
Yeah.

235
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,083
I don't usually like
being stolen from,

236
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,208
but at least we got a
good story out of it.

237
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,083
I'm impressed.
Your club figured out a lot.

238
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,583
It was mainly Oreki.
You remember him.

239
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,458
Yeah. Sure.

240
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,541
Anyway, thanks for the tip.
Appreciate it!

241
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,000
[ERU]
Please wait, Togaito!

242
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,666
[ERU] I gave you some
helpful information.

243
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,125
I hope you'll write about
the Classic Lit Club now!

244
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,208
You will... right?

245
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,083
[ERU] I kind of lost my cool
toward the end there.

246
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,625
I hope Togatio doesn't think
I was doubting his integrity.

247
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,958
[footsteps]

248
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,166
--[SATOSHI] Excuse me!
--[ERU] Sorry!

249
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,291
Oh, it's you. Well?
Did you have any luck?

250
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,791
Oh... well...

251
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,291
That's a good question.

252
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,708
Sorry, never mind.
It's an inside joke.

253
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,250
Okay.

254
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,625
Well, anyway, I finally heard
back from the Acapella Club.

255
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,458
Looks like it was
apple juice that was taken.

256
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,833
Turns out the Wall Newspaper
Club was targeted, too.

257
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,500
Apparently they had their
cutter knife stolen.

258
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,750
Right. "Ka."

259
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,125
Japanese alphabetical
order for sure.

260
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,500
Next up is the letter "ki,"

261
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,625
which can only be the
<i>Kijutsu</i> , or Magic Club.

262
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,333
Fortunately, it's almost time
for the next performance,

263
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,125
and I think I'm gonna go.

264
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,250
[ERU] You wanna catch
Jumoji in the act?

265
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,500
Yep.

266
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,875
That's a big weakness
for this kind of thief.

267
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,875
He's bound by his own rules,
so he's predictable.

268
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,833
We just have to anticipate
Jumoji's next move,

269
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,166
and the thief will be unmasked.

270
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,666
But if we catch him at "ki,"
then it will all be over.

271
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,166
[SATOSHI] And the culprit
will never have made it

272
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,750
to the Classic Lit Club.

273
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,875
That's all right.

274
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,333
I'm sure we can
figure something out.

275
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,333
[ERU]
Really? Like what, exactly?

276
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,583
Let's talk later, but now
I need to get to the Magic Club.

277
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,583
Gotta catch a thief. See ya!

278
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,875
It's still only 2:00.

279
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,041
[SATOSHI whistling]

280
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,333
[TANI]
Ah, well, look who it is.

281
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,958
Hey. How's it going?

282
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,833
If you're standing around
waiting for the show to start,

283
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,333
that means you must know.

284
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,041
Know what?

285
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,541
Don't play dumb with me!

286
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,708
You know about the
phantom thief Jumoji.

287
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,291
Oh. That...

288
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,083
[TANI chuckles] Good, then this
will be our next competition.

289
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,708
You know about
the Newspaper Club?

290
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,750
The cutter knife, you mean?

291
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,958
Sure, I heard about it.

292
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,458
Yeah.

293
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,375
Obviously, they've taken an
interest in the crime spree.

294
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,625
Jumoji is the
next issue's top story.

295
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,541
What's more, they're
going to run an extra,

296
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:20,083
exclusively covering any group
that catches the phantom thief.

297
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,166
Yeah.

298
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,583
[TANI]
Well, I hate to break it to you,

299
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,625
but I've got
this one in the bag.

300
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,708
Because you know who's
a major mystery fan?

301
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,875
That's right! It's me!

302
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,375
Go easy on me, okay?

303
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,250
[HOTARO]
Ibara.

304
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,916
You're a Christie fan, right?

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,250
So you must have read
<i>The ABC Murders</i> at some point.

306
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,125
[MAYAKA]
Yeah, of course I have.

307
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,875
[HOTARO]
Then can you tell me something?

308
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,791
Was there a reason why
the killings were done

309
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,583
in alphabetical order?

310
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,875
[MAYAKA]
Spoiler alert! Are you sure?

311
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,250
[HOTARO]
Go ahead.

312
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,541
[MAYAKA] "He wanted to kill
in alphabetical order,

313
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,708
so that's what he did."

314
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,375
Not exactly much of
a motivation, is it?

315
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,875
No.

316
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,500
Do you think the same
thing is going on here?

317
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,916
I don't know.

318
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,708
Anybody would have
figured out the pattern

319
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,791
the thefts were
following eventually.

320
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,000
Surely Jumoji would
have realized that.

321
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,250
[MAYAKA]
So why do it that way, then?

322
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,625
Right, that's what
I'm wondering.

323
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,583
Is there some kind of
hidden purpose or meaning

324
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,916
behind the way in which
things are being stolen?

325
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,208
Still, it is possible
Jumoji's doing it just for fun.

326
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,500
[MAYAKA]
Hmm... Interesting.

327
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,791
You really want to catch
the thief now, don't you?

328
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,041
You think so? Why's that?

329
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,291
You're pretty intent.

330
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,375
I don't care
one way or another.

331
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,666
But once Chitanda says she's
curious about something,

332
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,041
it becomes an issue
that can't be avoided.

333
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,875
Why don't you just ignore her?

334
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,708
She's not someone
I can easily ignore,

335
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,583
or trust me, I would.

336
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,958
[MAYAKA giggles]
Right, I get it.

337
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,125
Okay, then.

338
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,416
You're leaving?

339
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,625
Yep.

340
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, and by the way,
thank you for the flour.

341
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,416
It was a big help.

342
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,041
Oh! I almost forgot.

343
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,166
Really? You're charging me?

344
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,791
No, it's not like that.

345
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,625
It's the Warashibe Protocol.

346
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,708
I need you to give me something
in return for the flour.

347
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,583
You do?

348
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,958
Like in the old folk tale.

349
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,500
The guy starts with
a piece of straw

350
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,833
and trades till he gets rich.

351
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,166
Oh, yeah, okay.

352
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,541
Let's see...

353
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,708
[MAYAKA]
You can have this.

354
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,833
Are you sure?

355
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,333
Yep.

356
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:26,625
Really? Can you
cosplay without i--Ah!

357
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,083
[MAYAKA]
Don't call it that, you idiot!

358
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,625
The show will be starting soon.

359
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,625
Please take your
seats, everybody.

360
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,666
[SATOSHI]
Irisu! Over here.

361
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,791
[IRISU]
Oh. Hello.

362
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,166
[SATOSHI]
I can't wait for the show. You?

363
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,416
I'm not sure how much
I like magic, but here I am.

364
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,125
Yeah. It's something
to do, right?

365
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,333
[SATOSHI]
Could she be...?

366
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,125
[chuckles]
That's crazy.

367
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,541
[YUASA]
I mean, come on.

368
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,958
He didn't have to
say it like that...

369
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,583
[SATOSHI] That's the
Manga Club president.

370
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,166
I saw her at
their booth yesterday.

371
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,041
[GIRL 15A]
Well, this should be fun.

372
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,666
Oh... Hey, look!

373
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,333
[GIRL 15B gasps]

374
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,083
[SATOSHI]
Tanabe just walked in.

375
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,666
And look at that!

376
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,208
He's with the Student Council
President, Muneyoshi Kugayama.

377
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,958
[KUGAYAMA]
Hey, Empress.

378
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:33,583
[TANABE]
Hello.

379
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,666
[IRISU]
Hi.

380
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,333
[TANABE]
Hey, Fukube.

381
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,416
[SATOSHI]
Hi!

382
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,041
Thank you for your patience!

383
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,708
The Magic Club's
performance will now begin.

384
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,791
We're glad to see
so many friendly faces

385
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,458
in the audience this afternoon.

386
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,291
We hope you'll enjoy the show
that we've put together for you

387
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,250
and the tricks we've worked
long and hard to master!

388
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,041
[AUDIENCE clapping]

389
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,291
[SATOSHI]
Now, then...

390
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,958
With this many people
watching the show,

391
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:05,666
how will you commit your crime,
phantom thief Jumoji?

392
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,666
[TAYAMA] Yoichi Takamura
will perform "Living Dead."

393
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,791
[TAYAMA]
What's wrong?

394
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,000
[NAGAI]
Well...

395
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,791
[SATOSHI gasps]
Candle!

396
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,625
[SATOSHI]
Sorry. Don't mind me.

397
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,750
Damn!

398
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,750
[SATOSHI]
When...?

399
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,291
I was watching, and nobody
but the performers

400
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,416
went near the stage.

401
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,250
Which means... it was
taken before they started.

402
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,833
[SATOSHI] Ugh. Coming here
was a waste of time!

403
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,750
What made me so sure
he would steal something

404
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,583
during the performance, anyway?

405
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:47,208
I'm an idiot!

406
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,291
[CROWD clapping]

407
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,875
[MAYAKA, KIMURA] Thanks a lot!
Have a good day!

408
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,875
We're selling more
than yesterday, right?

409
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, we are.

410
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,875
I guess the posters are helping.

411
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:58,708
That's great!

412
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,833
[GIRLS giggling]

413
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,958
Obviously, we should have
just done what Kochi said

414
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,458
from the very beginning.

415
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,625
Yeah.

416
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,000
If a certain someone
hadn't thrown a fit,

417
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,583
I bet we could have sold
a bunch more yesterday.

418
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,916
Careful, now.

419
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,083
We don't want to hurt
anyone's feelings, do we?

420
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,708
Try to ignore them.

421
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,041
Yeah.

422
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,666
And after all that,
she couldn't find the thing?

423
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,125
A total lie, right?

424
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm sure she just got
scared that the manga

425
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,833
she was going on about was
actually nothing special.

426
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,416
How pathetic! Bringing up
some amateur title

427
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,125
just to make
yourself look smart.

428
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,500
[GIRLS giggling]

429
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,208
[ITZUKA]
Yeah, totally!

430
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,291
[HENMI] How much you want to bet
that manga doesn't even exist?

431
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,875
--[MAYAKA] Hey, hold on--
--[KOCHI] Stop! That's enough.

432
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,583
If you've never heard of it,
you can keep quiet.

433
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,000
Hi, everyone.

434
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,666
I-I was just saying--

435
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,500
[KOCHI]
Well now I'm saying.

436
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,208
[KOCHI]
If you don't know anything,

437
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,083
you should just keep
your mouth shut.

438
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,791
So anyway...

439
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,375
How was the Magic Club show?

440
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,000
Good. I really enjoyed it.

441
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,333
[KIMURA]
Yeah?

442
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,458
Maybe I could go and check
it out tomorrow, then.

443
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,541
[YUASA]
Okay. That should be fine.

444
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,375
[KIMURA]
What time does it start?

445
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,375
[YUASA] They do performances
throughout the day,

446
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,333
so I'm sure you can
make it to one of them.

447
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,333
Really? Thanks a lo--

448
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,583
Sorry. Think I can take a break?

449
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,083
[KIMURA]
Sure. No problem.

450
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,083
Hey!

451
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,125
I really am pathetic.

452
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,791
I just want someone
to tell me it'll be okay.

453
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,458
[YUASA]
Ibara?

454
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,708
Uh... Yes!

455
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,250
What's up, Yuasa?

456
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,625
I'm really sorry.

457
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,583
Things have gotten
pretty awkward, huh?

458
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't know why
you're apologizing.

459
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,083
For not saying
anything sooner.

460
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,791
I should have taken your
side before, and I didn't.

461
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,916
Except, if you had
stood up for me yesterday,

462
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,791
there probably would've been
friction between you and Kochi,

463
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,916
and I wouldn't
want that to happen.

464
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,166
I think it's better this way.

465
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,375
It's all bluster.

466
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,291
Ayako doesn't mean it.

467
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,041
Ayako?

468
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,791
Ayako Kochi.
That's her full name.

469
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,833
Oh.

470
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,333
She seemed pretty serious,

471
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,416
so what makes you
think she didn't mean it?

472
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,916
Because I know her.
She and I are friends.

473
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,541
Is that it?

474
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,416
There's also the fact that
she and Haruna were friends.

475
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,916
Sorry. Who's Haruna?

476
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,791
Haruna Anjo. Don't you know?

477
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,750
She's one of the authors
of <i>A Corpse by Evening</i> .

478
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,750
It was a collaborative work?

479
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,083
[YUASA] Somebody else
did the art for it.

480
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,625
Ayako would probably
know who it was.

481
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,208
Can I talk to Haruna?
What class is she in?

482
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,708
Well, she doesn't
go here anymore.

483
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,708
She transferred schools.

484
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,041
Really? Too bad.

485
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,333
But even if they
were good friends,

486
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,625
what does that matter?

487
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,541
Friends don't
agree on everything.

488
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,333
Maybe this was something
they disagreed about.

489
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,666
Yes, that's a
good point, but sorry.

490
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,958
I really shouldn't say any more
than I've already told you.

491
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,250
I mean...
Ayako is my friend, after all.

492
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,125
And explaining why
you think what you do

493
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,166
would mean speaking
badly of her?

494
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,000
I think I need a
little more time alone.

495
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,416
Are you sure?

496
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,583
[MAYAKA] It's okay.
I won't be much longer.

497
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,458
[NEWSPAPER BOY C]
Extra! Extra!

498
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,208
It's a must-read, kids!

499
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,416
[ERU]
He did come through!

500
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,625
[SATOSHI]
Bad news. I've been had!

501
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,458
There was a candle stolen
from the Magic Club earlier.

502
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,875
They even found the
standard confession note.

503
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,416
Isn't that good news, though?

504
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,125
We don't want the thief
caught before he hits

505
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,875
the Classic Lit Club, right?

506
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,208
Yeah. I know that's
what we decided.

507
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,625
But I thought maybe I
could catch him red-handed.

508
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,041
You hoped the theft would
happen during the performance?

509
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,458
[SATOSHI]
Yeah.

510
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,208
[HOTARO] Jumoji doesn't really
seem to want an audience

511
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,458
for the thefts.

512
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,833
I mean, the Cooking Club's
ladle disappeared

513
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,708
before the contest, right?

514
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,583
If you realized that,
then why not say something?

515
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,750
It's not like you told me you
were going to the Magic Club

516
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,583
to catch him in the act.

517
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,625
Yeah. I guess that's true.

518
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,500
[ERU]
Hey, guys, I'm back!

519
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,833
And I'm happy to report that
the 20 volumes of <i>Hyouka</i>

520
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,708
we left with Irisu are
selling at a good pace!

521
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,416
[HOTARO] Irisu could sell
a glass of water

522
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,750
to a drowning man.

523
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,500
[ERU]
There's one other thing, too.

524
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,625
In their 4:00 edition,
the Wall Newspaper Club

525
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,458
has included an article
that covers the Jumoji case.

526
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,750
It also mentions the
alphabetical order pattern

527
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,625
of the crimes.

528
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,000
Cool.

529
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,000
[ERU] The best part is that
we're in the story, too.

530
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,666
It says that the final
item will be taken

531
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,750
from either the Industrial Arts
Club or the Classic Lit Club.

532
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,250
An IA club?
We have one of those?

533
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,333
Yeah, we do. Guess I forgot.

534
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:25,541
If they get hit, then our whole
plan goes up in smoke, huh?

535
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,958
I'm thinking about making a deal

536
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,000
with the Broadcasting
Club tomorrow.

537
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,833
If we can get them
to give us some airtime,

538
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,666
that would be great publicity.

539
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,791
What? Is something wrong?

540
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,958
Well... It's just...

541
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,791
--You look... tired.
--[MAYAKA] Man, am I tired.

542
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,541
[SATOSHI]
Oh. Mayaka.

543
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,958
So how were our sales today?

544
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,666
Not counting the ones
we gave Irisu,

545
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,666
we managed to sell 16.

546
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,166
Not that bad.

547
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,291
I guess so. Yeah.

548
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,750
It could be worse.

549
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,458
As president,
it's my job to go around

550
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,208
recruiting people to
help us sell the anthology.

551
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,750
But honestly...
I'm getting worn out.

552
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,416
[MAYAKA]
<i>Body Talk</i> .

553
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,208
There's no denying it's a step
below <i>A Corpse by Evening</i> .

554
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,333
But still, it's pretty good.

555
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:42,791
[MAYAKA] Ugh. My stuff is
a hundred steps below.

556
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,416
[SATOSHI]
Hotaro's changed.

557
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,250
No, more like he's finally
showing his true potential.

558
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,666
And it's all because
he met Chitanda.

559
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,166
She's brought an element of
unpredictability into his life

560
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,000
that's forcing him to grow.

561
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,083
I should be happy for him.

562
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,958
And I am, really.

563
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,625
It's just sometimes I wish...

564
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,041
There are over a
thousand suspects.

565
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,833
There's no way that
simple deduction

566
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:10,875
is going to be able to
whittle down a list that long.

567
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,958
Which means that our best
shot at solving this mystery

568
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,458
is catching the
thief in the act.

569
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:20,083
I don't know if Hotaro will
be able to solve this one,

570
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,291
but I think I can.

571
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:27,458
Hotaro. I'm going to catch
Jumoji, just you watch.

572
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,708
They do mail order too?

573
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,583
[SATOSHI]
Next time: "The Final Target."
