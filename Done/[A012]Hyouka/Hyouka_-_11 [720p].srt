1
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,500
It was clever to
have the camera man

2
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,041
be the seventh character.

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,708
And I thought the
scene where the other six

4
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,500
looked into the camera
at the same time

5
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,833
had a lot of impact.

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,458
But still...

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,791
The rope didn't figure into your
new conclusion in any way!

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,083
[HOTARO]
Well, yeah, but...

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,875
What makes you think the rope
was even part of the setup?

10
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:32,750
[MAYAKA]
It had to be!

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,125
Hongo insisted they find a rope

12
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,791
that could hold a
person's full weight!

13
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,666
Why would she do that if it
wasn't a part of her plan?

14
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,875
I'm sorry, I guess I could
be mistaken about that part.

15
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,500
Anyway, I thought
your idea turned out

16
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,041
to be really entertaining,

17
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,083
and the end caught everyone
totally by surprise.

18
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,250
I just thought it didn't fit
with the rest of the film,

19
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,291
if you want my honest opinion.

20
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,458
Yeah.

21
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,750
Well, I'd better get
going to Manga Club.

22
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,458
See you tomorrow, Oreki.

23
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,125
[HOTARO] How could I have
forgotten about the rope?


24
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,750
Did I ignore it?
Not intentionally.

25
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:48,083
Did I twist the narrative
to make it fit Kaito better?

26
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,958
[SATOSHI]
Hotaro!

27
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,583
Hotaro! Hey, wait up!

28
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,791
Hotaro!

29
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:54,958
[HOTARO gasps]

30
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,666
Whoa, are you okay?

31
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,166
Yeah, it's nothing.
What's going on?

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,958
Oh, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

33
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,000
Where's Mayaka?

34
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,000
[HOTARO]
She had to go to Manga Club.

35
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,916
[SATOSHI] Good, I'm
actually glad it's just us.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,791
Did Chitanda have to leave, too?

37
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,875
Yeah, she did.

38
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,166
Why? Do you not
want them to overhear

39
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,916
what you need to
discuss with me?

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,458
It's nothing major,

41
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,833
but I would prefer to talk
about it with you in private.

42
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,291
Right. So what's up?

43
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,958
It's about the film's ending.

44
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,208
Was the plot twist
part of Hongo's plan?

45
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,583
Or did you come up with
all of that on your own?

46
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,416
It was Hongo's idea.

47
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,333
Okay.

48
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,625
I would be lying to you
if I said I believed

49
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,500
the ending was Hongo's idea.

50
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,708
I don't know what
she intended to write,

51
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,541
but I am positive
that wasn't it.

52
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,833
Are you basing that
on something specific?

53
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,583
Yeah.

54
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,625
How could I have
missed an inconsistency

55
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,958
so glaring that two people
picked up on it?

56
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,583
[SATOSHI]
There's no inconsistency.

57
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,708
I really thought
it was fantastic.

58
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,583
But it wasn't keeping
in line with the story

59
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,083
she wanted to tell.

60
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,458
Meaning what?

61
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,500
Have you ever heard of
the term "narrative trick"?

62
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,041
Isn't that a way of
fooling the reader

63
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,375
with clever storytelling?

64
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,875
[SATOSHI]
That's right.

65
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,750
The surprise twist of the
murderer being the camera man

66
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,125
in this film is a
perfect example.

67
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,458
[HOTARO]
Yeah, I guess that's true.

68
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,583
Do you remember our
conversation about the books

69
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,708
Hongo used to study
the mystery genre

70
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,000
in preparation for
writing this script?

71
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,458
<i>Sherlock Holmes</i> , right?

72
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,583
Exactly, she didn't
read anything other

73
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,958
than <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> .

74
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,666
That's telling, and here's why.

75
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,458
Doyle didn't use
narrative tricks

76
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,166
in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> novels.

77
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,333
[HOTARO gasps]

78
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,875
[SATOSHI]
Except for a handful of cases,

79
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,291
narrative tricks weren't in use
until Agatha Christie's era,

80
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,958
which wasn't until the
mid-1920s at the earliest.

81
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,083
Now, I don't know Hongo at all.

82
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,041
But I find it hard to
believe she'd be on par

83
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,041
with Agatha Christie!

84
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,041
Personally, the movie turned
out to be right up my alley.

85
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,041
And if it was all your idea,
I promise not to say anything!

86
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,625
But if you're trying to
pass it off as Hongo's work,

87
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,458
I have to tell you
that you're wrong.

88
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,541
Hold on a second!

89
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,916
We don't have some
comprehensive list

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,208
of everything she's read!

91
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,833
Maybe she learned to
use narrative tricks

92
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,041
by reading about them
in some other book!

93
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,416
Hell, maybe she even
saw one used in a movie!

94
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
[SATOSHI]
Hotaro!

95
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,875
Is that what you
actually believe?

96
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,875
If it is, and you feel
like you made the right call,

97
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,500
then I'll let this go.

98
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,125
That's all I wanted
to talk to you about.

99
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,250
I gotta go. I'll see you around.

100
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,833
Hey, what's wrong?

101
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,125
I thought you would've
already gone home by now.

102
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,291
[ERU]
Listen, Oreki.

103
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,958
There's something I
wanted to talk to you about.

104
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,041
Oh, great. You, too?

105
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,916
[HOTARO] This is about
Class 2-F's movie, isn't it?

106
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,333
[ERU]
Yes.

107
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,708
[HOTARO]
So you didn't like it?

108
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,583
[ERU]
No, it's not that at all.

109
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,916
[HOTARO]
You can be honest.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,458
Satoshi and Ibara already
talked to me about it.

111
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,375
They said they knew it
wasn't what Hongo intended.

112
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,708
And, well...

113
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,375
I'm beginning to think
you guys are right.

114
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,541
I don't think it
was what she wanted.

115
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,250
[HOTARO sighs]

116
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,250
And what makes you
say that, specifically?

117
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,125
It's still pretty early, huh?

118
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,333
Do you wanna take a walk
with me down by the river?

119
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,125
So, Oreki, do you
know what it was

120
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,041
that made me so curious
about all of this

121
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,333
in the first place?

122
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,041
How I was gonna tie up
all the loose ends

123
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,583
and wrap the movie, right?

124
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,333
That's why you came to watch it.

125
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,625
No, I didn't really
have any interest

126
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,250
in how the movie
was going to end,

127
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,833
to be perfectly honest.

128
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,000
That's why I told you that
the idea you came up with

129
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,583
was such a brilliant one.

130
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,041
Then what were you
so curious about?

131
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,625
Well...

132
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,958
I was actually more interested
in Hongo as a person, you know?

133
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,333
I thought the
whole script thing

134
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,166
was really bizarre
from the beginning.

135
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,083
Why didn't Irisu talk to someone
who was close to Hongo?

136
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,625
Eba knows Hongo really well,

137
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,416
so she could have
helped Irisu figure out

138
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,333
how Hongo wanted
the movie to end.

139
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,375
And it would have
been a lot easier.

140
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,083
And Hongo still would
have been able to rest,

141
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,208
you mean?

142
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,583
[HOTARO] If you've got something
in mind, you should say it.

143
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,458
I think Hongo had a
clear vision of her script

144
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,833
from the beginning,
right up to the very end.

145
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,958
Even if she had gotten sick
in the middle of things,

146
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,666
they could have
asked her about it.

147
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,125
And if she was too
frail to handle that,

148
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,666
I would think Eba would have
gotten so mad at the class

149
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,666
she wouldn't have participated.

150
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,791
She would have been furious!

151
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,500
And she probably
wouldn't have escorted us

152
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,500
to the detectives.

153
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,708
You're right.

154
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,875
Did Hongo really not tell
anyone else in the class

155
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,958
how the rest of
her film played out?

156
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,000
Are you implying
that Hongo still wanted

157
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,250
to write the rest
of the script herself?

158
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,958
No. from the way
Eba described her,

159
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,166
I get the impression Hongo's
too meek to insist on it.

160
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,125
I don't think that kind
of girl would have the gall

161
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,833
to keep her
classmates waiting around.

162
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,291
Well...

163
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,625
Maybe she didn't have
confidence in her conclusion.

164
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,875
That's an option
I've considered, as well.

165
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,375
But the other kids in the
class seem like nice people.

166
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,625
I don't think they would be
disrespectful of her idea,

167
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,125
or insult her or anything.

168
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,708
[HOTARO]
Nice people, huh?

169
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,208
If the ending you wrote is
the one she came up with,

170
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,166
I'm sure she would have
had enough confidence in it

171
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,666
to share it with the others.

172
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,625
It was that great of an idea.

173
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,666
But I don't think she came up
with something that good,

174
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,166
so she kept quiet.

175
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,416
And if all that's true,
what was it that pushed her

176
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
to the point of
not finishing it?

177
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,125
That's what I have to find out!

178
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,666
I believe that
all of her regrets,

179
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,750
how she really felt about
not being able to finish

180
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,250
what she started,

181
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,541
all those screams of frustration
were hidden in the script!

182
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,458
The version that we
ended up with didn't have

183
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,250
any of her real
feelings left in it.

184
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,625
So if it seems to you like
I didn't enjoy the movie,

185
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,083
well, that's the
only reason why.

186
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,583
[HOTARO] While I was
busy trying to figure out

187
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,375
the puzzle of the film,

188
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,000
Chitanda was actually
concerned about Hongo.

189
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,250
What does that say about me?

190
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,208
I saw the script
as a literary problem,

191
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,750
and forgot about the
human side of things.

192
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,000
The theatre setting.

193
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,291
The cast of characters.

194
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,958
The gruesome murder.

195
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,083
The setup.

196
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:34,208
The killer....
lurks among you all undetected!

197
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,541
[AUDIENCE claps, cheers]

198
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,166
[HOTARO] I never even
considered that Hongo

199
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,791
could have written her
feelings into the script

200
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,666
as some hidden code.

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,375
[HOTARO]
Pathetic. Some detective I am.

202
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,250
I'm not saying that you did
anything wrong at all, Oreki.

203
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,416
The last scene was really
quite a shock to everyone!

204
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,166
It may not have been what
Hongo originally intended,

205
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,750
but at the end of the day
it was a great ending.

206
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:07,041
[HOTARO] I wasn't asked to come
onboard as a screenwriter.

207
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,708
[HOTARO] I did a great job
if my assignment was

208
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,625
to screw things up.

209
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,791
But where did I go wrong?

210
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,583
[HOTARO] I can't wrap
my brain around it.

211
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,625
No lucky flashes of insight.

212
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,250
Who cares, anyway?

213
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,791
They already wrapped the film.

214
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,416
No matter how hard
I think about it,

215
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,166
it won't change anything.

216
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,333
Dwelling on it now is
just a waste of time

217
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,041
and precious energy.

218
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,583
[HOTARO]
Dammit!

219
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,375
[grunts]

220
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,750
[HOTARO] Maybe I'll read a book
to take my mind off of it.

221
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,083
[HOTARO]
A Tarot book?

222
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,125
I didn't know Sis
was into this stuff.

223
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,416
[HOTARO]
Let's see.

224
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,791
"The Empress.

225
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,208
Maternal affection,
a fertile mind, sensitivity."

226
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,833
From what I've seen, that
doesn't seem like Irisu at all.

227
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,375
So Ibara was "Justice."

228
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,125
"Equality, righteousness,
fairness."

229
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,541
Yep, that's not too far off.

230
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,833
Satoshi was "The Magician."

231
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,583
"Initiative, originality,"
and "interest," huh?

232
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,416
Interesting, indeed.

233
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,625
And Chitanda was "The Fool."

234
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,500
"Curiosity, impulse to action."

235
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,041
Sounds about right.

236
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,041
Okay, my turn.

237
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,208
"Inner fortitude,
fighting spirit, bonds?"

238
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,166
What the heck? That doesn't
sound like me at all!

239
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,166
Why would Satoshi
pick this for me?

240
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,208
"Strength is represented by
a picture of a ferocious lion

241
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,458
being controlled
by a kind woman."

242
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,791
What?

243
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,125
No way, I am not controlled
by women in any way!

244
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:08,125
Not my sister, Chitanda, Irisu,
or any of the rest of 'em.

245
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,250
Psh.

246
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,875
[HOTARO]
I dunno, maybe I am "Strength."

247
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,041
It's pretty fascinating.

248
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,416
Is he using the Tarot to hint
at some kind of judgment

249
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,625
he has of me?

250
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,625
That would be just like Satoshi.

251
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,000
It's not like he could
change my point of view.

252
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Change my point of view?

253
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,000
Hey, there.

254
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,583
It's been a while, hasn't it?

255
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,041
[HOTARO]
Yeah, hi.

256
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,500
The class film turned out
quite well, don't you think?

257
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,833
We couldn't have done
it without you, so thanks.

258
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,791
Listen, there's a launch
party this Saturday.

259
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,791
Do you think you can come?
We'd all love to see you there.

260
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,541
I'm not coming.

261
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,125
Irisu, look.

262
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,083
I'd like to discuss something.

263
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,791
[WAITRESS 10A] One Yunnan
tea for the gentleman.

264
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,666
One green tea for the lady.

265
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,958
Please enjoy!

266
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,458
So what did you
want to discuss?

267
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,375
Do you remember the
last time we were here,

268
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,750
when you said that I was
gifted, a "true genius?"

269
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,208
Of course I do.

270
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,000
Just what did
you mean by that?

271
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,375
It's ironic that you don't know.
I was talking about--

272
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,125
You're lying to me!

273
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,416
I wasn't your detective.
I was your mystery writer.

274
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,333
Wasn't that your plan all along?

275
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,375
What gave my plot away?

276
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,541
Sherlock Holmes did.

277
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,166
Do you care if I spoil some
of his stories for you?

278
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,666
No, I don't mind at all.

279
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,500
I found some notes
tucked into the novels

280
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,291
that Hongo read to prepare.

281
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,083
I copied a few of
them down for you.

282
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,666
At first glance,

283
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,791
I assumed she had just
written them down as ideas

284
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,375
she might use in her script.

285
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,833
But unfortunately,
I was mistaken.

286
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,208
From what Satoshi told me,

287
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,041
"The Red-Haired League"
and "The Three Garridebs"

288
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,125
have pretty much
the same plot line.

289
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,625
So why did she mark, "The Red-
Haired League" with a triangle,

290
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,041
but "The Three Garridebs"
with a double-circle?

291
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,458
I talked it over with Satoshi,

292
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,375
and I realized that the
stories with double circles

293
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,708
are the ones in which
the characters survive.

294
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,000
In the ones marked
with an "X," they die.

295
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,916
Here's my hypothesis.

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,750
Hongo wasn't thinking about the
plotlines when she marked them.

297
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,708
She preferred happy endings
to tragedies. That's all.

298
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,875
She just couldn't stomach
it when people died.

299
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,500
Once I thought of it
in those terms,

300
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,708
several puzzles suddenly
made sense to me.

301
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,666
First, the small amount
of blood used.

302
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,625
Second, the unexpected
outcome of the questionnaire.

303
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,375
What are you talking about?

304
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,583
[IRISU] How were you able
to get your hands on this?

305
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,916
[HOTARO] All I had to do
was ask if I could borrow it.

306
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,083
So, as far as the
answers are concerned,

307
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,041
staging a hundred murders in
the film would be impossible.

308
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,250
'Cause there are only
about 30 kids in the class.

309
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,333
But some joker
still voted for it.

310
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,416
So what about this
other single vote, here?

311
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,125
A lone vote for having
zero murders in the film.

312
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,833
And that was how Hongo
cast her vote, wasn't it?

313
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,333
She didn't want
anyone to have to die

314
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,791
in the script she wrote at all.

315
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,250
Quite impressive.

316
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,750
However...

317
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,791
Her impulsive classmates decided
to improvise the violence.

318
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,750
I heard that Hongo didn't
even come to the shoot.

319
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,000
The strangest part is
that the script never says

320
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,958
that Kaito dies from his injury.

321
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,375
But in the film he does.

322
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,708
Yes, that's correct.

323
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,916
And that arm was
remarkably well-made.

324
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,583
[HOTARO]
Ibara mentioned that, too.

325
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:48,500
But Kaito died, any way you
slice it, no pun intended.

326
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,500
[HOTARO] From here out,
my statements are conjecture.

327
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,000
I have no hard evidence.

328
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,875
Regardless, I have no
choice but to say this to you:

329
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,166
Hongo didn't have the nerve
to stand up for her script

330
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,833
and demand the class
reshoot without the changes.

331
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,916
She was much too timid
to speak up that way.

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,458
I think she had some guilt about
ignoring the death toll tally

333
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,500
from the questionnaire.

334
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,458
But you decided to take
matters into your own hands.

335
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,458
The way things were going, Hongo
was becoming the class villain.

336
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,625
You set her up to come
down with an illness

337
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,416
and leave her script unfinished.

338
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,083
Then you rallied her
classmates together

339
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,583
and held a meeting
of collective deduction.

340
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,125
But in reality it was just
a scriptwriting contest.

341
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,458
Once you realized they couldn't
write to your standards,

342
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,208
you dragged us into it, too.

343
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,708
It's pathetic.

344
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,458
No one caught on to the
fact that they were doing

345
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,541
your dirty work, not even me!

346
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,791
That's because you had
manipulated our point of view.

347
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,208
Then, you replaced
her script with my work,

348
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,875
and she couldn't claim
that you hurt her.

349
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,625
She couldn't substantially
prove you did anything wrong!

350
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,291
Isn't that right?

351
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,625
I don't dispute any
of these accusations.

352
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,041
[HOTARO] You said something
else to me before...

353
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,291
That when people have talent
and can't recognize it,

354
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,041
they unknowingly hurt
those who don't have any.

355
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,750
That was just a tactic.

356
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,583
You don't truly care about
the feelings of people

357
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,333
who don't have
natural abilities.

358
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,666
All that really matters
to you is the bottom line.

359
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,166
Am I mistaken?

360
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,291
Is there something
wrong with that?

361
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,250
Fine, then!

362
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,625
When you told me I was special,

363
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,041
was that just so you
could manipulate me, too?!

364
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,541
When you said it's
right to acknowledge

365
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,916
who you really are,
you were thinking

366
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,041
of your own selfish interests!

367
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,750
Well, I was not being
completely sincere.

368
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,500
And if you choose to
call it an outright lie,

369
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,083
that's your choice.

370
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,250
[HOTARO] I'm not sure why,
but that's a relief.

371
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,750
What's wrong?

372
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,958
Nothing.

373
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,666
You just have to know
what kind of script

374
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,583
Hongo actually
intended to write.

375
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,791
Is that what's twirling around
inside your head over there?

376
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,958
Huh? No, it's not that at all.

377
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,375
So what, then?
This isn't like you, y'know.

378
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,000
No, it's not like me.
You're right.

379
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,375
But I gotta say...

380
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,958
You're not acting quite like
yourself, either, Oreki.

381
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,125
[HOTARO]
Not like myself?

382
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,416
What's that mean?

383
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,708
Well, why don't I
just ask, like usual?

384
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,875
I'm curious.

385
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,458
What kind of script
did Hongo originally

386
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,875
dream up for the class film?

387
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,333
Please tell me.
I have to know, Oreki!

388
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,916
Ugh, your guess
is as good as mine.

389
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,333
Knowing Kaito's supposed to live
solves the locked-room problem.

390
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,541
Konosu is the real attacker,
and the entry point

391
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,666
was the window.

392
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,250
Huh? But I thought the window--

393
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,666
[HOTARO] I mean the window in
the stage right sitting room.

394
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,041
There are two, but it
doesn't matter which.

395
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,666
Konosu snuck in using
the rope Hongo asked for,

396
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,416
chased Kaito, and sliced him up.

397
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,416
Just one strike, though,
not enough to kill him.

398
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,291
Then she climbed back up
to the second floor,

399
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,833
using the same rope,

400
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,291
and met up with the rest of
the cast, looking nonchalant.

401
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,708
And that's that.

402
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,458
Ah, that must be why Hongo
wished Konosu luck, then.

403
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,041
It makes more sense now.

404
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,541
But wait...

405
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,833
What about the seventh character
Hongo was trying to cast?

406
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,583
[HOTARO] Yeah, they
turned up in the film,

407
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,000
even in the unfinished version.

408
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,541
[ERU]
They did?

409
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,250
Only the original six showed
up in the version that I saw.

410
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,875
[HOTARO] The cast didn't just
consist of the people onscreen.

411
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,041
There was a narrator, too.

412
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,875
Oh, right, I remember!

413
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,166
So why was the door
to the room the other six

414
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,958
found Kaito in locked, then?

415
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,458
Kaito went into the stage
left wing by himself,

416
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,708
and locked the door behind him.

417
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,208
[ERU]
Why would he do that?

418
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,458
Normally, I'd say "to stop
the murderer from getting him,"

419
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,791
but I don't think
that's the case here.

420
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,791
[ERU gasps]

421
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,125
What is it?

422
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,416
Oh, I just had the
realization that I understand

423
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,333
Hongo's intentions
a little bit better now.

424
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,000
Interesting.

425
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,083
[ERU] I bet that after
Konosu cuts Kaito,

426
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,416
she stays around for a minute,

427
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,291
and Kaito asks her
why she stabbed him,

428
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,833
because he's baffled by it.

429
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,916
Then, to cover for her,
for whatever reason,

430
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,666
he sends her back upstairs,

431
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,583
makes his way to
the stage left wing,

432
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,625
and collapses to the ground.

433
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,750
But then, how would
he explain away

434
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,166
the fact that he's
been cut that badly?

435
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,416
The injury could be
accounted for pretty easily,

436
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,041
because of the glass that
was all over the floor

437
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,083
in the room.

438
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,166
Oh, right, that
makes perfect sense!

439
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,416
[HOTARO]
He could just say that he fell

440
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,541
on a piece of the broken
glass and cut himself.

441
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,875
So that's how she
wanted the story to go?

442
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,125
Yeah, but we still don't know

443
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,375
why Konosu stabbed
Kaito in the first place,

444
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,541
or what made him decide
to forgive her, either.

445
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:10,083
Unless Hongo talks,
we might never find out.

446
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,625
I guess we'll leave it at that,

447
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,833
but why would anyone want to
stab one of their classmates,

448
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,166
and why would the
one who was stabbed

449
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,083
let their attacker
get away with it?

450
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,541
I'm dying to know why
Hongo was trying to depict

451
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,291
that scenario in
the first place.

452
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,333
By the way...

453
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,583
What is it?

454
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,208
Did you happen to know
more about this incident

455
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,916
than what you're
letting on here?

456
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,958
What? No, I didn't
know anything about it.

457
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,666
What would make you think I did?

458
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,916
You weren't convinced by any of

459
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,708
the other
detectives' hypotheses,

460
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,208
which is kind of out
of character for you,

461
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,541
so I wondered.

462
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,208
Was your empathy for Hongo
really the only reason?

463
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,583
Oh, yeah, I get that.

464
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,708
So listen...

465
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,000
If I tell you,
promise not to laugh!

466
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,541
Okay.

467
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,541
I think that Hongo and I are
really similar in a lot of ways.

468
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,666
Wow, this is a lot more
embarrassing than I thought.

469
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,166
The truth is...

470
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,125
I don't handle it very well
when characters have to die

471
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,833
in movies, either.

472
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,375
That is just like you.

473

Things Piled Up Endlessly."
