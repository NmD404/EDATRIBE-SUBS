00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:08,791
[QUIZ CLUB PRESIDENT]
All right, everyone!

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,333
Are you ready?

3
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,166
[CROWD cheering]

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,041
Who's our next quiz king?
Do you wanna know?

5
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,000
[CROWD]
Yeah!

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,416
Then let's get started
with the prelim round!

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,041
You with me?

8
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,958
[CROWD]
Yeah!

9
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:29,833
Quiz... trial... 7!

10
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,875
--[CROWD cheering]
--[SATOSHI] Yeah!

11
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,333
Question number one!

12
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,458
Here we go: "The term
"adamant" refers to a diamond,

13
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,083
while the term "beryl"
refers to an emerald."

14
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,458
So is this true, or is it false?

15
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,708
[SATOSHI] Not a terrible
first question, I guess.

16
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,666
The answer is...

17
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,208
...it's true!

18
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,291
[CROWD cheering]

19
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,750
[SATOSHI] Time to show off my
database skills.

20
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,291
Let's do this.

21
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,500
[ANNOUNCER 13A] There aren't
very many contestants left now.

22
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,416
Will question 7 be the last
of the prelim round?

23
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,708
Let's see!

24
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,166
[ANNOUNCER 13A] The word
"darui," or "listless",

25
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,250
derives from the
English word "dull."

26
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,500
Is this true, or is it false?

27
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,541
[ONODERA]
What do you think?

28
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,041
[KIMURA] Well, it makes
sense that it would be,

29
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,166
but I don't know.

30
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,000
[ONODERA]
What's your answer, Mayaka?

31
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,208
[MAYAKA]
Huh?

32
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,208
[ONODERA] Do you think
it's true or false?

33
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,791
Maybe... it's true?

34
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,375
[ANNOUNCER 13A]
The answer is...

35
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,583
[SATOSHI] The suspense is
killing me!

36
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,375
...false!

37
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,791
[CROWD cheering]

38
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,875
[ANNOUNCER 13A] And that's it
for the preliminaries!

39
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,166
[SATOSHI]
Wa-hoo!

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,500
If you answered correctly,
congratulations!

41
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,583
The championship round will
be held right over here!

42
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,958
Come on up!

43
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,500
[TANI]
Yo!

44
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,041
Wow, man.

45
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,166
That's one serious hat
you're rockin' there.

46
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,416
[SATOSHI]
Who's he again?

47
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,416
[SATOSHI]
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,041
[TANI] You didn't even realize I
was competing, did you?

49
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,458
[SATOSHI laughs] I was pretty
focused on the quiz.

50
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,500
[SATOSHI]
Oh, I remember him!

51
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,875
[SATOSHI]
So, Tani, how's the Go Club?

52
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,500
The Go Club.

53
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,416
I've got a funny story
about that, actually.

54
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,958
Wanna hear it?

55
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,125
[ANNOUNCER 13A]
Fantastic!

56
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,458
Now, let's hear from
our third finalist.

57
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,625
[SATOSHI]
Yeah, I'm coming!

58
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,750
We should go.

59
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,125
[ANNOUNCER 13A]
Whoa!

60
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,916
Looks like there's a
giant Saturn on his head!

61
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,333
[ANNOUNCER 13A] Please tell
us your name and class.

62
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,875
Hello, folks. Satoshi Fukube!

63
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:25,666
[ANNOUNCER 13A]
Ooh!

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,250
From the Classic Lit Club!

65
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,375
Wow!

66
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,458
We have a Classic Lit Club?
Who knew?

67
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,875
Based on that outfit,
your club must be wild, huh?

68
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,375
Yeah!

69
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,291
Sure! We are totally wild!

70
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,166
I mean really, we've done a lot
of awesome stuff this year.

71
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,958
[ANNOUNCER 13A]
You have?

72
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,541
Please, tell us more!

73
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,791
[SATOSHI] Well, we knew that we
needed to create an anthology,

74
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,750
and we wanted to
make the most of it.

75
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,708
Honestly, I think the results
are pretty amazing.

76
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,958
We put everything into it!

77
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,875
[HOTARO] Oh, yeah. We put
everything into it, money-wise.

78
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,625
As a matter of fact, we
uncovered a long-buried secret

79
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,583
about this very festival!

80
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,166
[SATOSHI laughs]

81
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,000
[ANNOUNCER 13A]
Please, tell us more!

82
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,500
We found the origin
of the term "Kanyasai."

83
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,583
It is not just a
simple abbreviation

84
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,000
of "Kamiyama High School
Cultural Festival."

85
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,958
The Classic Lit Club...

86
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,125
...has found the truth!

87
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,833
[CROWD cheering]

88
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,958
What is the name's origin?

89
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,583
To find out...

90
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,958
...buy our anthology!

91
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,875
For the low price of 200 yen,

92
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,875
you can learn the
45-year-old secret

93
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,958
of Kami High's
cultural festival.

00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,041
At this point,
winning is just gravy.

[ERU]
I'm here, Oreki!

101
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,125
How'd it go?

102
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,291
I talked to Tanabe.

103
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,000
He said we could ask other
clubs to sell copies for us

104
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,208
at their booths.

105
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,958
My first thought
was to find Irisu

106
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,083
and ask if she would
consider helping us out,

107
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,791
but I never quite made it there.

108
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,208
[HOTARO]
Yeah. I think I can see why.

109
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,041
What should we do now?

110
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,250
Satoshi's plug
was pretty effective.

111
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,583
Maybe that'll do the trick.

112
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,375
Huh? A plug!

113
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,666
That's it!

114
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,375
I heard the Wall Newspaper Club
is putting out an extra edition!

115
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,791
I'll go ask them
if they'll cover

116
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,958
the Classic Lit Club in it.

117
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,250
[HOTARO]
Always on the move.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,083
[ERU]
Excuse me!

119
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,958
[TOGAITO]
Hey, Chitanda. Need something?

120
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,708
[ERU] Actually, yes.
I could use your help.

121
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,416
Could you cover the
Classic Lit Club in your extra?

122
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Huh?

123
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,750
I'm confused.

124
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,833
What is it that
you want, exactly?

125
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,416
A small favor.

126
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,166
The club's run
into some trouble.

127
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,041
I was hoping you might
write a promotional article

128
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,500
for us and publish it
in the wall newspaper.

129
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,041
Oh. Uh...

130
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,375
I dunno.

131
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,416
The thing is, I'm not
really in the club anymore.

132
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,625
Since it's my last year
of school, I've retired.

133
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,625
All right, I'm sorry.

134
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,666
Well, then, is there a chance
you could introduce me

135
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,666
to the people who
are running it now?

136
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,166
Sure, I don't mind doing that,
but it may not do you any good.

137
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,041
The one-page extra is
set to run in two hours.

138
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,666
So the layout is pretty
much fixed at this point.

139
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,166
So it's impossible
to add anything?

140
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,083
For today, anyway.

141
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,791
But they might have
some room available

142
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,375
if you can wait until
the afternoon on day 2.

143
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,000
That said, there are more
than 50 clubs at Kanyasai,

144
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,083
and the paper gives priority
to those that deserve

145
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,291
the most attention.

146
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,166
And I'm not sure your
club makes the cut.

147
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,583
No offense, but all you're doing

148
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,458
is publishing an
anthology, right?

149
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,833
Yes, but, there's
important information in it.

150
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,583
Come on, every club thinks
that what it does is important.

151
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,625
Tell you what: if you can
come up with a story

152
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,500
that's actually going to
capture people's interest,

153
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,750
I'll personally ask them
to run it, okay?

154
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,875
Yes. I understand.

155
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,333
Well, thank you,

156
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,250
and I'm sorry for taking up
so much of your time.

157
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,041
[TOGAITO] Remember, if you come
up with an interesting story,

158
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,208
drop by again.

159
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,125
I may be able to help you out.

Hi, Kaho!

163
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,791
[KAHO]
Long time no see.

164
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,583
[ERU]
How is Uncle Jumonji doing,

165
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,166
after everything that happened?

166
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,750
[KAHO]
He's doing fine now.

167
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,416
How about you, though?
You look kinda stressed.

168
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,083
I guess so.
I've got a lot going on.

169
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,500
Well, maybe I can help.

170
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,208
I'll tell your fortune
if you want.

171
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,083
This is a pretty amazing
setup you've got here.

172
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,750
A lot of options, too.

173
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,208
I think I'd like to try
a tarot reading.

174
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,291

I'm running this all by myself,

so I have to leave the
booth unattended sometimes.

180

I stepped out for a little bit,
and when I came back,

181
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,333
the Wheel of Fortune card was
missing from my Tarot deck.

been left in its place.

I think I'll get
it back eventually.

heard of a thief

As far as I can tell,

it was open to the last page--

"We've taken some stones
from the Go Club."

And it's not like we
use all of them,

and nobody would notice
they were missing.

them in the first place?

Which is why I don't
think there's any point

346
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,083
in writing reviews.

347
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,833
Everyone should just
read what they like.

348
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,416
This is entertainment,
not fine art.

349
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,333
[MAYAKA]
All manga is basically the same?

350
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,958
I can't let that
statement stand.

351
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,833
I'll prove her wrong.

352
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,166
[MAYAKA]
Let me clarify.

353
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,416
To you, no manga stands
out above the rest,

354
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,666
meaning there are no works that
can be considered masterpieces.

355
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,041
There are masterpieces.

356
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,458
[MAYAKA]
And how would you define them?

357
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,166
Well, there are series
that go on for many years

358
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,041
without losing popularity, even
gaining readers over time.

359
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,291
That makes them masterpieces.

360
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,500
I think you're wrong.

361
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,875
A masterpiece is a
masterpiece from the beginning.

362
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,125
It doesn't become one.

363
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,250
I don't see how a manga
can possibly deserve

364
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,666
that title until it's
stood the test of time.

365
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,750
That's just ignorant!

366
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,791
Excuse me?

367
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,708
It's a matter of
personal experience.

368
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,083
Tell me this...

369
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,958
Have you ever read something
that really got to you?

370
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,208
That made you laugh
or cry so much it hurt?

371
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,708
Wow, Ibara.

372
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,125
Aren't you a passionate one...

373
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,375
There's a big gap between
the skill and talent

374
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,958
of different artists.

375
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,125
For example...

376
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,875
There was a manga sold
at last year's cultural festival

377
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,208
that was titled <i>A Corpse by</i>
<i>Evening</i> . Have you read it?

378
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,583
No, I haven't.

379
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,333
Okay, then I'll
bring it in tomorrow.

380
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,708
And if reading that still
doesn't convince you,

381
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,458
then nothing I could
say ever would.

382
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,666
[MAYAKA]
Nice.

383
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,250
That pretty much guarantees
I won't be able

384
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,583
to leave copies of <i>Hyouka</i> here.

385
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,583
[MANGA CLUB VISITOR A]
I'll take one, please.

386
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,583
[YUASA]
Here you go. Thanks a lot.

387
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,583
[MAYAKA]
Were they all listening?

388
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,958
Hi! Thanks for coming!

389
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,916
[ERU] Battle of the Maidens?
Sounds interesting.

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,291
[ERU]
Excuse me.

391
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,041
What's up?

392
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:24,916
What is that?

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,458
Sorry, it's over now.

394
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,333
They'll go at it again
tomorrow, though.

395
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,291
So feel free to stop by then.

396
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,375
Sure.

397
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,666
[SATOSHI]
So... What did you think?

398
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,416
About my plug, I mean.

399
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,291
Did it help our
situation at all?

400
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,958
[HOTARO]
Yeah, I suppose.

401
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,208
We sold 14.

402
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,750
Yeah? That many?

403
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,250
Guess this means
publicity really works.

404
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,708
[SATOSHI] It looks like we're
off to a pretty good start.

405
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,625
I'll try to do it
again tomorrow.

406
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:55,291
The cooking contest should give
me a nice opportunity.

407
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,791
You mean the
"three-person team" competition?

408
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,041
Huh?

409
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,083
[SATOSHI] It's a team
competition?! Seriously?

410
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,500
[HOTARO] Shouldn't someone on
the executive committee

411
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,833
know these little details?

412
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,708
[ERU]
I struck out.

413
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,125
I didn't increase our
number of outlets,

414
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,916
and I couldn't get the
newspaper to do a story on us.

415
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,208
I'm sorry I failed.

416
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,916
[HOTARO]
Don't beat yourself up.

417
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,041
Although...

418
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,541
I did hear something that I'm
kind of curious about.

419
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,291
[HOTARO]
Of course you did.

420
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,666
[ERU]
Never mind.

421
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,333
It's nothing.
Just forget about it.

422
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,541
[HOTARO]
That's a great idea.

423
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,916
[SATOSHI]
See?

424
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,833
It doesn't say anything about
three-person teams!

425
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,416
I don't know what to tell ya.

426
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,166
I heard it straight from one of
the girls in the Cooking Club.

427
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,875
[SATOSHI]
Aww... What am I gonna do?

428
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,750
I thought I could
enter on my own.

429
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,250
What about you, Mayaka?

430
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,958
How did it go with
the Manga Club?

431
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,000
Just fine, thank you very much.

432
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,458
Ladies... Can I ask a favor?

433
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,083
Would you please
consider entering

434
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,333
the Cooking Club
contest with me?

435
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,541
I can ask the
Manga Club president

436
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,583
if she'll give me time
away from our booth.

437
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,333
If it'll help with publicity,
I'm definitely in.

438
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,416
Great!

439
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,125
If we work hard,
I know we can win it!

440
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,125
It sounds like you're
really invested in this.

441
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,916
Well, I am fairly proud
of my cooking ability.

442
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,458
And honestly, I would hate to
pass up a chance to show it off.

Where is it?

Not here.
