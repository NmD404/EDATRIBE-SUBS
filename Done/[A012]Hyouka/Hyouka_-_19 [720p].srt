1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,250
[HOTARO] I bet if I picked up
a microphone and said,

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,458
"Today, the weather
will be pleasant,"

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,083
anyone from Japan who
heard me would just think,

4
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,458
"Oh, Oreki must be
testing that microphone."

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,250
Ten seconds left.

6
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,833
[HOTARO] But people from
other countries would think

7
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,000
I was giving a forecast.

8
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,541
They'd assume I
just wanted them to know

9
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,166
it would be clear.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,583
[TEACHER 19A] Okay, time's up.
Pass your papers to the front.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,666
[HOTARO] Both assumptions
could be considered reasonable.

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,625
Both parties have a fifty-fifty
shot at being right.

13
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,375
It all depends on luck.

14
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,125
What's the world coming to, man?

15
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,458
[HOTARO]
I've been wondering...

16
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,958
Your uncle Jun.

17
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,250
Did everything go all right
with his funeral?

18
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,458
It turned out very well.
Thank you.

19
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,625
Oh, good.

20
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,958
What's wrong?

21
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,041
Nothing. It's just...

22
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,500
Oreki...

23
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,333
Could you do me a favor?

24
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,791
Do you think that you could
light some incense for my uncle?

25
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,041
You want me to?

26
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,375
Yes, please.

27
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,125
I am planning to make a
trip out to his gravesite

28
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,833
in the next few of days or so.

29
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,666
And, well...

30
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,541
I hoped you'd... come with me.

31
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,291
Yeah, sure.

32
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,541
I'll go.

33
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,875
Oh, great!

34
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,375
I'll be in touch with you
about the details soon.

35
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,500
[HOTARO]
Cool.

36
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,583
I just have to
tell you, Oreki,

37
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,666
you have a gift when
it comes to mysteries,

38
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,041
and I'm grateful that you
solved the one about my uncle.

39
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,875
I think you're amazing.

40
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,375
You know, I appreciate
the sentiment,

41
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,291
but I've always
just gotten lucky.

42
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,541
I wish you wouldn't treat me
like I'm a big deal or whatever.

43
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,541
You sure are humble.
That's impressive.

44
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,708
[HOTARO]
Aw, man...

45
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,583
She totally missed the point.

46
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,958
[HOTARO] Chitanda, I heard
something once upon a time

47
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,625
that struck me as profound.

48
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,125
What is that?

49
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,916
"You can put poultice and
plausible reason on anything."

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,750
[giggling]

51
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,208
Oreki, the saying goes,

52
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,125
"You can put plaster and
plausible reason on anything."

53
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,625
[HOTARO]
Uh... That's what it says?

54
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,458
I just mean you
can find reasons

55
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,166
to support anything you want.

56
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,416
If you say so.

57
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,291
Then the reason you've
solved all these cases

58
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,666
is only pure, dumb luck,

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,958
and it has nothing to do
with your intelligence.

60
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,250
And your talent isn't
a factor either, okay?

61
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,875
However, you've been
able to capitalize

62
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,416
on the luck you've had,
and follow through

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
to the correct conclusions.

64
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,625
Now isn't that,
in and of itself,

65
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,291
a particular kind of talent?

66
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,375
Are you trying to say
I'm a master of reason?

67
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,750
[ERU]
Am I wrong?

68
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,208
Yeah, you are.

69
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,416
I couldn't tell you how
I made those deductions.

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,291
Honestly, that's
the real mystery here.

71
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,541
[ERU]
If I had to guess,

72
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,833
what I would say...

73
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,791
...is that you have never
really taken a good,

74
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,583
honest look at yourself.

75
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,666
[HOTARO]
She's not wrong there.

76
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,791
In that case, Chitanda,

77
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,375
I want you to come up
with a situation.

78
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,791
I'll prove to you
that I can invent

79
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,833
a good reason for it,
whatever it is.

80
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,708
This is a dream come true!

81
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,083
[HOTARO]
This is the perfect opportunity

82
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,333
to show her that she
can't actually rely on me.

83
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,583
All right, then.

84
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,625
What should I pick for you?

85
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,208
[PA announcement]

86
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,583
[SHIBAZAKI] Anyone who
was shopping at Kobundo

87
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,916
near the train station
on October 31st,

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,541
please report to Shibazaki in
the faculty room immediately.

89
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,333
[ERU]
What is that all about?

90
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,458
No clue.

91
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,208
Let's make that the situation!

92
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,625
Please deduce why that
announcement was made just now!

93
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,625
So what's the story behind it?

94
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,791
Okay, fine.

95
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,083
Challenge accepted.

96
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,125
Right. Here ya go.

97
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,541
[HOTARO] Your power of
recollection is as intimidating

98
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,833
as ever.

99
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,458
That's no compliment.

100
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,833
Let's see...

101
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,666
"Anyone who was
shopping at Kobundo

102
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,416
near the train station
on October 31st,

103
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,291
please report to Shibazaki in
the faculty room immediately."

104
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,041
First thing we should
do is a word check.

105
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,541
Do you know what
this "Kobundo" is?

106
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,125
Yes.

107
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,208
It's a little stationery store
across from the train station.

108
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,166
[ERU] It's very quaint, and it's
run by a sweet elderly couple.

109
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,250
I've only been
there once, though.

110
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,666
[HOTARO]
What kind of stationery?

111
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,958
[ERU]
Oh, the usual.

112
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,833
North Elementary is nearby,

113
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,041
so I think they might specialize
in the kinds of things

114
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,166
grade-schoolers would use.

115
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,541
[HOTARO] So it's not
the kind of place where

116
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,916
high-schoolers would go
out of their way to shop?

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,666
[ERU]
I suppose you could say that.

118
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,500
[HOTARO] Is Shibazaki
on the faculty here?

119
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,791
Oreki, Mr. Shibazaki
is the vice principal.

120
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,708
[giggles]
For all your deductive prowess,

121
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,250
you're not good with
remembering people's names, huh?

122
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,625
Leave me alone.

123
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,875
[HOTARO] "If I don't have to,
I'm not going to.

124
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,750
If I have to, I'll do it
as quickly as possible."

125
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,875
That was my unshakeable creed.

126
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,250
But the stakes of
this contest are high.

127
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,916
I'm going to have to turn up
the heat a little on this one.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,791
First off...

129
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:18,750
[ERU]
Yes?

130
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,208
I've deduced why Shibazaki

131
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,000
would be calling
people in to see him.

132
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,083
Yes. I have a pretty good
idea of that myself.

133
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,583
[HOTARO]
Just to make things clearer,

134
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,000
let's refer to the student
who's been called out as "X."

135
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,166
[ERU] Now we're getting
into the swing of things.

136
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,166
Why don't you have a seat?

137
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,250
Okay.

138
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,375
[HOTARO clears throat]

139
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,291
At this point,
with the information we have,

140
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,541
there's no way to know
whether X is a single kid

141
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,083
or multiple people.

142
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,833
Could be anything.

143
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,333
A teaching moment.

144
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,083
He could be trying
to teach X a lesson

145
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,958
about something that happened.

146
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,625
In other words,
he could be calling X

147
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,500
to the faculty room
to chew them out.

148
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,500
What makes you so
certain about that?

149
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,041
Because when students are
called down to the faculty room,

150
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,875
it's very rarely
for something good.

151
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,000
That's what you call
inductive reasoning.

152
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,083
Oreki, are you
taking this seriously?

153
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,833
I haven't been this
serious about something

154
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,791
since I started at Kami High.

155
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,000
I'd go so far as to say
I haven't been this serious

156
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,666
my whole life.

157
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,291
Besides, if he was summoning X

158
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,166
to the faculty room
to offer praise,

159
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,083
he wouldn't put it
in such vague terms.

160
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,000
he would just say that's
what was going on.

161
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,166
And he would have called
the person out by name.

162
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,541
With an announcement like that,

163
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,583
anyone involved would be
too anxious to answer it.

164
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,500
[ERU] You're right,
that's a good point.

165
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,166
Furthermore, that sounded
like an urgent page.

166
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,041
You mean 'cause
he said, "immediately"?

167
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,041
[HOTARO]
No, most pages use that word.

168
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,916
It's not that.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,375
This announcement deviated
from the standard pattern,

170
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,708
so we can deduce that
they made it hastily.

171
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,083
[ERU]
Standard pattern? How so?

172
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,666
[HOTARO] Let's say you wanted
to make an announcement

173
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,916
addressing me, asking me
to come to Class 1-A.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What would you say?

175
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,125
Well, let me see...

176
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,958
Something like this:

177
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,333
"Attention, students:

178
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,333
Would Hotaro Oreki of class 1-B

179
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,416
please report to Eru Chitanda
in the 1-A classroom."

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,583
Is that really all?

181
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,041
Try to think of
other announcements

182
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,333
you've heard this year.

183
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,833
If it were me, I'd say:

184
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,208
"Attention: would Eru
Chitanda of Class 1-A

185
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,458
please report to Hotaro Oreki
in Class 1-B at once.

186
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,666
I repeat.

187
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,625
Would Eru Chitanda of Class 1-A

188
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:43,291
please report to Hotaro Oreki
in the 1-B classroom at once."

189
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,041
[HOTARO] It's not like
a regular announcement.

190
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,875
Usually summons like that
are repeated somehow.

191
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,958
But for whatever reason,

192
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,625
he only made this
announcement once.

193
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,041
I think it's safe to
conclude he was in a rush.

194
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,750
It's not just any
run-of-the-mill rush, either.

195
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,208
It's not?

196
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,291
I know that because
of when we heard it.

197
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,666
He made the announcement
after school.

198
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,458
Hmm... I don't know.

199
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,458
That seems pretty
insignificant, if you ask me.

200
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,458
[HOTARO]
Oh, yeah?

201
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,125
Then I won't say
why I think that.

202
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,291
Oreki, come on!

203
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,083
It's just a bit odd.

204
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,875
Why make that announcement
after school?

205
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,500
Why not make it
earlier in the day?

206
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,791
Sure, Kamiyama may have
a ton of after-school

207
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,333
clubs and activities,
but there are still

208
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,708
plenty of students here
who leave right away.

209
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,375
That makes me think he
made the announcement

210
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,250
after school because
the event that caused

211
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,041
the announcement happened
after school, too.

212
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,833
And it was urgent enough
that he couldn't risk

213
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,416
waiting to summon X
until tomorrow.

214
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,541
So that means Shibazaki
followed his impulse

215
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,458
and took the gamble
that X hadn't gone home

216
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,666
from school yet.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,166
I gotta say...

218
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,916
This whole thing feels
incredibly shady to me.

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,875
Yeah, me, too.

220
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,041
And the term "shady,"

221
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,833
how did it come to
mean what it does?

222
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:55,541
Dunno.

223
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,000
[whining]

224
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,333
[HOTARO]
Next deduction...

225
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,708
Whatever Shibazaki wants
to speak to X about,

226
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,708
that subject can't be
discussed out in the open.

227
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,833
Whether that's just
for now or forever,

228
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,416
we have no way of knowing.

229
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,125
[ERU] Do you figure
that because Shibazaki

230
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,625
didn't give a reason
for making the page?

231
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,916
[HOTARO]
That's a factor,

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,958
but there's an even
clearer reason I think so.

233
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,666
[ERU]
It's not clear to me.

234
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,125
Shibazaki is the
vice-principal, right?

235
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,000
The guidance counselor
is usually the one

236
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,333
who comes down on students.

237
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,583
[ERU]
That's right.

238
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,291
Morishita is always the
one to call students in.

239
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,500
Where is the guidance
counselor's office?

240
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,958
It's on the second floor
of the main building.

241
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,416
[HOTARO] But Shibazaki summoned
X to the faculty room,

242
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,458
and not the guidance
counselor's office.

243
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,458
To me, that means the
circumstances were serious.

244
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,500
And that all information
about this incident

245
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,083
was to be kept between
the administration only.

246
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,666
Or so it could be argued.

247
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,041
Listen... Oreki...

248
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,583
[HOTARO]
What is it?

249
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,750
Judging by what you've deduced
about this situation so far,

250
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,750
I can't escape the feeling
that X was involved

251
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,208
in doing something really bad.

252
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,583
Well, that's what
all the signs point to.

253
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,916
[ERU gasps]

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,041
So then...

255
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,791
[HOTARO]
Student X...

256
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,875
...committed some kind of crime.

257
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,583
[HOTARO] This is only a game
between Chitanda and me.

258
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,291
My explanation doesn't have
to match up with the truth.

259
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,000
I mean, the whole point
of this was to prove

260
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,583
that my assessments
are only right

261
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,500
when I have a good deal
of luck on my side.

262
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,958
So, then... What crime
could X have committed?

263
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,166
[HOTARO]
Before we get to that,

264
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,250
if we assume that my
deductions are accurate,

265
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,916
we have to note that the school
doesn't have a police officer,

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,541
so it's likely that
law enforcement

267
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,291
has been summoned
here to talk to X

268
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,916
about what went down.

269
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,208
If a crime was committed,

270
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,833
it must have happened
on October 31st.

271
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,583
And yet the announcement
came a few minutes ago,

272
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,833
and seemed really hurried.

273
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,500
It's conceivable that the
page followed immediately

274
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,958
after some request
from law enforcement.

275
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,958
[ERU] But that could have
been done relatively easily

276
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,250
over the phone.

277
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,375
[HOTARO]
That may be true,

278
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,666
but if worse came to worse,

279
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,541
and it was decided
that X was guilty,

280
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,958
the police might have
to take X into custody.

281
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,666
They could have come to
the school just in case

282
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,166
that became necessary.

283
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,583
Custody?

284
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,666
Do you mean if
X is found guilty

285
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,916
that they would
face criminal charges?

286
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,416
Well, it's possible.

287
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,125
Hey. It's a game, remember?

288
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,625
Oh. Right. I keep forgetting.

289
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,083
If X weren't the culprit,

290
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,208
Shibazaki would have waited
to make the announcement,

291
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,666
and he wouldn't have
sounded so rushed.

292
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,916
[ERU]
That makes sense.

293
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,333
[HOTARO] Now as far
as what crime we may

294
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,708
be dealing with here,
do you have any ideas?

295
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,625
It must have to do
with the store somehow.

296
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,541
Well, let's see... Uh...

297
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,166
Shoplifting is
the obvious choice.

298
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,458
Beyond that,

299
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,166
it's possible that someone
had committed crimes

300
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,916
at other locations,
but police received a testimony

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,708
that someone of that
suspect's description

302
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,833
had been seen
shopping at Kobundo,

303
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,291
but if that's the case,

304
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,750
the crime could have been
any number of heinous acts.

305
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,958
It could have been anything!

306
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,708
[HOTARO] That's a detailed
answer for having been

307
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,583
put on the spot.

308
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,791
[HOTARO] Considering
the announcement,

309
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,916
I doubt anyone gave
a physical description.

310
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,666
[ERU]
Why's that?

311
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,416
[HOTARO] If the police had
a description of someone

312
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,750
who had committed a crime,

313
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,875
they would probably
share it with Shibazaki.

314
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,875
He would have been able
to think of at least one name,

315
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,083
and wouldn't just have said,

316
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,000
"anyone who was
shopping at Kobundo"

317
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,208
in the announcement.

318
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,916
[ERU]
That's a good point.

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,791
[HOTARO] The incident
occurred at Kobundo,

320
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,458
and all we know
for sure was that X

321
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,958
was shopping there
on October 31st.

322
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,458
[HOTARO] Was the purpose of
the announcement to make X

323
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,875
turn themselves in?

324
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,375
If that's the case, it's
kind of a weird way to do it.

325
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,333
[HOTARO]
I speculate...

326
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,958
...that law enforcement doesn't
know very much about X,

327
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,375
but they assume that
the announcement

328
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,916
will lead X to
confess their crimes.

329
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,416
[ERU]
Why would that be?

330
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,750
[HOTARO]
If I had done something wrong,

331
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,041
and that page came
over the PA system...

332
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,750
[PA announcement]

333
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,041
[SHIBAZAKI] Anyone who
was shopping at Kobundo

334
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,333
near the train station
on October 31st,

335
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,916
please report to Shibazaki in
the faculty room immediately.

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,791
[TEACHER 19A]
Ten more seconds.

337
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,166
[HOTARO]
Good.

338
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,875
The police still don't know
I'm the one who did it.

339
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,291
If all goes according to plan,

340
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,416
I could get away with it
and go on to become

341
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,958
a criminal mastermind!

342
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,333
[laughing]

343
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,166
[HOTARO] Why would a guilty
party ever come forward

344
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,208
just because they heard
an announcement like that?

345
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,958
If they had some sense of
remorse about the crime?

346
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,125
No, if that were the case,

347
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,541
they'd have turned
themselves in already,

348
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:45,791
and wouldn't be at large.

349
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,000
What are you thinking?

350
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,625
Let's forget about
the nature of the crime

351
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,583
for a moment, and
try another tactic.

352
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,083
Now suppose X felt guilty
about what they had done.

353
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,500
Maybe they decided to apologize
to the owners of Kobundo.

354
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,875
In writing.

355
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,458
Wait, in writing?

356
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,750
Chitanda.

357
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,625
Do you know the date
off the top of your head?

358
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,708
Of course. It's November 1st.

359
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,500
[HOTARO] So the crime was
committed yesterday,

360
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,416
October 31st, right?

361
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,458
Why didn't Shibazaki say,

362
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,000
"Kobundo next to the train
station yesterday,"

363
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,250
in his announcement?

364
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,166
Now that you mention it,
that is quite unusual.

365
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,500
Why would someone
spell out October 31st

366
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,208
instead of saying "yesterday"?

367
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,791
One explanation could
be that they have

368
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,833
some sort of form or
note in front of them

369
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,291
on which all that
is written out,

370
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,291
and they are reading the
date directly from it.

371
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,000
A form or a note, huh?

372
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,208
Yeah.

373
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,166
Furthermore, why do
the police know that X

374
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,125
was involved in a crime,
but have no idea

375
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,208
what X looks like?

376
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,208
Why would they assume
that X would come forward

377
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,625
just because they were paged?

378
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,000
To put it another way,

379
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,500
why would they think X felt
remorse for the crime?

380
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,291
It has to be that X sent an
apology note to Kobundo.

381
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,666
It probably went
something like this:

382
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,083
"I am terribly sorry.

383
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,625
I was shopping in your
store on October 31st

384
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,458
and committed an unlawful act.

385
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,375
I intend to pay for
the damage I caused,

386
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,916
so please accept such and such
and my sincere apology."

387
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,416
Kobundo then takes that apology
note directly to the police.

388
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,250
Either the police
or other law enforcement

389
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,625
follows up on the letter,

390
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,500
and decides to
come to Kami High.

391
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,583
That just happened,
mere moments ago.

392
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,041
Then Shibazaki reads the
note and is so outraged

393
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,000
that he makes a hasty
schoolwide announcement,

394
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,041
summoning the suspect
to the faculty room.

395
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,083
[ERU]
Hold on a minute.

396
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,333
Oreki, by your logic,

397
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,875
even though X wanted
to apologize to Kobundo

398
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,375
and repay them for the damage,

399
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,125
they hoped by writing the
letter that they could settle

400
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,625
without any police
involvement, right?

401
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,000
[HOTARO]
Yeah, that makes sense.

402
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,416
[ERU]
In that case, I don't think X

403
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,875
would have indicated
in their letter

404
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:37,125
that they were a student at
Kamiyama High, would they?

405
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,750
So then how would
the police have known

406
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,375
to look for them here?

407
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,166
Maybe when police asked
the owners of Kobundo

408
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,083
for a physical
description of the suspect,

409
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,666
they detailed X's clothes,

410
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,500
and police put together that it
was the uniform for Kami High.

411
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,833
That would be one
possible explanation.

412
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,333
[ERU]
Interesting.

413
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,833
[HOTARO] And if X did anything
that made them stand out,

414
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,625
it would make sense for the
owners to remember details.

415
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,291
What would make them stand out?

416
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,666
Well, let's see.

417
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,666
We might be able to
determine the crime from that.

418
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,041
So, X behaved oddly.

419
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,500
They did something outrageous
enough to attract attention,

420
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,416
but that's not
necessarily illegal.

421
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,875
Then X committed a crime,

422
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,333
the nature of
which is such that,

423
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,625
without the apology letter,

424
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,958
no one would have
known right away.

425
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,916
X was consumed with regret.

426
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,208
X's crime was serious
enough that it warranted

427
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,541
contacting law
enforcement immediately.

428
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,208
Whatever X did yesterday--

429
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,541
It wasn't something petty,
like shoplifting.

430
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,708
Then, what?

431
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,083
[HOTARO] Shopping in
a way that stood out.

432
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,958
Shopping that became illegal.

433
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,166
You said that Kobundo
is a stationery store

434
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,708
that caters to
grade school kids,

435
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,625
so it's not likely that they
carry anything of much value.

436
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:55,583
[HOTARO] Shopping...
shopping... shopping.

437
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,666
No way.

438
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,791
What is it?

439
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,125
[HOTARO]
Our friend, X,

440
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,166
tried to pay with a
counterfeit 10,000 yen bill.

441
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,708
But... But...

442
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,166
But that can't be true!

443
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,958
It's just way too far-fetched.

444
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,666
I don't think it's realistic!

445
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,750
It defies any sort of logic!

446
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,041
It's a terrible theory!

447
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,041
It's completely catastrophic!

448
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,833
[HOTARO]
Whoa. Hey.

449
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,500
[HOTARO]
Calm down.

450
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,958
[HOTARO]
This is just a game, you know?

451
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,500
Right. I'm sorry.

452
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,500
It's not real.
Don't take it so seriously.

453
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,750
I know, but still...

454
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,541
It's not possible...
It can't be.

455
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,708
Why are you so
sure it's impossible?

456
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,333
[ERU] It's been all over
the news that someone

457
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,708
has been trying to pass
off 10,000 yen bills.

458
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,500
That's what gave you the
idea in the first place:

459
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,166
That X must be someone
from our school

460
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,416
who tried to pay with one
of them yesterday, right?

461
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,625
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

462
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,125
But X could not have
possibly gotten ahold

463
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,375
of one of those counterfeit
bills, or even if they had,

464
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,625
they would have
realized it was fake

465
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,416
and handed it over
to the police.

466
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,750
[HOTARO]
What makes you say that?

467
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:25,833
[ERU]
Bear with me here.

468
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,708
Let's say X did
get a counterfeit bill.

469
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,458
Where do you think they
could have done that?

470
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,875
[HOTARO]
From an ATM, I would imagine.

471
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,291
Counterfeit bills
that are good enough

472
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,541
to slip past bank
tellers into an ATM

473
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,166
aren't very common.

474
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,291
And even if by some
chance that happened,

475
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,750
the bill would be so good
that X wouldn't spot it.

476
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,166
If X was given change--Oh.

477
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,625
That's right.

478
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,208
You can't get 10,000
yen bills as change.

479
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,666
Except for commemorative coins,

480
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,750
the 10,000 is the highest
note there is here.

481
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,500
I think I see what
you're getting at now.

482
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,000
That means there's only
one or two other ways

483
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,250
in which X could have acquired
a fake bill innocently.

484
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,041
But even if we assume X's
parents own their own business,

485
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,750
and had a counterfeit
bill given to them

486
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,000
without their knowledge,

487
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,083
if X had gotten it as
allowance or something,

488
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,166
X would have had the chance
to tell his or her parents

489
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,375
it was a fake.

490
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,875
[ERU]
I think you're right.

491
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,125
And if X had earned it at a
part-time job or something,

492
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,875
they would have had a chance
to turn it in then, as well.

493
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,541
What if X found it?

494
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,708
That would be too crazy!

495
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,916
Yeah, someone who would
find a counterfeit bill

496
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and try to pass it off
as real doesn't seem like

497
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,250
the kind to write an
apology letter, do they?

498
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,208
X probably noticed
at the last minute

499
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,666
and felt guilty as they
were trying to pay with it.

500
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,041
Without knowing how X
obtained a counterfeit bill,

501
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,291
it's impossible to say whether
your deduction is realistic.

502
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,083
A 10,000 yen note.

503
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,833
Chitanda. Would you
say that you like money?

504
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm not sure.

505
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,791
I suppose it's fair to say I
like it more than I dislike it.

506
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,500
If you dropped 10,000 yen,
would you miss it?

507
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,041
Yeah, of course I would.

508
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:06,125
Well... Unless I knew my money
wasn't the genuine article.

509
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,708
If it was your own, real money,

510
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,041
then I bet you would
miss it for sure.

511
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,791
The reason X felt guilty,
even while committing the crime,

512
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,625
is that it was their own money.

513
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,083
Even if it was a fake.

514
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,708
I submit that X must have
gotten that bill from someone,

515
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,416
thinking it was
legitimate currency,

516
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,125
and if that wasn't from
wages or allowance,

517
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,500
there's only one
other possibility.

518
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,416
Someone gave it to them
when they repaid a loan.

519
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,458
If X had gotten the
bill in that manner,

520
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,708
and discovered it was a fake,

521
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,250
they'd have been
really disappointed.

522
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,875
That being the case,
it's hard to blame them

523
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,708
for trying to use it at a store
run by an old man and woman.

524
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,875
Even if they knew it
was immoral to do that.

525
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,791
Even so, they still would
have had the opportunity

526
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,125
to turn it in and
exchange it for real money!

527
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,333
[HOTARO]
I don't know.

528
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,583
A fake bill is like
the joker in Old Maid.

529
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,541
No one wants to
get stuck with it.

530
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,291
You know, the longer
I think about this,

531
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,666
the more plausible
it sounds to me.

532
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,750
"Hey, X, I have the money
that I borrowed from you

533
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:58,916
a while back."

534
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,958
"Ah, Y, that's great.
I appreciate it."

535
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,833
"It was 10,000 yen, right?
Here ya go."

536
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,583
"Yes, thank you."

537
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,791
Then, surprise,
it's a fake bill.

538
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,916
Maybe Y, who borrowed
the money from X,

539
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,541
had seniority over X,
complicating things.

540
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,333
So X didn't feel like
they could object

541
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,833
when Y paid them back
with a counterfeit note.

542
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,916
At this point, I think
it's safe to say that X

543
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,458
is just one person.

544
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,333
And since Kobundo
is a store that sells

545
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,625
inexpensive stationery
for grade school kids,

546
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,375
it would be weird for
high schoolers to come in

547
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,666
buying things with
10,000 yen bills.

548
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,750
[HOTARO]
I think that wraps that up.

549
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,041
Then there's Y.

550
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,000
Y also came across a fake bill.

551
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,041
It could be that Z,
someone above Y,

552
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,083
gave it to them.

553
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,875
If we lump everyone
above Y together

554
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,791
as one collective,
then who are they?

555
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,333
A store manager somewhere
with no conscience,

556
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,291
or the counterfeiter themselves?

557
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,500
The police may have
gotten involved at Kami

558
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,291
in the hope that they
could find out from X

559
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,875
specifically where
the counterfeit bills

560
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,416
were originating.
That's my guess.

561
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,583
[HOTARO]
And that concludes my deduction.

562
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,583
[HOTARO]
Hmm...

563
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,833
After I talked for so long,

564
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,666
it seems kind of rude
of her not to respond.

565
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,958
Whatever.

566
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,333
[HOTARO] Kobundo is
over that way, isn't it?

567
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,125
[ERU]
That's amazing.

568
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,916
"Anyone who was
shopping at Kobundo

569
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,375
near the train station
on October 31st,

570
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:38,000
please report to Shibazaki in
the faculty room immediately."

571
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:44,166
A whole story. Wow.
Just from that one announcement.

572
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,125
Yeah, that's what
we came up with.

573
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,416
Game over, I guess.

574
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,500
Hey, Oreki.

575
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,666
Huh? What is it?

576
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,750
I seem to remember that
we started this whole game

577
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,666
as a way to settle an
argument we were having

578
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,750
about something.

579
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,875
Oh, that rings a bell.

580
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,375
Now what was it, again?

581
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,833
I can't recall.

582
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:10,875
Oh, Oreki... I have an idea.

583
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,958
Do you want to
deduce what it was?

584
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,458
[HOTARO]
Give me a break.

585
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,250
[HOTARO]
Whoa...

586
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,833
But that was
supposed to be a game.

587
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,166
I thought...

588
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,166
It couldn't possibly be true.
Hmm.

589
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,875
[ERU] Next time:
"Mishap-py New Year."
