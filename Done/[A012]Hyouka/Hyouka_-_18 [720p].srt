1
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:14,750
[ERU]
No, I'm serious!

2
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,625
When we played classical music
for our shiitake mushrooms,

3
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,916
their growth rate
increased exponentially!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,125
[MAYAKA]
Really? That's amazing!

5
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,041
Yeah, and if you expose
them to electricity,

6
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,208
like artificial light,
they'll get even bigger.

7
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,416
[MAYAKA]
For real?

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,916
[SATOSHI]
Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,875
When they're stimulated by
a strong current like that,

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,583
they feel threatened,
and the fungal filaments respond

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,750
by growing bigger to ensure
reproductive success.

12
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,583
[HOTARO] That's fascinating,
but we're here to do homework.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,083
A helicopter?

14
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,166
Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,000
[HOTARO]
That reminds me...

16
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,416
Wasn't Ogi into helicopters?

17
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,333
[ERU]
Ogi who?

18
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,875
Do you mean Takahiro Ogi
from Class 2-B?

19
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,916
[HOTARO]
No. Who's that?

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,166
[ERU] You know. Ogi.
From Class 2-B.

21
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,958
[HOTARO] No, this Ogi taught
at our middle school.

22
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,375
He was an English teacher,
kind of an older guy.

23
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,416
Satoshi. Do you remember him?

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,833
I mean, sure,
I remember Mr. Ogi.

25
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,000
but I didn't know he was
really that into helicopters.

26
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,166
I thought everybody
knew about that.

27
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,916
It was the talk of
the school for a bit.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,416
Ibara, does any
of this ring a bell?

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,166
No.

30
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,708
[HOTARO]
That's so weird.

31
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,625
How could it have made
such an impression on me,

32
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,333
yet they don't even recall it?

33
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,000
We all went to the same school,

34
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,125
and Ibara and I were
in the same class.

35
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,541
Did I just dream it?

36
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,250
She can't not have known.

37
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,583
[ERU]
Okay.

38
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,708
Is this thing with Mr. Ogi
worth examining further?

39
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,291
No, it's not really a big deal.

40
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,208
Ibara, let me try
to jog your memory.

41
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,541
Now think...

42
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,833
Do you happen to recall
that day when a helicopter

43
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,625
flew over Kaburaya
Middle School?

44
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,958
Um, that happened
like, all the time.

45
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,541
But this time it was strange.

46
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,666
Mr. Ogi stopped teaching
in the middle of class

47
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,166
and ran over to the window to
look at something in the sky.

48
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,666
He stared at this helicopter
until it disappeared,

49
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,041
then said something about
how he loved choppers,

50
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,583
like he was trying to brush
it off as no big deal.

51
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,083
And then he just went
back to teaching, remember?

52
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,083
Oh!

53
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,375
Now that you've
told me the story,

54
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,583
it does sound familiar.

55
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,541
Yeah, I remember that happening.

56
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,041
Are you sure that was Ogi?

57
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,500
Completely sure.

58
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,541
[HOTARO]
That's better.

59
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,291
I felt like I was going crazy.

60
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,250
[SATOSHI]
That is pretty weird.

61
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,500
You're right, it's unusual,

62
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,625
but I swear it happened,
nevertheless.

63
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,916
But when the squadrons
of JSDF helicopters

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,875
would fly over,
it was an awesome sight.

65
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,500
We'd all stop and watch.

66
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,375
Even so, I don't
remember Ogi having

67
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,666
a particularly strong
reaction to those.

68
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,625
Hold on a second.
What's a squadron?

69
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,833
A formation.

70
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,250
And how could you
tell they were JSDF?

71
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,708
[SATOSHI] Because I don't know
of any other groups

72
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,166
of helicopters that
fly around in squadrons.

73
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,458
And are you positive Ogi was
around when all that happened?

74
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,125
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

75
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:37,916
Oh!

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,458
It was in English class,

77
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:43,375
'cause I remember looking up
AGM in the English dictionary.

78
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,750
AGM, huh?

79
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,291
And what does that stand for?

80
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,500
[HOTARO] It's an abbreviation
of "air-to-ground missile."

81
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,500
Weird...

82
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,083
I'd think if Ogi
was into choppers

83
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,958
and a squadron flew over,
he'd get up and do a dance.

84
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,041
[SATOSHI] A dance might
be taking it too far.

85
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,500
[HOTARO]
I'm just saying he'd freak out.

86
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,541
Hmm... It's all
coming back to me.

87
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,958
Ogi did go crazy
for helicopters.

88
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,500
I remember hearing that
after starting middle school.

89
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,208
Hmm... It's all
coming back, right?

90
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,416
I even recall wondering if all
the middle school teachers

91
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,458
were as weird as Mr. Ogi.

92
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,500
But like Fuku said
a moment ago,

93
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,333
Ogi never freaked out
about helicopters

94
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,833
after that one flew
over during class.

95
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,458
[HOTARO]
It was three years ago,

96
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,875
but I think I would
remember if Ogi

97
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,750
had done something
similar again.

98
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,666
It was just that one time,

99
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,166
and the way he tried
to cover was weird, too.

100
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,791
There's gotta be
more to this story.

101
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,333
Hey, speaking of Mr. Ogi,

102
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,416
I've suddenly remembered another
incredible story about him.

103
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,583
The man is pretty much a legend.

104
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,166
Don't start making stuff up.

105
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,166
I'm not.

106
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,000
I swear, it actually happened.

107
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,791
I heard this one from
Mr. Ogi himself!

108
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,375
Hmph! This story's insane!

109
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,750
If I hadn't heard it firsthand,
I wouldn't have bought it.

110
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,791
So if you guys don't believe me,
I don't blame ya!

111
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,250
I'm not saying it's
impossible, but still...

112
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,166
Fine, out with it.

113
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,375
Well, according to Mr. Ogi...

114
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,416
...on three separate
occasions...

115
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,833
...he was struck by lightning!

116
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,208
[ERU]
Huh?

117
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,958
You don't mean, like,
lightning lightning, do you?

118
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,166
Mm-hmm.

119
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,208
Lightning!

120
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,333
[HOTARO groans]

121
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,708
Three times?
How could that man be okay?

122
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,875
He was struck three times!

123
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,041
Three times?
How could that man be okay?

124
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,208
[HOTARO] It looks like
Chitanda's learned

125
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,291
to play along with Satoshi.

126
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,875
Although, apparently
the lightning didn't

127
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,083
strike him dead on.

128
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,500
But that still doesn't
mean he walked away

129
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,000
completely unscathed.

130
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,791
He told us he was knocked
unconscious one of those times,

131
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,666
and he has burn marks all
over his entire body, too.

132
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,166
That sounds awful.

133
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,541
But he did live
to tell the tale,

134
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,375
so there is that one
consolation, at the very least.

135
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,333
Yeah, that's for sure.

136
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,375
Even so, why didn't I ever
notice any visible scars?

137
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,541
[HOTARO]
Struck by lightning...

138
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,750
And three times, to boot.

139
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,208
Is something like
that even possible?

140
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,416
We haven't historically
experienced much lightning

141
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,208
here in Kamiyama.

142
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,416
In spite of that,

143
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,541
Ogi claims to have been
struck three times.

144
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,416
Satoshi isn't the type
to lie to his friends

145
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,958
for the sake of a good story.

146
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,958
He even prefaced by saying it
was unbelievable, but true.

147
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,291
If Satoshi was telling the
truth, could Ogi be lying?

148
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,083
It seems like one of those
"stranger than fiction" cases.

149
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,166
[HOTARO]
Wait a minute!

150
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,916
Satoshi.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,833
Don't they keep old
newspapers in the city library?

152
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,625
[SATOSHI] Yes, they do.
Some of them, anyway.

153
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,125
[MAYAKA] We have a few in
the school library, also.

154
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,583
But only ones that pertain
to Kamiyama High.

155
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,666
They won't have
what I need here.

156
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,833
Gotta go.

157
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,250
[HOTARO] I'm heading
to the public library.

158
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,666
You guys wanna come?

159
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,625
[whimpers]

160
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,208
Hotaro, wait.

161
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,333
If I didn't know any better, I
would say you were motivated.

162
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,666
You're wrong!

163
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,458
How should I put it?

164
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,500
I...

165
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,125
I just have to know, okay?

166
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,000
[ALL gasp]

167
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,041
Hotaro?

168
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,833
What have you
done with our friend?!

169
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,333
Are you the energy
conservationist Hotaro Oreki?

170
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,333
Have you been
possessed by an alien?

171
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,333
Or have you been brainwashed
by one Eru Chitanda?

172
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,666
Knock it off!

173
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,666
[MAYAKA] Oreki, you should
go straight home to bed.

174
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,208
Make yourself some tea
and pile on the blankets.

175
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,791
I'm sure you'll be
back to 100% tomorrow.

176
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,916
That's so rude.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,541
Is it that hard to
believe I would take

178
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,500
some spontaneous initiative?

179
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,833
[HOTARO]
Ugh, whatever.

180
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,166
I'll wrap it up in no time.

181
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,166
Hey, Oreki!

182
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,041
Hey, what?

183
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,375
You're just curious, aren't you?

184
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,500
Yes, I am.

185
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,166
You're going to investigate?

186
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,791
Yeah, but who knows if
I'll even turn anything up.

187
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,041
Now I'm curious!

188
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,708
You're what? But why?

189
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,208
Because something has the
power to pique your curiosity!

190
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,041
It's novel for you
to be so intrigued!

191
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,666
I'm dying to know
what quest could have

192
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,541
that kind of
influence over you!

193
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,833
[HOTARO]
This is all incredibly rude.

194
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,750
[HOTARO] Satoshi couldn't
come because he had

195
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,000
too much homework.

196
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,250
He was really
disappointed, though.

197
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,500
Ibara would have
been a lot of help

198
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,833
since she knows the ins
and outs of libraries,

199
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,708
but I couldn't bring
myself to ask.

200
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,291
[ERU]
Thanks for waiting for me!

201
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,791
[ERU]
Okay. Are you ready to go?

202
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,791
Why don't you ride ahead?

203
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,083
I can give you a
lift there, if you want.

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
[ERU laughs]

205
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,916
[HOTARO]
No way; that's not right.

206
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,791
[HOTARO]
Nope. Not that, either.

207
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,583
No, you go on.
I'll catch up.

208
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,958
Oh, okay. See ya.

209
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,791
Chitanda!

210
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,083
Yes?

211
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,583
If you happen to come
across the news archives

212
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,375
before I get there,
will you go ahead

213
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,416
and start looking through them
for the name Masakiyo Ogi?

214
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,666
I believe it's written out as,

215
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,000
"small tree that is
correct and pure."

216
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,583
Sure, I'll get right on it.
See you in a few.

217
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,333
[HOTARO]
From what my sister has told me,

218
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,375
having been up into the
Kamikakiuchi mountains

219
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,916
herself several times...

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,708
...in such ranges where the
peaks are around 3,000 meters,

221
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,458
the air currents from
below get blocked.

222
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,333
This can cause the
weather to vary greatly

223
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,041
from the near to far sides,

224
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,250
like two completely
different climates.

225
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,791
[HOTARO] I shouldn't keep
Chitanda waiting for too long.

226
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,333
[ERU]
Oreki, you made it!

227
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,875
Look!

228
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,333
I found some information
on Mr. Ogi in the paper!

229
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,000
[HOTARO] "Mountain trail
beautification efforts

230
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,500
in the Kamikakiuchi Range."

231
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,833
It seems like mountaineering
is one of Mr. Ogi's

232
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,708
secret hobbies, huh?

233
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,833
[HOTARO] "The Kamiyama
Mountaineering Association

234
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,791
began sponsoring
beautification efforts

235
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,333
on the Abumidake mountain trail
on the 26th of this month.

236
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,833
Eleven volunteers took part,

237
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,833
primarily picking up litter
and removing overgrowth.

238
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,250
The association's captain,
Masakiyo Ogi, 39,

239
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,500
had this to say:

240
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,083
'The current climbing
boom could bring with it

241
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,791
climbers who might not be
familiar with trail etiquette.

242
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,250
I think it's important
for them to know

243
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,166
that a breach of manners
in this environment

244
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,916
could cost them their lives.'"

245
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,458
I see. That's what I thought.

246
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,541
Oreki, is there
anything the matter?

247
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,291
It's nothing.

248
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,958
Was this the only
mention of him you found

249
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,500
in the newspaper archives?

250
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,083
Yes, but we can ask
at the information desk

251
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,583
on the second floor.

252
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,333
[HOTARO]
It's strange.

253
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,666
I'm kind of hoping
my hunch gets disproven.

254
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,791
[HOTARO]
Excuse me, Miss.

255
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,208
I'd like to do a search of
the newspaper archives.

256
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,250
Sure.

257
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,916
What is it you'd
like to search for?

258
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,583
I'm interested in
local happenings

259
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,375
from April and May
of about three years ago.

260
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,916
[NAKAMURA] Should I search
for specific keywords?

261
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,125
Yes, ma'am.

262
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,375
Try "stranded."

263
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,333
[NAKAMURA]
I've turned up 12 results.

264
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,750
Would you like
to narrow it down?

265
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,583
If that's all there are,
I'd just like to see them.

266
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,750
Sure thing.

267
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,500
[HOTARO]
Eureka.

268
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,916
[ERU] There's an article
from May 9th of that year.

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,708
Pardon...
If you wouldn't mind...

270
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,041
We'd like to see
this newspaper article.

271
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,000
[HOTARO] Chitanda can
tell where this is going.

272
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,875
[NAKAMURA] Hey, Maruta,
do you have a minute or two?

273
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,291
[MARUTA]
Hi, may I help you?

274
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,041
Yes, ma'am.

275
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,125
We're interested in reading a
particular newspaper article

276
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,625
from a few years ago.

277
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,166
[MARUTA]
May, three years back.

278
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,625
I'll look for you; hold on.

279
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,541
Sure. Thank you
so much for looking.

280
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,125
It might take about
a half-hour for me

281
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,791
to track down the
article for you, okay?

282
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,208
Sure, we're happy to wait.

283
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,333
[MARUTA] I'll call you
over when it's ready.

284
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,583
We truly appreciate
your help, ma'am.

285
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,875
Hey, Oreki.

286
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,333
Since we'll be here a while,

287
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,291
would you like to look
around for a little bit?

288
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,750
That sounds good.

289
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,958
Oh, is this month's issue
a special on Taira no Kiyomori?

290
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,916
The cover is so beautiful!

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,083
[HOTARO] The feature says
that Taira no Kiyomori

292
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,583
was actually the
child of someone

293
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,416
in the Shirakawa palace,
I think.

294
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,875
[ERU]
I've heard that theory.

295
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,666
I'd like to read more
about it, though.

296
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,125
[HOTARO]
Wow, that's pretty impressive.

297
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,458
Miyajima, the island with
the Itsukushima shrine.

298
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,708
I've always wanted to
take a trip to see it.

299
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,791
[ERU]
Look at all of these cabbages!

300
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,625
There are so many
gorgeous colors!

301
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,916
And this page
with all the tomatoes!

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,791
They look so juicy
and delicious!

303
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,041
That reminds me, Oreki,

304
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,875
we still have a ton
of shiitake mushrooms

305
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:20,833
from the harvest!

306
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,000
[HOTARO]
Huh?

307
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,250
[ERU] I can give you some,
if you'd like!

308
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,333
Oh! Look, Oreki, I found
the book on insects!

309
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,750
[ERU]
Dung beetles... interesting.

310
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,416
[giggles]
They're so cute!

311
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,708
[HOTARO]
Not quite how I'd describe them.

312
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,333
Well, Oreki, is there
anything around here

313
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,750
that you'd like to look at?

314
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,541
[HOTARO]
Let me see...

315
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,916
[ERU] Now, that is
what I call a castle.

316
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,166
Your house is huge.

317
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,791
Kind of like a castle, huh?

318
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,041
Do you really think so?

319
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,875
Our house isn't that big.

320
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,625
I would say it's
only a little bit bigger

321
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,541
than a normal house, right?

322
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,000
[HOTARO] I wonder where
she's getting her idea

323
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,541
of a "normal house."

324
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,833
[HOTARO]
So what did you find out?

325
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,041
[MARUTA] It's contained in
this compilation of articles,

326
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,750
so you can find
what you need here.

327
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,708
Thank you very much
for your help.

328
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,041
[HOTARO]
Whoa. It's heavy.

329
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,250
[HOTARO]
There's a ton of stuff in here.

330
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,208
[ERU] There! That's the
issue from May 9th!

331
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,916
When Ogi stopped
class and voiced his love

332
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,625
for helicopters, it must
have been on this day.

333
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,083
If my theory is correct.

334
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,500
[HOTARO]
Here we go.

335
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,791
Okay, then.

336
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,875
What do you think
all of this means?

337
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,458
Basically...

338
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,083
Mr. Ogi wasn't especially
fond of helicopters.

339
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,750
[HOTARO] But he was struck
by lightning three times.

340
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,208
I think that part
is most likely true.

341
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,708
Although...

342
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,291
He was really just your typical
Kamiyama English teacher.

343
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,333
Not someone likely
to get hit by lightning.

344
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,500
You're right;
that is pretty weird.

345
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,666
But then it hit me,
no pun intended.

346
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,375
What if he frequently
visited a place

347
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,875
where lightning struck a lot
more than it does in town?

348
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,041
Like up in the mountains.
Am I right?

349
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,625
[ERU] So did you have a hunch
that this would be the answer?

350
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,791
[HOTARO]
Something like it, yes.

351
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,166
I figured that even though
he was an English teacher,

352
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,916
mountaineering could've still
been his favorite hobby.

353
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,500
And with that...

354
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,166
I decided to come to the library
and put my theory to the test.

355
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,833
Why did he only look
up at the helicopter

356
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,875
on that day and no others?

357
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,583
Because that particular
helicopter had

358
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,250
a special purpose.

359
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,333
Mr. Ogi was especially
eager to see

360
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,083
that lone helicopter
doing its job.

361
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,375
But... why would he be?

362
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,916
The stakes were high for him.

363
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,416
Mr. Ogi wasn't eager.

364
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,041
He was desperate
to know if the copter

365
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,125
was going to fly that day.

366
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,625
That's why, when
he heard the sound,

367
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,625
he ran over to the window
to see what it was.

368
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,708
Just saying that an
English teacher stops class

369
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,583
to watch a helicopter
doesn't make much sense.

370
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,166
But when you frame it
as a mountaineer

371
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,708
dropping everything
to watch one,

372
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,708
then that's a different story.

373
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,208
Kamiyama sits in the shadow
of the Kamikakiuchi range,

374
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:57,625
a string of many,
3000-meter-class mountains.

375
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,291
The mountaineers in this town?

376
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,125
They'd pay attention
to helicopters.

377
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,416
Even if they just carried
aerial photographers

378
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,750
over the range.

379
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,416
But this one didn't.

380
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,458
Then what did it carry?

381
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,958
A rescue mission.

382
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,625
[ERU]
Rescue?

383
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,458
The article says
that on May the 8th,

384
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,291
the weather conditions
were severe.

385
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,750
Too bad for a helicopter to fly.

386
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,791
Yeah, I remember.

387
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,625
Ogi was worried the
police wouldn't be able

388
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,541
to send it out on the 9th.

389
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,083
Even while he was teaching,

390
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,125
all he could think about was
the weather up in the mountains.

391
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,208
If it cleared up, the helicopter
would be able to fly,

392
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,500
and the chances of the
stranded mountaineers' survival

393
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,708
would improve.

394
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,208
Imagine what he felt.

395
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,666
He must have been
going through so much.

396
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,833
[HOTARO] I can't speak
to what he was feeling...

397
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,541
...but I do remember
seeing him smile.

398
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,041
[HOTARO] We combed the newspaper
for several days after that.

399
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,416
The bodies of two
climbers were discovered.

400
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,833
They didn't make it, it seems.

401
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,208
They were found by
a police helicopter.

402
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,750
[ERU]
Oreki...

403
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,916
[HOTARO]
Hm?

404
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:43,125
[ERU] Would it be okay if
I asked you something?

405
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,500
[HOTARO]
Sure. What?

406
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,958
Why were you so
curious about this?

407
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,541
So, what, am I only
allowed to investigate

408
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,208
when you guys are curious?

409
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,208
Oh. You have a point there.

410
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,625
It just doesn't really seem like
something you would do.

411
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,375
Well, I guess you're
right about that.

412
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,833
I mean, after all, my motto is,

413
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,125
"If I don't have to,
I'm not going to."

414
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,208
Yeah, but that's not exactly
what I was trying to say.

415
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,083
[HOTARO] She didn't even bat
an eye at my immutable motto.

416
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,375
[ERU] Oreki, you do work hard
all the time for other people.

417
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,625
You've stepped in to help me
a lot since I've known you.

418
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,583
[HOTARO]
She's got it completely wrong!

419
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,000
[ERU]
However, I've got to say,

420
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,625
you're usually complacent
when it comes

421
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,333
to working for yourself.

422
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,541
But not today.

423
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,208
So I want to know what
made you investigate

424
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,833
for your own sake this time.

425
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,666
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,666
It's strange, but I just
have to know the answer.

427
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,708
[HOTARO] When Satoshi
told us about the lightning,

428
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,125
my mind associated it
with something awful.

429
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,458
[ERU] Yeah, I remember
you saying that.

430
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,666
[HOTARO]
I wanted to find out whether

431
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,208
I was right about it or not.

432
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,666
That's what motivated
me to investigate.

433
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,666
So then I went to the library.

434
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,333
If all of the research required
had been a major undertaking,

435
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,916
it would've been
a different story.

436
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,583
But since it was just a
matter of flipping through

437
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,958
old newspapers,
it was no big deal.

438
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,416
And you were there to help me.

439
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,666
If it turned out to be true,

440
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,750
then I should be more
careful about things.

441
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,250
What do you mean,
"careful"? How so?

442
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,041
[HOTARO] Maybe "mindful"
is a better word.

443
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,375
With all that happened,

444
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,625
I shouldn't talk about it
as casually as I did.

445
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,250
People died, you know?

446
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,458
The way I spoke
seems insensitive now.

447
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,666
And that's what I have
to be mindful about.

448
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,250
[HOTARO]
Was that hard to follow?

449
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,458
Insensitive's a strong word.

450
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,041
I just mean...

451
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,500
That sense of not taking how the
other guy feels into account.

452
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,833
I'll probably never
see Ogi again--

453
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,333
So his feelings might
not be of much concern.

454
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,375
[ERU]
Oreki...

455
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,541
That's very... I don't know.

456
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,083
I can't think
of the right word.

457
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,791
[HOTARO]
What is she trying to tell me?

458
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,250
Oh, well.

459
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,666
If she can't find
the words for it,

460
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,208
then I'm certainly not
going to press her.

461
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,750
[HOTARO]
Well, I gotta be going.

462
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,250
I really appreciate you
helping me out today, though.

463
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,708
You're very welcome.

464
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,333
Actually, I'm grateful
to have the opportunity

465
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,250
to see this other side of you.

466
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,166
Come on, don't say
stuff like that!

467
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,125
Oh! Sorry, you're right.

468
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,875
[ERU]
I'll see you later.

469
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,708
[HOTARO] By the time
Chitanda gets home,

470
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,083
night will have fallen.

471
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,166
But she's the one
who offered to tag along

472
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,500
in the first place.

473
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,375
I didn't exactly
ask her to help me.

474
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,916
Then again...

475
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,750
...this was my quest.

476
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,166
I owe her one.

477
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,666
[HOTARO] Next time:
"Does Anyone Have Any Idea?"
