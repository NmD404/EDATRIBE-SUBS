[HOTARO yawns]

5
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,791
Is that you, Sis?

6
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,166
[TOMOE] Guess who's
finally ho-oome?

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,708
[TOMOE chuckles]

8
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,208
I expect a big "welcome back"
hug when I come out.

9
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,208
I think I'll pass.

10
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,041
[TOMOE] After I've
been away for so long?

11
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,708
What a heartless little brother!

12
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,250
[HOTARO]
Hm.

13
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,625
Is this a souvenir
from South America?

14
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,291
[TOMOE] Sure is.
You wanted one, right?

15
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,875
No, not really.

16
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,583
[WEATHER GIRL] Good morning!
If you're just tuning in,

17
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,333
we're about to move on to
the national weather forecast.

18
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,500
[TOMOE] This is unusual.
Since when do you watch TV?

19
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,750
What about the paper?

20
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,916
[HOTARO] I don't feel
like working my brain.

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,291
[TOMOE]
Hmm.

22
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,500
[WEATHER GIRL] We'll see it
sweep across the country

23
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,458
from west to east
over the next few hours,

24
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,375
clearing up cloudy skies
as it pushes through.

25
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,250
[TOMOE] Your calendar
looks pretty empty.

26
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,083
[HOTARO] My schedule
is packed full.

27
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,250
[TOMOE]
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

28
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,791
[HOTARO]
Napping.

29
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,083
I know about a job
where you can get paid

30
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,458
for just sitting there
all day long. Want it?

31
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,458
[HOTARO]
Mmm.

32
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,500
[TOMOE] Well?
You interested?

33
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,833
[HOTARO]
Mmm.

34
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,791
[TOMOE] That sounds
like a "yes" to me.

35
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,208
I'll let them know
to expect you.

36
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,875
[WEATHER GIRL] Taking a look
at our extended forecast,

37
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,375
you'll see that as
we enter September,

38
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,916
the mornings will
finally cool off...

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,291
[TOMOE]
Here.

40
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,958
You're going to need this.

42
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,500
[TOMOE]
Yes, Oreki residence?

43
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,250
Oh, hi Satoshi!
It's been a long time, huh?

44
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,208
Yeah. I just got back.

45
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:07,291
Hotaro? Sure, he's here.
Hold on a sec, 'kay?

46
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,000
Hotaro! Satoshi's on
the phone for you.

47
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,750
[HOTARO]
Mmm.

48
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,041
[SATOSHI] Hey. You know that
book I lent you last week?

49
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,583
You done reading it yet?

50
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,708
[HOTARO]
Mmm.

51
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,875
[SATOSHI]
Is that a "yes"?

52
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,958
'Cause if you are,
I'd like to get it back.

53
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,291
[HOTARO]
Mmm.

54
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,541
[SATOSHI] So, can I
come pick it up today?

55
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,625
Mmm. Just stop by
after I get off work.

56
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,625
[SATOSHI]
Huh?

57
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,583
After I get off work.

58
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,708
[SATOSHI] A job?
You have a job?

59
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,166
I don't understand.
What's going on?

60
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,208
[HOTARO] It's no big deal.
I'm just filling in

61
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,083
as a lifeguard over
at the municipal pool

62
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,583
for somebody my sister knows.

63
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,708
[SATOSHI] Ahh. Your sister.
That explains it.

64
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,541
Still, the thought of you doing
actual work boggles the mind.

65
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,625
[HOTARO] Well, anyway,
I've got to get going.

66
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,583
[SATOSHI] All right.
Maybe I'll stop by the pool

67
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,625
for a swim later.

68
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,625
[HOTARO]
Suit yourself. See ya.

69
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,166
[SATOSHI]
Bye.

70
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,000
[children laugh]

71
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,208
[SATOSHI]
Hotaro!

72
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,125
Hey! How's it going?

73
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,833
[ERU giggles]

74
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,166
[HOTARO] I didn't
realize all three of you

75
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,625
were going to show up.

76
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,083
I called the ladies right
after we got off the phone.

77
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,166
I said if they came with me,

78
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,000
they'd see a truly
exceptional sight.

79
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,125
Yeah, you did.
So where is it, then?

80
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,666
Right there!
The elusive Working Hotaro.

81
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,083
I gotta tell you,
I'm a little underwhelmed.

82
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,666
Not me! We all get to hang
out at the pool together.

83
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,875
I think this is going to be fun!

84
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,500
Yeah. You're right.
Let's make the best of it.

85
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,750
[ERU laughs]

86
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,166
[MALE VOICE]
Hey, you creep!

87
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,250
Unless you're
looking for trouble,

88
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,916
you better keep
your eyes off my girl!

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,250
Calm down.
He wasn't doing anything.

90
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,916
Yeah, I was
just standing here.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,208
Sir, please take it easy,

92
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,041
or I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

93
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,875
What's all that about?

94
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,958
[HOTARO] Whatever's going on, I
just hope I can stay out of it.

95
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,291
[MOTHER] Come on,
sweetie, you can do it!

96

[KID]
Catch!

97
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,041
Are you ready, Mayaka?
It's coming your way!

98
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,125
And... go!

99
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,916
Here!

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,791
[SATOSHI grunts]

101
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,166
It's all yours.

102
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,875
You can do it!
Spike that ball!

103
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,208
Huh? Spike? I... Oh!

104
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,333
[MAYAKA laughs]

105
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,166
That was a pretty sad showing.

106
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,666
Right! Penalty game!
You know what to do.

107
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,166
[ERU sighs]

108
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,791
Ah! I'm sorry!
They made me!

109
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:12,125
[SATOSHI and MAYAKA laugh]

110
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,333
You watching?

111
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,375
[SATOSHI]
Whoo!

[SATOSHI]
All right, get ready!

117
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,000
Here... I... come!

118
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,041
Wooohoohoo!

119
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,583
[MAYAKA and ERU laugh]

120
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,000
[MAYAKA] You think
you're funny, don't you?

121
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,333
[HOTARO sighs]

122
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,000
[LIFEGUARD]
Hey!

123
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,875
Time to switch up. You can
take your lunch break now.

124
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,666
[ERU]
Hey, Oreki.

125
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,416
We were going to eat too,
if you'd like to join us.

126
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,625
If I'd had a little more
warning, I could've made

127
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,375
something a lot better
than this for lunch,

128
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,375
but I guess it'll have to do.

129
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,875
Hey, don't look at me.
This one's all on Hotaro.

130
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,375
Yeah, why do you say that?

131
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,708
He's a monument to idleness!
Look in the dictionary and

132
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,958
you'll see his picture next to
the word. Then out of nowhere,

133
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,458
he suddenly decides to
start earning a living.

134
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,416
He should've told us
about it immediately.

135
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,416
Really. Why didn't you?

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,375
[ERU]
Heh...

137
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,625
Well, anyway. I'm glad we
all got together like this.

138
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,375
It's been a lot of fun!

139
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,750
Mm. Totally.

140
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,375
I have to say, though, it's
not exactly a perfect match.

141
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,333
What's not a perfect match?

142
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,958
[SATOSHI]
The pool and Hotaro.

143
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,166
[MAYAKA chuckles]
That's for sure.

144
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,166
Come on, you two,
that's not very nice.

145
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,583
[MAYAKA] Swimsuits and Oreki
don't go together either!

146
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,416
Yep! The sun and Hotaro, there's
another bad match for ya.

147
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,416
[MAYAKA laughs]
The sea and Oreki!

148
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,208
How about summer
and Hotaro?

149
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay, enough already.
Tell them to stop, Oreki.

150
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,541
[HOTARO]
Hm.

151
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,000
[SATOSHI] All right. Anybody
else wanna get back in the pool?

152
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,875
Sounds good to me. I'll take
care of throwing out our trash.

153
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,833
I have a few more bites,
but when I'm done,

154
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,291
I'll put our chairs back.

155
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,833
There we go.

156
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,333
[BOY cries]
[ERU gasps]

157
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,458
Aww. One ice cream
wasn't enough, huh?

158
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,500
Well, you certainly do have
a sweet tooth, don't you?

159
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,125
All right, you win.
Let's go and get you another.

160
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,375
That startled me
for a second.

161
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,958
Yeah.

162
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,375
So, are you liking
the job so far?

163
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,291
Sure. It's okay.

164
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,500
I've always wondered what
being a lifeguard was like.

165
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,875
[ERU gasps]
Look how fast they are!

166
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,250
I wonder if they're training
to be competitive swimmers

167
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,833
when they get older.

168
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,125
You never know, one of
them might even win

169
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,791
a gold medal at
the Olympics someday.

170
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,583
[HOTARO]
Yeah, maybe.

171
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,125
[ERU]
Huh?

172
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,708
It all just comes down to
what kind of person they are.

173
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,083
You know what I mean?

174
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,208
If they're special,
they'll do something great.

175
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,041
If they're average, they'll
just lead an average life.

176
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:26,291
And what about you? Have you
ever wanted to be special?

177
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,375
Not really. I'm just
a regular guy,

178
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,541
and that's all right with me.

179
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,791
That's not true. You are
special! To me, anyway!

180
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,041
[HOTARO]
Huh?

181
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,250
And the same thing goes
for Fukube and Mayaka.

182
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,125
You might not think of
yourselves as being special,

183
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,833
but I do because
you're my friends!

184
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,041
I'm not talking about
subjective opinions.

185
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,458
Objectively speaking, I'm not--

186
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,500
My opinion should count too!

187
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,875
I don't think it's a simple
matter of looking around

188
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,125
and categorizing everyone
as either special or average.

189
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,583
There's more to life than that.

190
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,833
As long as there's someone,
even just one person,

191
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,500
who thinks you're special,
I think that means you are!

192
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:11,250
Oh. I'm sorry. I just, uh...
I should get going.

193
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,875
[CHILD]
Ha ha ha! Wait up!

194
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,666
[ERU laughs]

195
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,000
That's not true.
You are special!

196
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,791
My opinion should count too!

197
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,416
[ALL THREE laugh]

198
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,500
Okay, Oreki.
It's your break time.

199
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,625
I'll take over here
for a little bit.

200
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,750
[ERU] So...
Are you on break?

201
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,416
[HOTARO]
Mm.

202
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,750
Well, um... There's something
that I'm sort of curious about.

203
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,958
[HOTARO]
Huh?

204
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,208
Yeah, it has to do with
the serious business

205
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,250
of lifeguarding.

206
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,708
[ERU] You see the
woman over there--

207
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,000
the one in the red swimsuit?

208
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,000
[HOTARO]
Mm.

209
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,458
[ERU] She's the same
one we saw earlier

210
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,125
when we were finishing lunch.

211
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,250
I remember that she had
something white on her ear.

212
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:30,000
But then I looked at her again
just now, and it's not there.

213
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,500
I'm surprised you noticed
something that tiny.

214
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,916
[ERU] I notice little things
about people sometimes.

215
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,583
I don't know why.

216
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,083
So? Why ask me about it?

217
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,083
Well, as one of the pool's
lifeguards, we thought

218
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,833
you'd be concerned about
the potential safety hazard.

219
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,583
If there's an earring
lying around out there,

220
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,666
someone could step
on it and get hurt.

221
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,833
[pop]

222
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:59,541
So, anyway. I thought maybe
you could look for it with us.

223
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,000
[HOTARO] Find one earring
in a place like this?

224
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,541
Is she kidding?

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,625
And you're sure you saw
something on her ear earlier?

226
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,791
Yes.

227
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,583
Even so, before we
start an all-out search,

228
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,916
maybe we should
verify that with her.

229
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,416
[I thought of doing
that, but, well...

230
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,958
I'm worried that
I'll get yelled at.

231
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,291
All you're doing is
asking about an earring.

232
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,708
I'm sure you'll be fine.

233
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,750
Then how about
you go and ask her?

234
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,041
Thanks, I'm good.

235
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,083
[MAYAKA]
Hmph.

236
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,875
Please, I'd
appreciate it so much!

237
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,416
[MAYAKA] Come on.
Isn't this a lifeguard's job?

238
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,791
[SATOSHI] Well?
What do you say?

239
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,416
[HOTARO sighs]

240
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,666
Please help!
I have to know!

241
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,750
[HOTARO gasps]

242
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,625
[HOTARO sighs]

243
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,666
[CHIEF LIFEGUARD]
Huh?

244
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,708
That jerk from before?

245
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,291
I don't wanna get him
riled up again, y'know?

246
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,791
Yeah.

247
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,125
Tell ya what, I don't want to
turn this into a big deal.

248
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,166
So let's look for it discreetly.

249
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,875
Sure. It'll be slow-going
alone, though.

250
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,125
[CHIEF LIFEGUARD]
Right.

251
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,958
Well, you're not the only
lifeguard we have.

252
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,625
I'll get the others
to check the poolside.

253
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,375
As for you... you can
start inside the pool.

254
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,416
'Kay.

255
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,833
Don't worry. I'll help look.

256
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,416
Yeah, same goes for me.

257
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,333
Well...
Guess I'm in too, then.

258
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,625
Okay, thanks.

259
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,041
All right everybody,
what's the best way

260
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,541
to start looking for it?

261
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,375
Our best bet's probably to
split the place into sections.

262
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,666
Good idea. What do
you think of that, Oreki?

263
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,166
Knock yourselves out.

264
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,666
Seriously, would it kill you
to show a little initiative?

265
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,916
You're the lifeguard here,

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,041
so that means you should
be the one in charge.

267
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,000
Just assign us to
different parts of the pool.

268
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,041
[HOTARO]
Mmm.

269
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,875
Okay, fine, I'll take
care of it then. So...

270
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,916
Chitanda and Mayaka,
you two have the stair area.

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,291
Hotaro gets the slide area. And
I'll take the diving board area.

272
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,583
Well? Sound okay?

273
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,708
Yes, leave it to us!

274
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,958
Sure, why not?

275
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,500
Whatever.

276
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,166
Just curious...

277
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,166
[HOTARO]
Hm?

278
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,583
Why did you take this job?

279
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,791
Did you owe your big
sister or something?

280
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,500
No, I just took it.

281
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,458
That's not really staying
true to your motto.

282
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,083
What happened to "If I don't
have to, I'm not going to"?

283
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,458
What's it matter to you?

284
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,708
All right! Better!

285
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,583
I'm glad to get a reaction
out of you finally,

286
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,166
even if it is a pissy one.
Much less boring.

287
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,333
[HOTARO]
Ah...

288
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,625
See ya. Happy hunting.

289
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,333
[MAYAKA]
Oreki!

290
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,375
Doesn't look like you're
working very hard.

291
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,541
I'm pulling my weight.
I just found something

292
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,083
at the bottom of the pool
and came to throw it away.

293
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,625
Sure you did.

294
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,541
[MAYAKA sighs]

295
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,583
You know what? Just looking
at you right now is enough

296
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:51,916
to drain all my energy. I'm
practically falling asleep here.

297
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,458
So stop looking at me.

298
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,625
I'm used to being annoyed or
exasperated when I look at you.

299
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,583
This is different, though.

300
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,750
[MAYAKA] Either way, you're a
real pain most of the time.

301
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,083
But do us all a favor.

302
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,041
Go back to being the kind
of pain you used to be.

303
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,958
You're a lot more fun to be
around when you actually talk.

304
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,166
More fun to be
around... Huh?

305
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,166
[HOTARO gasps]

306
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,666
[MAYAKA]
Any luck?

307
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,333
No, none. But...

308
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,916
I don't think we need to
keep looking anymore.

309
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,291
Ah! I know what
that means, Hotaro.

310
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,875
You've figured it out,
haven't you?

311
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,416
[ERU gasps]

312
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,791
[HOTARO] Yeah.
I think I've got it.

313
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,291
Chitanda.

314
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,291
Are you sure it was an earring
you saw the woman wearing?

315
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,625
Am I a hundred percent sure?
I guess not. All I can say

316
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:09,458
for certain is there was
something white on her left ear.

317
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,958
[MAYAKA] What else
could it be, though?

318
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,208
There's no other jewelry you
wear on your ears, is there?

319
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,375
[HOTARO] Right.
That's what I'm wondering:

320
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,916
what else could it be?

321
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,166
What if we assume it wasn't
actually jewelry to begin with?

322
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,333
What? Now you've lost me.

323
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,333
Look at what she's
doing right now.

324
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,791
If she were wearing
anything in her ears,

325
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,916
would she be smacking
them like that?

326
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,541
Sounds like it would be
kind of painful to me.

327
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,333
[SATOSHI]
What's your point?

328
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,750
[HOTARO] I would guess
that whatever she had

329
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,791
on her ear was probably
something that got there

330
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,541
without her even knowing it.

331
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,333
[MAYAKA] All right, then. What
do you think it could've been?

332
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,250
[HOTARO]
That's the question.

333
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,416
Satoshi. Would you do me
a favor and pick Ibara up?

334
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,750
Sure.

335
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,291
[MAYAKA]
Mm...

336
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,125
No! I don't want him to.

337
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,958
All right, what if
Chitanda does it?

338
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,250
That's not gonna make it
any less embarrassing.

339
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,750
I don't wanna be picked up like
I'm some little kid, okay?

340
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,333
[HOTARO]
Well, that's a shame.

341
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,375
Since seeing a little kid picked
up is exactly what I'm after.

342
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,041
Why do you want somebody to
pick me up in the first place?

343
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,750
'Cause I'm trying
to prove a theory.

344
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,666
About whatever was
on the woman's ear?

345
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,750
Yeah.

346
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,333
[MAYAKA]
Hm...

347
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,083
I'm game if you are.
What can it hurt?

348
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,625
Eh...

349
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:33,125
Ah, all right, you win.
I'll sacrifice my dignity.

350
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,833
[MAYAKA gasps]

351
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,416
Impressive, Chitanda. I didn't
know you were so strong.

352
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,750
[MAYAKA] What's that
supposed to mean?

353
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,625
Whoa, hold on! I didn't
mean it that way, I swear.

354
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,250
It was just, y'know, a general
observation, that's all.

355
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,208
Yep. It fits.

356
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,541
What fits? Were you able
to prove your theory?

357
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,750
[HOTARO] It's her hand. She's
resting it on your shoulder.

358
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,000
So... Can she stop
holding me now?

359
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,666
Yeah. I've seen enough.

360
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,208
[ERU]
Down you go.

361
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,708
Look over there
for a second.

362
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,958
[HOTARO] Earlier, I saw
the woman in the red suit

363
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,625
holding that kid. Exactly the
way Chitanda was holding Ibara.

364
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,041
If he was eating an ice cream
cone like that at the same time,

365
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,583
what would've happened?

366
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,208
[SATOSHI] I get it!
The cone would've been

367
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,250
at the perfect height to get
ice cream on the woman's ear!

368
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,958
[HOTARO]
And there you have it.

369
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:29,125
Ah... So that explains why
it isn't there anymore.

370
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,833
[HOTARO] Either it washed off
while she was swimming

371
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,375
or she just wiped
it off herself.

372
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,583
Case closed. Mystery solved.

373
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,041
You know, Oreki...

374
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,375
Yeah, what's up?

375
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,000
[ERU]
Well, um... It's just...

376
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,750
That was great! I think
the way you're able

377
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:50,125
to figure things out makes
you a really special person!

378
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,583
Heh. Flattery will get
you nowhere with me.

379
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,583
--[SATOSHI] Hm.
--[MAYAKA] Hm.

380
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,833
Sure.

381
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,083
And here I was
starting to think

382
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,583
we'd never hear another
snappy retort from you!

383
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,916
Would that be so bad?

384
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,500
You wouldn't think.

385
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,916
But you were totally weirding us
out for a little while there.

386
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,916
[HOTARO]
Hmph.

387
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,500
[ERU laughs]

388
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:20,583
Ah! Sorry! I just realized
I haven't thanked you yet.

389
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:25,083
Thanks a lot. Sorry to bother
you with something like this.

390
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,375
I made a big fuss.
And it was all for nothing.

391
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,708
Hey. I...

392
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,875
No, you shouldn't apologize.
I mean, I'm the one

393
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,291
who thought it was an
earring in the first place.

394
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,375
I'm sorry. Really.

395
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,166
Seriously, it's no big deal.

396
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,208
Alllriiight! I don't know
about the rest of you,

397
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,500
but all this searching
has made me hungry.

398
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,041
I could really go
for some ice crea--

399
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:50,666
What's up? Why'd you cut off
like that? Ah! <i>Hyouka</i> !

400
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,083
I seem to remember you solemnly
swearing to me that you

401
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,000
would have your <i>Hyouka</i> draft
done by tomorrow, rain or shine!

402
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,083
Well, Fuku.
Have you finished it yet?

403
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,833
Well, I guess you could say I
have it more or less finished.

404
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,333
Give or take a page or two.

405
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,250
So the answer is no. It isn't
finished. Is that correct?

406
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,375
Yeah. I guess you
could say that, too.

407
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,416
That is exactly
what I would say!

408
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,625
We're leaving! I'm taking
you home right now,

409
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,208
and you're going
to write that draft!

410
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,291
I don't care how long it takes,
I'm not letting you

411
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,125
out of my sight
until it's done!

412
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,666
Look. There's not
much left to do.

413
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,625
I can take care of it myself,
I promise, okay?

414
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,750
[MAYAKA]
I don't believe you!

415
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,250
Sorry to leave
like this, you guys,

416
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,000
but a deadline's a deadline.
See you tomorrow.

417
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,791
Well, wish me luck--ah! Ah!

418
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,250
[ERU chuckles]

419
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,916
I hope it doesn't take too
long to get the draft done.

420
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,500
Oh, I'm sure it will.

421
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,166
For those two, I think the
thrill is all in the chase.

422
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,666
I wish they'd get to it already.

423
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,708
The thrill is in the chase, huh?

424
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,458
Well, I guess I dragged
you along on a chase

425
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:48,333
of my very own, didn't I?
Sorry I'm always doing that.

426
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,791
Yeah, seriously.
You can be a real nuisance.

427
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,000
Hey, that's not a
nice thing to say.

428
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:58,458
On the other hand, maybe
that's not such a bad thing.

429
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,458
Huh?

430
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,916
Nothing. Just forget about it.

431
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,458
[ERU]
Oh.

432
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,625
That's right,
I was wondering...

433
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,125
With that woman...

434
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,708
What gave you the idea that
it was ice cream on her ear?

435
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,208
Oh, that's simple.
Just look around.

436
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,791
Ice cream's the only thing
in this place that's white.

437
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,375
[HOTARO] I guess there
is one other thing.

438
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,958
[ERU]
Huh?

439
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,041
Well. I should probably
get going now, too.

440
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,666
Have fun. I guess
I'll see you later.

441
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,416
Uh. Yeah.

442
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,416
[LIFEGUARD]
Hey!

443
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,208
Break time's over.

444
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,833
All right.

445
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,375
Man, what a pain.
