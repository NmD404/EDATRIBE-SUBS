1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,250
[YOSHINO] So, Chitanda,
can you say with certainty

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,583
that you will catch
the phantom thief Jumoji?

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,791
[ERU]
Of course we will!

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,083
Well, that's our intention.

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,208
With all of your--

6
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,583
With everyone helping us out,

7
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,166
I don't think there's
any logical reason

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,000
that we wouldn't be
able to catch Jumoji!

9
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,166
Whoa, that's a
pretty bold statement!

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,541
Then my next question:

11
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,958
What do you think
Jumoji is after now?

12
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,750
[ERU] Well, we've already
gotten something ready

13
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,000
that fits his pattern of thefts:
proofed manuscripts.

14
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,208
[YOSHINO]
Proofed manuscripts?

15
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,041
[ERU]
Yes.

16
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,375
Corrected drafts of the Classic
Lit Club's anthology, <i>Hyouka</i> .

17
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,375
[MAYAKA]
Huh?

18
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,875
Are there fewer of them?

19
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,541
[ERU] Our anthology contains
a story no less compelling

20
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,583
than the Jumoji Caper,
so come pick one up!

21
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,166
Because if you like
mystery as much as we do,

22
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,791
you'll love this tale
that will keep you

23
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,541
on the edge of your seat!

24
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,916
Wow, that does sound
pretty intriguing!

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,083
[ERU]
Yes.

26
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,625
Everyone!
Please come check out

27
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,041
the Classic Lit Club's
anthology, <i>Hyouka</i> !

28
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,166
It's great! I know
you're all gonna love it!

29
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,416
Thanks!

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
One more thing,

31
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,250
as we're getting ready to roll
out the red carpet for Jumoji,

32
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,375
we'd like to ask
everyone for a small favor.

33
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,875
[YOSHINO]
Oh, yeah? And what's that?

34
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,541
[ERU] Well, since there are
only four of us in the club,

35
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,750
we need help keeping
an eye on everything.

36
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,791
So everyone, if you
have some free time,

37
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,375
come help the Classic Lit Club!

38
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,500
And I mean everyone!

39
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,333
We are counting on
all of you to help!

40
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,458
[YOSHINO]
I understand!

41
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,458
Strength in numbers, am I right?

42
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,583
Yes!

43
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,125
We expect everyone
to come help us out!

44
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,625
Thanks in advance!

45
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,750
Hmm... I've always been a
sucker for a desperate request!

46
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,250
[ERU gasps]
Another thing...

47
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,875
...if you come by and
you think you can...

48
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,208
...please buy
an anthology. Okay?

49
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,916
And so, the final target,

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,541
the Classic Lit Club,
is more than ready to engage!

51
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,666
Well, Chitanda, happy hunting!

52
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,041
[ERU]
Thank you for your time.

53
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,416
We hope you all decide
to stand with us.

54
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,541
[YOSHINO]
That was Eru Chitanda, everyone!

55
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,250
[BROADCAST CLUB BOY 16A]
Okay, we're off the air.

56
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,125
[ERU sighs]

57
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,625
Hey, that was a
decent interview!

58
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,583
[ERU]
Thank you very much.

59
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,750
[YOSHINO]
Is something wrong?

60
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,958
Nothing.

61
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,041
I'm just not sure if I
should be doing all of this.

62
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,125
[sighs]

63
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,958
One, please.

64
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,083
200 yen.

65
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,208
One, please.

66
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,333
200 yen.

67
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,375
[BOY 17B]
One, please.

68
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,416
[HOTARO] Whoa! They're
selling! This is great!

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,291
We're so close.
Almost sold out.

70
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,000
[BOY 17C] Do you think
he's really coming?

71
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,500
[GIRL 17B] As packed as
this place is right now,

72
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,916
he couldn't make his move!

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,083
[GIRL 17C]
Yeah, you're right.

74
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,583
It'd be impossible like this.

75
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,833
How long do you think this thief
is going to make us wait?

76
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,291
Does Jumoji even exist?

77
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,791
[BOY 17E] Could they be doing
all of this themselves?

78
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,375
[GIRL 17E] Yeah, I hadn't
even thought of that!

79
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,583
[BOY 17F] Show yourself,
already, Jumoji.

80
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,333
--[cell phone ringing]
--[STUDENTS gasp]

81
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,125
[SATOSHI] Sorry about that.
Just my cell phone.

82
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,333
[MAYAKA]
Geez.

83
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,416
You gonna answer?

84
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
Nah. Not till after
our watch--

85
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,916
[STUDENTS gasp, scream]

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,791
[BOY 17A]
Hey, it's on fire!

87
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,500
It's on fire!

88
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,125
[BOY 17C]
Put it out! Put it out!

89
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,625
[coughs]

90
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,833
[STUDENTS whispering]

91
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,291
[ERU]
Water?

92
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,875
[SATOSHI]
We've been had.

93
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,916
[STUDENTS chattering]

94
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,583
Look. He left this.

95
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,666
[SATOSHI] It's Jumoji's
confession note, all right.

96
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,541
[BOY 17G] I hate to say,
"I told you so."

97
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,375
[BOY 17A] Wait, you never
said this would happen!

98
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,375
[BOY 17B]
He got them good, huh?

99
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,041
[STUDENTS chattering]

100
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,041
[GIRL 17A] Now I'm thinking
Jumoji might be a girl!

101
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,291
[GIRL 17B] Huh?
What makes you say that?

102
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,000
[GIRL 17A]
I mean, just think about it.

103
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,041
[chattering continues]

104
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,000
We sold out.

105
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,083
Huh?

106
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,958
I'm sorry I couldn't sell
them at the list price.

107
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,291
No, don't worry!
This is great!

108
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,916
Thanks so much. I mean it.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Really, you have no idea!

110
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,583
[IRISU] Oh, stand up.
And another thing...

111
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,708
[ERU]
Yes?

112
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,250
I don't know if I
should tell you this...

113
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,375
Should tell me what?

114
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,375
[IRISU]
I heard your radio broadcast.

115
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,166
[ERU] Oh, did you think that I
followed your advice correctly?

116
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,791
[IRISU]
Look, about that...

117
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,625
My advice was
a bit too literal.

118
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,583
I want to be clear about this.

119
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,458
You aren't really suited
for stuff like that.

120
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,041
When you try so
hard to manipulate

121
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,958
the expectations of others,
you come across

122
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,416
as kind of needy.

123
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,416
[ERU]
Needy?

124
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,625
Do you really think
that's how I sounded?

125
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,500
[IRISU] Maybe as much as
the tip of my little finger.

126
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,416
However, sometimes, if you
pretend to be something,

127
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,458
you wind up becoming that way
in your real life somehow.

128
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,666
[ERU]
Right.

129
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,208
You'd really do better
to not take my words

130
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,458
at face value if you're only
going to botch the execution.

131
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,375
You might see your
inability to manipulate

132
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,125
as a shortcoming, but under
the right circumstances,

133
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,208
it's a valuable weapon.

134
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,625
So... You understand?

135
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,333
Yes. I was kind of
thinking the same thing!

136
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:35,625
I'm just not cut out
for this sort of stuff.

137
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,458
I guess, what I mean is...

138
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,083
Well... I've had enough.

139
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,291
[GIRL 17F]
That was exciting.

140
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,666
[TANI] Wow, not even
the Classic Lit Club

141
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,333
could catch Jumoji, huh?

142
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,333
I expected so much from you.

143
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,083
[SATOSHI]
Yeah, well...

144
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,083
Sorry I haven't lived up
to your expectations.

145
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,375
No way.

146
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,666
It was still an entertaining
cultural festival.

147
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,750
Plus, I got my revenge
for the cooking competition.

148
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,875
See ya.

149
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:08,958
Who's he?

150
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,208
That's Tani.

151
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,041
He doesn't get the
subtleties of language.

152
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,000
You know?

153
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,458
What do you mean?

154
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,833
He said "expected."

155
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,625
That's not really what
you say to your opponent

156
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,083
when neither of you won.

157
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,208
Why does that matter?
"Expected"--

158
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,041
Using that word implies
that it's finished.

159
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:30,041
If you still believe in
yourself, it's not appropriate.

160
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,750
The way he phrased it...

161
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,791
It's not right,
'cause this isn't over.

162
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,041
Unless there's no hope,

163
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,875
and things have gone
worse than imagined,

164
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,083
there's no point
in using that word.

165
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,375
Fukube...

166
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,541
Anyway, the cards
haven't all fallen.

167
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,291
[SATOSHI] I swear I saw
Hotaro come this way.

168
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,958
[SATOSHI]
There he is.

169
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,291
Let's cut to the chase,
then, shall we?

170
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,291
You are Jumoji, aren't you?

171
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,250
You might as well confess.

172
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,166
What? Just a shot in the dark?

173
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,125
[SATOSHI]
Tanabe's Jumoji?

174
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,708
First, there's your card.

175
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,500
Why does it always say "lost,"
rather than "stolen" or "taken?"

176
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,625
Who knows?

177
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,250
My next question deals
with the letter "ku."

178
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,791
Why did you skip it?

179
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,041
That alone should
eliminate the Jumoji theory,

180
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,541
but what if it dealt
with some element

181
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,791
that the rest of the school
didn't know anything about?

182
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,458
Something not meant
for the public.

183
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,333
[TANABE]
Oh? Like what?

184
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,041
The Jumoji Caper itself.

185
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,291
The entire affair was
only a code, wasn't it?

186
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,083
You had to deliver a message,

187
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,666
to one whose name
starts with "ku,"

188
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,125
and something beginning with
"ku" had already been lost.

189
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,625
It was two-fold.

190
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,250
That's a convoluted code
for relaying a message.

191
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,875
[HOTARO]
A layman could never crack it,

192
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,375
but if the recipient already
knew the rules of the cipher,

193
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,041
it would be easy.

194
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,708
To cut right to the chase...

195
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,541
I believe that was the plot
of <i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> ,

196
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,750
the manga you were
all planning to write.

197
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,916
You're wondering how on
Earth I could know the title.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,250
Isn't that right?

199
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,166
<i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i>
is a take on

200
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,458
one of Agatha Christie's
most famous works,

201
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,541
<i>The A.B.C. Murders.</i>

202
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,375
Same goes for the Jumoji Caper.

203
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,291
The culprit used <i>The</i>
<i>Kudryavka Sequence</i>

204
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,250
as his source material.

205
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,666
As for the intended recipient
of the coded message,

206
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,541
that's Muneyoshi Kugayama.

207
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,583
Student council president.

208
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,750
And the artist behind
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i> .

209
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,833
Am I wrong?

210
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,875
Hmm...

211
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,500
Why would all the
other targets be clubs,

212
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,875
and then switch
it up to have "ku"

213
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,500
represent someone's name?

214
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,625
Jumoji never wrote
anything to establish

215
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,458
that all the targets
would be clubs.

216
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,458
It's a bit thin.

217
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,125
[HOTARO]
It's not that thin at all.

218
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,166
You put out a list,

219
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,500
and implied that all
of your victims

220
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,416
would be chosen from
among those on it.

221
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,833
Copying the timetable bit
from <i>The A.B.C. Murders</i>

222
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,166
was obvious.

223
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,958
I mean, you had a list
already drawn up for you.

224
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,958
All the victims were together,
right here on this page.

225
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,791
The Acapella Club, the Go Club,

226
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,958
the Fortunetelling Club,
the Gardening Club,

227
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,166
the Cooking Club,
the Wall Newspaper Club,

228
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,791
the Magic Club, and finally...

229
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,500
...Muneyoshi Kugayama.

230
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,416
Once I put it all together,
it wasn't difficult

231
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,416
to trace back to you.

232
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,791
It's incredibly convenient
that all the targeted clubs

233
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,166
were listed together
on this page.

234
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,000
Only someone on
the executive committee

235
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,291
could have orchestrated
this page that way.

236
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,083
Fine, but there are 20 other
people on that committee.

237
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,208
Yes. That brings me
to the manga.

238
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,250
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i> .

239
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,166
President Kugayama, the author,

240
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,500
had teamed up with
Haruna Anjo on this one,

241
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,500
so he must have known about
<i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> .

242
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,500
That means President
Kugayama would also

243
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,541
be able to decipher
the Jumoji Caper's code.

244
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,625
One possibility is that Kugayama
lost the original story

245
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,833
for <i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> ,
thus providing a motive.

246
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,875
Jumoji could have concocted
this whole scheme

247
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,000
in order to exact
revenge for that, right?

248
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,833
Meaning the message
he was trying to relay

249
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,750
with these crimes is this:

250
00:11:54,833 --> 00:12:00,166
"Kugayama has already forfeited
his Kudryavka Sequence."

251
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,208
Now, consider this afterword: 

252
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,833
It was written by the
same person who helped

253
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,541
with the backgrounds.

254
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,208
Haruna Anjo.

255
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,708
President Kugayama.

256
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,708
Other than those two,
only one other person

257
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,541
knows the plot line of <i>The</i>
<i>Kudryavka Sequence</i> .

258
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,500
That person is the only
possible culprit here,

259
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,000
and then there's this:

260
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,500
"Takuha Ajimu."
That's quite an odd penname.

261
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,583
But it's just a mash-up
of the first characters

262
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,833
in the names of the three
people who wrote this, right?

263
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,083
[TANABE]
How's that?

264
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,958
[HOTARO] "Haruna Anjo"
gives us "Ha" and "A."

265
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,875
"Muneyoshi Kugayama."
There's the "Mu" and "Ku."

266
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,208
Take away those four letters,

267
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,958
and you're left with two
characters: "Ji" and "Ta."

268
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,833
It has to be a
second year or higher,

269
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,041
someone who was at last
year's cultural festival,

270
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,375
on the executive committee,

271
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,583
and whose initials
are "Ji" and "Ta."

272
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,541
We also can deduce
that it has to be someone

273
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,416
who knows President
Kugayama well enough

274
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,000
to know he draws manga.

275
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,916
There's only one person
who fits that bill.

276
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,083
And that would be you.

277
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,333
Jiro Tanabe.

278
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,416
Well done, sir.

279
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,291
I never imagined in
my wildest dreams

280
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,333
that anyone other than Mune
or Anjo would be able

281
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,791
to crack my little code.

282
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,583
I'll be damned.

283
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,750
Expectations, smashed.
Way to go.

284
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,708
[HOTARO] Why did you use
such a roundabout way

285
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,375
to send your message?

286
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,666
[TANABE]
I think you know the answer.

287
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,041
Is it because of your
feelings for Haruna Anjo,

288
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,833
who was transferred
to another school?

289
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,291
[TANABE laughs]
That was a part of it.

290
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,041
It's also just that it
was the cultural festival.

291
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,458
I was dying to pull off
a well-executed prank.

292
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,625
Although...

293
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,125
...not being able
to say it out loud...

294
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,000
That was the biggest reason.

295
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,166
[clears throat]

296
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,791
Well, there's another
matter I'd like to discuss.

297
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,083
I just have a small request
to make of you, Tanabe.

298
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,458
Yeah? What's that?

299
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,458
I'd like you to
buy these from me.

300
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:14,666
Thirty copies of <i>Hyouka</i> ,
our anthology.

301
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,500
Are you blackmailing
me into buying these

302
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,875
in exchange for your silence?

303
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,333
[HOTARO]
Yep.

304
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,958
I'm actually asking the
executive committee to buy them.

305
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,041
[TANABE]
That's absurd.

306
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,708
[HOTARO]
There's nothing absurd about it.

307
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,583
This is Kami High's website.

308
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,791
That's a mail-order link,
a place to buy items

309
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,625
from the cultural
festival, right?

310
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,916
You could have the executive
committee buy these,

311
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,458
then resell them through
this link on the website.

312
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,875
I can't just agree
to resell them

313
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,375
without a good reason.

314
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,416
There has to be some kind
of buzz about them first.

315
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,875
Absolutely.

316
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,750
But lucky for us, there's
already a good deal of hype

317
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,958
around <i>Hyouka</i> .

318
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,708
What are you talking about?

319
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,083
[HOTARO] Don't you know?
Jumoji, of course.

320
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,875
The Classic Lit Club is going
to be your final target.

321
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,666
I can help,
and Satoshi Fukube

322
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,083
will also be an accomplice
once I officially ask him.

323
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,833
You'll have inside
men at the target.

324
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,166
You couldn't ask
for an easier job.

325
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,375
People will flock to
the Classic Lit Club room

326
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,791
to try to catch Jumoji
at his last target.

327
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,583
The anthologies will
fly off the shelves,

328
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,500
creating a demand
for them online,

329
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,166
and then you'll sell them there.

330
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,750
It gives you the
perfect opportunity

331
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,125
to wrap up your scheme
in a nice little package.

332
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,375
What do you say?

333
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,125
[TANABE]
That's not bad.

334
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,166
Yeah, I like the sound of it!

335
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,083
A dramatic close
to the Jumoji Caper,

336
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,833
and also providing items
for the mail order site.

337
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,041
It's beneficial
to both parties.

338
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,250
[sighs]

339
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,791
I'm glad we agree.

340
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,083
[TANABE] So how do you plan
to aid and abet Jumoji

341
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
in his crimes?

342
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,208
[HOTARO] We'll prepare
a proofed manuscript,

343
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,000
which will be your target.

344
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,583
Then we'll post guards
to surround it,

345
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,500
so no one can get close.

346
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,750
[TANABE]
Oh? Then what?

347
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,916
According to the guidebook,

348
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,708
the Chemistry Club
is doing a demonstration

349
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,333
on what happens
when water is poured

350
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,250
directly over pure sodium.

351
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,875
I saw a video
of it once online.

352
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,000
It flares up, and looks
pretty spectacular.

353
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,875
You don't plan on
doing that, do you?

354
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,125
[HOTARO]
I do.

355
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,041
I want you to somehow
get ahold of the sodium.

356
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,208
Once you do that,
we'll need water pistols.

357
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,666
Some members of the Confection
Club are carrying them around.

358
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,750
You'll have to negotiate
with them for one.

359
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,583
You sure play a
dangerous game, don't you?

360
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,916
It's festival week.

361
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,208
Why don't we close
it out with a bang?

362
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,291
[chuckles]

363
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,833
All right.

364
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,416
[HOTARO] Then after we get the
sodium, I'll figure out a way

365
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,750
to slip some of it
into the manuscript pages.

366
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,083
Once we sell enough copies,

367
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,958
I'll give you a signal,
like this,

368
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,541
and that's when I want
you to shoot the pages

369
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,958
with the water pistol.

370
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,833
But everyone's going to
be watching the manuscript

371
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,791
like hawks, aren't they?

372
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,083
Yeah, that's true.

373
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,458
Okay, how about this:

374
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,208
I'll get Satoshi to put
his cell phone by the door.

375
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,208
Just call it before you
shoot the manuscript,

376
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,875
and it will divert
people's attention.

377
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,291
They won't know what hit them.

378
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,541
[TANABE]
Good idea.

379
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,666
What should we do
about the confession note?

380
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,500
The room will probably
devolve into chaos,

381
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,166
so just slip it into
a copy of <i>Hyouka</i>

382
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,333
and drop it on the floor.

383
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,791
That sounds good.

384
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,458
All right, well, you'll have
to buy a copy to do that.

385
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,125
That'll be 200 yen.

386
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,458
[chuckles]
You're quite the salesman.

387
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,500
We really are up a creek here,
so I'm desperate.

388
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,000
What did you say
your name was, again?

389
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,375
I'm Hotaro Oreki.
I'm from Class 1-B.

390
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,416
Are "expectations"
what pop into your mind

391
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,458
when you think about Oreki?

392
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,458
That's astute.
What gave it away?

393
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,666
[MAYAKA]
I can just tell by watching.

394
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,708
Only when it comes
to you, though.

395
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,125
[MAYAKA] Fuku, were you
trying to beat Oreki?

396
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,375
[SATOSHI] It's not that
I want to beat him.

397
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,750
I just look up to him a lot.

398
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,000
But...

399
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,666
I don't expect you to
understand that, Mayaka.

400
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,291
[MAYAKA]
No, I think I get it.

401
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,375
[SATOSHI]
Well, I really messed this up.

402
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,291
I forgot my main rule.

403
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,375
Databases can't ever
come up with conclusions.

404
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,958
[KUGAYAMA] And so,
the 54th Kanyasai closes

405
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,583
without incident.

406
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,833
Although...

407
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,625
...there were a number
of "odd occurrences."

408
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,666
[STUDENTS laughing]

409
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,666
Way to go! [laughs]

410
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,875
[KUGAYAMA] Anyway,
good work all around, folks.

411
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,916
I hereby declare the 54th annual

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,458
Kamiyama High School Cultural
Festival officially closed!

413
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,416
[STUDENTS cheering, clapping]

414
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,166
[MAYAKA] I know this may
be too little, too late,

415
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,500
but I brought it.

416
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,625
This manga was written
by someone whom I believe

417
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,916
will someday
write a masterpiece.

418
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,458
[KOCHI sighs]
You actually found a copy.

419
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,541
Yes.

420
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,875
This isn't mine, though.
I borrowed it.

421
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,000
But Kochi, you already knew
about this manga, didn't you?

422
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,375
Yuasa told you.

423
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,500
That jerk.

424
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,791
[MAYAKA]
She did.

425
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,583
Yuasa said that you
and the author used to be

426
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,250
close friends or something.

427
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,625
[KOCHI]
Friends? Yeah, that's right.

428
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,083
I wonder how Haruna
is doing these days.

429
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,041
It's been a while
since I've heard from her.

430
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,083
Have you ever read this manga?

431
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,291
[MAYAKA]
I have to say...

432
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,625
I think I understand what
you said a little better now.

433
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,500
That whether or not
a manga is appealing

434
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,041
is ultimately
a subjective matter.

435
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,750
I get it, but I still
don't think you're right

436
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,166
across the board.

437
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,833
I mean, that would
take all the hope

438
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,958
and fun out of reading,
wouldn't it?

439
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,291
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i>
is a perfect example.

440
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,333
It's a really serious title.

441
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,875
If I were only into gag manga,

442
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,125
I wouldn't even give it
a second thought.

443
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,708
That's just how people are.

444
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,916
But if they did read it,
they would like it!

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,125
Some works have a powerful
impact on people, regardless!

446
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,666
On those with
discerning tastes, maybe.

447
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,125
I don't agree!

448
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,666
I'm messing with you.

449
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm joking.

450
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,875
Come on, I feel the same
way you do about manga.

451
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,875
You're just too
passionate to see it.

452
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,125
You're so sincere.

453
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,916
It's all bluster.
Ayako doesn't mean it.

454
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,083
[KOCHI] That manga keeps
coming back to haunt me,

455
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,875
so I guess I'm supposed
to have this conversation.

456
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,166
I haven't read the whole thing.
I gave up halfway.

457
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,000
Know why?

458
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,583
[MAYAKA]
I don't.

459
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,333
[KOCHI] You told me before that
I would understand if I read it.

460
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,958
And I get it, I really do.
It's good.

461
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:02,041
But I don't actually want to
have to admit that it's good.

462
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,208
It's all about my pride.

463
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,125
Say you had a friend
who didn't read manga,

464
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,916
but knew you
were really into it.

465
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,083
Then that friend
teamed up with someone.

466
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,416
And decided to draw one herself.

467
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,750
So?

468
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,000
If it were great, wouldn't
you be a little angry?

469
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,791
[KOCHI] That's why I keep it
tucked in the back of my closet.

470
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,166
I swore I'd never read it.

471
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,291
Out of spite and pettiness,
I refused to open it.

472
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,583
I swore to always say
that it was no good.

473
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,875
But fate just had to keep
throwing it in my face.

474
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,000
Look, I'm sorry you went
and got a copy for me,

475
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,958
because I am still
not gonna read it.

476
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,083
[MAYAKA]
Wait...

477
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,875
[KOCHI]
I mean, if I were to read it,

478
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,625
then I'd be forced
to reach out to her.

479
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,333
And how could I bring
myself to say,

480
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,916
"I read it, and you're amazing!

481
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,166
I have really high expectations
for your next one!"

482
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,500
I can't make myself do that!
You know?

483
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,833
[MAYAKA] That cat...
It's from <i>Body Talk</i> !

484
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,708
A masterpiece is a
masterpiece from the beginning.

485
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,375
It doesn't become one.

486
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,625
[MAYAKA]
<i>Body Talk</i> .

487
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,500
There's no denying it's a step
below <i>A Corpse by Evening</i> .

488
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,333
My stuff is a
hundred steps below.

489
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:40,000
[MAYAKA crying]

490
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,458
[ERU] Is this pile really
all that's left of them?

491
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,541
--[HOTARO] Yeah.
--[SATOSHI] Whoa... Whoa!

492
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,000
I can't believe it!

493
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,500
I can't believe we
pulled this off!

494
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,500
[ERU]
It's incredible!

495
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,666
We sold almost 200 anthologies!

496
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,250
I never expected to do that!

497
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,375
"Expected."

498
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,583
Interesting.

499
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:01,166
Oh... nothing.

500
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,541
[HOTARO]
I can't ever tell Chitanda

501
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,125
that I resorted to blackmail
to sell these things.

502
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,458
[TANABE]
Hey, Oreki.

503
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,166
Earlier, you mentioned you
thought that the reason

504
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,125
I started this whole thing
was to get revenge

505
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,750
on Kugayama for losing
the <i>Kudryavka Sequence</i> ,

506
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,791
isn't that right?

507
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,375
It was just a hypothesis.

508
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,666
I have no real way of knowing
what your true motive was

509
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,833
in doing it.

510
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,541
Well, it's astute.

511
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,833
Especially because
Anjo is the only person

512
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,458
who truly knows how I feel.

513
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:31,416
Wait, are you saying
Kugayama has no idea?

514
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Yeah.

515
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,208
But the code was
invented and executed

516
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,708
with him in mind, right?

517
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,791
[TANABE]
That's correct.

518
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,125
[HOTARO]
Then what's the point?

519
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,166
[TANABE]
Ever since Mune--I mean,

520
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,708
ever since Kugayama finished
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i> ,

521
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:50,458
he hasn't picked up his pen
to write again, not even once.

522
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,583
Anjo is brilliant, too,
don't get me wrong,

523
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,583
but I had no idea Kugayama
could draw so well.

524
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,208
I wish I had his talent,
but I'm mediocre at best.

525
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:01,083
[growls] I couldn't
hold a candle to him!

526
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,750
I know the story isn't lost!

527
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,958
I think that if he would just
get his head in the right place,

528
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,750
he could create a masterpiece
that would blow

529
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,791
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i>
out of the water!

530
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,750
But as far as Mune is concerned,

531
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,791
drawing manga is something
he just did once on a lark.

532
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,208
[HOTARO]
He did that on a lark?

533
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,583
It's such a waste of talent.

534
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,625
You think it's a
shame, too, right?

535
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,375
But he doesn't have
any desire to draw.

536
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,166
I would have been willing
to do anything he said,

537
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,750
anything to help,
if he would just agree

538
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,875
to continue working on it.

539
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,375
But I was too afraid
to speak up.

540
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,416
I didn't want to admit
to myself that he might not

541
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,625
recognize the message.

542
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:43,333
And out of that denial,
my expectations were born.

543
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,833
I've been carrying them
around this whole time.

544
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,333
[HOTARO] But wouldn't it
have been a lot simpler

545
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,083
if you could just
tell him how you feel?

546
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,666
If you had asked him?

547
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,916
"Kugayama.

548
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,791
Have you even had a chance to
read <i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> " ?

549
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,125
You really are perceptive.

550
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,833
[HOTARO]
But you know his answer.

551
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:07,666
[TANABE]
Oh, you're right. I do.

552
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,666
Mune never opened the
story that Anjo poured

553
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,708
her heart and soul into.

554
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,833
So he couldn't have
cracked the code.

555
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,458
[TANABE]
My message didn't get through.

556
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,750
[MAYAKA]
Oreki.

557
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,500
Here, thanks for this.

558
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,500
Tell your sister
I said thanks, too.

559
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,583
Yeah.

560
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,500
What now?

561
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,500
Nothing. I'll tell her for you.

562
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:40,958
[ERU] So what should
we do about these

563
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,666
four leftover copies?

564
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,375
[SATOSHI]
There's nothing much we can do.

565
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,791
I guess we'll just have
to buy one copy each.

566
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,541
[ALL laugh]

567
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:59,541
[ERU]
And with that... we're sold out!

568
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,541
[ALL cheering]

569
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,000
[cheering continues]

570
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:08,708
All that's left is to find the
truth behind the Jumoji Caper.

571
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,958
And now, since there's
nothing standing in our way...

572
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,083
...we can use all
of our brain power!

573
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,375
Or... not.

574
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,625
Oh.

575
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,791
Actually, Hotaro already
figured that one out.

576
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,541
Leave it to him to
crack it on his own.

577
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:22,666
Huh? Did he really?

578
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,250
Is that true?

579
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,833
Well... I mean...

580
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:28,916
Yeah, why don't you tell us all
about your findings, Hotaro?

581
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,541
We can have our own little
selling-out celebration.

582
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,125
Oh!

583
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,041
Satoshi!

584
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,916
Come on, buddy, why don't
we all have some fun?

585
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,833
[HOTARO]
Huh?

586
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,458
[MAYAKA]
I am so down to party!

587
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,500
I didn't get to spend much time
with the Classic Lit Club.

588
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,916
So you have to tell me
everything that happened!

589
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,458
[ERU] Okay, why don't you guys
all come over to my place, then?

590
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,791
[SATOSHI]
All right, it's settled!

591
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,250
[HOTARO]
Wait, what's settled?

592
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,250
[MAYAKA] Yes! Time to get
out of here and cut loose!

593
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,750
We are drinking tonight!

594
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:55,666
[HOTARO]
Now we're drinking?

595
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,041
[MAYAKA]
Oolong tea, dummy!

596
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:59,333
[HOTARO] That's the lamest
thing I've ever heard.

597
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,041
[ERU] Next time: "Is the
Mountain Range Clear?"
