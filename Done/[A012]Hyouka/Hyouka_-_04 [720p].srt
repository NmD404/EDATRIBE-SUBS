1
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:15,750
[sneezes]

2
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,083
Unless we find
the first issue,

3
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,000
we're kind of
spinning our wheels.

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,041
Yeah, you're right.

5
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,500
[HOTARO] It might be a good
idea to bring Satoshi and Ibara

6
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,041
in on this.

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,333
No. I'd really rather not.

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,875
Well, it could take a long
time for us to solve this.

9
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:34,000
And we might not find anything
out before your uncle's funeral.

10
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,625
[ERU]
His funeral...

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,125
Fine, let's ask them.

12
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,458
I have a feeling
that we're gonna need

13
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,833
all the help we can
get to figure it out.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,375
I just... I have to know!

15
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,083
What happened to
my uncle so long ago

16
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,541
has weighed on me for years.

17
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,291
I'm begging you all
to help me find out.

18
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,625
Your uncle sounds
like an interesting guy.

19
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,458
Did all of that really happen?

20
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,208
The story of a
forgotten hero,

21
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,958
uncovered by his niece
45 years later.

22
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,625
You know, we were just looking
at some stuff from that period.

23
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,666
[MAYAKA]
That's true.

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,500
I'm also fascinated
by this picture.

25
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,250
I'd love to help
find out the truth.

26
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,625
[SATOSHI]
This is kind of exciting, huh?

27
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,333
If we figure it out,
we should write about it

28
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,833
in the anthology.

29
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,708
We can investigate all we want,
and call it club business.

30
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,833
[HOTARO] And so, this is the
story of how all the members

31
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,375
of the Classic Lit Club
became fully invested

32
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,750
in illuminating the
mysteries of its past.

33
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,458
Hey there!
Did you wait long?

34
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,125
Hey! What is your
problem, man?

35
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,416
Put a sock in it!

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,625
What the matter with you,
screaming like that?

37
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,166
Anyway, did you bring all
your research to present?

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,291
Of course, and what about you?
Did you find anything good?

39
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,875
Yeah, I found a few things.

40
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,083
Awesome. I'm looking forward to
hearing your hypothesis, too.

41
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,375
[HOTARO]
Aw, crap.

42
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,375
I forgot we were supposed
to come up with one.

43
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,458
[SATOSHI]
All right, let's get going.

44
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,541
The Chitandas are a
super-rich farming family,

45
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,875
so their mansion
should be top notch!

46
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,375
[SATOSHI humming]

47
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm glad you're enjoying
yourself so much.

48
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,166
What can I say,
I love cycling!

49
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,666
Speeding through
town like the wind

50
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,125
by the power of your legs
alone is thrilling, you know?

51
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,416
[HOTARO] Not that. I'm talking
about your whole attitude

52
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,541
about high school life so far.

53
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,958
Oh, right, the
"sunshine and roses" bit.

54
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,750
That's just me.

55
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,625
I like to stay sunny regardless
of my circumstances.

56
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,000
I'd say "sunny" is
putting it kinda mildly.

57
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,708
[laughs]
Whatever!

58
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,291
Why should anybody live their
life under a little black cloud?

59
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,208
You said that last
time we discussed this.

60
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,541
Did I really?

61
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,333
Well, I don't mean it as
an insult or anything bad;

62
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,833
it's just foreign to me.

63
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,083
[HOTARO]
Hmph.

64
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,916
I guess my attitude is
all sunshine and roses

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,083
at the end of the day.

66
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,333
You can throw shade
all you want,

67
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,916
but it's not gonna change that!

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,833
I won't be rained out!

69
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,791
Well, maybe you should
rein it in a little.

70
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,083
Not a chance, buddy!

71
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,458
What's the big problem?

72
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,375
You think I'm overextending
myself with all these

73
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,500
extracurricular
activities, is that it?

74
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,791
Well, am I wrong?

75
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,166
Yeah, you are.

76
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,708
Even if I weren't in clubs,
I'd find things to do.

77
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,375
I'm just an energetic
guy, you know?

78
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,916
And if I wanted
to insult you,

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,375
I'd call you boring,
not pessimistic.

80
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,500
Yeah, well, I really
don't care what you think

81
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,791
about me anyway.

82
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,208
[laughs]
That's pretty obvious!

83
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,375
Oh, hey, how did you end up
doing on your midterms?

84
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,958
[HOTARO]
Average overall, of course.

85
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,708
[SATOSHI] There's that
little black cloud again.

86
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,291
There it is, up ahead!

87
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,500
That's the Chitanda
family estate.

88
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,791
[SATOSHI]
What'd I tell ya?

89
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,791
Pretty sick digs, right?

90
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,166
Come on, they're probably
getting antsy in there.

91
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,250
[SATOSHI]
Fine. Hey, wait!

92
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,833
Wouldn't it be super cool if a
butler came to escort us in?

93
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,125
I'm glad you made it!

94
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,666
We thought you guys got lost!

95
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,791
Sorry.

96
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,625
Don't mind if I do.

97
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,583
Come on in, we're back here.

98
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,500
Sit where you want.
Make yourselves at home, okay?

99
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,083
You sure took your time.

100
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,083
[HOTARO] We aren't
even late, calm down.

101
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,166
[MAYAKA]
Hmph.

102
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,958
[HOTARO] I've never seen a man
less suited to take the seat

103
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,208
at the head of the table.

104
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,708
[ERU]
All right!

105
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,791
I guess we should get this
party started, don't you think?

106
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,500
Second!

107
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,166
Sure!

108
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,500
Yeah.

109
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,208
The purpose of today's
meeting is to investigate

110
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,708
what took place within the
Classic Lit club 45 years ago.

111
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,708
If we do happen to
find out anything,

112
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,416
then I want to include
it in the anthology

113
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,958
for the festival this year.

114
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,541
First, let's each share reports
on any data we've gathered,

115
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,708
followed by some Q and A
about those findings,

116
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,666
then propose our hypotheses.

117
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,583
Finally, we'll discuss
the various theories

118
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,625
and decide how we
should proceed from there.

119
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,875
[HOTARO] Dang, she's
kind of a natural leader.

120
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,875
Okay, who do we
think should go first?

121
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,125
I mean... uh...

122
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,541
Oh, geez, I can't decide
who should start.

123
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,875
[HOTARO]
I take it back.

124
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,041
Does it really matter?

125
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,166
Chitanda, why don't you
lead us off, okay?

126
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,708
Right, good idea.

127
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,583
I'll begin, and then we'll go in
clockwise order from there.

128
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,125
I decided to research the
old anthology, titled <i>Hyouka</i> .

129
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,958
The only reference I
could find to the events

130
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,291
of our investigation
was in this forward.

131
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,375
I compiled all the facts
from it and included them

132
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,083
on the second page.

133
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,708
Let's look at item one.

134
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,083
"Senpai" refers to
my uncle, Jun Sekitani,

135
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,583
the subject of our quest.

136
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,208
We know that Jun was
kicked out of Kamiyama High,

137
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,958
and thus his
academic career ended

138
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,000
as a middle school graduate.

139
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,291
Item two just shows
that the story became

140
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,458
more exaggerated as time passed.

141
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,541
He started as a hero and
turned into a legend.

142
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,083
Items three and five
are connected.

143
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,791
He was a quiet
and kind "senpai,"

144
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:50,000
and once he turned "warrior,"
he morphed into a "hero."

145
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,000
In the end...

146
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,291
...he became a martyr.

147
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:58,375
Item four is curious to me,
but we'll talk about that later.

148
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,000
That concludes my presentation.

149
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,500
What do you think?
Any questions for me?

150
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,958
[MAYAKA]
I have one.

151
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,583
Why did you leave out the
part where the author says,

152
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,750
"It was in no way
a heroic tale?"

153
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,083
[ERU] Because that's an opinion,
and I only included facts.

154
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,583
Maybe by that, they
just mean the fights

155
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,041
were really scrappy.

156
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,250
That they weren't anything
awe-inspiring or remarkable.

157
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,666
That could be true.

158
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,458
Okay, now let me
tell you my hypothesis.

159
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,208
I think my uncle may have
protested some school policy,

160
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,375
and was asked to
leave as a result.

161
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,583
There's something else.

162
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,375
It's not stated
objectively in the forward,

163
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,375
but I inferred it
from the wording.

164
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,166
This says it had been "a year
since" the events occurred.

165
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,083
That means my uncle was
expelled around the time

166
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,958
of the previous Kanyasai.

167
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,333
This is kind of off topic,

168
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,250
but my friend who goes
to another school told me

169
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,916
they had an incident at their
cultural festival last year.

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,458
A culture fest shakedown!

171
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,500
Extortion and larceny,
a dark, seedy underbelly!

172
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,375
I guess every
generation has its crooks

173
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,500
who wanna spoil it
for the rest of us.

174
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,250
Maybe people like that tried
to target Kami High's festival

175
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,041
that year, and when
my uncle led the charge

176
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,750
to defend the
school against them,

177
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,375
he got punished for fighting.

178
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,375
That would be in line with
the whole hero narrative.

179
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,750
I think the underclassmen
who looked up to my uncle

180
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,250
for his bravery were
mad that he got expelled,

181
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,166
and they wrote this
in honor of him.

182
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,000
Hmm... I don't buy it.

183
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,416
Yeah, I agree with Hotaro.

184
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,916
Seriously?

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,833
What part of it
doesn't add up to you?

186
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,916
Well, for starters,

187
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,541
do you remember
what I suggested we do

188
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,666
instead of the anthology
when you first brought it up

189
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,916
to me that day?

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,375
Lemme see...

191
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,666
A concessions stand!

192
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,708
That's right.

193
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,000
You told me that
selling refreshments

194
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,250
had never been allowed
at the Kanyasai before.

195
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,625
So why would anyone try
to rip off a festival

196
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,000
where they knew no money
would be changing hands?

197
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,791
They might have come
with other bad intentions

198
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,250
besides stealing people's money.

199
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,416
[HOTARO gasps]

200
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,333
Didn't think of that
one, did ya, Hotaro?

201
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,666
Fine.

202
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,791
Why don't you wow us with
your take on her theory?

203
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,416
A bunch of punks
disrupting the Kanyasai,

204
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,875
I'm sorry to say,

205
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,583
would never have
happened back then.

206
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,625
Why not?

207
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,125
When you think
of that time-period,

208
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,666
the 1960s, what images
come to mind?

209
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,958
[MAYAKA]
Hmm...

210
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,333
[SATOSHI] Tokyo, the Diet
building, protests,

211
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,458
people carrying signs?

212
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,958
[HOTARO] Satoshi, why don't
you get to the point already?

213
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,083
Peaceful student activism.

214
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,041
You see, the kind of
on-campus violence

215
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,958
Chitanda presents
in her hypothesis

216
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,750
wasn't even a thing
yet in the 60s,

217
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,750
at least not
around here, anyway.

218
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,791
We were fighting against
"The Man" back then:

219
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,083
The system and the state.

220
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,750
There wasn't any animosity
toward the teachers

221
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,041
or the schools.

222
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,875
Don't try to make it
sound like you were there.

223
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,250
[SATOSHI]
I obviously wasn't,

224
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,166
but I did some
in-depth research.

225
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,666
You're right.

226
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,875
I didn't take the social climate
of the time into account.

227
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,625
[MAYAKA]
I'm really sorry, Chi!

228
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,625
What are you
apologizing for, Mayaka?

229
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,541
The information I found
in my research

230
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,416
doesn't support
your theory, either.

231
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,791
I wanted to wait my turn,
so I didn't say anything,

232
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,875
but my info refutes your claim.

233
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,875
[HOTARO] Damn it, Ibara, you
just let me waste my breath?

234
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,083
No worries, I think it's
safe to withdraw my theory

235
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,416
for right now, so Mayaka,

236
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,666
why don't you share your
findings with the group?

237
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,083
Is that all right with you guys?

238
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,416
--[HOTARO] Sure thing.
--[SATOSHI] Yeah!

239
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,333
[SATOSHI] Ugh! Aw, man,
my butt is falling asleep.

240
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,458
This might be rude,

241
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,125
but your estate is
ginormous, Chitanda.

242
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,541
Do you have a pond
in your gardens?

243
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,000
[ERU]
Yep, we sure do!

244
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,458
Really? I'd love
to check it out.

245
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,458
Would that be cool with you?

246
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,333
Ooh, yeah,
I wanna see it, too!

247
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,916
Okay, why don't we move
the meeting outside, then?

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,750
It's such a lovely day
to sit out on the veranda!

249
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,375
[HOTARO]
A pond? Wow.

250
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,416
This is a copy of a booklet
I found in the library,

251
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,166
called <i>Solidarity and</i>
<i>Salutes</i> , Issue One.

252
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,458
I couldn't find issues
two or higher, though.

253
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,958
It was published 45 years ago,
the same as Chi's.

254
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,875
[HOTARO]
"Our valiant activism?" Really?

255
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,708
That sounds so old-fashioned.

256
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,166
Okay, let's dive in.

257
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,166
"We," in this case,
refers to the students,

258
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,000
while the terms, "reactionary
forces" and "authoritarians"

259
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,625
refer to the teachers.

260
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,416
The previous June, there
was some kind of conflict,

261
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,500
and Jun Sekitani, the president
of the Classic Lit Club,

262
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,708
spearheaded it.

263
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,500
The students,
under his leadership,

264
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,333
engaged in what
they called "activism"

265
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,000
by sticking it to the teachers.

266
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,333
[HOTARO]
Interesting.

267
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,625
I wonder what their methods
of protesting were.

268
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,250
This <i>Solidarity</i>
<i>and Salutes</i> stuff

269
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,416
seems a little silly,
doesn't it?

270
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,875
What do you mean by that?

271
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,083
I'm not knocking it.

272
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,833
I just think it makes
a presumably common

273
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,416
high school complaint
out to be on par

274
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,833
with a legitimate,
real-world protest, ya know?

275
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,875
So does that have any
bearing on this research?

276
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,458
Nope, I'm just
thinkin' out loud!

277
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,958
Sorry for interrupting you guys.

278
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,583
All right, any questions,
or can we keep going?

279
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,666
Well, here's my hypothesis.

280
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,041
Like I said, Chi's
theory doesn't work.

281
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,041
According to <i>Solidarity</i>
<i>and Salutes</i> ,

282
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,416
the incident in question
happened in June.

283
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,791
As for what Sekitani
did to get expelled,

284
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,750
violence is what
comes to mind, right?

285
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,208
So in other words, he and
the students he inspired

286
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,208
got themselves all riled up.

287
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,875
And they let the
teachers have it!

288
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,791
There isn't any evidence he
actually hit anyone, though.

289
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,666
Something happened that
threatened to take away

290
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,083
the students' freedom, so they
must have rallied together

291
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,458
to fight against that
perceived injustice.

292
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,666
[ERU] And my uncle
was their leader?

293
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,250
[SATOSHI]
Hmm...

294
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,875
I'm almost completely on board
with your hypothesis, I think.

295
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,083
Why "almost?"

296
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,750
To sum up, your theory
is that the students

297
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,041
resorted to violent
resistance in protest

298
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,333
of some sort of oppression
by the teachers, is that it?

299
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,833
Yeah, pretty much.

300
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,916
It's a decent
hypothesis, overall.

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,750
But honestly, I think
it's a little too vague

302
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,083
to fit the bill.

303
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,083
Well, my theory doesn't
mention anything specific,

304
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,250
that's for sure.

305
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,541
But are there flaws in it?

306
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,833
Uh-huh.

307
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,125
Both <i>Hyouka</i> and
<i>Solidarity and Salutes</i>

308
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,875
claim the incident
occurred in June,

309
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,333
but we know he wasn't
expelled until October.

310
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,000
If he had led some violent
uprising against the teachers,

311
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,791
he would have been
expelled immediately.

312
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,958
Fine, then.

313
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,333
Yeah, I'm curious
about why they'd wait

314
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,916
four months to expel him, too.

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,750
In <i>Hyouka</i> , it states
that it had been a year

316
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,750
since he left, and it was
published in October,

317
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,083
so that must be accurate.

318
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,333
[MAYAKA groans]

319
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,208
Okay, guys, I get it.
My theory doesn't work.

320
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,833
I think you're on the right
track with the protest, though.

321
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, I agree.

322
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,541
Well then, I guess that
means it's the end

323
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,125
of my turn, doesn't it?

324
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,875
Yes. Thank you for your input!

325
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,416
--Okay, moving on--
--[stomach growling]

326
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,625
[SATOSHI]
Sorry.

327
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,416
Sounds like my stomach
wants to contribute.

328
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,458
[MAYAKA]
Geez.

329
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,833
You just ate a bunch
of junk food.

330
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,166
Yeah.

331
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,666
I can make you some
<i>onigiri</i> if you want.

332
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,791
What about you guys? Sound good?

333
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,250
[MAYAKA] Hey, Chi, do you
need any help with those?

334
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,208
No, I'm fine,
but thanks for asking.

335
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:27,916
[MAYAKA]
You sure?

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,041
[ERU]
Uh-huh!

337
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,791
Handmade snacks, bro!

338
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,291
Calm down, weirdo.

339
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,083
Wait, Fuku. Doesn't this--?

340
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,833
[SATOSHI]
Mayaka! I'm sorry!

341
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,250
According to this data,

342
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,666
your hypothesis can't be
accurate, not even a little bit.

343
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,041
I forgot to say it earlier.

344
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,791
Fine, whatever.

345
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,833
[HOTARO]
Hm?

346
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,666
Is this the Kami High
Monthly Newsletter?

347
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,416
I just remembered
Togaito mentioning

348
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,291
they were approaching
the 500th issue.

349
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,541
[SATOSHI]
Yeah, he's right.

350
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,083
There are about 500.

351
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,250
I took a quick look through
almost all of the back issues,

352
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,291
but my research didn't
turn up very much.

353
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,291
This article was all that
mentioned an incident

354
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,625
from back then.
And trust me, I looked.

355
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,916
Page two is a summary
of what it says.

356
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,666
The first one and the
last one say the same thing.

357
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,291
No violence occurred
at all during the incident.

358
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,625
So Mayaka, there's proof
against your theory.

359
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,333
Also, if "we" refers
to all of the students,

360
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,875
it says they were in solidarity,

361
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,333
so the entire student body
could have been involved.

362
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,333
At the very least it
means everyone in school

363
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,916
supported those who
actively participated.

364
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,208
[ERU] Here you go.
Thanks for waiting.

365
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,083
[SATOSHI]
Wow!

366
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,625
These look amazing, thanks!

367
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,000
[ERU]
Sure!

368
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,708
I made a few each of plum,
kelp, and mustard leaf.

369
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,666
Help yourselves, okay?

370
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,583
Thank you for the food!

371
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,791
Huh? What's the matter with you?

372
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,041
Nothing!

373
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,583
Tasty!

374
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,166
Delicious!

375
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,833
Hey, Chitanda, is this rice
from here on your family's farm?

376
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,083
It sure is!

377
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,666
Oh. Do you guys
have any questions?

378
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,125
Yeah, are you positive that
this is the "legendary movement"

379
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,708
that got Jun Sekitani
expelled from school?

380
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,041
This blurb doesn't seem
like enough to support that.

381
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,083
Who knows? That's all I've got.

382
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,291
That's all you've got?

383
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,208
How can we even
count it as data?

384
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,833
I don't know,
maybe we can't.

385
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,916
We can still consider it as
circumstantial evidence, though.

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,625
If the "Jun Sekitani Incident"
and the "Legendary Movement"

387
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,000
were different events,

388
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,083
there would be something
in there distinguishing this

389
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,083
as the "Legendary Movement,"
wouldn't there?

390
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:24,958
She's right!

391
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,458
That's what I meant to say.

392
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,833
Thank you for sorting it out!

393
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,333
[MAYAKA]
Hmph!

394
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,375
Okay, then what's
your hypothesis?

395
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,208
Uh... Well, about that...

396
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,583
[ERU]
I'd love to hear it.

397
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,416
Unfortunately, I
don't really have one

398
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,000
to offer to the group right now.

399
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,500
My research only
uncovered enough

400
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,833
to correct the
theory Ibara offered.

401
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,208
And besides...

402
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,000
It's not a database's function
to draw conclusions.

403
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,291
I knew he'd say that.

404
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,541
--[HOTARO] Now, then...
--[MAYAKA] Thanks so much.

405
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,416
--[HOTARO] Now, then...
--[ERU] You're welcome.

406
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,541
[HOTARO]
What should I do?

407
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,333
[ERU] Okay, Oreki.
It's your turn now.

408
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,583
Hotaro, is this
what I think it is?

409
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,791
"The Fifty-Year Progress
of Kamiyama Secondary School?"

410
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,791
It is.

411
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:06,958
I thought there
might be something

412
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,041
in the public record
about the incident.

413
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,916
[HOTARO] But now that
I look at it again,

414
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,916
there's nothing at all worth
mentioning to the group.

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,916
I haven't come up with
a hypothesis, either.

416
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,500
What's going on?
You're acting weird.

417
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,833
[MAYAKA]
What's the matter?

418
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,000
Did you forget how you're
supposed to proceed?

419
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,750
You start by
presenting your research.

420
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,208
[HOTARO] Does this even qualify
as something I have to do

421
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,958
in the first place?

422
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,833
You're freakin' me out a little.

423
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,000
What's up with you?

424
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,625
Are you feeling okay?

425
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,000
[HOTARO]
Stop it!

426
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,125
Should I blow this off?

427
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,291
[ERU gasps]

428
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,750
Whoa, you scared me!

429
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,958
Sorry, I forgot that I
have some shiitake mushrooms

430
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,125
drying outside.

431
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,041
I have to bring them
in out of the rain!

432
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,458
Do you need any
help with them?

433
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,375
[ERU]
No, it's okay.

434
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,291
Hey, Chitanda.

435
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,666
What is it?

436
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,708
Sorry. But would it be okay
if I used your restroom?

437
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,291
Oh, of course.

438
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,166
Just go right through that door
and then straight down the hall.

439
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,500
You'll see it.

440
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,833
Are you nervous
about presenting?

441
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,583
[HOTARO]
Straight down the hall.

442
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,666
I'll see it, she says.

443
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,666
[HOTARO]
Hm?

444
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,333
[HOTARO]
Well, I'm lost.

445
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,166
[HOTARO] She's done
so much research.

446
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,333
The least I can do is put
my brain to work for a bit.

447
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,416
[HOTARO]
45 years ago,

448
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,208
something happened
to Jun Sekitani.

449
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,375
There are four
different accounts.

450
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,041
What's the common thread
that ties them all together?

451
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,000
I've got to think.

452
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,041
Student activism.
Nonviolent resistance.

453
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,125
Four months between the
event and his expulsion.

454
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,333
What happened to Jun Sekitani?

455
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,833
What did he do?

456
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,833
You sure were gone
a long time.

457
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,541
Well, excuse me.

458
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,291
It was my turn to present
my research, right?

459
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,291
Sorry, but I don't
have a hypothesis.

460
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,458
So would it be okay
if we just skip my turn?

461
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,166
We could move right on
to the wrap up.

462
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,833
Stop playing. You figured
it out, I can tell.

463
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,208
Maybe. I think I've got
a general explanation.

464
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,500
You've solved the mystery,
haven't you, Oreki?

465
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,083
[SATOSHI] Calm down,
Chitanda, let him explain.

466
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,958
Yeah, come on, impress us.

467
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,625
You'd better not
let us down now.

468
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,291
All right, but I have
to explain it in stages.

469
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,416
[HOTARO] First, let's
establish the "when."

470
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,583
Well, we know it happened
45 years ago, for starters.

471
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,791
If we trust both <i>Hyouka</i>
and <i>Solidarity and Salutes</i> ,

472
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,916
then we know the incident
took place in June,

473
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,375
but that our hero
left in October.

474
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,875
Next, the "where."

475
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,541
We all know it happened at our
own Kamiyama High School.

476
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,375
As for the "Who," according
to <i>Solidarity and Salutes</i> ,

477
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,500
our main player is Jun Sekitani,

478
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,500
president of the
Classic Lit Club.

479
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,250
From the Kami High
Monthly Newsletter,

480
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,000
we learned that the
entire student body

481
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,666
was somehow involved.

482
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,125
Now for the "why."

483
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,208
It makes the most sense that
the students would rise up

484
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,541
in solidarity
against the teachers.

485
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,125
To borrow from Ibara,
the students likely rose up

486
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,750
because something happened
and they thought it

487
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,083
threatened their freedom.

488
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,125
And the event that caused
the whole problem was...

489
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,708
...the cultural festival.

490
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,000
[gasping]

491
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,500
Where did it say in
any of the research

492
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,916
that the cultural festival
was the cause of it?

493
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It didn't, but just
hear me out for a minute.

494
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,875
In June, the teachers
and students met

495
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,833
to discuss the details
of the festival.

496
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,666
And they decided that
the event would be held

497
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,750
four months later, in October.

498
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,250
Are you referring
to this part,

499
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,375
where it says, "meeting to
consider the cultural festival?

500
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,166
[HOTARO] Exactly.
Now take another look at it.

501
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,500
[ERU]
Hmm...

502
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,500
There are circles and
squares marked at the top

503
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,333
of each entry in the calendar.

504
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,833
I've got it!

505
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,666
The squares are recurring
events that happen every year,

506
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,458
but the circles are things
that only took place that year!

507
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,000
That's right.

508
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,250
The same notation appears on
calendars for other years, too.

509
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,166
This is the only year
that they held a meeting

510
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,791
to discuss the cultural
festival, but why is that?

511
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,041
I bet that 45 years ago,
the student body demanded it.

512
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,666
I found a clue in <i>Hyouka</i> .

513
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,125
Right here.

514
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,250
"In the past year, senpai has
gone from being a hero

515
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,666
to a legend.

516
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,625
The cultural festival will
continue its five-day run,

517
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,291
in spite of everything."

518
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,500
I think the key words
here are "five-day run,"

519
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,875
especially with the
"in spite of everything."

520
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,083
What does that mean?

521
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,666
The length of the
cultural festival

522
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,666
is what Jun Sekitani was
fighting the teachers for.

523
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,791
I'm just guessing, but combine
that with this mention

524
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,583
of the principal placing
heightened emphasis

525
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,333
on academics. I believe
that the administration

526
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,333
was trying to shorten
the length of the festival

527
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,125
against the kids' wishes.

528
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,125
I could imagine that throwing
the whole student body

529
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,250
into a burning rage.

530
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,166
That was the motivation,
I bet. The "why."

531
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,875
As for the incident itself,
let's talk about that.

532
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,291
The "how."

533
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,625
The "valiant activism,"
which was popular at the time,

534
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,125
was carried out
by none other than

535
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,666
Classic Lit Club
president Jun Sekitani.

536
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,083
This leads us to the ultimate
question: the "what."

537
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,958
The students did not
engage in violence;

538
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,875
instead, they most likely
decided to boycott class.

539
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,333
With no one to teach,
the school had to acquiesce

540
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,958
and meet with the students,
deciding to abandon the plan

541
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,375
to shorten the festival.

542
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:21,500
But someone had to pay,
and thus Sekitani was expelled.

543
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,708
So why did so much time
pass between the event

544
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,041
and the expulsion?

545
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,458
Well, if he'd been
kicked out in June,

546
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,791
while tempers were hot,
it would've made things worse.

547
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,166
So they probably waited
until after the festival,

548
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,875
when the hype had
died down a bit.

549
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,083
That's all I've got
for the wrap-up.

550
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,333
[sighs]

551
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,416
Now I finally know.

552
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,375
That's what happened to him?

553
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,250
Excellent work.
That was really impressive.

554
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,791
[chokes]

555
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,416
Yeah, you've really outdone
yourself with that one, Hotaro.

556
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,916
It all adds up, huh?

557
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,541
Why does he get it every time?
It's so freaking annoying!

558
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,875
It came to me.

559
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,166
Do either of you have
objections to his theory?

560
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,375
None here!

561
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,583
I hate to admit it,
but I think he's right.

562
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,916
Well, in that case,

563
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
let's focus this year's
Classic Lit Club anthology

564
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,666
on proving Oreki's theory.

565
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,708
We'll get started on that a
little bit later in the term.

566
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,041
On that note, I guess this
meeting is adjourned.

567
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,791
Thank you for your hard work!

568
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,666
[ERU] I can't express how
much I appreciate this.

569
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,875
It's not like I did it
all by myself, you know.

570
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,041
That's true.

571
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,250
But you're the one
who found the answer.

572
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,250
I'll get your umbrella
back to you at school.

573
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,000
Well... See ya.

574
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,458
[ERU] 
Although...

575
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,500
Would hearing that
story as a child

576
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:03,125
really have made me
cry as much as I did?

577
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,166
[ERU]
Next time:

578
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,583
"The Truth About the
Historic Classic Lit Club."
