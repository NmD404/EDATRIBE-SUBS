1
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,041
[HOTARO]
Oreki residence.

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,500
[ERU]
Good morning. It's Chitanda.

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,875
Sorry to bother you
on a day off.

4
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,000
[HOTARO]
It's fine.

5
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,625
[ERU]
I know it's short notice,

6
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,291
but do you have any plans
for the day after tomorrow?

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,000
[HOTARO]
No.

8
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,250
[ERU]
Fantastic!

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,208
Listen, I know it's kind
of rude to ask you this

10
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:36,958
out of the blue, so no pressure,
but I was wondering, well, if--

11
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,541
You'd be willing to
carry my parasol.

12
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,500
Your what? Parasol?

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,458
[ERU]
That's right.

14
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure what you mean.

15
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,208
[ERU]
Oh. Sorry.

16
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,416
I didn't explain that
very clearly, did I?

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,708
Let me try again.
The shrine near my house

18
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,916
is hosting a Dolls' Festival
the day after tomorrow

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,375
and we need help.

20
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:54,625
Dolls' Festival?

21
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,125
But it's already April.

22
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,500
[ERU]
Ah, yes, I know.

23
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,583
This shrine goes by
the old calendar.

24
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,875
I'm only asking because
one of the parasol holders

25
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,916
had a freak accident
and can't do it.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,833
They can't find anyone
who fits into his costume,

27
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,583
but you guys are the same size.

28
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,625
Wait...

29
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,041
You mean someone
holds it for them?

30
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,541
[ERU]
Yes.

31
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,875
It would mean the world to me
if you could help us out.

32
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,041
All right. I'll do it.

33
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,833
[ERU] You mean it?! I can't
thank you enough for this!

34
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,708
I just have to stand
next to them, right?

35
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,916
[ERU] Well, no, you have
to walk alongside them.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,541
Walk with all the
dolls, you mean?

37
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,333
[ERU]
Yes, that's right.

38
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,291
[HOTARO]
So the dolls can walk?

39
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,125
[ERU]
Yes.

40
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:32,916
[HOTARO]
Are the dolls--

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,333
[ERU]
Oreki, please!

42
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,583
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop
saying "dolls" so much.

43
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:40,166
This is embarrassing
enough for me as it is.

44
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,000
They're not really
dolls, are they?

45
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,250
[ERU]
No.

46
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,041
It's Mizunashi Shrine's
Living Doll Festival.

47
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,458
The dolls are just
girls in costumes.

48
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,958
[HOTARO]
Oh.

49
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,541
[ERU] I've been participating
as one of the living dolls

50
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,125
for the past few years.

51
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,000
[HOTARO]
Head upstream along the brook

52
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,916
and take the Chokyu bridge
past the cherry tree.

53
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,666
Wow. That cherry tree.

54
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,166
It's blooming out of season.

55
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,166
[HOTARO] Did Chitanda really not
know there was construction?

56
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,416
Excuse me, mister.

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,208
Is it okay if I
ride across here?

58
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,875
Yeah, you're fine.

59
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,458
We're about to
start working, though.

60
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,791
You won't be able
to cross back.

61
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:04,916
[HOTARO]
Thanks.

62
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,125
[HOTARO]
Anyone here?

63
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,958
Hey, Hanai.

64
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,833
Where should I put these?

65
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,791
[HANAI] Oh, over in the hall,
if you don't mind.

66
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,458
[SONO]
Right.

67
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,791
[HOTARO]
'Scuse me.

68
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,875
[HANAI]
Who are you?

69
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,791
[HOTARO]
Hello, my name is Hotaro Oreki.

70
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,666
I'm supposed to be
carrying a parasol.

71
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,833
Hmm...

72
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,083
I guess Chitanda
didn't tell you about me?

73
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,750
I was asked to be a
replacement parasol-bearer.

74
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,500
Oh, you came to
take Hazawa's place?

75
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,541
I'm sorry about that.
Come right on in.

76
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,000
[FUKIYA] Hey, Hanai,
who's in charge of the saké?

77
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,666
[HANAI] I gave it to
Nakatake 'cause it rhymed.

78
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,333
[FUKIYA]
Hey, Nakatake, are we good?

79
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,041
We're good. It's on the way.

80
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,750
Never mind that. What about
the business this afternoon?

81
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:05,958
[FUKIYA]
I delegated it to the maid.

82
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,375
[HANAI]
Will that work?

83
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,625
Hey. Where are
the spare banners?

84
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,458
[KONARI]
In the hall.

85
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,750
[SONO]
Gotcha.

86
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,958
[HANAI]
So, Oreki.

87
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,083
Yes?

88
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,625
You're going to be
carrying a parasol

89
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,666
for Chitanda's daughter,
is that right?

90
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,958
As far as I know, yes.

91
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,041
[ASSISTANT 22A]
Hanai, sir! Telephone for you.

92
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,083
The newspaper.

93
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,958
Geez, for the love of--

94
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,875
[HOTARO]
I can't relax in here.

95
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,333
[YOSHIDA]
Nakatake!

96
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,041
What's going on with the saké?

97
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,833
They told me that
it'll be here at 1:00.

98
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,750
Are you a moron?!
The parade is over at 12:30!

99
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,708
1:00 is way too late!

100
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,875
Have them move it up!

101
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:41,833
[NAKATAKE]
Right away, sir.

102
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,333
[YOSHIDA]
For crying out loud.

103
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,875
Oh.

104
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,041
Uh... yes?

105
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,291
Who are you?

106
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,583
Oh, you must be that kid
Chitanda recommended.

107
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,958
[HOTARO]
Oh. Yes.

108
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,208
My name is Oreki.

109
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,625
Thanks a lot for
coming all the way here

110
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,791
to help us out.

111
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,541
We're shorthanded, but still...

112
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,583
Shame we had to bother
an outsider to carry

113
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,458
a damn parasol.

114
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,500
We appreciate your help,
young man.

115
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,750
Sincerely.

116
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,083
It's my pleasure, sir.

117
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,125
I'm sorry that a stranger
like me has to intrude.

118
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,625
I'll try my very best to
keep out of everyone's way.

119
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,458
If I do anything to offend,
please let me know immediately.

120
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,875
You sure are a
stalwart young man.

121
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,291
[HOTARO] First time
I've ever been called that.

122
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,291
[YOSHIDA]
Oreki, was it?

123
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,958
You just relax here
until we send for you.

124
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,875
[HANAI] What about the
parishioner representatives?

125
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:43,750
[FUKIYA]
Got it covered.

126
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,500
The kids?

127
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,333
Got it covered.

128
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,250
The living dolls?

129
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,333
They need more time.

130
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,500
Fine.

131
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,958
Tanimoto, is the Chokyu
bridge good to go?

132
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,708
[TANIMOTO] Murai is
in charge of that now, sir.

133
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,625
[HANAI] Well, do you know if
they've halted construction,

134
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,375
at least?

135
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,458
[TANIMOTO]
Yes.

136
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,208
He assured me he
would take care of it.

137
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,083
Actually, they resumed
construction a little while ago.

138
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,291
[ALL gasp]

139
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,708
What did you say?

140
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:06,625
[HOTARO]
Hm?

141
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,583
Tanimoto!

142
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,541
You did follow up, didn't you?

143
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,416
[TANIMOTO] Well...
I reminded Murai about it.

144
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,250
[HANAI]
Oreki.

145
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,083
Are you positive about this?

146
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,458
[HOTARO]
Yes.

147
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,333
Sono!

148
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,916
[SONO]
Yes, sir?

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,166
[YOSHIDA] I hate to do this, but
take the truck and go make sure.

150
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,083
[SONO]
Yes, sir.

151
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,083
[YOSHIDA]
Tanimoto.

152
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:26,875
[TANIMOTO]
Yes, sir?

153
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,333
[YOSHIDA]
Call Murai.

154
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,166
Scratch that, get Nakagawa
Construction on the phone.

155
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,458
[TANIMOTO]
Yes, sir.

156
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,500
Will that cover it, Hanai?

157
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,583
Yes, sir.

158
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,791
What's the problem
with construction?

159
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,541
The procession is set
to cross Chokyu bridge.

160
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,916
[HOTARO]
Oh.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,208
I really hope you're
mistaken about this one, kid.

162
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,875
[HOTARO]
What's he glaring at me for?

163
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,416
[footsteps]

164
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,875
It's true!
They've resumed construction!

165
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,500
[BOTH gasp]

166
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,791
Tanimoto! This falls on you!

167
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,458
No, there has to be some
kind of misunderstanding!

168
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,500
I'm positive that Murai called
the construction office earlier!

169
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,958
He specifically told them
not to start working today.

170
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,541
[HANAI]
Then why did they?

171
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,250
[TANIMOTO] I do know they got
a call the day before yesterday

172
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,625
to go ahead as planned, though,
so maybe that's why.

173
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,791
[HANAI]
From whom?

174
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:15,833
[TANIMOTO]
Well, I didn't ask them that.

175
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,500
I didn't think it mattered.

176
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,958
[SONO] The workers told
me a similar story just now.

177
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,500
Never mind the reason.

178
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,666
We have to deal
with this immediately.

179
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,625
[FUKIYA] There's gotta be a way
to get them to halt construction

180
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,666
before the parade.

181
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,000
[HANAI]
It's too late for that.

182
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,458
The TV crew is already
here and set up to shoot.

183
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,708
Plus, if someone
gets hurt, we're liable.

184
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,333
We'd better find
a way to reroute

185
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,541
and avoid it altogether.

186
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,041
[SONO] What if they
took the same route,

187
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,000
but doubled back instead
of crossing the river?

188
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,458
They could just stay
on the east bank.

189
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,083
[FUKIYA] That's great for
the people on the east side,

190
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,041
but what about all the folks
gathered on the west?

191
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,625
No dolls for them?

192
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,000
[TANIMOTO] Then what if they
go down to the bridge and back,

193
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,083
then cross over here and
then go up the west side?

194
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,166
[HANAI] Walking twice the
length of the current route

195
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,916
is out of the question.

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,583
[SONO] Then what about going
halfway to the bridge and back,

197
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,541
then crossing over
to the west side?

198
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,625
[HANAI] I refuse to do something
that ridiculous on live TV.

199
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,875
[SONO] So then what
do you propose we do?

200
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,750
[KONARI] We could have them
cross over at the Toji bridge.

201
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,541
If they cross
at the Toji bridge,

202
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,166
then back via Kaya bridge,

203
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,208
it only ends up being slightly
longer than the original route.

204
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,500
[ALL sigh]

205
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,125
[HANAI]
I don't know.

206
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,791
[FUKIYA]
I'm not sure about it either.

207
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,041
[MAID 22A]
Excuse me.

208
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,416
Is there someone here
by the name of Oreki?

209
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,250
Yes. That's me. What is it?

210
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,625
[MAID 22A] Chitanda's daughter
asked me to come get you.

211
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,500
[FUKIYA]
What does she want?

212
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,666
[SONO]
Who knows?

213
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,000
[ERU]
Oreki, is that you?

214
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,250
Yeah.

215
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,625
[ERU]
Sorry I can't come out and talk.

216
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,958
I'm not quite finished
getting dressed.

217
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,875
[HOTARO]
That is Chitanda, isn't it?

218
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,791
[ERU] I called you back
here to find out what's up.

219
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,541
Something has gone kind
of haywire, hasn't it?

220
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,458
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

221
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,875
[ERU]
Is it anything serious?

222
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:07,750
[HOTARO]
Yes, it is.

223
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,416
[ERU]
I see.

224
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,333
Can you fill me in
as much as possible?

225
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,541
There's not much time,
so talk fast.

226
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,541
[HOTARO] There's an
issue at Chokyu bridge.

227
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,125
So it's been proposed that we
cross at Toji bridge instead.

228
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,750
But not everyone agrees.

229
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,375
Are you listening?

230
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,500
[ERU]
Yes, I am.

231
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,000
When the others heard that,

232
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,583
for some odd reason they started
acting weird and scowling.

233
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,958
That's all.

234
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,625
[ERU] I must say, that was
an excellent retelling.

235
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,041
[HOTARO]
Thanks.

236
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,583
[ERU] Oreki, can I ask you to
relay a message for me?

237
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,083
[HOTARO]
Sure.

238
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,583
[ERU] I will speak to the other
shrine's priest about this

239
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,583
right away.

240
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,666
I am also going
to have my father

241
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,458
call the parishioner
representative.

242
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,250
Please tell them that.

243
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,583
So is that the whole message?

244
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:01,000
[ERU] Don't worry,
they will understand.

245
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,833
[HOTARO]
That's all she told me.

246
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,166
[ALL sigh]

247
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,166
[HANAI]
Okay, then that's what we'll do.

248
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,375
All right, everyone,

249
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,875
we'll take a detour
across the Toji bridge.

250
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,375
What are you waiting for?!

251
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,791
Start getting things
ready to go!

252
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:14,875
[ALL]
Right!

253
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,666
[HANAI] 
Yes, Toji bridge. Did I stutter?

254
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,083
We already talked with Takahashi
in the traffic division!

255
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,583
[NAKATAKE]
Hey, Hanai,

256
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,083
the cameraman wants to know
where he should shoot from.

257
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,333
So, um, weren't you originally
slated to take over here?

258
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,666
Yeah, but I couldn't
fit into the costume.

259
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,208
[HOTARO]
Oh. I guess not.

260
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,708
Besides, this kind of
procession is a rare sight.

261
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,500
I came back home just for this.

262
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,791
If I'm in the parade,
I can't see it, right?

263
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:42,791
[HOTARO]
That's true.

264
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,666
[KONARI]
And, the finishing touch.

265
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,333
[KONARI]
Well, what do you think?

266
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,541
Kinda sad, huh?

267
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,708
That's for sure.

268
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,750
[CROWD chattering]

269
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,833
[CROWD gasps]

270
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,250
It's freezing.

271
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,916
[CROWD gasps]

272
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,666
[HOTARO]
Oh, isn't that...?

273
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,166
I think that's Irisu.

274
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,083
[CROWD gasps]

275
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,750
[HOTARO]
Wow...

276
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,958
[HOTARO]
Aw, crap.

277
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,833
[HOTARO]
Not good...

278
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,708
This is not good!

279
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,458
[HOTARO] I'm rethinking
this entire thing.

280
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,875
What is the matter with me?

281
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,750
[HOTARO] My philosophy
of energy conservation

282
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,166
has encountered a deadly threat.

283
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,250
[HOTARO]
I can't see Chitanda.

284
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,125
I can't see how she looks.

285
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,125
I just... I have to know.

286
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,166
If I could see her
from the front...

287
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,208
Dressed up so beautifully...

288
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,250
Looking down so demurely...

289
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,458
What would happen then?

290
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,583
[SATOSHI]
Hotaro!

291
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,625
[SATOSHI]
Man, that was fantastic!

292
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,083
Chitanda and Irisu's elegance
was absolutely unmatched!

293
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,208
[MAYAKA] They were so
gorgeous, weren't they?

294
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,375
[SATOSHI] Where are Chitanda
and the other dolls now?

295
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,708
[HOTARO]
Main building.

296
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,250
They said something about
purging their impurity.

297
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,583
By the way, buddy,

298
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,750
that outfit did not suit you
at all, just saying.

299
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,750
Man, shut up.

300
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,041
For real, it was
wasted on you.

301
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,708
Fine, keep running your mouths.

302
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm gonna go get another
one of these things.

303
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,416
Oreki, I wanted to thank you.

304
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,708
Yeah, for what?

305
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,333
For the Valentine's thing.

306
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,291
I haven't had a chance
to tell you until now.

307
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,750
Sure.

308
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,500
How's it been going since?

309
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,666
[MAYAKA]
Well, not too bad.

310
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,750
[HOTARO]
That's good.

311
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,791
I snapped at him
for that, you know.

312
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,333
It's not very often that
I really lay into him.

313
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,000
Mm-hmm. I heard.

314
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,541
Oh. Hey, there, Irisu.

315
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,375
Oh. Hello, Oreki.

316
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,041
Weren't you the emperor doll?

317
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,666
[IRISU]
That's a long story.

318
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,791
And speaking of those, I heard
about the Chokyu bridge.

319
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,958
[IRISU] A lot of it sounds a
bit suspect, if you ask me.

320
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,083
What do you think?

321
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,333
Huh... Uh...

322
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,125
I guess it does, sure,
but I don't know.

323
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,125
[IRISU]
I see.

324
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,416
I thought you'd be
the first person

325
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,416
to try his hand at
solving the mystery.

326
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,875
Don't do that, please.

327
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,666
[IRISU]
Oreki.

328
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,625
In that situation, I had
a specific role to play.

329
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,583
And in this one,
I'm just the emperor doll.

330
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,333
And since I have no
stake in any of this,

331
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,875
I won't mislead you.

332
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,041
Oh.

333
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,250
[CROWD chattering]

334
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,250
[footsteps]

335
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,666
Oh, Oreki.

336
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,750
Oreki!

337
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,875
What? What's wrong?

338
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,375
Today was just awful!

339
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,250
I've been forced to hold
it in this whole time!

340
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,083
Yeah, you're a real trooper.

341
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,083
I couldn't.

342
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,791
Not that, silly,
the Chokyu bridge!

343
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,041
The business with
Nakagawa Construction!

344
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,500
Oh, okay, right.

345
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
[ERU]
I've been obsessing about it,

346
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,541
but since I had a part
to play, I couldn't let on.

347
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,958
I was dying to ask
about it the whole time.

348
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,958
What I mean is-- 

349
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,208
You just have to know, huh?

350
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,291
That's right!

351
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,291
You must have drawn up
some conclusion

352
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,250
about everything that happened.

353
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,583
Well, yeah, I do
have a suspect in mind.

354
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, good, so do I.

355
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,708
Why don't we write it down
and reveal our theories

356
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,333
to each other at the same time?

357
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,875
That's fine with me,
but write on what?

358
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,416
[ERU giggling]

359
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,625
Here.

360
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,291
[HOTARO giggling]

361
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,916
[ERU]
Okay, good to go?

362
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,291
Ready, set, reveal!

363
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,250
Oh, Konari's son
does have brown hair,

364
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,458
as a matter of fact.

365
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,375
We're thinking
of the same person?

366
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,416
Yes.

367
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,875
I'm curious:
why did you suspect him?

368
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,541
[HOTARO] First of all,
it seems pretty clear

369
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,500
that they got a call saying
to come to work today, right?

370
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,000
[ERU]
Yes, I believe so.

371
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,666
[HOTARO] Okay, then who would
have made that phone call?

372
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,125
Everyone was running around
like crazy here today.

373
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,333
There was only one person
who seemed totally sure

374
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,833
we wouldn't be able to
cross the Chokyu bridge.

375
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,458
[ERU] And you're saying
that was Konari's son?

376
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,375
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

377
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,291
He helped me get
into my costume.

378
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,750
He told me that
he came back home

379
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,041
just for this, and he said
that this kind of procession

380
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,041
is a rare sight to see.

381
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,750
[ERU]
Did he really?

382
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,875
[HOTARO] Yeah, and I
thought that was weird.

383
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,541
They do this every year, right?

384
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,333
If he's from here,
why would this procession

385
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,666
be so rare to him?

386
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,083
[ERU] You're right,
that's an odd thing to say.

387
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,083
[HOTARO] However, a "rare sight"
did happen today.

388
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,916
Do you know what it was?

389
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,208
[ERU] Well, for one,
they altered the route.

390
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,291
Doing that took us
to the Toji bridge.

391
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,875
Oh, the cherry tree!

392
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,250
Yes, and it was
blooming out of season.

393
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,916
We'd only get to see
it by taking the route

394
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,333
we ended up with.

395
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,458
The spectacle of a
parade of living dolls

396
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,208
passing under cherry blossoms?

397
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:52,291
That is what I'd call a
"rare sight to see."

398
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,208
That's a frivolous motive.

399
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,000
[HOTARO]
I wouldn't call it that.

400
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,208
Um, Oreki?

401
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,958
But who knows what
he was really thinking.

402
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,791
Why did you suspect him too?

403
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,041
Well, I know him.

404
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,208
And he's...

405
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,250
Konari's son is the only
person around here

406
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,125
who would put so many people
through all that stress

407
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,500
without thinking twice
about their feelings.

408
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,833
[HOTARO]
That makes sense.

409
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,208
[ERU] But couple that
with your theory,

410
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,250
and I am totally convinced.

411
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,833
[HOTARO]
What do you mean?

412
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,708
[ERU] Apparently, his lifelong
dream is to be a photographer.

413
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,791
He is going to vocational school
to study it, as far as I know.

414
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,625
[HOTARO]
Ah, so that's why.

415
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:33,208
I'm sure he just wanted to get
a photo of such a "rare sight."

416
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,125
Could be.

417
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,041
[ERU]
Hey, Oreki.

418
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,708
Remember in my dressing
room when I mentioned

419
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,916
contacting the other
shrine's priest?

420
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,291
Yeah.

421
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,500
That was what finally calmed
all the chaos, you know.

422
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,791
It may seem kind of trivial,
but hear me out, would you?

423
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,500
'Kay.

424
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,416
[ERU] A long time ago,
this area was divided

425
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,583
into two halves:
north and south.

426
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,541
The north half was our village,
and the south was another.

427
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,458
There were lots of disputes
over water and territory.

428
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,041
And though that
was so long ago,

429
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,000
for a solemn ritual like this,
crossing over without permission

430
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,166
would be a major source
of contention, even now.

431
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,625
[HOTARO]
Ah, so that was a big deal.

432
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,375
[ERU] They wanted to let
them know ahead of time,

433
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,000
but there aren't many
people who even know

434
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,541
what channels to use
to make that call.

435
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,250
[HOTARO] And that's
where you stepped in.

436
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,750
[ERU] Once I talked
to the other side,

437
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,000
we were free to go that far
south with peace of mind.

438
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,333
[HOTARO]
I see.

439
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,916
No wonder Satoshi calls
your family "prestigious."

440
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,416
I wouldn't go that far.

441
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,333
It's fascinating.

442
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,875
All I did was act as a liaison

443
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,458
between the north
and south sides

444
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,125
of a little community
north of Kamiyama.

445
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,291
I don't think it's something
grandiose or monumental,

446
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,166
but I wouldn't dismiss it
as insignificant, either.

447
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,375
[HOTARO]
Interesting.

448
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,208
You may have a point there.

449
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,250
[ERU] If I manage
to get into college,

450
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,041
I'm still gonna come
back here eventually.

451
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,083
No matter where life
takes me, in the end,

452
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,625
my place will always be here.

453
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,791
I love this place.

454
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,291
So, Oreki...

455
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,875
What did you choose for your
second year? Science or lit?

456
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,000
[HOTARO] Oh, I chose lit.
Seemed right.

457
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:13,708
[ERU]
Oh, yeah?

458
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,666
Well, I chose science.

459
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,958
[HOTARO]
You did?

460
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,208
I'm not depressed
about coming back here.

461
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,250
It's actually quite the
contrary, as a matter of fact.

462
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,041
As the daughter of
the Chitanda family,

463
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,416
I want to fulfill the role
I was born to play.

464
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,750
It suits me.

465
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,500
I've given a lot of thought
to how I might best

466
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,208
be able to do it.

467
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,291
You have? Good.

468
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,458
I see two ways, really.

469
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,250
One of those is to
help us all prosper

470
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,500
by developing a commodity
that's extremely marketable.

471
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,125
The other way would be
to make our production

472
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,708
more efficient, working from
a managerial standpoint,

473
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,958
with the goal of
wasting nothing at all.

474
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,208
Ultimately, I think the former
is the more appropriate

475
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,458
path for me.

476
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,458
[HOTARO] Which is why
you chose science?

477
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,458
[ERU]
Yes.

478
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,083
[HOTARO] Yeah, I definitely
don't think you're cut out

479
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,416
for the latter path, no offense.

480
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,125
That was a lesson
that I learned

481
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,375
during the cultural festival,

482
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,208
when I saw how I was
driving everyone crazy.

483
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,375
I don't think I have the
skillset needed to manage

484
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,791
a bunch of employees.

485
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,083
That's for sure.

486
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,500
Good for you.

487
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,666
Just look at
all of this, Oreki.

488
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,208
I know this is
where I belong.

489
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,750
There's nothing here but
the water and the earth.

490
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:31,083
The people who live here will
slowly grow old and tired.

491
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,958
It's not the most beautiful
place in the world by any means.

492
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:38,875
And I don't even believe
it has very much potential.

493
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,291
But still...

494
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,958
I just felt compelled
to share it with you, Oreki.

495
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,500
[HOTARO]
By the way...

496
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,458
As far as the
managerial perspective

497
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,541
that you determined
wasn't for you...

498
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,291
What if I were to take
on that task for myself?

499
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,458
By the way what?
Finish that thought.

500
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,333
Oh. Uh, nothing.

501
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,000
I...

502
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,208
[HOTARO] I wonder if
this is how Satoshi felt.

503
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,250
Afraid to spoil it
by saying too much.

504
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,375
It's starting to
get cold, huh?

505
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,208
No. It's spring, silly.
