1
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,125
[HOTARO]
Excuse me.

2
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,916
Could I get another
cup of coffee?

3
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,500
[ERU]
Right.

4
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,208
Okay. The truth is...

5
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,458
Here goes! I need help!

6
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,250
I have a favor to ask you!

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,166
[HOTARO]
Huh?

8
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,625
I... Huh?

9
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,708
A favor?

10
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,958
[ERU]
Yes.

11
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,625
It's a personal matter
and not really something

12
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:55,958
I would normally talk about,

13
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,458
but I've given it a lot
of thought and decided

14
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,291
that you might
be able to help me.

15
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,500
I know it's asking a lot,

16
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,458
but will you please
at least hear me out?

17
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,041
Well... I guess
I can manage that.

18
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,041
[ERU]
Thank you.

19
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,791
[ERU] So, the favor
I wanted to ask you

20
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,583
has to do with my uncle,
Jun Sekitani.

21
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,083
See, he told me something once--

22
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,875
Something that was
really important.

23
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,666
And I want you to help me
remember what it was.

24
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,791
Yeah, I'm not
really following you.

25
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,541
I'm sorry. I'm telling
this story all wrong.

26
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,916
I guess I'm just not
used to talking about it.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,750
The first thing you should
know is that my uncle

28
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,833
went to India seven years ago.

29
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,583
And he's been
missing ever since.

30
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,250
I was very fond of him
when I was a little girl.

31
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,166
Unlike most other adults,
he would answer all my questions

32
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,416
no matter how silly they seemed.

33
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,958
He was so smart!

34
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,708
It seemed to me that there
was nothing he didn't know.

35
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,083
When I was in kindergarten,

36
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,458
I learned that my uncle
was in the Classic Lit Club.

37
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,083
That's when I became
interested in it.

38
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,333
I especially liked it
because the name reminded me

39
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,666
of the vinegar kelp
we ate at home.

40
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,416
[HOTARO]
Seriously?

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,583
[ERU]
Anyway...

42
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,250
One day I asked my
uncle about something

43
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,250
having to do with
the Classic Lit Club.

44
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,375
And for the first
time I can remember,

45
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,750
he was reluctant
to answer my question.

46
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,625
[HOTARO]
So, what'd you do?

47
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,875
[ERU] Well... I threw a huge
tantrum, to be honest.

48
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,916
And I did convince him to
answer my question eventually.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,708
But when he told me
what I wanted to know, I...

50
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,875
[HOTARO]
Yeah? You what?

51
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,416
I started to cry.

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,458
I don't know if it was because
I was scared or sad or what,

53
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,250
but I was bawling.

54
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,333
Okay.

55
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,958
The sound must've
startled my mom

56
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,291
because she came rushing
in to see if I was okay,

57
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,625
but my uncle...

58
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,666
He didn't do anything
to comfort or reassure me.

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,583
Afterwards, I couldn't remember
what my uncle had said,

60
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,333
only my reaction to it.

61
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,083
I guess I was in shock.

62
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,625
Then, when I was
in middle school,

63
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,416
I started wondering about that
strange conversation again.

64
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,541
What made my uncle so
hesitant to answer me?

65
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,083
Why didn't he react
when I was upset?

66
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,125
I still have so many questions.

67
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,041
I just want answers.

68
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,083
And I've tried to get them.

69
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,666
We've become estranged
from the Sekitani family,

70
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,500
and I haven't been able to
get in touch with them at all.

71
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,708
No matter what I do, I can't
remember what he said!

72
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,000
So when I started at Kami High,

73
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,833
I signed up for
the Classic Lit Club.

74
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,583
I figured it would
be my last chance

75
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,125
to get to the
bottom of everything.

76
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,041
So that's the "personal matter"
you're always talking about?

77
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,875
This is it.

78
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,541
Of course, I had no way
of knowing that the club

79
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,166
was about to be shut down.

80
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,083
I asked around in
the faculty room,

81
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,000
but there weren't any
teachers who remembered

82
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,750
a Jun Sekitani
from 45 years ago.

83
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,250
'Kay.

84
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,125
I still don't get why you're
asking me for help, though.

85
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,583
Because you...

86
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,291
You think about
things differently.

87
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,125
You have this way of
reaching conclusions

88
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,166
that would have
never occurred to me.

89
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,541
Like with the lock.
And the library book.

90
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,583
And that secret club
recruitment note!

91
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,083
You can do this, Oreki!

92
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,625
If anyone can help me find
the answers I'm looking for,

93
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,958
it's you!

94
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,083
You're really giving
me too much credit.

95
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,291
That other stuff was
just luck, that's all.

96
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,583
I don't care if it's
just luck; I'll take it!

97
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,875
I don't want to.

98
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,625
[HOTARO] This is a
big deal to Chitanda.

99
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,208
She's spent years obsessing
over this question.

100
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,125
There's no telling how much
learning the answer to it

101
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,500
might affect her.

102
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,583
And she's asking someone
like me to take on

103
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,416
a responsibility like that?

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,166
She's gotta be kidding.

105
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,791
I still don't get
why you picked me.

106
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,083
There's gotta be
some other people

107
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,208
who can help you
with this, right?

108
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,125
Strength in numbers might
be your best bet, ya know.

109
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,375
Ask a bunch of your
friends to help,

110
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,458
and I'm sure you'll
get it done in no time.

111
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,875
[ERU]
Maybe you haven't noticed,

112
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,041
but I'm kind of
a private person.

113
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,541
I don't talk about
my past very much.

114
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,791
This story... isn't the kind of
thing I can tell just anybody.

115
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,291
[HOTARO]
Sorry.

116
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,125
I know I'm asking a lot of you,
and maybe it's not fair.

117
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,125
I realize I probably
shouldn't be dragging you

118
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,000
into my own personal
drama like this.

119
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,666
It's just...

120
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,750
You answer all my questions,
just like my uncle used to.

121
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,666
Even if you aren't
quite as personable.

122
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,083
[HOTARO] Well, that's one
way to ask for a favor.

123
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,625
[ERU] I see something of
him when I look at you.

124
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,458
And that makes me think
I can trust you, somehow.

125
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,083
[HOTARO]
What's the rush?

126
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,541
You've got three whole
years of high school

127
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,666
to spend looking for
an answer, don't you?

128
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,333
I really don't think I'll have
anywhere near that much time.

129
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,958
Not if I want all of this
settled before his funeral.

130
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,416
[HOTARO]
I thought he was missing.

131
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,791
[ERU]
Yes.

132
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,958
But if someone's been
missing for seven years

133
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,375
and no one knows if
they're alive or dead,

134
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,208
it's possible to have them
declared legally deceased.

135
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,708
[HOTARO]
I didn't know that.

136
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,000
Declaring him dead
would put the matter to rest

137
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,000
and give my uncle's
family some closure.

138
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,833
I heard that they also intend to
hold a small funeral service.

139
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,125
So you see...

140
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,791
That's why I'm in such a hurry!

141
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,583
I want to know the truth
about our conversation.

142
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:15,958
Before I say goodbye.
For the last time.

143
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,125
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,500
[TOMOE]
Come on, Hotaro.

145
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,916
It's not like you have
anything better to do.

146
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,250
This is not really
the kinda thing

147
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,833
that I want responsibility for.

148
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,000
So I wanna be totally clear
that I'm not agreeing

149
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,250
to see this all the way through.

150
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,291
But I will keep
your story in mind.

151
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,000
And if I come across anything
that might give you some clues,

152
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,291
I'll be sure to
tell you about it.

153
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,916
And if you find out anything new
that you want me to know about,

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,041
I'm willing to
listen to that too.

155
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,958
Okay.

156
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,375
If you're good with
those parameters,

157
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,250
then I guess I'll help you out.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,208
I'll take whatever
help you can give!

159
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,166
Thank you! I mean it;
thanks so much!

160
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,208
Yeah, sure.

161
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,041
[HOTARO] Of course, high
school isn't all about drama.

162
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,333
There's also a good
amount of tedium.

163
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,583
Take exams, for example.

164
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,208
It's every student's
favorite time of year

165
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,458
here at Kamiyama High: Midterms.

166
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,250
During the testing period, all
club activities are suspended.

167
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,000
Obviously, that includes
the Classic Lit Club.

168
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,500
But we don't really
do anything anyway,

169
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,541
so there's honestly
not much difference.

170
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,291
Keys to the clubrooms
aren't given out

171
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,875
while midterms are underway,

172
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,916
so even if we wanted
to meet up like usual,

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
that wouldn't be an option.

174
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,208
[TEACHER 3A]
Okay, time's up.

175
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,291
[STUDENTS groaning, chattering]

176
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,583
[HOTARO]
Midterm tests are over.

177
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,416
And I survived.

178
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,250
[TOMOE]
"Hey, Little Bro.

179
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,875
Greetings from Istanbul!

180
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,791
Or, more accurately,
from the Japanese consulate.

181
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,791
I goofed up a bit and
haven't quite made it

182
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,500
into the city yet."

183
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,833
What trouble did you
get into this time?

184
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,541
[TOMOE]
"This has been a lot of fun,

185
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,166
and I know I'll look back in
10 years and be glad I did it."

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,041
"I'm dying to know
how the club's going.

187
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,041
Have any more members yet?

188
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,000
The club is actually
the reason I'm writing.

189
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,833
I wanted to ask you something.

190
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:07,166
Are you planning
to make an anthology?

191
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,791
The Classic Lit Club enters
an anthology each year

192
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,333
for the cultural festival.

193
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,833
You are going to keep up
the tradition, aren't you?

194
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,125
If so, I'm sure you'll want
to look at some examples

195
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,250
to know what you're
supposed to do.

196
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,375
I'll tell you right now,
the old anthologies

197
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,541
aren't in the library.

198
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,166
You have to look
in the club room.

199
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,291
There's an unused
chemical locker in there.

200
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,000
And the back-number
anthologies are inside.

201
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,083
It shouldn't be locked.

202
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,500
Anyway, once I reach Pristina
I'll give you a call.

203
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,333
Take care of yourself.
Your sister, Tomoe."

204
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,958
A chemical locker, huh...

205
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,208
You've got some
good timing, Sis.

206
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,458
--[GIRL 3A] Hey, nice hat.
--[BOY 3A] Shut up!

207
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,833
[ERU]
Really? Are you sure?

208
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,833
[sneezes]

209
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,166
[HOTARO]
Yeah, I'm sure.

210
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,541
Here you go. Take a look
for yourself if you want.

211
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,583
So that's it, then.

212
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,541
We just find the
chemical locker.

213
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,666
[HOTARO]
It isn't in here, though.

214
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,000
[ERU gasps]

215
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,958
Yeah, you're right,
I don't remember seeing one.

216
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,916
So... What happened to them?

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,250
Where are they?

218
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,666
It's all right, Chi.
Let's just calm down a sec.

219
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,916
[HOTARO]
"Chi," is it?

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,541
Chitanda. Take a look
at the letter again.

221
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,666
All it said was they're in a
chemical locker in the clubroom.

222
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,083
My sister graduated from
Kami High two years ago.

223
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,625
They've probably changed
the clubroom since then.

224
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,833
Yeah, you're right.

225
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,541
And more than once, maybe.

226
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,916
Okay, now what?

227
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,666
How do we find out where
it was two years ago?

228
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,541
I already asked the adviser.

229
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,833
It was located in
the biology prep room.

230
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,083
Wow. You're unusually
well prepared today.

231
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,375
[HOTARO]
Just trying to be efficient.

232
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,125
[MAYAKA]
Hmph.

233
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,708
Admit it. You're pumped.

234
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,500
I don't get "pumped."

235
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,125
That kind of excitement
requires too much energy.

236
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,416
Well, let's go!

237
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,041
Oh, hey, where's Fukube?
I haven't seen him.

238
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,250
Handicrafts Club.

239
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,000
He said something about
getting a head start

240
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,791
on the summer fashion scene.

241
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,166
[ERU]
You coming?

242
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,541
[ERU]
Huh... I guess it's locked.

243
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,208
[ERU]
Excuse me! Is anybody in there?

244
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,166
[TOGAITO]
Hey, sorry about that.

245
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,083
I guess I locked the door.

246
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,333
So what brings ya here?

247
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,958
Wanna join the
Wall Newspaper Club?

248
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,541
No, that's not it.

249
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,625
Sorry. I didn't realize this was
the Wall Newspaper Club room.

250
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,541
Yep, it sure is.

251
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,916
[HOTARO sniffs]
What's that smell? Cologne?

252
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,958
No. Air freshener.

253
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,291
So... What can I
do for you today?

254
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,791
Well, um...

255
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,625
My name's Eru Chitanda,
and I'm the president

256
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,291
of the Classic Lit Club.

257
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,375
You're in class 3-E, right?
Togaito, isn't it?

258
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,375
I'm sorry, have we met before?

259
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,791
[ERU] I saw you at the
Manninbashi home last year.

260
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,041
I kind of have a knack
for remembering names.

261
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,083
[TOGAITO]
The Manninbashi home, was it?

262
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,541
Hold on.

263
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,041
You wouldn't happen to be
one of the Kanda Chitandas,

264
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,416
would you?

265
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,208
[ERU] Yes! Thank you for
all you do for my father.

266
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,083
So... President of
the Classic Lit Club.

267
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,541
That's cool.
And you're a Chitanda.

268
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,208
[HOTARO] What is this
guy babbling about?

269
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,958
[TOGAITO]
Anyway... What do you need?

270
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,458
Right!

271
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,291
We're looking for the old
anthologies the Classic Lit Club

272
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,125
put together, and we're
pretty sure they're in

273
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,166
the Biology Prep room.

274
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,125
This used to be the Classic
Lit Club room, didn't it?

275
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,041
[TOGAITO]
Oh... Uh... Yeah.

276
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,708
I think it was, actually,
back when I was a first-year.

277
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,083
[ERU]
Great!

278
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,541
Are the anthologies in there?
Have you seen them?

279
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,416
Sorry. No.

280
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,625
Too bad. I guess we'll
be on our way then.

281
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,166
Don't leave!

282
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,458
Sorry to bug you, but we're
pretty sure they're in there.

283
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,875
Can't we just take
a quick look around?

284
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,000
There's no point.

285
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,125
I already told you,
they aren't here.

286
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,416
[ERU]
You're sure?

287
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,625
[HOTARO]
Oh well, that's that.

288
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,541
[MAYAKA]
Hey!

289
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,666
Don't you think he's
acting kinda weird?

290
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,375
Of course.

291
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,208
Then don't just walk away!

292
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,958
[TOGAITO]
Anyway, sorry I couldn't help.

293
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,250
Hope you find 'em somewhere.

294
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,666
You don't understand!

295
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,750
The information we've gathered
points straight here.

296
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,250
It's the only clue we have.

297
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,125
If they aren't here,
we're going to have to search

298
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,333
the whole school!

299
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,291
[HOTARO]
The whole school?

300
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,541
I can't let that happen.

301
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,375
We need a couple
minutes, that's all.

302
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,083
Can't you at least
give us that much?

303
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,666
[HOTARO]
Pretty please?

304
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,375
I don't like the idea of letting
non-club members poke around.

305
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,791
It's not just a clubroom,
it's a classroom.

306
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,916
There are non-members in
there all the time, y'know.

307
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And you are...?

308
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,375
Classic Lit Club member
Ibara Mayaka.

309
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,666
All right, I give.

310
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,500
Go ahead and take a look then.

311
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,666
But don't make too
much of a mess, okay?

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,250
[HOTARO]
Where are the other members?

313
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,875
[TOGAITO]
Oh, they're takin' the day off.

314
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,708
I'm just brainstorming
ideas for the June issue.

315
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,000
Our club's been writing the
Kami High Monthly Newsletter

316
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,041
for a long time.

317
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,750
We're about to hit
our 500th issue.

318
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,916
[MAYAKA] I'm not seeing
what we're looking for.

319
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,416
Sorry. I guess you were right.

320
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
[sneezes]

321
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,500
[MAYAKA]
So what now? Oreki?

322
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,666
[HOTARO]
Togaito...

323
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,166
When this became your clubroom,

324
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,666
did you move anything out
to make space for your stuff?

325
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,833
Now that you mention it, we did
take some cardboard boxes out.

326
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,416
Some cardboard boxes, huh?

327
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,708
[TOGAITO]
Yeah.

328
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,458
[HOTARO]
We have an opening.

329
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,375
[HOTARO] This situation has
to be handled delicately.

330
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,291
But with just the
right amount of pressure.

331
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,625
[HOTARO]
Y'know...

332
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,708
I didn't realize how much
stuff there was in here.

333
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,541
It's gonna take forever
to sort through it all.

334
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,833
We could really use
a few reinforcements.

335
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,791
I think I'll go and ask the
club adviser to help us out.

336
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,041
You're cool with that, right?

337
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,625
No, I'm not.

338
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,125
Like I told you, I don't want
you making a mess of this place.

339
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,791
Sorry we're
inconveniencing you,

340
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,541
but this is really important!

341
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,375
We'll put everything back right
where we found it, I promise.

342
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,208
You won't have to--

343
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,166
I said no, okay?

344
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:31,750
[ERU]
But--

345
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,208
Don't you get it? I'm busy!

346
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't want a bunch
of underclassmen

347
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,208
ransacking my club room!
Is that so hard to understand?

348
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,791
Just get out of here!

349
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,750
[HOTARO]
Gotcha.

350
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,958
Just so you know,

351
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,458
we're pretty sure
what we're looking for

352
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,375
is inside some kind
of a chemical locker.

353
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,791
A locker?!

354
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,333
Yep. Our intel says that's
where the anthologies are.

355
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,083
We don't care about anything
else that might be in this room.

356
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,375
Do you understand me?

357
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,791
So listen.

358
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,375
Right now, we've got some stuff
to take care of in the library,

359
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,875
but if you happen to find the
anthologies after we leave,

360
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,666
maybe you could leave
them in the Earth Science

361
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,375
prep room for us?

362
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,708
The door should be unlocked.

363
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,625
I... I didn't...

364
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,166
I didn't do anything!

365
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,541
Who said you did?

366
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,000
All right, fine.

367
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,041
If I find them,
that's what I'll do.

368
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,208
[HOTARO]
Great. Thanks.

369
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,000
Okay, let's go.

370
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,583
Hey, first-year.

371
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,166
I don't think I ever
did catch your name.

372
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,791
It's Hotaro Oreki.

373
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,500
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry about all this.

374
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,375
[MAYAKA]
Okay, I give.

375
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,166
Why are we waiting
out here like this?

376
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,458
[HOTARO]
To conserve energy.

377
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,083
[MAYAKA]
What does that mean?

378
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,666
So tell me something.

379
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,125
You've obviously heard
of the Togaito family.

380
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,666
Why are they so prominent?

381
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,250
Well, let's see.

382
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,625
I guess they're best known for
their involvement in education.

383
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,791
Their family holds a lot
of important positions

384
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,041
in the educational system.

385
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,708
That explains it.

386
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,750
It's been five minutes.

387
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,791
We should get back now.

388
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,708
[HOTARO]
Yep. There they are.

389
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,791
[MAYAKA]
The anthologies.

390
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,708
[MAYAKA]
Hold on, Oreki!

391
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,125
How'd you know they'd be here?

392
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,291
What on Earth did you do?

393
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,625
Oh, just a little
intimidation, that's all.

394
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,041
[MAYAKA]
What's that mean?

395
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,708
[HOTARO]
Well... I dunno.

396
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,250
Can you keep a secret?

397
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,500
[MAYAKA]
Of course!

398
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,625
If you tell me not to
say anything, I won't.

399
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,541
[HOTARO]
Okay.

400
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,791
So let's start
at the beginning.

401
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,041
When Togaito came to
meet us, he stepped out

402
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,041
and closed the door behind
him instead of letting us in.

403
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,166
[MAYAKA]
Yeah, that was weird.

404
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,416
[HOTARO]
Then there's the room itself.

405
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,166
The window was wide open
and the fan was running.

406
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,458
If you recall, it was
pointed toward the window,

407
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,708
blowing around the papers
that were on the table.

408
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,250
[MAYAKA] It's like he wanted to
air out the room or something.

409
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,833
Exactly.

410
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,416
But why'd he care so much about
ventilating the room like that?

411
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,875
More importantly,

412
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,041
why would he lock himself in
and place infrared sensors

413
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:23,958
out in the hall?

414
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,708
[MAYAKA]
Wait! Slow down a sec.

415
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,458
Infrared sensors? What in the
world are you talking about?

416
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,666
What?

417
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,458
You didn't notice the
small, strange boxes

418
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,583
on either side of the hallway?

419
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,583
Then there was that device
with the antenna on it

420
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,250
that was obviously the receiver.

421
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,375
He must've set it up so
that anyone who passed by

422
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,958
the sensors would
trigger an alarm.

423
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,375
[alarm beeping]

424
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,916
And since when are
you so tech-savvy?

425
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,291
I'm not, really.

426
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,208
I just infer stuff from
what I observe, that's all.

427
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,333
The question is,
why would he need an alarm

428
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,916
that would tell him
when someone was coming

429
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,708
so he could start
airing out the room?

430
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,041
Why take such precautions?

431
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,166
[MAYAKA]
To get rid of a smell?

432
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,083
Seems like a reasonable guess.

433
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,125
And let's not forget the fact
that the place reeked

434
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,625
of air freshener.

435
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,750
Now... What smell could
he be trying to get rid of

436
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,583
that would make him go
to such desperate measures?

437
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,458
[MAYAKA]
Cigarette smoke.

438
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,041
[HOTARO]
Knowing that the Togaito family

439
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,916
is prominent in
academic circles,

440
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,958
can you imagine the kind
of trouble he would be in

441
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,791
if he was caught
doing something illegal?

442
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,125
He couldn't risk it.

443
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,583
It all makes sense now.

444
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,791
[HOTARO] Of course,
if Chitanda didn't have a cold,

445
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,708
she would've noticed
the smell immediately

446
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,041
and things would've
been a lot easier.

447
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,291
That's not all, though.

448
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,625
Where did the anthologies
end up being, huh?

449
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,708
Inside the locker, obviously.

450
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,291
What... lock... er?!

451
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,041
Hey. I'm not messing with you.

452
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,375
It was there, okay?

453
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,166
The chemical locker
had to be hidden under

454
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,875
that makeshift table.

455
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,541
My guess is that Togaito kept
his cigarettes and lighter

456
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,958
in there too.

457
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,625
So, when I suggested
we come back

458
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,625
and search the room
with an adviser,

459
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,875
he panicked and
flipped out on us.

460
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,666
You really are weird.

461
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,041
Not at all.

462
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,083
I'm probably the most
ordinary guy at this school.

463
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,041
[SATOSHI]
You guys!

464
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,500
[chuckles]

465
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,708
Look! I'm a sunflower!

466
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,583
About time.

467
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,500
While you were out doing arts
and crafts, we were working.

468
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,166
[SATOSHI]
What? Oh, the anthologies.

469
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,291
Huh... So this
is what they look like.

470
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,041
[MAYAKA] Check out the
ones from 40 years ago.

471
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,125
What is it? Something wrong?

472
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,708
[SATOSHI] That's because they
were printed on a Ditto machine.

473
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,833
More precisely, it's
called mimeograph printing.

474
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,958
It's what they had...

475
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,291
[HOTARO]
What's the matter?

476
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,541
[SATOSHI] Copy machines
didn't become commonplace

477
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,041
until a lot later,
so they wouldn't...

478
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,208
Well, it's just--

479
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,750
[HOTARO]
Hm?

480
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,625
[ERU]
Come here.

481
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,250
[MAYAKA]
What issue is that?

482
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,958
[ERU]
It's this.

483
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,500
[HOTARO]
<i>Hyouka</i> ?

484
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,833
Issue 2.

485
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,458
I saw it back when I was little.

486
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,250
That's what started all this.

487
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,875
I remember taking
this volume to my uncle,

488
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,333
and asking him about
what was inside.

489
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,083
What was special about it?

490
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,625
Here, take a look
at it for yourself.

491
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,375
Something happened 45 years ago.

492
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,958
I'm not sure what,

493
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,958
but it involved my uncle
and the Classic Lit Club.

494
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,666
[HOTARO] "Once again, the time
for the cultural festival

495
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,041
is upon us.

496
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,791
It has been a year now
since Sekitani left.

497
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,625
And in that year,
he has gone from being a hero

498
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,958
to being a legend.

499
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,875
The struggles
that were endured...

500
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,083
The sacrifices that were made...

501
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:33,541
Even his smile...
All are fading now.

502
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,708
And... Perhaps
it is for the best.

503
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,041
Perhaps they
should be forgotten.

504
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:43,458
After all, it was in
no way a heroic tale.

505
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,416
Details blur, facts fade away,

506
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,833
the passage of time polishes
the story's rough edges.

507
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,708
Bit by bit, the truth
will be eroded.

508
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,875
Until the tale is just
another dusty classic.

509
00:23:55,958 --> 00:24:00,666
October 13th, 1968.
Yoko Koriyama."

510
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,791
You see? Whatever event
they're referencing

511
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,041
happened 45 years ago.

512
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,000
There's no way it's
just a coincidence.

513
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,750
The Sekitani they
talk about was my uncle.

514
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,041
This mentions
struggles and sacrifices,

515
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,625
like something big happened.

516
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,000
It must be what my
uncle told me about.

517
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,833
Well then the mystery's
just about solved, right?

518
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,375
I still don't know
all of it, though.

519
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,791
I'm so close!

520
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,333
Why can't I remember?

521
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:30,375
What did my uncle say to me
that day that upset me so much?

522
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:34,041
What exactly happened to him at
this school all those years ago?

523
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,166
[HOTARO]
Just look into it some more.

524
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,333
[ERU] But... It says
there it might be best

525
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,625
if it were forgotten.

526
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,833
Who knows, maybe
something bad will happen

527
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,041
if I keep digging.

528
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:54,500
There are some truths that
are better left undiscovered.

529
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,000
Isn't that what people say?

530
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,500
So you're just
gonna give up, then?

531
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,250
Is that what you want to do?

532
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,250
You think I'm wrong?

533
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,333
Yeah, kinda.

534
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,541
I mean, look at what
it says at the end here.

535
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:10,458
"Bit by bit, the
truth will be eroded.

536
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,375
Until the tale is just
another dusty classic."

537
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,416
How long till the
truth's lost forever?

538
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,375
Right.

539
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:24,791
Besides, looking into
it shouldn't be too difficult.

540
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,083
This is Issue 2, and it talks
about stuff that happened

541
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,500
the year before, right?

542
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,208
So you just find issue one,
and there you have it.

543
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,916
[MAYAKA]
Bad news, you guys.

544
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,291
We're still missing
the first issue!

545
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,750
[SATOSHI]
Next time:

546
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,958
"The Classic Lit Club's
Glorious Days of Yore."
