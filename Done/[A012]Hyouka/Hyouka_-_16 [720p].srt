1
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,541
If this is already up
this early in the morning,

2
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,666
they must have kicked
it into high gear.

3
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,041
Well...

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,041
When it comes to high gear,
I can't be beat.

5
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,291
Yo, Fukube!

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,875
You're a little late
this morning.

7
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,583
Hi. Guess I am.

8
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,208
[SATOSHI]
Aw, bummer.

9
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,458
It's gonna be hard to keep
Jumoji at large at this rate.

10
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,125
Anyway...

11
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,833
You're pretty determined if
you're staking out this early.

12
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,333
Same for you.

13
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,000
[SATOSHI] Judging by the fact
that there are this many

14
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,916
amateur detectives around,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,458
the crime must not
have happened yet.

16
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,791
All right, Jumoji.

17
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,125
If you're gonna strike,
bring it on!

18
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,416
[ERU] It's the last day of the
festival: the moment of truth.

19
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,291
Interesting.

20
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,041
She seems familiar.

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,208
I wonder if I've met her
somewhere before.

22
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,708
[HOTARO] The idea to use Jumoji
to sell copies of <i>Hyouka</i>

23
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,833
isn't necessarily a bad one.

24
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,833
But I'm not convinced
it's a good enough plan

25
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,041
to sell all of them.

26
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,875
I hope I'm wrong about that.

27
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm just not convinced yet.

28
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,541
Nothing's happening here.

29
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,000
[SATOSHI]
He's right about that.

30
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,916
Is Jumoji's next
target the Quiz Club?

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,750
That doesn't make sense.

32
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,708
Why steal something from
them when their event

33
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,250
is already over?

34
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,958
This is boring.
I'm outta here.

35
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,458
[BOY 16B]
Yeah, man. This scene's over.

36
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,541
I'm gone.

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,291
[SATOSHI] What's wrong,
phantom thief Jumoji?

38
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,958
Were you scared off
by all the people?

39
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,333
[TANI]
Seriously?

40
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,333
Something you'd like to share?

41
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,833
Hmph. That dirty thief Jumoji
made a fool out of us.

42
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,583
Is that right?
Did he hit the Quiz Club?

43
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,625
Not them. Light Music Club.

44
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,125
Took one of their strings.

45
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,208
[SATOSHI]
Light Music Club?

46
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,708
Did I hear that right?

47
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,541
[SATOSHI] You're sure that's
good information?

48
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,875
If you don't believe me,

49
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,083
then why don't you just
investigate for yourself?

50
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,916
--Later.
--[SATOSHI] Hold on!

51
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,916
[SATOSHI]
It's no use.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,791
[BOY 16C]
Check it out!

53
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,250
The Light Music Club got hit.

54
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,875
How did you know that?

55
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,833
[SATOSHI] Jumoji's adaptability
is more sophisticated

56
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,041
than I thought.

57
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,083
I might be a bit out
of my depth here.

58
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,625
My head-on approach
didn't work.

59
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,791
I have to go back to
the drawing board.

60
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:43,166
If I can't catch him in the act,
then how can I catch him?

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,875
[HOTARO]
Wow.

62
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,833
When they sell, they
sell out, don't they?

63
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,083
The 20 copies Chitanda gave
to Irisu are already gone,

64
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,291
so she brought another
ten down there.

65
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,541
Then I sold nine more
just this morning.

66
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,791
I'm starting to have
some hope about this.

67
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,583
That's Saturday for you.

68
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,666
[TOMOE]
Hey, there!

69
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,625
I see you've decided to take
on the easy work, as usual.

70
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,625
You're here?!

71
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,041
I didn't think you
would show up!

72
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,791
[TOMOE] What, you're not
grateful that your big sister

73
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,166
cares enough to come see how

74
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,250
her dear little
brother is doing?

75
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,750
Here.

76
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,666
Thank you for your patronage.

77
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,166
What's that?

78
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,625
It doesn't really suit you,
little bro.

79
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,291
[HOTARO]
Oh.

80
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,500
You can blame the
Warashibe protocol.

81
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,916
Your pen turned into
this little hand mirror.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,250
[TOMOE]
What?

83
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,916
You mean you traded my pen
and ended up with that?

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,791
Pretty much.

85
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,916
I see. Well, then.

86
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,541
[TOMOE] I'll take it off your
hands, and in return you get...

87
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,208
...this.

88
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,500
[HOTARO]
What's that?

89
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,916
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i> .

90
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,708
It's a manga?

91
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,750
[TOMOE] Whether you decide to
spend your valuable time

92
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,291
reading it is
entirely up to you.

93
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,625
What's that supposed to mean?

94
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,000
[TOMOE]
Later, bro!

95
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,291
[HOTARO]
Hey, wait!

96
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,583
[HOTARO]
"Anshinin Takuha"?

97
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,250
[HOTARO] What do you think of
the way <i>A Corpse by Evening</i>

98
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,416
turned out?"

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,416
Well, if I do say so myself,

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,541
I think it turned out
very well."

101
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,958
Of course, all I did
was help out with

102
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,250
some of the backgrounds.

103
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,250
I didn't have much
to do with it at all."

104
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,125
"If you really enjoy
the finished product,

105
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,458
the credit goes to the
author and the artist,

106
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,791
least of all to me.

107
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,541
Credit where it's due,
you know?"

108
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,666
[HOTARO] I guess Anshinin
Takuha is just the name

109
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,750
they adopted for the whole team?

110
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,916
"It's not even as though
every single one of us

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,208
is in the Manga Club
or anything."

112
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,000
"We all just like manga a lot,
and really hit it off

113
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,166
when we would get
together to talk about it.

114
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,625
When we decided to try
making a manga of our own,

115
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,500
this is the story that emerged."

116
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,916
"I think it's kind
of extraordinary

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,375
for a maiden effort,
but that's my opinion.

118
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,875
I will let the creators toot
their own horns."

119
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,083
"I also want the reader to
decide for themselves,

120
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,208
without me putting
ideas in their heads."

121
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,416
"Now, keep in mind:
We have no intention

122
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,083
of breaking up the team
after just one title."

123
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,166
"We have already started
working on something new

124
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,333
with next year's
Kanyasai in mind."

125
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,250
"Our writer, A, is considering
turning the writing style

126
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,583
completely on its ear and
delving into the mystery genre."

127
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,750
"The word on the street is
that they plan to take on

128
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,666
one of Christie's
most famous works,

129
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,833
then see if there's any room for
a few twists here and there."

130
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,333
"The title has
already been chosen,

131
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,833
so I suppose I'll go ahead
and announce it here."

132
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,000
"The next story is
going to be called:

133
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,083
<i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> ."

134
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,416
"We picked another
foreboding name."

135
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,791
"Okay, I look forward to
seeing you next year

136

during the Kanyasai season!

Anshinin Takuha."

138
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,666
[HOTARO]
<i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> ?

139
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,875
I don't know what
"Kudryavka" means,

140
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,041
but the word "sequence"
captures my attention.

141
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,791
Also, which "one of Christie's
most famous works?"

142
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,666
[TOMOE] Whether you decide
to spend your valuable time

143
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,541
reading it is
entirely up to you.

144
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,125
[HOTARO]
Damn it, Sis.

145
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,166
You really better not have
just laid a bunch of work

146
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,750
down on my feet again.

147
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,208
[BOTH gasp]

148
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,791
[ERU]
Oh, excuse me!

149
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,958
Pardon, but are you Yoshino, the
Broadcasting Club's president?

150
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,541
Yeah, that's right.
Who are you?

151
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,541
[ERU]
Nice to meet you.

152
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,458
I am so glad you
were actually here!

153
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,833
I'm Eru Chitanda--

154
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,916
[YOSHINO] You're the
Classic Lit Club president!

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,125
The timing couldn't be better!

156
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,833
I was literally just
on my way to see you!

157
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,833
Would you like to be a guest
on our radio show today

158
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,791
during lunch?

159
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,666
I think interviewing
the president of the club

160
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,208
that's sure to be Jumoji's final
target would be a huge hit.

161
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,166
Well?

162
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,625
[ERU] I couldn't have
planned it better myself!

163
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,166
[ERU] I would be honored
to be a guest on your show!

164
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,166
Great!

165
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,750
We meet at 12 noon
in the studio!

166
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,750
The broadcast starts
at 12:30 sharp.

167
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,625
See you then!

168
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,708
Right!

169
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,166
Hey, guys. I'm back.

170
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,458
Great! Hi, Chitanda.

171
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,083
Thanks for watching the store.

172
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,208
Have there been any
further developments?

173
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,666
The thief skipped "ku."

174
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,416
He stole <i>gen</i> , a string
from the Light Music Club.

175
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,583
I think we should
start over from scratch.

176
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,875
[ERU]
What's your opinion, Oreki?

177
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,291
He's all engrossed
with that <i>doujin</i> manga;

178
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,916
he's had his head
buried in it for a while.

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
[ERU]
Oh.

180
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,708
This is so good.

181
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,291
Oh, yeah?

182
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,625
Hold on...

183
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,958
What's the matter?

184
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:43,958
[ERU] For some reason,
that picture looks really

185
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,291
familiar to me.

186
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,958
[HOTARO] Your eyes are
playing tricks on you.

187
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,375
My sister just
brought this to me.

188
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,291
No way.
There's no doubt in my mind.

189
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,208
Chitanda, this is really
not the time for that stuff.

190
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,000
But... I've seen it.

191
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,000
I... I have to know!

192
00:09:59,083 --> 00:09:59,875
[HOTARO]
There it is.

193
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,208
It's on the tip of my tongue!

194
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,125
Swallow it.

195
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,166
But I can't!

196
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,458
That's not my problem.

197
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,583
Just let me look at
another page, okay?

198
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,333
Fine, then.

199
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,750
Thanks, I won't take long!

200
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,625
[SATOSHI giggling]

201
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,958
This one!

202
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,750
It looks similar to
a poster I saw outside

203
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,333
of the conference room!

204
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,041
[SATOSHI]
Yeah, you're right. It does.

205
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,291
Hey, Oreki.

206
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,125
Would you mind letting
me borrow this manga?

207
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,333
I want to compare the two!

208
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,500
 All right.

209
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,916
Just make sure you
bring it back quickly.

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,083
I kind of need it.

211
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,208
[ERU]
Right!

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,541
This is some fine
artwork right here.

213
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,291
Thank you. Have a lovely day!

214
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,375
[MAYAKA]
I'm all done.

215
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,166
Now what?

216
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,541
[STUDENTS chattering]

217
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,625
Great.

218
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,666
[chattering continues]

219
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,291

Whoop-sies!

00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,625
[SAWAI gasps]

00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,333
[water splashes]

222
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,583
I'm so sorry, Ibara.

223
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,333
I really didn't mean to do that.

224
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,583
[MAYAKA]
It's no big deal.

225
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:45,500
It's khaki, so even if it
stains, it won't show up anyway.

226
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,375
At least I hope not.

227
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,208
Ibara...

228
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,250
Ibara...

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,208
[MAYAKA]
Sorry, President.

230
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,250
I hope you can
manage without me.

231
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,125
[YUASA] You need to change out

233
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,291
[MAYAKA]
Don't worry about me! I'm fine.

234
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,708
Oh, Mayaka!

235
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,541
Hi, Chi.

236
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,208
Hey, are you busy right now?

237
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,250
Gym clothes?

238
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,291
Mm-hmm. I had to change.

239
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,958
No, I'm not busy, what's up?

240
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:44,083
Oh. It's about this!

241
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,750
What? That's crazy!
Where did you get it?

242
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,500
I borrowed it from Oreki.
He was reading it earlier.

243
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,208
Why did he have it?

244
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,416
He said that his sister
brought it to him.

245
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,458
Mayaka, how familiar are you
with this particular manga?

246
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,541
Well... very. Oddly enough.

247
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,791
[ERU]
That's awesome!

248
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,458
I saw a poster promoting
the Cultural Festival,

249
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,250
and I'm certain that
whoever drew this manga

250
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,833
also drew the poster!

251
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,708
I think the style's identical,
but I need an expert opinion!

252
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,125
I have to know!

253
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,083
[MAYAKA]
Where did you see this poster?

254
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,583
[ERU]
Next to the conference room!

255
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,958
[MAYAKA]
Right! Let's go!

256
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,375
[ERU]
What do you think?

257
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,958
I'm 99% sure it's
the same person.

258
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,375
The way they handle
the ears is unmistakable.

259
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,875
So I was correct!

260
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,666
Thanks, I'm glad to hear it!

261
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,750
It was lucky that
I ran into you!

262
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,000
[laughs]

263
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,125
You had to know!

264
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,208
Yep!

265
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,375
Well, then.

266
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,875
Would you like to
find out who drew it?

267
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,208
Yeah, of course! Bonus points!

268
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,083
[TANABE]
Yes?

269
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,791
We meet again, Tanabe.

270
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,458
Hello. You're from the...
hold on.

271
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,583
Classic Lit Club.

272
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,750
That's right.

273
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,250
So, how can I help you?

274
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,875
We're really sorry
to bother you,

275
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,375
but we're curious: Could you
tell us who drew that poster

276
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,458
on the wall right there?

277
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,791
Ah. That would be Kugayama.

278
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,083
[ERU] What?
You mean Muneyoshi Kugayama?

279
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,791
The student council president?

280
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,291
The same.

281
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,375
I had to badger him a bit to
convince him, but he caved.

282
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,833
Turned out well, huh?

283
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes!

284
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,875
It's absolutely beautiful!
A masterpiece!

285
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,833
[TANABE laughs] He'll be tickled
when I tell him you said that.

286
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,333
[MAYAKA]
This is incredible!

287
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,833
I now know the author
and the artist!

288
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,666
Maybe I'll get the chance to
chat with them in person!

289
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,041
I hope this lucky
streak keeps rolling.

290
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,083
[ERU]
We solved the mystery!

291
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,083
So, was it the same person?

292
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,416
Wait... What the heck?

293
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,583
Why the gym clothes?
What about Manga Club?

294
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,791
Oh. I had to change.

295
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,083
It was the same person!

296
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,000
We even found out his name!

297
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,583
Oh, wow. Good for you.

298
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,583
[ERU]
It was Muneyoshi Kugayama.

299
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,208
Isn't that a surprise?

300
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,458
Should I know who that is?

301
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,666
All right. Come on, Hotaro,

302
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,583
that's enough messing
around for today.

303
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,250
[HOTARO]
Seriously, who is that?

304
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,833
[MAYAKA]
The student council president.

305
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,041
Right. I remember.

306
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,666
[HOTARO] This whole time
I thought it was pronounced

307
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,833
"Rikuyama."

308
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,916
So that means this
Kugayama guy is the artist

309
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,833
of the Anshinin Takuha group who
created that manga?

310
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,291
[SATOSHI] What do you mean,
"Anshinin Takuha?"

311
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,666
That's meant to be
read as, "Ajimu."

312
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,500
It's a place in Kyushu.

313
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,416
Is that information crucial
to surviving my daily life?

314
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,375
[ERU]
I mean...

315
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,291
The pronunciation is
written in Romanized text

316
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,708
right here on the cover,
next to the name.

317
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,291
Kugayama did the artwork,

318
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,833
but the story itself was written
by someone named Anjo Haruna.

319
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,208
[HOTARO] Oh. So you know
something about this manga?

320
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,625
It's one of my favorites.

321
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,083
I bought it at last year's
cultural festival.

322
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,333
[HOTARO] For Ibara to say that
openly, it must be remarkable.

323
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,125
[MAYAKA]
Listen, Oreki...

324
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,333
Do you think... I could
borrow it for a bit?

325
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,625
Yeah, that's cool,
but give me a little while.

326
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,375
I need it right now.

327
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,833
You do?

328
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,916
Oh, yeah! I almost forgot!

329
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,708
The Broadcasting Club
is having me as a guest

330
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,208
on their lunchtime show!

331
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,250
[HOTARO]
She's what?!

332
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,958
[MAYAKA]
Wow, Chi, that's amazing!

333
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,041
[SATOSHI]
Way to go!

334
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,166
We couldn't have
asked for better.

335
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,208
Our goal of selling all these
copies just got within reach!

336
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,833
Now, let me coach
you through the basics

337
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,250
of giving a good interview.

338
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,666
[ERU]
Would you really do that?

339
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,208
[SATOSHI]
Yes.

340
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,708
First and foremost, guests are
only allotted five minutes.

341
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,833
That's a mere blip.

342
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,250
So the question becomes:

343
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,625
"How can you manage to
stand out with so little time?"

00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,458
<i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> .

350
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,000
What's up?

351
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,250
How 'bout it?

352
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,375
'Bout what?

353
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,458
Nothing.

354
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,833
[HOTARO]
Oh, well.

355
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,583
My thoughts were at a
standstill, anyway.

356
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,083
Normally, I would
try to get unstuck

357
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,333
by talking everything out
with these guys.

358
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,250
But Chitanda would
stand in my way.

359
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,833
If she knew what
I was trying to do,

360
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,666
she'd definitely be against it.

361
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,166
[HOTARO]
Satoshi.

362
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,208
[SATOSHI]
Hm?

363
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,791
I need to borrow you
for a second.

364
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,541
You've figured something out,
haven't you, Hotaro?

365
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,958
[gasps]

366
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,916
Hey, is that true?
Tell us, Oreki!

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,750
[HOTARO] No one asked you to
share your hunches!

368
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,916
Now Chitanda's got that
insatiably curious look

369
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,375
in her eyes!

370
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,375
[ERU] Have you had some
kind of realization?

371
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,125
No, I haven't.
I promise you!

372
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,625
So, then,

373
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,500
are you saying this isn't about
the Jumoji matter at all?

374
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,041
Well, uh...

375
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,250
Come on. Out with it.

376
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,500
[ERU]
Yes, please tell us.

377
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,041
I'm curious, and I want to
be in the loop about things.

378
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,041
So why keep it a secret?

379
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:09,625
[HOTARO]
Not fair! Okay, fine.

380
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,875
[HOTARO] It does have to do
with the Jumoji affair.

381
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,750
Great! Then you have to tell us!

382
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,625
It's obscene. That's why
I left you out of it. Okay?

383
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,458
[SATOSHI laughing]

384
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,208
So... it's "obscene," huh?

385
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,375
Let's hear this lewdness.

386
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,375
Sorry to drag you
out here with this.

387
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,666
No worries.
Doesn't bother me at all.

388
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,041
[HOTARO] It's not even
like I have anything

389
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,958
earth-shattering to talk about.

390
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,583
I just have a few
problems I can't seem

391
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,125
to wrap my head around,

392
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,666
and I have a feeling that they
might be pretty significant.

393
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,083
Did you discover
some hidden link

394
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,541
between the clubs that have
already fallen victim?

395
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,208
[HOTARO] No. I haven't
discovered anything there.

396
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,791
Then, did you find some
mistake in Jumoji's methods

397
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,541
that might lead us to an answer?

398
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,458
[HOTARO]
It's not so much that, either.

399
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,583
What's wrong?

400
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,666
[SATOSHI]
How do we proceed?

401
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,125
There are over a
thousand suspects.

402
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,250
How are we ever supposed
to identify the culprit

403
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,916
without finding any
real leads or mistakes?

404
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,125
Yeah. Good question.

405
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,666
[SATOSHI]
But it's not possible!

406
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,583
Look, it's not like I don't
have any ideas about it.

407
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,875
I just need to gather my
thoughts a little better.

408
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,458
Mm-hmm. Let's hear them, then.

409
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,416
I'm looking forward
to it, Hotaro.

410
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,375
First of all...

411
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,666
What's the evidence that he's
stealing ten specific items

412
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,625
from ten different clubs?

413
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,666
We just assumed that because of
the way he signed his notes.

414
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,750
[SATOSHI] And that assumption
has since been challenged

415
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,125
by new events.

416
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,583
[HOTARO]
Second...

417
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,791
Why does he leave a calling
card at all of his crimes?

418
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,083
[SATOSHI]
Yeah.

419
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,458
You mean like this?

420
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,708
Third question...

421
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,166
Why does he keep saying that the
missing items have been lost?

422
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,541
Wouldn't you say
"stolen," or, "taken?"

423
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:05,458
Fourth, why does he always leave
a Kanyasai guidebook, too?

424
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,166
It's not the only thing
that lists all the clubs.

425
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,208
Why choose that in particular?

426
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,875
That reminds me.
I picked this up.

427
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,416
It was at the
Cooking Club event.

428
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,833
Fifth, why'd he choose
to target the Cooking Club

429
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,583
and the Gardening Club?

430
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,625
There are several other clubs
that start with "E" and "O."

431
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,583
Especially since the Cooking
Club's usually called

432
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,708
the <i>Ryori</i> Club, not <i>Oryori</i> .

433
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,291
Answering that could
help us figure out

434
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,750
whether the Classic Lit Club
or the Industrial Arts Club

435
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,791
will be hit next.

436
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,500
Sixth question, and no
doubt the weirdest one of all:

437
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,166
Why did he decide to
skip over "ku,"

438
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,791
and hit "ke" next instead?

439
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,416
[SATOSHI] That's simple: he did
it to keep from being noticed.

440
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,583
The Global Action Club
was crawling with civilians,

441
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,250
and it would've made
the crime too difficult.

442
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,541
[HOTARO]
Lastly, seventh.

443
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,416
There's this.

444
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,416
Are you implying the manga has
something to do with this case?

445
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,458
[HOTARO] That's my hunch,
but I haven't decided yet.

446
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,583
What do you think when you hear,

447
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,791
"one of Christie's
most famous works?"

448
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,583
[SATOSHI]
Let me see...

449
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,583
I'd say,
<i>And Then There Were None</i> ,

450
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,500
Then <i>Murder on</i>
<i>the Orient Express</i> ,

451
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,875
<i>A.B.C. Murders</i> ,

452
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,208
and <i>The Murder</i>
<i>of Roger Ackroyd</i> .

453
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,541
Those come to mind.

454
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,916
[HOTARO] If someone were to use
one of them

455
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,666
as the basis for a manga
with the title

456
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,500
<i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> ,

457
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,416
I'd think they would use, <i>The</i>
<i>A.B.C. Murders</i> , wouldn't you?

458
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,791
[SATOSHI] Well, Kudryavka
was a nickname for the dog

459
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,541
the Soviets shot into space,
but she never made it back.

460
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,750
With that violent image in mind,
I think I would say,

461
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,000
<i>And Then There Were None</i> ,
instead.

462
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,666
[HOTARO] Well, since
we're only speculating,

463
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,541
we don't have to
pin it down just yet.

464
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,916
[sighs]

465
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,041
I believe I'm finally
beginning to piece together

466
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,625
what you're getting at, Hotaro.

467
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,291
Satoshi,

468
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,750
do you know if there's a manga
called, <i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i>

469
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,041
being sold at the festival?

470
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,416
There's not.

471
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,541
At least, the executive
committee hasn't been told.

472
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,666
I also think Mayaka would have
mentioned it to us

473
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,250
if the Manga Club
was selling it.

474
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,125
Keyword, "if."

475
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,083
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i>
came out at last year's

476
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,875
Cultural Festival, apparently.

477
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,416
In the afterword,
there was an announcement

478
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,833
that they would write
a manga this year

479
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,375
that was going to be
a take on one of

480
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,625
"Christie's most famous works."

481
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,833
You and I have said we
think that work is either

482
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:03,958
<i>And Then There Were None</i> ,

483
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,625
or <i>The A.B.C. Murders</i> .

484
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,750
At this year's
Cultural Festival,

485
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,416
events similar to <i>The A.B.C.</i>
<i>Murders</i> are taking place,

486
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,000
albeit on a much
less sinister scale.

487
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,791
Is that just coincidence?

488
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,708
In other words, you think the
key to solving the Jumoji case 

489
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,083
is contained in the end of
" <i>A Corpse by Evening</i> ."

490
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,458
Is that what you're saying?

491
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,958
[HOTARO] I guess I'm saying
I don't think they're

492
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,541
completely unrelated.

493
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:28,916
[SATOSHI]
Hmm...

494
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,541
[HOTARO] I think this Jumoji
character is just trying

495
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,416
to carry on with his little
caper for as long as he can,

496
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,000
causing an uproar
at the festival

497
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,166
with as little
interference as possible.

498
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,083
I don't think this
is all just for fun.

499
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,333
Still, why would he
skip over "ku?"

500
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,875
There are a number of ways
to pull that one off.

501
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:47,208
Satoshi, there's a specific
reason he's doing this.

502
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,541
I'm gonna head back in.

503
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,541
I wanna help
Chitanda prepare.

504
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,583
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

505
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,583
I'm going to see if there's
anything in this stuff

506
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:00,833
you gave me.

507
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,125
Oh! Satoshi!

508
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,750
Tell Chitanda to have
some "ko" items

509
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,500
out somewhere they'd
be easy to find.

510
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,250
Right. Bait...
I like that idea.

511
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,833
Proofed manuscripts?
<i>Koryogenko</i> fits the bill.

512
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,666
[SATOSHI] I have high hopes
for this, Hotaro.

513
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,583
We go live when he
gives us the cue, okay?

514
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,458
Right!

515
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,375
On in five seconds.

516
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,250
Four. Three.

517
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,250
A special broadcast of
Yasukuni Yoshino's Radio Beat!

518
