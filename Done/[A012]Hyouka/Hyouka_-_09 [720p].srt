1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,541
[EBA] Each of these three
has their own theory

2
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,708
about how the murder mystery
is supposed to play out

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,750
in the finished script.

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,250
I'd appreciate it
if you'd listen

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,250
to what they have to say and
then tell me what you think.

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,125
Sure!

7
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,333
[NAKAJO]
So, what's the deal?

8
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,500
You guys are mystery
experts or somethin'?

9
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,125
[EBA]
This is Junya Nakajo.

10
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,291
He's our assistant director.

11
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,000
And that's Tomohiro Haba.

12
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,541
The props master.

13
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,000
Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,000
[EBA]
Finally, we have...

15
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,083
Ciao, ciao!

16
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,041
[EBA]
Misaki Sawakiguchi. PR rep.

17
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,333
Thanks for coming all
the way to Class F!

18
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:40,666
This is gonna be awesome!

19
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,708
Yeah. Sure.

20
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,916
I'm kinda gettin' a weird
vibe from these three.

21
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,125
All right then--we'll
let you get started.

22
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,500
Have fun! We'll talk soon!

23
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,958
[HABA]
Hope it goes well.

24
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,250
Sorry we got even
more people dragged

25
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,583
into this mess.

26
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,625
The movie was a blast
when we first started out,

27
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,500
but without an ending,
we're kinda screwed,

28
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,791
so thanks a lot for helping.

29
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:33,708
Sure.

30
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,166
[ERU]
Oh, I almost forgot!

31
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,291
Here.

32
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,458
I brought these for
everyone to share.

33
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,708
What are they?

34
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,416
Whiskey-filled chocolates, huh?

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,541
Promotional samples of a
new product, apparently.

36
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,291
[HOTARO gags]

37
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,750
[ALL coughing]

38
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,916
Phew!

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,958
--[MAYAKA groaning]
--[HOTARO coughing]

40
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,416
That's strong!

41
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,916
[HOTARO grunts]

42
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,291
[NAKAJO]
Well, wanna get started?

43
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,375
Why don't you give
us your perspective

44
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,041
as a member of the film crew?

45
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,125
Would you say it was
a difficult shoot?

46
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,000
[NAKAJO] The performance
and production side of things

47
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,541
was pretty fun, actually.

48
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,958
It was just getting out there
that was a pain in the butt.

49
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,833
By bus and train, the trip
was more than an hour.

50
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,208
I mean, would it
have killed them

51
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,791
to choose someplace closer?

52
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,250
Why do think they
chose that location?

53
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,041
I guess someone
recommended it because

54
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,791
it had an interesting
look to it.

55
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,208
I've heard about
the deserted village

56
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,083
in the Narakubo area,
but I'm surprised

57
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,375
you were allowed to film there.

58
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,125
The person who
recommended it had an in

59
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,458
with the property manager.

60
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,250
What's this got to do
with anything, though?

61
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,708
You never know what
information might

62
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,250
hold an important clue.
Please, let's continue.

63
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,250
Actually, if you don't
mind me interrupting,

64
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,000
I'd love to know
how Hongo is doing.

65
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,125
Not very well
from the sound of it.

66
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,833
But honestly, I wasn't too
surprised when she got sick.

67
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,416
Why's that?

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,041
Is she the type of person who
gets sick a lot or something?

69
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,791
Yeah, she's been
absent from school

70
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,750
a whole bunch of times
throughout the year.

71
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,583
She didn't make it out
to the shoot, either.

72
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,166
[HOTARO] She worked
that hard on the script

73
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,875
but then didn't
come to the shoot?

74
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,041
[HOTARO] How did the crew
feel about Hongo's script?

75
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,041
Was it pretty well-received?

76
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,333
[NAKAJO]
Of course it was!

77
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,750
No one had any problems with it.

78
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,958
I mean, why would they?

79
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,500
[HOTARO]
You sound a little defensive.

80
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,583
I'm sorry. Did I hit a nerve?

81
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,083
[NAKAJO]
I'm not being defensive.

82
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,500
I'm just telling you that
everyone liked Hongo's script.

83
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,291
And that includes me!

84
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,583
[MAYAKA]
Ahem.

85
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,291
Let's move on to
a different question.

86
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,208
Uh-- Sure.

87
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,666
So did Hongo say anything
to the actors about

88
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,333
which of them might
be playing the murderer?

89
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:30,750
Hm... No, there's not really
anything I can think of.

90
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,875
Well, maybe...

91
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,041
[gasps]

92
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,833
It might not mean
anything, but I remember

93
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,083
she made a point to
wish Konosu good luck.

94
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,250
[HOTARO] Which she could
easily have said to anyone.

95
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,875
So then, have you interviewed
all the actors about this?

96
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,666
To see if Hongo
said anything to them

97
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,916
that might be helpful?

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,208
No, none of them.

99
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,041
As assistant director,
did you observe

100
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,000
anything else that
might be significant?

101
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,458
Significant, like how?

102
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,333
[MAYAKA groans]

103
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,750
Well. Questions over?

104
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,291
So maybe you'd like
to hear my theory

105
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,250
about the murderer now?

106
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,583
More than anything.

107
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,916
Ahem!

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,666
If you ask me, your
typical viewer doesn't care

109
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,416
about fancy plot devices.

110
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
All they want is a good story.

111
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,791
"That's him! He's the murderer!"

112
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,833
[NAKAJO]
Once his guilt is revealed,

113
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:15,916
the culprit breaks down

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,041
in tears and
confesses his crimes.

115
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,958
The mystery's solved,
and everyone goes home happy.

116
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,708
Uh...

117
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,958
[HOTARO]
Huh?

118
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,083
I think that's just the
sort of satisfying ending

119
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,500
the audience would expect
after the horrifying discovery

120
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,958
of Kaito's body. Our props
guy did a great job

121
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:32,833
with that scene.

122
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,458
Even on the fly.

123
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,583
[HOTARO]
"On the fly"?

124
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,958
You're saying the
scene was adlibbed?

125
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,125
[NAKAJO]
Yeah.

126
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,833
Everybody got all
fussy about it, though.

127
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,000
Goin' on about the
rules of a mystery.

128
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,083
It's the drama of the story
that matters, not the details!

129
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,291
I say play the title straight.

130
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,458
"The Case of the Furuoka
Deserted Village Murder."

131
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,708
Putting death right
there in the title

132
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,125
is a good way to sell seats.

133
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,708
I betcha Hongo knew that
much about mystery flicks.

134
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,500
Hm.

135
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,791
Okay, then.

136
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,250
Do you wanna tell us
your theory of the crime?

137
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,750
[NAKAJO]
Given the way he died, you know

138
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,666
what this was, right?

139
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,333
A locked-room murder.

140
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,541
Kaito was found in a
room with only one door,

141
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,250
and it was locked. So,
how'd the killer get out?

142
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,916
That's the real question here.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,166
[MAYAKA] And... You think
you have an answer?

144
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,625
[NAKAJO]
Sure. It's simple.

145
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,500
Through the window.

146
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,791
[MAYAKA]
The window?

147
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,166
[NAKAJO]
Yeah.

148
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,291
The murderer kills Kaito
then climbs out the window.

149
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,416
It's pretty obvious
if ya think about it.

150
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,458
[HOTARO]
Hold on.

151
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,291
My memory's a little
bit fuzzy here.

152
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,750
Satoshi, you have the floorplan?

153
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,958
Yes, sir, I've got it right
here as a matter of fact.

154
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,916
There. Let's take a look.

155
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,583
[SATOSHI] This is the
room where Kaito died.

156
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,458
In the stage left wing.

157
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,458
The other characters
enter the room here,

158
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,083
through the right hallway.

159
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,375
Except initially,
the door was locked.

160
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,583
So two of the characters
head back down the hall

161
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,333
to get the master key.

162
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,250
[MAYAKA]
Then they return, open the door,

163
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,208
and find Kaito dead
inside the room.

164
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,791
There were two
other entry points,

165
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,916
but they were totally blocked
with furniture and other junk.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,666
[SATOSHI]
So, as Nakajo suggested,

167
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,041
there were only two points
of access to the murder scene.

168
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,000
The door everyone
came in through,

169
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,583
and the window on this wall.

170
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,291
[ERU] Except, that doesn't
mean much of anything

171
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,958
if Hongo didn't know when
she wrote the script.

172
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,750
Oh. I'm sorry.

173
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,791
I just mean...

174
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,458
Well, uh...

175
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,583
You're totally right,
that's important.

176
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,083
[MAYAKA]
How do you figure?

177
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,541
What if she wrote
the script without

178
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,875
seeing the place?

179
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,875
If the story was based on
the floor plan alone,

180
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,875
she might have considered
other escape routes

181
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,708
for the murderer to have taken.

182
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,833
[NAKAJO]
She saw it.

183
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,666
Hongo went to visit
the shoot location

184
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,333
before she started
writing the script.

185
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,958
Do you know when
she went to see it?

186
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,666
[NAKAJO]
I think it was June.

187
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,375
No, maybe the end
of May, actually.

188
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,291
Is that so?

189
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,333
[NAKAJO]
So there ya go, right?

190
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,375
The killer came in and went
out through the window.

191
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,416
No need for a door at all.

192
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,458
Just climb in, do the deed,
and climb back out.

193
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,041
Mystery solved.

194
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:57,541
Boom!

195
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,291
[HOTARO gasps]

196
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,958
[HOTARO]
Really? "Boom"?

197
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:04,250
That works, but it wouldn't make
for a very well-crafted mystery.

198
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,250
Why would it be "well-crafted"?

199
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,166
It's not like Hongo was
an expert on mysteries.

200
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,625
It didn't really
seem like she had

201
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,916
anything fancy in mind.

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,666
Okay then, who's the killer?

203
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,041
What do you mean?

204
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,625
Even if we say your theory about

205
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,791
how it went down is true, can
you tell us who the killer is?

206
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,541
[sighs] Well...

207
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,083
You didn't take into
account the fact

208
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,375
that we get a look outside
the window after everyone

209
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,916
arrives at the scene, did you?

210
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,458
[NAKAJO]
Uh...

211
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,458
[MAYAKA]
The grass was way overgrown.

212
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,125
Anyone passing through
it would have left

213
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,500
a pretty obvious trail,
but from what I recall,

214
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,166
nothing looked like it was even
a little bit out of place.

215
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,875
That doesn't line up
with your theory.

216
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,875
The killer couldn't have
fled through the window.

217
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,541
I dunno--maybe Hongo forgot
to write that part in.

218
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,666
Now you're grasping at straws.

219
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,375
Come on. Hongo wasn't a slacker.

220
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,416
From what we've heard,
her writing was consistent.

221
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,666
Yeah, I guess that's true.

222
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,666
Wait a sec! It's summer now!

223
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,916
Don't you get it?

224
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,541
Remember how I said that
Hongo went to scout out

225
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,208
the site back at the end of May?

226
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, at that point in time,
the summer grass

227
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,208
hadn't grown in yet!

228
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,958
So she probably wouldn't
have taken the grass

229
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,291
into account when
she wrote the scene.

230
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,541
All we have to do is
cut the grass and re-shoot

231
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,541
the dead body scene,
then everything should fall

232
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,333
neatly into place,
top to bottom!

233
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,416
And there ya have it. Boom!

234
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,416
Ha...

235
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,375
See? We solved it!

236
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,125
The killer fled
through the window.

237
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,125
Now we can get back to
shooting and finish this movie.

238
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,041
Thanks! See ya later!

239
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:31,958
Huh...

240
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,375
You think he's right?

241
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,083
It's not much of a plot twist.

242
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,333
It isn't fancy. But it
is feasible at least.

243
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,458
[MAYAKA]
Feasible and lame.

244
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,208
[ERU]
Well, Oreki?

245
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,333
Do you think Nakajo's
theory is in line

246
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,541
with what Hongo
originally intended?

247
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,208
It doesn't sit right with you?

248
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,458
I wouldn't say that.

249
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,791
I...

250
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,041
I'm not totally
convinced, that's all.

251
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,208
[HOTARO] In other words,
it doesn't sit right with you.

252
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah.

253
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,000
Well,

254
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,000
I can definitely see flaws
in Nakajo's version of events.

255
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:03,833
Huh?

256
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,333
Would you care to elaborate?

257
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,791
What seems like
a simple solution

258
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,708
to the physical problem
of a locked room

259
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,375
is made problematic itself
by the psychology involved.

260
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,958
Say what now?

261
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,541
You think you could find a more
convoluted way of putting it?

262
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,708
Every bit the
cerebral detective.

263
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,416
[HOTARO]
Hmph.

264
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,750
Uh...

265
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,833
Would you mind explaining
what you meant, exactly?

266
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,416
Just that any killer
with an instinct

267
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,416
for self-preservation
wouldn't risk going in

268
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,125
through the window.

269
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,708
The window's here, right?

270
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,916
If you go in that way,
you're practically guaranteed

271
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,041
to be seen by somebody.

272
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,625
There are other windows
here, here, and here.

273
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,625
Walking around in broad
daylight, there's no way

274
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,916
you're going to go unnoticed.

275
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,166
[SATOSHI]
Good call.

276
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,791
If I were the killer,
that would probably be

277
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,750
the last way I'd go.

278
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,833
Well, that's my take, anyway.

279
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,125
[MAYAKA]
I get your point.

280
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,333
But did Hongo see the
same problems you did?

281
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,958
There's no way for us to know.

282
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,208
You may be right.

283
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,125
But I do think if we can
get our hands on a copy

284
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,166
of the script, that would
help us figure some stuff out.

285
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,416
[SATOSHI] I'm curious.
When it comes to mysteries,

286
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,125
what kind does everybody read?

287
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,791
Uh, why?

288
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,125
[SATOSHI]
I got to thinking while we were

289
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,875
listening to Nakajo talk.

290
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,583
He has his own idea
of what a "mystery"

291
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,666
should look like,
but what do we all think?

292
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,458
Nakajo's idea of a mystery
seems as sophisticated

293
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,916
as a kid's picture book.

294
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,416
[SATOSHI] Mm-hm. What kind
do you read, then?

295
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,541
Dunno.

296
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,500
Just the standard
bestsellers, really.

297
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,041
And you, Mayaka?

298
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,208
Old stuff. You know,
like Christie.

299
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,500
The classics, huh?

300
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,708
What about you, Chitanda?

301
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,458
I don't read them.

302
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,375
Seriously? Not at all?

303
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,750
It's not that I've
never read one,

304
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,416
it's just I haven't
bothered to in a long time.

305
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,583
The truth is, I don't really
care for mystery novels.

306
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,958
I guess I've read enough
of them to know that much,

307
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:53,833
at least.

308
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,041
That blows my mind.

309
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,458
Didn't see that one coming.

310
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,958
Okay, so what's your
mystery genre of choice?

311
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,875
Oh, me? Ah. Well, you know.

312
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,666
He may not wanna come
right out and say it,

313
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,250
but Fuku here fancies
himself to be a Sherlockian.

314
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,583
What? I've never heard
of a Sherlockian before.

315
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,000
[HOTARO]
From the name, I'd say it refers

316
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,416
to a passionate fan
of Sherlock Holmes.

317
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,291
Very passionate.
Seriously hardcore.

318
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,416
Right?

319
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,000
[SATOSHI laughs nervously]

320
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,250
I don't know if
that's really how

321
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,458
I would describe it.

322
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,791
You might be oversimplifying
a little bit.

323
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,958
[knocking]

324
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,041
Uh--

325
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,500
Did the interview go well?

326
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,458
Yeah. I guess.

327
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,958
We've rejected
Nakajo's idea, though.

328
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,833
Very well. I understand.

329
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,250
There's one other thing.

330
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,583
What is it?

331
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,375
You think you could get
us a copy of the script?

332
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:50,333
We'd like to get a better feel
for Hongo's attention to detail.

333
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,875
I'll see if I can find one.

334
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,666
It may take me some time.

335
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,833
While I'm looking, you can
speak with our props master,

336
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:59,000
Tomohiro Haba. He's
waiting just outside.

337
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,166
Hey there.

338
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,416
I understand the
four of you know

339
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,291
your mystery stories.

340
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,875
[HOTARO sighs]

341
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,958
[hiccups] Oh.

342
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,208
[HABA]
You know,

343
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,916
if you think of a mystery
as a contest between

344
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,125
author and reader,

345
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,166
an amateur writer like
poor Hongo is bound

346
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,666
to come up a little short.

347
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,875
[MAYAKA] We heard that she
didn't have a lot of experience

348
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,500
with the genre.

349
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,500
Yeah.

350
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,916
She used those
books to get ideas

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,500
for how to write the screenplay.

352
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,666
Until she started
working on this film,

353
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,750
I don't think she'd seen
any crime shows or movies

354
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,625
or read any mystery novels.

355
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:41,125
Oh, the Nobuhara translation.
Looks like the latest editions.

356
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,666
She was teaching
herself how to write

357
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,875
a mystery by reading
Holmes novels?

358
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,000
See what I mean?

359
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,500
Obviously, Hongo was
a total amateur.

360
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,958
[SATOSHI] I suppose you
could put it that way.

361
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,833
Hey, Oreki, look at this.

362
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:57,916
What is it?

363
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,916
There are some
strange looking marks

364
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,250
here on this paper. See?

365
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,416
Here's another one.
They're on here, too!

366
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,583
She probably just
marked the stories

367
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,125
she wanted to draw from.

368
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,875
You really think that's all?

369
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,375
[HABA]
Well, anyway...

370
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,583
When are we gonna
work on our own mystery?

371
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,791
[SATOSHI]
What is this?

372
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,541
[HABA]
A floorplan from town hall.

373
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,833
[SATOSHI]
Oh.

374
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,291
[MAYAKA] We're interested
to hear your theory.

375
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,375
Ahem.

376
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,833
If you want my
opinion, this mystery

377
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,791
is not especially
difficult to solve.

378
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,250
Not if you're experienced
with this sort of thing.

379
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,500
Is that so?

380
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,041
The first point I would
make is that the murder

381
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,458
was not premeditated.

382
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,208
Rather, circumstances simply
fell neatly into place,

383
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,625
and the killer seized
that opportunity to act.

384
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,791
Why do you say that?

385
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,916
Heh... It couldn't
have been pre-planned,

386
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,708
since there was no way
to guarantee Kaito

387
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,000
would end up in that room.

388
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,500
The keys were spread out
on the table, remember?

389
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,875
Everybody picked
one up at random,

390
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,458
and that's what decided
where they went to explore.

391
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,541
Now, then.

392
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,208
This is a locked-room
murder, right?

393
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,291
All points of escape
were effectively blocked,

394
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,208
aside from the window,
and the ground outside

395
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,000
of that showed no sign of
having been recently disturbed.

396
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,208
That tells us whoever
killed Kaito could not

397
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,208
have escaped using
conventional methods.

398
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,708
And of course, let's not forget
the question of how the killer

399
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,250
entered the room
in the first place.

400
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,708
Could they have used
the master key

401
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,333
and then replaced it afterwards?

402
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,125
That is clearly an
implausible explanation.

403
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,166
In order to get to the
office where the keys were,

404
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,458
they would have to risk passing
through the front lobby here.

405
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,291
That would put them
in danger of being seen

406
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,458
by any of the other characters
who were moving about

407
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,666
the building, so we can easily
write-off that possibility.

408
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,833
And the office isn't
the only area the killer

409
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,041
couldn't reach.

410
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,791
The first-floor hallway
down the right side

411
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,583
is the only open route
leading to the room

412
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,500
in which Kaito was found,
but none of the others

413
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,666
could have accessed it.

414
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,791
Can anyone tell us why?

415
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,541
For the same reason
you already gave.

416
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,041
They couldn't risk
walking through the lobby

417
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,041
and being seen by somebody.

418
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,958
[HABA]
A good deduction.

419
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,541
Plus, how could
someone reach that room

420
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,708
and still have time to re-enter
from the correct direction

421
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:04,208
when they regrouped?
So, other possibilities.

422
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,208
Perhaps Kaito's death
could have been a suicide

423
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,250
disguised to look like a murder?

424
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,958
Given the fact his
arm was taken off,

425
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,083
I'd say that's highly unlikely.

426
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,000
All in all, this could be
a difficult murder to solve.

427
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,916
At least, for someone
who doesn't have experience

428
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,041
with these things.

429
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,041
But not for you.

430
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,208
This is your specialty, right?

431
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,750
What do you think
the solution is

432
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,250
to this murder mystery?

433
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,083
Well, gosh.

434
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,125
I just don't know.

435
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,333
The mystery expert doesn't know!

436
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,291
Well, I suppose I can't
really blame you.

437
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,916
[HABA]
This is the key.

438
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,041
[SATOSHI]
Some rope?

439
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,750
I am the props master, remember?

440
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,375
And Hongo specifically
asked me to procure this.

441
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,583
She said we needed to find
a rope that was strong enough

442
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,833
that it could support
the full weight of a person.

443
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,416
I'm sure you can see where
this is leading, right?

444
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,125
Just think:

445
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,625
The killer couldn't enter
from the first floor,

446
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,250
but what about the second floor?

447
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,708
Konosu was the one
who went upstairs

448
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,375
to the right-hand hallway.

449
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,250
Konosu is in the
Mountaineering Club,

450
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,166
although you wouldn't know
it from looking at her.

451
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,208
She dangled the rope out
the second floor window,

452
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,250
climbed down it to the stage
left wing, killed Kaito,

453
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,250
then escaped using
the same route.

454
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,875
If I were going to decide
on a title for the movie...

455
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:11,916
Let me think.

456
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,625
I suppose I'd go
with something like

457
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,125
"The Unseen Incursion."

458
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,458
All right. I'm ready to
hear what you guys think.

459
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,541
[hiccups]

460
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,125
What other props were there?

461
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,750
Did Hongo ask for
anything interesting

462
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,916
besides the strong rope?

463
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,875
No, she didn't have
very many requests,

464
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,583
which I think speaks to
her lack of experience.

465
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,583
For example, the amount
of blood she asked for

466
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,291
wasn't nearly enough.

467
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,916
Fortunately, I had the
foresight to prepare extra

468
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,083
so we would have plenty on hand.

469
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,500
Now, will there
be anything else?

470
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,708
--If not, I'll just be goin--

471
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,416
--You know.
--If not, I'll just be goin--

472
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,666
[HABA]
What is it?

473
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,333
[HOTARO] This may seem
like a silly question,

474
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,250
but have you seen the movie yet?

475
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,833
Actually, I haven't
had the chance to.

476
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,708
[MAYAKA]
That's it! Now I'm grouchy!

477
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:55,833
Yeah, 'bout what?

478
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,041
That guy's attitude.

479
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,250
I mean, he even made fun
of Sherlock Holmes.

480
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,833
Didn't that bother
you at all, Fuku?

481
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:01,833
Not really.

482
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,041
How could it not?

483
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,833
I think Sherlock Holmes
stories are perfect

484
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,833
for newcomers to
the mystery genre.

485
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,500
And that's exactly
what Hongo was,

486
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,083
so why shouldn't
she start there?

487
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,291
[MAYAKA grumbles]

488
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,458
So, what do we think
about Haba's conclusion?

489
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,541
Well...

490
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,166
It seemed like a
pretty good one to me.

491
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,625
I'm not saying I like the guy,
but there must be a reason

492
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,916
Hongo asked for rope,
and he makes a solid case

493
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,166
for his explanation.

494
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,500
Unfortunately, I can't
argue with it either.

495
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,750
[ERU]
I dunno.

496
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,125
I'm not completely
convinced that he's right.

497
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,875
Just like with
Nakajo's explanation--

498
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,250
I can't say what exactly,

499
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,291
but something about it
feels a little off to me.

500
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,333
I don't know, maybe
it's silly, but...

501
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,041
I don't think that's
what Hongo intended

502
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,000
when she was writing the script.

503
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,416
[HOTARO] You really put
down a lot of those.

504
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Whoa!

505
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,000
[ERU]
Whoops! Did I eat all of them?

506
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,625
I couldn't decide
if I liked them,

507
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,625
so I kept trying them

508
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,875
to see if I could
make up my mind.

509
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,625
[MAYAKA]
How are you feeling, Chi?

510
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,250
Oh, I feel totally fine.

511
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,250
Pretty great, actually.

512
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,166
[ERU giggles]

513
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,208
Uh...

514
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,458
[ERU gasps]
Haba's theory!

515
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,416
Oreki, do you think he's
on the right track or what?

516
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,916
No, I think he's wrong.

517
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,250
[MAYAKA]
Why's that?

518
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,125
[HOTARO] It's not the idea
itself that's an issue.

519
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,625
That part's solid enough.

520
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,833
But it doesn't work in
this particular movie.

521
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,166
[SATOSHI]
Why not?

522
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,291
It's inconsistent with
what was filmed.

523
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,375
Oh. I see. The window, huh?

524
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,333
It probably hadn't
been opened in years,

525
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,208
since the place was abandoned.

526
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,833
Katsuta gave it a good pull

527
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,291
and it still
didn't wanna open,

528
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,083
so it must've been shut tight.

529
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,458
Plus, it creaked loudly
and opened upward.

530
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,750
It would be impossible
to open it quietly while

531
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,541
dangling from a rope.

532
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,458
Do we really think Kaito
would just stand there

533
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,000
doing nothing while somebody
was rattling at the window?

534
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,333
[SATOSHI]
That would pretty dumb.

535
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,875
That explains why you asked Haba

536
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,625
whether or not
he'd seen the movie.

537
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,500
[HOTARO] Hongo had gone there
to scope out the place.

538
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,625
If the window was such
an important plot point,

539
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,875
she would've checked to see
if it would open or not.

540
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,833
But we all saw
the footage, right?

541
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,500
Obviously, the state
of the window

542
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,250
wasn't a big concern for her.

543
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,291
[MAYAKA grumbles]
I can't believe I was so quick

544
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,833
to buy that jerk's idea!

545
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,000
[knocking]

546
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,833
How did it go this time?

547
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:07,875
[SATOSHI]
Rejected.

548
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,166
[EBA]
Very well.

549
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,458
[EBA] Here you are.
I've brought the script.

550
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,583
Thank you. This
should be helpful.

551
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,083
Hey, that looks cool!
Can I have one, too?

552
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,333
Tipsy, much?

553
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,833
I'm just fine, thank you.

554
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,500
Come on. Let us see.

555
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,833
[HOTARO] Looks pretty
well laid out to me.

556
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,583
She didn't skimp on details.

557
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,916
Look at this note: "Make sure
there are no footprints

558
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,125
outside the window."

559
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,541
[MAYAKA] Nakajo's theory
is totally out then.

560
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,083
There's still one person left.

561
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,500
Sawakiguchi, right?

562
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,208
[SAWAKIGUCHI]
Sorry, am I late?

563
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,208
Ciao!

564
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,250
Hello, there, Sawakiguchi!

565
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,500
I mean, "ciao"!

566
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,916
[SAWAKIGUCHI]
I'd love to get this sorted out.

567
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,875
There's not much I can do
on the publicity front

568
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,541
till we've got a title.

569
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,541
It's not like I can
start making posters

570
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,250
or anything. It's way
past time we get this whole

571
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,958
script thing settled,
if you ask me.

572
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,333
I've been wondering.

573
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,958
Did Hongo volunteer herself
to write the screenplay?

574
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,916
Nope. She was recommended.

575
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,375
And making the film a mystery?

576
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,375
Voted by the majority.

577
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,208
What about the idea
to make a movie--

578
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,625
I think we're getting
a little off track here.

579
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,500
I don't think so. I'm curious!

580
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,250
Here, I have the
meeting minutes.

581
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,083
If it'll help, you're
welcome to take a look.

582
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,708
[ERU]
Great, thank you!

583
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,083
All righty.

584
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,416
Is everybody ready to listen
to what I have to say?

585
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
First, I'd like to know what
you picture in your head

586
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,458
when you hear
the word "mystery."

587
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,416
Let's start with... this guy!

588
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,458
"Murder on the Orient Express"?

589
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,500
A boring old whodunit book?
How lame can you get?

590
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,833
Huh?

591
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,375
Think about what you see
if you're renting a movie.

592
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,791
It's all slasher flicks--the
kinda stuff that's full of blood

593
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,041
and gore and chainsaws.
You know what I mean?

594
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,541
Except those are horror films.

595
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,791
Yeah, sure, I know
what you mean.

596
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,083
Huh?

597
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,333
Think about it from
the perspective of someone

598
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,875
who's not all that
interested in the genre.

599
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,875
They wouldn't draw a distinction
between mystery and horror.

600
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,208
[SAWAKIGUCHI]
So anyway.

601
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,000
The problem is that no one
could get into the room

602
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,833
where Kaito died, right?

603
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,833
So obviously,
there must have been

604
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:04,875
a seventh person.

605
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,208
Um, what?

606
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,916
[SAWAKIGUCHI] Hongo was
looking for another actor,

607
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,333
in addition to the original six.

608
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,625
[MAYAKA, SATOSHI]
Huh?

609
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,125
Just think about it:
they all begin to suspect

610
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,291
one another.

611
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,500
And right about the
time their paranoia

612
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,833
starts to peak,

613
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,875
the phantom psycho killer
appears out of nowhere!

614
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,041
[HOTARO]
Hm?

615
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,708
Phantom killer?

616
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,791
[BOTH scream]

617
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,333
[SAWAKIGUCHI] I'm not sure how
many of them get killed off,

618
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,750
but I think the best bet is
to have one couple left alive,

619
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,916
y'know, for a little romance.

620
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,166
Together, they're able
to defeat the phantom.

621
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,250
And they share
a kiss at sunrise.

622
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,625
As for the title...

623
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:40,250
"Bloody Beast" would work.

624
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:44,291
Or whatever. That might
be a bit cheesy.

625
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,333
So, what do you think?

626
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,583
Good story, right?

627
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,625
[MAYAKA]
Except...

628
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,500
The room where Kaito
died was locked.

629
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,458
So how did the killer get out?

630
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,750
Isn't it obvious?
He's a phantom.

631
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,166
[MAYAKA, SATOSHI gasp]

632
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,583
[SAWAKIGUCHI] Phantom killers
can walk through walls,

633
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,125
can't they? But if
that doesn't work...

634
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,625
I know!

635
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,916
It could be a vengeful spirit!
Yeah! That's even better!

636
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,125
[ERU]
She's totally, completely wrong!

637
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,666
There's no way that's
how Hongo meant

638
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,791
for it to end when
she wrote the screenplay!

639
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,541
Gettin' a little worked up.

640
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,583
I agree, though, that sounds
more like a bad joke

641
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,708
than a movie.

642
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,291
But technically speaking,
it would fit

643
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,500
with what's been filmed so far.

644
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,500
It's wrong. Just wrong!

645
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,541
Yeah, maybe. But can
you disprove it?

646
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,250
What's wrong is wrong. The end!

647
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,416
[gasps]

648
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,916
You okay?

649
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,750
It's like looking
into a kaleidoscope.

650
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,958
What do you mean?

651
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,791
Hey! Can you hear me?

652
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,291
Hello?

653
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,375
[MAYAKA]
I think she's asleep.

654
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,125
[SATOSHI]
I have to admit...

655
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,750
Sawakiguchi's idea
may have been crazy,

656
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,583
but I kinda liked that about it.

657
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,666
To be honest,
I sorta like it, too.

658
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,916
I'll bet you do.

659
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,916
There are some
inconsistencies, though.

660
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Like what?

661
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,958
We all saw how
detailed the script was.

662
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,208
If Hongo had been planning
that kind of horror twist

663
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,291
for the second half of it,
she would have arranged

664
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,541
for the necessary props,
don't you think?

665
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,250
One prop in particular.

666
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,291
And what would this
particular prop be?

667
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,583
You know.

668
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,916
The one Haba had the
foresight to make lots of.

669
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,500
Oh.

670
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,125
[HOTARO] Hongo only asked for
a small amount of fake blood.

671
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,958
The description in the
script seems to back that up.

672
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,958
Knowing that, we can
assume she wasn't planning

673
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,875
on a movie with
a high body count.

674
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,291
[SATOSHI]
I buy it.

675
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,666
Not much of a horror movie
with only one dead person.

676
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,625
[MAYAKA] It's starting to
feel like we're never going

677
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,291
to figure this out.

678
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,416
[knocking]

679
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,750
[door scrapes]

680
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,708
What did you think
of this theory?

681
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,500
Rejected again.

682
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,208
[MAYAKA] Come on, Chi,
let's get you home.

683
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,791
[ERU]
I'm sorry about this.

684
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:52,958
[MAYAKA]
Uh--

685
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,833
[SATOSHI] Three possible
endings, but none of 'em work.

686
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:00,583
I wonder what's gonna
happen to their movie now.

687
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,041
[HOTARO] Well, they won't be
able to finish it, will they?

688
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,666
Kinda depressing, isn't it?

689
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,458
"Summer grass,
'tis all that remains

690
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:08,083
of ancient warriors' dreams."

691
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,041
[HOTARO]
Mm.

692
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,208
[SATOSHI]
Later.

693
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,416
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

694
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,125
Oh, my god!
I can't believe that!

695
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,208
[IRISU] No matter how much
passion goes into a film,

696
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,791
without real skill,
it feels amateur.

697
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,333
[GIRL 9A]
Totally.

698
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,708
[GIRL 9B]
