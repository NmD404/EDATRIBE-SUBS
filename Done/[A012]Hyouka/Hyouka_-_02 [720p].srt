[HOTARO groans]

00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,208
[TOMOE]
"Hey, Little Bro.

4
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,458
How are you?

5
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,583
I'm still in Varanasi.
Congrats on passing!

6
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,333
Sorry this is late.

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,875
I hear you ended up going
to Kami High, my alma mater!

8
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,708
Now that you're
officially in high school,

9
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,125
let me give you
some sisterly advice.

10
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,875
Join the Classic Lit Club.

11
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,958
It's one of the oldest
clubs the school has,

12
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,750
and I was in it
my whole time there.

13
00:00:58,833 --> 00:00:59,916
From what I've been told,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,625
it doesn't have a
single member right now!

15
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,208
If no one new joins this year,

16
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,083
the Executive Committee
will do away with it!

17
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,166
As one of the veterans,

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,250
I couldn't bear
to see that happen.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,750
Please, Hotaro.

20
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,333
Join the Classic Lit club,
and help keep the legacy alive.

21
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,958
My adolescent
memories are at stake!

22
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,041
It's not like you have
anything better to do, right?

23
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,875
Sincerely, your sister, Tomoe."

24
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,791
[BOY 2A]
1, 2, 3,4 !

25
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,875
[HOTARO] It's been a month since
we saved the Classic Lit Club.

26
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,875
I'm starting to feel at home in
the Earth Science prep room.

27
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,083
When I get bored after school,
it's the first place I go.

28
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,041
I never expected to
feel that way in there,

29
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,625
but I'm not complaining.

30
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,166
[ERU]
Want some?

31
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,583
I brought some snacks from home.

32
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,583
You're welcome to
whatever you want.

33
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,291
Thank you.

34
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,000
[HOTARO] It's not that I
ever disliked spending time

35
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,541
with other people.

36
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,916
As long as they weren't the kind
who wore me out or anything.

37
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,125
It's pointless.

38
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,208
Yeah, is life
like a dull pencil?

39
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,375
What? What are you
talking about?

40
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,291
Was that supposed to be a joke?

41
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,458
Yeah, sorry.

42
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,500
Look. I'm not in the
mood for jokes now!

43
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,500
'Kay, fine then.

44
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,708
I said it's pointless!

45
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,666
What?

46
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,250
[ERU] All the time we've
been wasting in here

47
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,291
after school every day,

48
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,583
doing absolutely
nothing productive!

49
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,333
[HOTARO] I don't have
a problem with that.

50
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,791
But is there something
specific you want to do

51
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,791
with your time in
the Classic Lit Club?

52
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:16,791
Yeah, there is.

53
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,958
Oh?

54
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,958
But... That's more
of a personal matter.

55
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,666
[HOTARO]
She's said that before.

56
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,375
Right now I'm talking
about something different.

57
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,916
If we're going
to be a legit club,

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,125
we need some good activities.

59
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,541
[HOTARO]
That's pointless.

60
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,500
Wait, hear me out.

61
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,791
Let's submit an anthology
to the cultural festival!

62
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,708
Seriously?

63
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,833
Yep.

64
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,125
Let's not.
Sounds like a ton of work.

65
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,541
No, we have to
have an anthology!

66
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,916
Look, if you really want to
participate in the festival,

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,791
there are much
easier ways to do it.

68
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,041
Like concessions.

69
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,625
Kami High's cultural festival

70
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,541
has never allowed students
to sell concessions.

71
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,916
Anyway, they'll give us
a budget for an anthology,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,958
and our advising teacher has
requested that we create one.

73
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,916
Also, it's been a
tradition for this club

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,458
to create one for the festival
for the past four decades.

75
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,791
They don't want to break that.

76
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,291
Well then, why didn't you
mention all that sooner?

77
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,500
That means we have to do it.

78
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,958
Great!

79
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,000
So what is this anthology
supposed to contain, anyway?

80
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,708
I have no idea!

81
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,166
Are you kidding me?

82
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,541
Yeah, sorry.

83
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,000
I thought that you and I
could look into it together.

84
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,625
I figured if there
were any anthologies

85
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,250
from previous years lying
around, we could start there.

86
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,041
Why don't we
search for them?

87
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,166
I give up.

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,875
[ERU]
Maybe they're in the library.

89
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,500
Let's check it out!

90
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,375
[ERU] Why are you
still sitting there?

91
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,750
You're coming with me.

92
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,458
Get up.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,750
[HOTARO]
I'm not in the mood for this.

94
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,458
It's Friday, which means that
it's her shift on library duty.

95
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,708
Well, well. It's Oreki.

96
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,375
Long time no see.
Can't say I've missed you.

97
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,666
Hey, Ibara.
Nice to see you, too.

98
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,958
This is the sacred
realm of knowledge.

99
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,958
Your presence here
defiles all that.

100
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,208
Oh, yeah?

101
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,708
I'm floored they'd leave
you in charge of books.

102
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,125
Do you even know how to read?

103
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,833
You haven't changed at all.

104
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,916
If you came to insult me,
then you should just leave.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,208
'Scuse me.

106
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,666
[SATOSHI]
Hey, Hotaro! How's it going?

107
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,166
Looks like you two
are as close as always.

108
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,833
Seems about right for the cutest
couple in middle school!

109
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:32,833
Ridiculous.

110
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't be disgusting.

111
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,208
I'd rather date a slug
than this lowlife.

112
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,333
Out of your league.

113
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,958
Over the line, Fukube!

114
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,750
And you've got a lot
of nerve making a joke

115
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,416
when you're well
aware how I feel.

116
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,333
Ah, I'm sorry, Mayaka.

117
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,791
Hurt your feelings?

118
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,458
Do you even care
that you're pouring salt

119
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,625
into my wounds? Not cool.

120
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,208
Seriously. Have a heart, okay?

121
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,791
I don't understand
what's going on here.

122
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,250
She's had an
enormous crush on him

123
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,000
ever since middle school.

124
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,625
Oh!

125
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,875
[SATOSHI]
Ahem.

126
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,666
Chitanda, I'd like you
to meet Mayaka Ibara.

127
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,083
We all went to Kaburaya
Middle School together.

128
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,875
Nice to meet you!

129
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,041
[SATOSHI]
Mayaka, this is Eru Chitanda.

130
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,916
She's president of
the Classic Lit club,

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,125
which I joined recently.

132
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,125
Yes, indeed.

133
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,375
It's a real pleasure
to meet you.

134
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,833
So anyway, what brings
you two to the library?

135
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,541
Oh, right, I almost forgot!

136
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,875
So, uh, Ibara...

137
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,791
I was wondering if you
might be able to help us.

138
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,291
[MAYAKA]
I'll try.

139
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,708
Does the library happen to
have any old club anthologies?

140
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,958
Like Classic Lit Club, maybe?

141
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,583
Let me see.

142
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,666
I don't think so, actually.

143
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,041
At least not out here,
but maybe in the back.

144
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,416
Oh, okay.

145
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,166
So why are you
looking for them?

146
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,791
We've decided our
club should make one

147
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,333
for the culture festival.

148
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,916
So we wanted to look at past
anthologies to get some ideas.

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,958
Oh, yeah?

150
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,458
Are we gonna
present it at Kanyasai?

151
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,500
I can't believe
Hotaro agreed to that.

152
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,916
I was pressured into it,
as a matter of fact.

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,041
"Kanyasai?"

154
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,166
Abbreviation.

155
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,625
Kamiyama High Cultural Festival.

156
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,958
Is this another one
of those terms

157
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,416
you make up and try to coin?

158
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,750
No, for real!

159
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,333
That's what everyone
here in the school calls it,

160
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,666
not just me! Right?

161
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,458
Yeah, "Kanyasai" is what
they call it in Manga Club.

162
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,166
"Kanya"?

163
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,083
Wait, how do they
spell that, anyway?

164
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,416
I have no idea.

165
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,000
I've asked around but I
haven't gotten an answer.

166
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,541
I bet it started as,
Kamiyama High Bunkasai,

167
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,375
then shortened to, Kamiyama-sai.

168
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,583
Kaynama-sai. Kanyasai.

169
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,250
That's my hypothesis,
but who knows?

170
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,791
[MAYAKA]
Anyway, Chitanda.

171
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,458
There might be some
old anthologies

172
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,958
back in the storage stacks.

173
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,916
But the librarian is
in a meeting right now,

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,625
and we can't get back
there unless she unlocks it.

175
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,166
I think her meeting will be
done in about 30 minutes or so.

176
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,250
Wanna wait?

177
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,625
What should we do?

178
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,916
We should wait.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,166
[MAYAKA] You could always
leave and come back.

180
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,583
[HOTARO]
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,333
Wait! Hotaro, hold up!

182
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,916
Hey, Mayaka.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,833
You should tell these guys the
story that you told me earlier.

184
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,208
[MAYAKA]
Huh?!

185
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,750
[groans]

186
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,833
Hmph. Okay, fine.

187
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,750
Oreki. Do you feel like
using your tiny brain

188
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,750
for once in your life?

189
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,750
[HOTARO]
Nope.

190
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,250
What story are
you going to tell?

191
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,166
[SATOSHI] It's called the "Most
Favored Book of Disfavor."

192
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,000
[ERU] "The Most Favored
Book of Disfavor"?

193
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,958
[SATOSHI]
It's quite a peculiar tale.

194
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,583
No matter how I slice it,
it doesn't seem to add up.

195
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,000
It's got Mayaka and me
pretty much stumped.

196
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,416
Please, tell us
all of the details!

197
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,333
[MAYAKA] I report here
for duty every Friday

198
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,750
after school, you know?

199
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,000
And every week,
the same book gets returned,

200
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,125
like clockwork.

201
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,958
Today makes five weeks in a row.

202
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,750
That, in and of itself,
is kinda weird, right?

203
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,500
This is the book.

204
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,916
[ERU]
Wow, what a gorgeous book!

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,208
[HOTARO]
It's huge.

206
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,375
[ERU]
Is it okay if I look inside?

207
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,625
[MAYAKA]
Go ahead.

208
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,458
Oreki, you should see this.

209
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,458
[ERU] It's about the
school's history, huh?

210
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't believe how dense it is.

211
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,875
This would be a
lot of work to read.

212
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,125
It's not weird for someone
to check this out every week.

213
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,625
They'd never finish.

214
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,416
You've obviously never borrowed
from the school's library.

215
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,625
The check-out period
here is a full two weeks,

216
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,125
instead of just one.

217
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,583
So why would someone need to
get it more often than that?

218
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,375
Nevertheless,
someone always does,

219
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,541
and turns it in every week, too.

220
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,458
[ERU] Do you have a
record of the borrowers?

221
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,625
Yeah, of course!

222
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,541
The checkout list
is in the front cover.

223
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,666
See?

224
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,958
[ERU]
Huh? Oreki, this is odd!

225
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,708
Each Friday, a different
person checks this book out,

226
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,166
but they always bring
it back that same day!

227
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,416
[MAYAKA]
Exactly.

228
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,291
This giant book has been
checked out and returned

229
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,875
every Friday, for
five weeks in a row now.

230
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,541
Even the times are consistent.

231
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,708
All five kids have come
to get it during lunch

232
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,708
and returned it after school.

233
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,875
[SATOSHI]
What do you think?

234
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,875
You're curious, right?

235
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,458
Yes.

236
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,833
I just... I have to know!

237
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,125
Let's try to figure
this out, Oreki.

238
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,583
You want to?

239
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,083
[HOTARO] Damn you, Satoshi.
You knew this would happen

240
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,958
when you stopped me
from leaving, didn't you?

241
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,375
I mean, you did such a great job

242
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,458
solving that
locked door mystery.

243
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,166
And then there was that strange
business with the secret club.

244
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,875
Wait, what are
you talking about?

245
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,000
She would be referring
to a rather provocative

246
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,291
facet of Hotaro, here.

247
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,333
Stop, you're making
it sound dirty!

248
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,500
In any case,
this is curious, right?

249
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,541
[HOTARO]
No, it's not.

250
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,041
Yes, it is!

251
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:18,750
Is not!

252
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,250
Enough!

253
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,958
Be quiet. Both of you.

254
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:24,833
[ERU]
Right.

255
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,000
[HOTARO]
Sorry.

256
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,416
[HOTARO]
I got reckless.

257
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,541
Any further refusal could
result in a careless waste

258
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,875
of precious energy.

259
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,416
That can't happen.

260
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,708
With that in mind...

261
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,541
Yeah, all right.

262
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,291
I guess I will
think about it, okay?

263
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,375
Great!

264
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,583
Fukube...

265
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,375
Has Oreki ever been
smart in his life?

266
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,875
No, not like us.

267
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,875
But he does have a knack
for solving problems,

268
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,916
which can come
in handy sometimes.

269
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,041
Hey, don't talk about
me like I'm not here.

270
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,125
[HOTARO]
For five weeks straight,

271
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,375
different people have
checked this book out,

272
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,208
and returned it
a few hours later.

273
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,458
Lesser minds might shrug
it off as a coincidence,

274
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,250
but Chitanda wouldn't be
content with that answer.

275
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,250
The truth isn't
what matters here.

276
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,708
What's important is satisfying
her burning curiosity.

277
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,125
Now, then...

278
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,500
Borrowing the book
at lunch hour,

279
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,458
then returning it after
school doesn't allow

280
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,250
sufficient time to read it.

281
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,250
If they didn't want
to lug around such a tome,

282
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,208
they could just read it in the
library without borrowing it.

283
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,625
Conclusion: this book
is not being utilized

284
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,416
for literary purposes at all.

285
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,125
They're not reading it.

286
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,958
What does that mean?

287
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,708
If a book's not
being used for reading,

288
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,708
what other purpose
could it serve?

289
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,625
If you stack them up,
they make decent pillows.

290
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,833
They make good
shields in combat, too.

291
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,750
Are you ever serious
about anything?

292
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,875
He's right; these people
can't be reading it,

293
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,791
so what could they
be doing with that book?

294
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,458
[SATOSHI] Well Chitanda,
what do you think?

295
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,541
Let me see.

296
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,041
Someone could use them
as weights in a workout.

297
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,708
[HOTARO]
You guys are no help at all.

298
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:02,416
[HOTARO] Is Chitanda really as
smart as everyone claims she is?

299
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,541
She seems like a
total doofus to me.

300
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,291
Let's try something else.

301
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,833
What does it mean
that a different person

302
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,541
borrows this book every week?

303
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,208
Well, from the names, we can
guess that they're all girls.

304
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,208
This brings up
two possibilities:

305
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,625
The girls have no connection.

306
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,083
It's en vogue to have this
book on Friday afternoons,

307
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,916
so they've all checked it
out on different occasions

308
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,125
by coincidence.

309
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,916
Or, the five of them
use the book together,

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,666
as a group, and
they each take turns

311
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,875
being the one to borrow
it every Friday.

312
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,750
"En vogue," huh?

313
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,250
For fortunetelling!

314
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,750
Right, like...

315
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,958
This book will be your
lucky charm on Friday,

316
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,250
so take it with you!

317
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,416
If you check it out
during your lunch period,

318
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,875
and return it after school,

319
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,083
your boyfriend will
plant a kiss on you!

320
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,000
Heck yeah!

321
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,166
Astounding.

322
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,166
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

323
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,166
I'm just brainstorming here.

324
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,125
[HOTARO] All they have in
common is that they're girls

325
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,916
and second years, though
all in different classes.

326
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,500
Why would the fact
that they're all girls

327
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,375
have anything to
do with this book?

328
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,791
Who knows, it might not.

329
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,291
Think about it:

330
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,875
If you randomly selected five
students from this school,

331
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,416
there's a pretty decent chance
they would all be female.

332
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,541
It's also pretty common
for members of the same sex

333
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,291
to stick together.

334
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,625
Well, what if they're using
it for some kind of code?

335
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,833
Like if they return it facing
up, it has a particular meaning.

336
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,125
Face down, then it
means something else?

337
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,833
[MAYAKA] I don't think that
would be a very effective

338
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,166
code at all.

339
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,333
[MAYAKA]
You see?

340
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,708
[SATOSHI]
She's right.

341
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,250
Any face-up, face-down code
would be lost in there.

342
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,416
Hmm...

343
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,083
Well, no matter
how hard he thinks,

344
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,958
Oreki's not gonna figure it out.

345
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,166
After all, Fukube and I racked
our brains and couldn't get it.

346
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,583
Hey, what's wrong?

347
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,208
It has a peculiar smell.

348
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,833
Wait, it does?

349
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,541
I don't smell anything.

350
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,708
[ERU]
I swear, it stinks.

351
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,416
There's some sort of acrid odor.

352
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,708
It's like paint thinner.

353
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,125
It's unmistakable.

354
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,583
[HOTARO]
Is she a dog?

355
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,958
Well, if Chitanda insists
she smells something strange

356
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,916
on that thing, then
it's worth looking into,

357
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,416
don't you think?

358
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,875
[HOTARO]
What could that mean?

359
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,666
Hotaro, if you've
cracked it open,

360
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,000
then you gotta say so.

361
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,291
Huh? Did you get it?

362
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,208
Calm down.

363
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,083
Maybe, but I'm not sure.

364
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,625
Hey, Chitanda, you
wanna get some exercise?

365
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,708
There's a lead I want
you to investigate.

366
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,041
Let's get right on it!

367
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,625
[HOTARO]
No, I'm not going this time.

368
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,000
It's just you.

369
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,250
Just me? Don't you need to go?

370
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,541
Well, I, uh...

371
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,458
Yeah, good job, Chitanda!

372
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,583
Hotaro has got no right
to use you like that!

373
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,125
He's at his best
when you're the one

374
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,791
taking advantage of him!

375
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,250
I'm not using anyone!

376
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,166
[ERU]
Oh, no, it's not like that.

377
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,416
I just figured we'd
investigate together.

378
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,958
Right. That makes sense.

379
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,583
What are you waiting
for then, huh?

380
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's get going!

381
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,916
Thank you so much for coming.

382
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,750
We're honored to serve you.

383
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,833
We have prepared two
fine menus for you tonight.

384
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,708
Which one would you prefer?

385
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,000
[FEMALE GIGGLING VOICE]

386
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,541
[MALE GIGGLING VOICE]

387
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,583
[GIGGLING VOICES]

388
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,666
I recommend...
this dish for you.

389
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,250
[SATOSHI] This might end up
costing you more than you think.

390
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,000
Are you okay?

391
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,416
Let's go.

392
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,458
After all, gym class
got rained out today.

393
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,041
So I think I have exactly
enough energy to spare.

394
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,541
Great!

395
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,708
What kind of guy your age
has such a deficit of energy?

396
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,000
Shut up.

397
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,125
All right, come on, then.

398
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,166
[ERU]
Right.

399
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,333
[MAYAKA]
Hold on.

400
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,250
I'm going with you.

401
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,666
I'm kinda curious.

402
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,458
Fukube, would you watch
the desk till I get back?

403
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,541
[SATOSHI]
Huh?

404
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,583
[MAYAKA]
I mean, I can't just walk away

405
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,291
from my library duty, right?

406
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,625
[HOTARO]
You hold down the fort. Later.

407
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,375
Don't have too much fun.

408
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,541
So where are you taking us
to investigate now, Oreki?

409
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,958
[HOTARO]
To check out the art room.

410
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,541
Whoa, all the way over there?

411
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,000
Yep, it's far,

412
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,833
which is why I didn't want
to go in the first place.

413
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,750
You have to be the laziest
person I have ever met.

414
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,291
[ERU]
What's in the art room?

415
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,083
[HOTARO] First let's set
a few things straight.

416
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,750
I'm willing to bet
none of those girls

417
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,375
would have time to get any use
out of that book on a break.

418
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,083
It's too enormous for that.

419
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,125
Which means that they could
only really do anything

420
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,916
with it during class time.

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,375
What are the only
classes made up

422
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,041
of students who are
in the same year,

423
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,750
but in different homerooms?

424
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,541
Gym and all of the fine
arts subjects, right?

425
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,708
[HOTARO]
Yep.

426
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,000
So every week before class,

427
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,791
those five girls
have each taken turns

428
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,041
to come borrow the book.

429
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,541
I still don't understand
the timing, though.

430
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,250
I mean, they could check it out
for two weeks if they wanted.

431
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,416
[HOTARO]
The book is huge,

432
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,208
so they probably
just want it for class

433
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,625
rather than lug it around.

434
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,375
[MAYAKA]
Oh, that makes sense.

435
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,000
[ERU gasps]

436
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,041
[MAYAKA]
What is it?

437
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,083
It's the same smell
as the book!

438
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,208
Seriously?

439
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,458
Look in the room
and you'll see why.

440
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,791
[HOTARO] There's the answer
to your little mystery.

441
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,291
The second-year combined
D, E, and F classes

442
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,041
are just using it
in art as a prop

443
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,458
when they model for
portrait painting.

444
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:14,291
The book's binding makes it
an ideal, picturesque motif.

445
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:18,250
It was the smell
of paint. Not thinner.

446
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,125
How did you figure it out?

447
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,541
Huh? What do you mean?

448
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,250
It came to me, I guess.

449
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,083
I just got lucky.

450
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,208
[SATOSHI]
Wow, nicely done, my friend!

451
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,250
Students using it
as a prop for art class

452
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,583
is the last thing I ever
would have imagined.

453
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,625
I still don't
know how you did it.

454
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,625
You're just... weird.

455
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,000
No, I'm not.

456
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,166
I'm probably the most normal
person at this school.

457
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,416
Well... That's a bit strong.

458
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,083
Still, that's some
really impressive

459
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,666
detective work, Oreki.

460
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,583
I'm completely
fascinated by what goes on

461
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,958
inside that head of yours.

462
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:53,833
"Fascinated"?

463
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,916
Yes!

464
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,416
I'd just love to
crack open your skull

465
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,416
and pick your brain
sometime, you know?

466
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,583
That sounds like
a horror movie to me.

467
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,125
Plus, to an honor
student like you,

468
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,958
it's not that
remarkable of a brain.

469
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,666
[MAYAKA] Oh, yeah?
You're an honor student?

470
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,041
Let me put it this way:

471
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,291
We haven't had midterms yet,
but I'm sure when we do,

472
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,625
Chitanda's gonna be
at the top of our class!

473
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,458
No way.

474
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,333
It doesn't matter
how good my grades are.

475
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,458
That can't compare
at all to his raw ability.

476
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,333
Taking little clues and
piecing them together

477
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,166
into a lead that actually
pans out is just incredible.

478
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,333
[SATOSHI]
Huh...

479
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,625
[HOTARO]
Well, on that note...

480
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,000
Her senses of smell
and hearing fascinate me.

481
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,166
They're what solved
this mystery and the last.

482
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,416
Oreki might even... 
be able to...

483
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,166
Hmm?

484
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,166
Uh... Oh! Uh... Nothing.

485
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,666
Anyway...

486
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,250
I had fun with this, even
though I missed the best part.

487
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,291
What about you?

488
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,958
[ERU]
Yeah, I had a blast!

489
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,500
The afternoon flew by
before I knew it!

490
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,000
I spent hours gripping over it

491
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,208
and I still couldn't
even get close!

492
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,000
It's so frustrating!

493
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,583
[SATOSHI] Didn't I tell you
he could come in handy

494
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,000
once in a while?

495
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,416
I can't stand the thought
of being outdone by Oreki!

496
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,333
My stupid life is
over now. Finished!

497
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,708
[SATOSHI] Come on,
it's not that bad!

498
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,166
[HOTARO]
It's odd.

499
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,833
Something just
doesn't feel right.

500
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,166
I can't ever see myself acting
like they are right now.

501
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,000
Why is that?

502
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,166
Is there something
wrong with me?

503
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,583
[SATOSHI]
Yeah, I know what you mean.

504
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,625
Once he's got the scent,
there's a brilliant flash,

505
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,083
and in an instant
he knows everything!

506
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,958
[ERU]
Oreki, you can't leave yet!

507
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,250
[HOTARO]
Why not?

508
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,833
Oh, right. The anthologies.

509
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,208
Yeah, we have to wait
till the librarian gets back.

510
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,791
Hotaro does kind of
zone out sometimes, huh?

511
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,666
Not just sometimes.

512
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,791
He's always out to lunch.

513
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,500
[ITOIGAWA] Ibara, thank you
for watching the desk for me.

514
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,750
You're free to go now.

515
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,791
[MAYAKA]
Oh, good.

516
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,208
It was my pleasure,
Miss Itoigawa.

517
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,583
Ma'am. My name is
Satoshi Fukube.

00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,958
We're from the Classic Lit Club,

519
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,958
and we hoped you
might be able to help us.

520
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,291
Where could we find
the old anthologies?

521
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,500
Classic Lit? Anthologies?

522
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,416
You're in the
Classic Literature Club?

523
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,083
Well, unfortunately,
we don't currently have

524
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,125
any of the back-numbered
issues anywhere in the stacks.

525
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,541
[SATOSHI]
Are you sure about that?

526
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,625
If they were here, son,
trust me, I would know.

527
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,958
Now, if you'll
excuse me, I'm busy.

528
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,583
Huh. Well, thank you anyway.

529
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,041
I guess we're out
of luck, Chitanda.

530
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,125
This is a big problem.

531
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,416
We'll find them soon enough.

532
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,791
[MAYAKA]
So, Oreki.

533
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,583
Was it frustrating
not being able

534
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,291
to solve a problem for once?

535
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,250
Not really.

536
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,416
[MAYAKA]
Whatever.

537
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,916
[ERU] That's that, then.
We should go home.

538
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,541
I did learn something
helpful today, though.

539
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,833
Yeah, what's that?

540
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,041
Nothing.
It's a personal matter.

541
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,375
Oh, that again, huh?

542
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,166
Yeah.

543
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,291
Knowing Oreki, it might
be possible after all.

544
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,750
[phone ringing]

545
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,375
Hello? This is Oreki.

546
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,166
[ERU]
Good morning. Um, it's Chitanda.

547
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,583
Chitanda?

548
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,375
[ERU] Yeah, um, I'm
sorry if I woke you up.

549
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,333
Did I?

550
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,583
[HOTARO]
Oh, no.

551
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,125
I thought it might be
my sister or something.

552
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,250
[yawns]

553
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,000
So why are you
calling on a Sunday?

554
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,333
[ERU]
I'm sorry.

555
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:21,416
But I'd like to see you
today, if that's possible.

556
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,000
There's something I really
want to talk to you about.

557
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,458
[HOTARO]
She's late.

558
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,000
Hi. Thank you for waiting.

559
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,541
I rushed right over.

560
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,041
[HOTARO]
Uh-huh.

561
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,666
So, was there something
you wanted to talk about?

562
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,791
[ERU]
Huh?

563
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:18,958
I'm just curious as
to why you wanted

564
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,458
to meet me here at
this weird coffee shop.

565
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,291
You're the one who
recommended this place,

566
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,291
not me, Oreki.

567
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,291
[HOTARO]
Later.

568
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,166
[ERU]
Huh? No, please don't go.

569
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,916
[HOTARO] It's my precious
Sunday to do nothing.

570
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,583
I won't waste it sitting
in this place with you,

571
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,541
playing these games.

572
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,708
Look, I'm sorry!

573
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:39,791
It's just that...

574
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,625
I'm really nervous, okay?

575
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,416
What is there to be
so nervous about?

576
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,708
Are you about to
make a confession?

577
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,333
Tell me that you love me?

578
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,208
There may be something I'd
like to confess to you, yes.

579
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,291
[HOTARO]
Huh?

580
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,458
[ERU]
Next time:

581
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,041
"The Circumstances of the
Classic Lit Club's Scion."
