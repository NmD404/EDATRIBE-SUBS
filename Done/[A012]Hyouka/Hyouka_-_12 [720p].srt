1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:14,583
[ERU]
I wonder...

2
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,333
Are the others getting
a good night's sleep?

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,375
[MAYAKA groans]

4
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,625
Tomorrow's the day.

5
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,041
[chuckles]

6
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,208
[SATOSHI] The whole school is
really going full out for this,

7
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,750
aren't they?

8
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,583
I've gotta see all of it.

9
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,041
Hmm... now, then...

10
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,333
The Quiz Club
starts at one o'clock.

11
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:22,416
A Shogi tournament?
Not sure I'm up for that one.

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,250
Ooh! The cooking contest is
definitely worth checking out!

13
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,833
Tomorrow's finally the day!

14
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,416
[HOTARO yawning]

15
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,875
Starts tomorrow, I guess.

16
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,125
All right.

17
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,666
Please let us have
nothing but good fortune

18
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,125
at the cultural festival
the next three days.

19
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,833
May we have the perseverance
to climb the mountain before us.

20
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,625
[ERU]
It's cultural festival time!

21
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,291
[TOMOE]
Good morning!

22
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,708
Hey.

23
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,208
You're up kinda early, huh?

24
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,958
[TOMOE]
Is today the cultural festival?

25
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,125
[HOTARO]
That's right.

26
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,541
[TOMOE] I heard you guys
had some trouble.

27
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,208
[HOTARO]
How did you find out?

28
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,000
[TOMOE]
I have my methods.

29
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,250
Besides, it's tradition
that the Classic Lit Club

30
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,958
can't get through
a cultural festival

31
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,875
without some kind of problem.

32
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,333
Nobody wants your
crappy traditions.

33
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,875
If that's the case, you
had better throw me

34
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,458
a good luck charm
to ward that off.

35
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,250
[TOMOE]
Catch!

36
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,375
[HOTARO gasps]

37
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,083
[TOMOE]
Ward it off with that.

38
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,958
Do you expect me to say
"thank you" for this?

39
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,000
[TOMOE] Oh, I guess I should
mention it's out of ink,

40
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,625
and the nib is split.

41
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,208
What am I, a trash can?

42
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,000
[TOMOE]
Better go or you'll be late.

43
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,708
Fine, whatever.

44
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,916
[TOMOE] If I have time,
I'll stop by and say hi to you!

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
[HOTARO]
No, stay away!

46
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,583
[SATOSHI] It's the day of
the festival, Hotaro!

47
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,708
Apparently so.

48
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,958
[SATOSHI] Ah, the Hotaro
we all know and love.

49
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,708
[HOTARO]
You sure are enjoying yourself.

50
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,541
[SATOSHI] Of course I am! Why
not? It's the cultural festival!

51
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,666
The hall of fame
for all the school clubs!

52
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,375
Hey! Isn't that
Mayaka up ahead?

53
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,291
[SATOSHI] That must be
a Manga Club costume.

54
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:16,208
Judging by her outfit,
I'd say she's on festival time.

55
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,541
[HOTARO] Did you come up
with a costume, too?

56
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,750
[SATOSHI] Well, I am a member of
the handicrafts club, after all.

57
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,375
I'm gonna go bother her.

58
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,791
Hey, happy festival
week, Mayaka.

59
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,625
Same to you.

60
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,166
I like your outfit. Looks great.

61
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,000
Cut it out.

62
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,916
So what character
are you cosplay--

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,833
Do not use that awful
word in the presence

64
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,916
of such respectable people.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,583
[SATOSHI]
Roger that.

66
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,416
Then what character
are you dressed as?

67
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,541
I'm Frol.

68
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,125
Frol who?
Oh, Frolbericheri Frol?

69
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,208
I've got some gloves
that I'll put on later.

70
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,833
Oh, yeah?

71
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,375
[MAYAKA] What have you got in
your bag? It's stuffed.

72
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,583
[SATOSHI]
You'll find out.

73
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,375
[MAYAKA]
Sounds kind of shady.

74
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,708
Are you on Manga Club
duty all day?

75
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,750
I got stuck with the
salesgirl position.

76
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,500
it's terrible luck, considering.

77
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,500
Well, don't waste any
of that precious energy

78
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,666
beating yourself up.

79
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,916
You can't change
the past, you know?

80
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,625
Whoa!

81
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,666
[SATOSHI chuckles]

82
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,333
[SATOSHI] Now this is
what I call a festival!

83
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,333
[MAYAKA]
No kidding!

84
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,375
[SATOSHI]
I knew they went all out,

85
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,875
but this is better
than I ever imagined!

86
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,583
Wow, check out this mural!

87
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,541
Whoever made this
did a fantastic job.

88
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,958
[MAYAKA]
Yeah, you're right.

89
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,500
[HOTARO]
I think it's too busy.

90
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,041
Way too busy for my taste.

91
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,666
--Hey, are you done?
--Yeah, I'm all finished.

92
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,250
[MAYAKA]
Amazing!

93
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,375
[SATOSHI] All right, people!
It's time to party!

94
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,791
[laughs]

95
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,166
Well, I gotta leave
you guys for a bit.

96
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,416
[HOTARO]
Handicrafts Club?

97
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,458
Just for a few.

98
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,541
I'll be back in a jiffy, though.

99
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,833
[HOTARO]
It's quiet up here.

100
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,666
[MAYAKA]
It sure is...

101
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,166
Try not to dwell on it.

102
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,791
If you keep fretting
about what happened,

103
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,833
Satoshi won't be the
only one badgering you.

104
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,583
Chitanda will start
worrying about you, too.

105
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,750
[MAYAKA]
Yeah, I'm well aware of that.

106
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,750
[ERU]
Oh, good morning!

107
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,083
I'm so glad you guys
are finally here!

108
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,166
[MAYAKA]
Good morning to you, Chi.

109
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,833
It's almost time, right?

110
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:49,875
[HOTARO]
It sure is.

111
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,041
[ERU]
Let's give it our best shot!

112
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,125
Sure.

113
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,541
Is our best shot really going
to have much impact, though?

114
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,416
That's a good point!

115
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,333
There's no guarantee that
our best shot will help.

116
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,375
On the other hand,

117
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,375
if we don't give it
our best shot,

118
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,500
then it certainly won't help,

119
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,041
so we might as well
try our best!

120
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,541
Indubitably.

121
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,416
You know, why don't I just
go ahead and buy them all?

122
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,333
No! I wasn't trying to
make you feel guilty,

123
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,666
I promise!

124
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,833
Well, I am responsible
for messing up the order.

125
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,666
How many were we
originally trying to get?

126
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,750
[MAYAKA]
Thirty copies.

127
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,333
[HOTARO] And how many
did we end up with?

128
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,833
There's 200.

129
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,750
[SATOSHI]
Galaxy!

130
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh, no! I broke my Saturn!

131
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,333
Nice of you to show up.

132
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,083
Good morning, Fukube.
Nice to see you.

133
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,000
[SATOSHI]
You guys been waiting long?

134
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,041
No, not at all.

135
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,083
We haven't even
gotten started yet.

136
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,250
[ERU gasps]

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,708
[MAYAKA]
Listen. I'm sorry. Really!

138
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,958
It's all my fault.

139
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,375
I should have read the
email from the printers

140
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,333
more carefully.

141
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,458
Everybody makes mistakes
once in a while.

142
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,166
[HOTARO] Did he forget
what he looks like?

143
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,416
There's no need
for self-flagellation.

144
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,750
We're all friends here, right?

145
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,375
[HOTARO]
He forgot what he looks like!

146
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,833
[ERU]
That's right!

147
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,458
I'm the club president, so I
should have looked it over

148
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,208
before we confirmed.

149
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,583
You know...

150
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,083
After I turned in my draft, I
washed my hands of it for sure.

151
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,125
We're all responsible
for what happened.

152
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,500
Right! I totally agree.

153
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,625
Thanks, guys.

154
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,625
Good. I'm glad you finally
got your head on straight.

155
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,500
[HOTARO] He had to have
forgotten what he looks like!

156
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,500
There's not much time to
discuss business before

157
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,625
the opening ceremony.

158
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,416
We've got our work
cut out for us,

159
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,166
so do any of you have
ideas about how we can

160
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,375
sell as many copies as possible?

161
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,125
How much are
we asking per copy?

162
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,500
[ERU]
Two hundred yen.

163
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,333
That's pretty cheap,
if you ask me.

164
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,000
[SATOSHI]
The problem is two-fold:

165
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,875
Our club's lack
of name recognition

166
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,125
and the fact that we're
stuck so out of the way.

167
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,708
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

168
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,416
So it'd help us to generate some
buzz about the Classic Lit Club

169
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,291
and to create a more
eyecatching storefront

170
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,541
in a busier place.

171
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,625
[ERU] Creating another
storefront altogether?

172
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,125
I hadn't thought about that!

173
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,541
I was just trying to
come up with something

174
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,625
to lure customers
all the way up here!

175
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,166
You have managed to blow
my mind yet again, Oreki!

176
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,416
[HOTARO]
That's great.

177
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,916
But isn't that a little
bit dramatic, though?

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,666
You don't think it'll
be hard to get permission

179
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,791
to move on the first day
of the festival?

180
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,291
[HOTARO]
Yeah, good point.

181
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,166
Satoshi, care to weigh in?

182
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,000
Hmm... That's a special
request, so it depends on

183
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,666
what the committee
chairman thinks.

184
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,041
But it can't hurt to ask him.

185
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,916
Worst case, he tells us no.

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,666
We could ask the
student council president.

187
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,166
Who's the executive
committee chairman?

188
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,666
[SATOSHI] You could at least
consult the guide, Hotaro.

189
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,583
Look. Right there.

190
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,375
I didn't see that.

191
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,958
[SATOSHI groans]

192
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,375
[SATOSHI]
Man...

193
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,875
I wish you would have noticed
the fruits of my labor!

194
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,666
And that refers to...?

195
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,000
To this! Let me show you.

196
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,000
Look, the Classic Lit
Club is listed

197
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,000
at the end of all
the club profiles.

198
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,666
I called in a favor,
and they came through for us.

199
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,375
The executive committee
puts the guide together.

200
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,875
That's amazing!

201
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,416
You abused your power?

202
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,791
[SATOSHI] Yeah, what of it?
If you want to ask the chairman,

203
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,083
you should try the
council room first.

204
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,208
[HOTARO] Wait, shouldn't
you be the one to ask?

205
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,708
[SATOSHI] Well, I guess
I could do that if I must,

206
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,708
but I don't have much
luck with negotiating.

207
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,583
[ERU]
It sure seems like you do.

208
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,291
Chitanda, I think you
should do the talking here.

209
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,708
I'll jump in to back
you up if you need me.

210
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,291
[ERU]
Please help us out, sir!

211
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,541
Okay. I guess I might
as well give it a shot.

212
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,041
[HOTARO] She doesn't
seem too eager to do this.

213
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,375
[SATOSHI]
Oh! Also...

214
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,500
I want to take charge
of publicity!

215
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,416
Is that why you're
wearing that getup?

216
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,333
[SATOSHI]
This is just one part of it all.

217
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,958
I have something
else up my sleeve.

218
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,541
Do you have a crazy
brilliant plan in mind?

219
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,416
I'm going to drop the
Classic Lit Club name.

220
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,958
I'll make the festival rounds,

221
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,500
participating in the
events and contests.

222
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,875
The plan is to perform
really well and to beef up

223
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,166
the Classic Lit Club's
reputation that way.

224
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,750
[HOTARO] He just wants
an excuse to play around.

225
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,541
Yeah, that's an awesome idea!

226
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,291
[SATOSHI]
You think?

227
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,500
Yes!

228
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,958
You're full of it today!

229
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,541
[HOTARO]
Wait... That's perfect!

230
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,291
You know,
that's a fantastic plan.

231
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,416
I think we should
proceed with it.

232
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,791
Chitanda will try to
negotiate a better storefront.

233
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,958
And Satoshi will publicize.

234
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,958
All right, it's official.
Let's get to it.

235
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,916
But what's your role, Oreki?

236
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,666
[HOTARO]
My role?

237
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,541
Yes.

238
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm gonna hold down the fort.

239
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,000
[SATOSHI]
Oh, right.

240
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,750
I guess someone
has to stay here.

241
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,000
[ERU]
Yeah, that's true.

242
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,458
[SATOSHI]
Well, we'd better go.

243
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,791
Roll call for the opening
ceremony is about to start.

244

Right!

00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay!

246
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,333
We will all proceed with the
plan that we have just outlined.

247
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,583
Let's try to sell as
many copies as we can!

do that on principle.
