00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,041
[TEACHER 6A] So that's when
it all changed for Rome.

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,833
When the Romans
overthrew the Etruscans

3
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:15,250
in 509 B.C.,
Rome established a republic.

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,541
The people were divided
into two classes:

5
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,666
The patricians,
made up of aristocrats,

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,000
and the plebeians,
made up of common folk...

7
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,375
[HOTARO]
I'm so bored.

8
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,791
[TEACHER 6A] The classes
were strictly forbidden

9
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:25,916
from intermixing.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,083
Now, the aristocrats
held all important

11
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,916
governmental offices,
such as the two consuls,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
and the 300 senators.

13
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,416
Furthermore, the senate
was considered to be

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,875
the highest legislative
and advisory body,

15
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:40,041
meeting in the curia
to convene and pass laws.

16
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:40,958
[MITSUISHI]
Did you hear that?

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:41,875
[GIRL 6A]
Yeah, what was it?

18
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,250
Is that Class A?
With Mr. Omichi?

19
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,083
Yeah, I think so.

20
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,375
[OMICHI] It's as if you have no
desire to learn anything,

21
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,291
so why are you even here?!

22
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,916
It is Class A.
What the heck's going on?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,333
Sounds like Omichi snapped

24
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,541
and is on one of
his tirades again.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,541
[OMICHI] Hurry up,
we don't have all day!

26
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,041
--What's your answer?!
--[ERU] Mr. Omichi...

27
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,833
Maybe you should look
at the lesson plan again.

28
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,625
I think you've got it wrong.

29
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,000
[OMICHI]
Excuse me?!

30
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,833
[ERU] Before you scream at us,
you ought to be sure

31
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,666
you're not the one
making a mistake.

32
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,541
[HOTARO]
Is that Chitanda?

33
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,041
[STUDENTS chattering]

34
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:18,083
[OMICHI] Ah, sorry.
I see where we are.

35
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,875
Tamura, you may sit down.

36
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:22,958
[TEACHER 6A]
Okay!

37
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,291
Let's get back to
the Roman Republic.

38
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,916
Let's see, where were we?

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,416
Oh, yes, the senate
and the curia.

40
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,375
So the curia was a huge
building on the grounds

41
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,916
of the Roman forum.

42
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,083
[MAYAKA] It was your idea
for us to get together

43
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,958
in the first place, Fukube!


44
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,083
Hey, Mayaka.

45
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,416
Why don't you just
try to calm down?

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,125
You should just
stay out of this, Chi.

47
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,666
Look, maybe you
did have a reason,

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,458
but it's common
courtesy to call!

49
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,083
Or you could have
even sent me a text

50
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,291
at the very least!

51
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,708
I wouldn't have cared
if you'd cancelled,

52
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,458
but to stand me up
without a word?

53
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,125
I know you've
got a cell phone,

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,375
so why didn't you use it?

55
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,958
It never occurs to you
to do the right thing!

56
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,750
You don't care about
anyone but yourself,

57
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,791
and that's the truth!

58
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,500
[HOTARO] That's a bold move
on your part, Chitanda.

59
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,333
[MAYAKA] Apologizing won't let
you off the hook this time!

60
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,625
You're full of
useless information...

61
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,041
[HOTARO]
Your efforts are futile, though.

62
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,833
You had to know
how mad I would be,

63
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,166
but you didn't care!

64
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,416
Then it started
storming like crazy!

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,625
Rain, thunder, lighting,
hail! Hail, Fukube!

66
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,333
You're the most inconsiderate
person I've ever met!

67
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,375
I even got all dressed up,
like an idiot,

68
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,625
and by the time I got home,
my favorite outfit was ruined!

69
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,750
--Ruined, Fukube!
--[HOTARO] Aren't you tired yet?

70
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,875
Yes, I am.

71
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,125
Why don't you
take a breather?

72
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,833
[MAYAKA]
Fine, good idea.

73
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,250
[HOTARO] I didn't intervene
for your sake, dummy.

74
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,416
Wow.

75
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,250
I've gotta say,
you get mad really often.

76
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,875
Does yelling make
you feel any better?

77
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,666
You know, I only seem
to get ticked enough

78
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,583
to yell when you are involved,
which I think is pretty telling.

79
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,791
Yeah, makes sense.

80
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,458
You know, maybe you
should take a few pages

81
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,666
from Chitanda's book.

82
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,708
She never gets riled up
about anything.

83
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,041
Huh?

84
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,041
I've never seen you
like that, either, Satoshi.

85
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,000
And come to think of it,

86
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,166
though I've seen
him get annoyed,

87
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,250
Oreki doesn't often
get downright angry.

88
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,875
Not as far as I have
noticed, anyway.

89
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,583
Fuku totally gets angry.

90
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,166
Yeah, I've seen him livid.

91
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,500
[ERU]
Do you really?

92
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,875
Of course.

93
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,500
I may not flip out and start
screaming like Mayaka.

94
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,166
But yeah, I get mad.

95
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,625
I couldn't even
imagine you having

96
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,875
that kind of reaction
about anything.

97
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,708
[SATOSHI]
Well, I am human, after all.

98
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,250
I get angry sometimes.

99
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,000
[HOTARO] True, but you
don't make a big production

100
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,958
about venting your feelings
in front of everyone.

101
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,458
He's not very scary when
he gets angry, though.

102
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,458
Are you serious?

103
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,583
Well, it's sure news to me.

104
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,708
That piques my curiosity.
I want to see it.

105
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,250
[SATOSHI]
What?

106
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,666
[HOTARO] I predict that Chitanda
will hatch some grand scheme

107
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,708
to trick Satoshi into
getting ticked off.

108
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,750
Just to see if it's possible.
I can't wait for that.

109
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,833
Oreki, do you have
a secret temper?

110
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,416
There's no hot
blood in that one at all.

111
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,000
Because he's
so level headed?

112
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,708
It's more that he
is way too selfish

113
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,291
and shallow to get upset
about anything in life.

114
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,750
[HOTARO]
Hey, we may be frenemies,

115
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,041
but that's over the line.

116
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,375
Whoa, I got mad!

117
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,916
Don't get me
started on Hotaro;

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,333
we'll be here all night.

119
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,875
But Chitanda's lack of
irascibility is almost heroic.

120
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,208
She's like a Zen master.

121
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,666
Her patience is incredible.

122
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,000
No matter what, she
always rolls with the punches.

123
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,916
You might be happier if you
tried to be more like her.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,208
That's easy for you to say,

125
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,750
but you don't understand
what it's like to be me.

126
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,083
I don't think I could
ever be a calm as Chi.

127
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,875
Hold on. I'm confused.

128
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,166
Is all this a compliment?

129
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,250
For sure.
It's totally a good thing.

130
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,208
It's just an observation.
There's no judgement either way.

131
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,375
Definitely.

132
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,083
Not being able to
get angry is not good,

133
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,583
but the ability to rise
above it is another story.

134
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,333
After all, wrath is
a pretty serious sin.

135
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,875
You should cut me
some slack, Mayaka.

136
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,583
The way you
lash out isn't right.

137
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,541
A sin?

138
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,208
You mean the
seven deadly sins?

139
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,708
Yeah! I'm impressed, Chitanda.

140
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,500
They're pretty well known
throughout the world.

141
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,250
Hey, Mayaka, have you
ever heard of them?

142
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,041
Yeah. Everybody knows
about those, right?

143
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,583
Wait a sec, I thought
there were 108 sins.

144
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,416
No, those are
Earthly Desires.

145
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,375
Excuse me.

146
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,666
Let me see...

147
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,000
There's wrath, pride,
gluttony, greed.

148
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,875
Envy, lust, and sloth
are the three others.

149
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,041
Yeah, that's right!

150
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,958
Sloth, you say?

151
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,416
[HOTARO]
What's she looking at me for?

152
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,166
Wow! That means Chi is perfect!

153
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,666
You're honest, kind,
and you don't eat too much.

154
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,208
I wouldn't go that far.

155
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,833
I doubt that you've
ever been greedy,

156
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,958
and you're really diligent.

157
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:57,625
I am?

158
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,708
And another thing...

159
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,500
As for lust, you're not slutty.

160
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,666
Awkward...

161
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,791
There's no way to
know if she's envious,

162
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,458
but I would bet she isn't.

163
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,458
[HOTARO] This has turned from
giving her simple compliments

164
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,250
into full-out teasing.

165
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,833
[ERU]
Let's stop talking about it!

166
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,250
Anyway, when I am hungry,

167
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,500
I can eat more food than
you would ever imagine!

168
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,708
[HOTARO]
No surprise there.

169
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,958
I think her new nickname
should be Saint Chi!

170
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,250
Eru Chitanda kind of sounds like
an angel's name, doesn't it?

171
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,416
The Archangels Michael,
Gabriel, Uriel, and Eru!

172
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,041
[laughing]

173
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,666
I don't think this is funny!

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,125
She got mad.

175
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,875
You're right. She yelled at us.

176
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,833
Sorry, we didn't mean it, Chi.

177
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,750
[ERU]
I'm done talking.

178
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,083
Good job!

179
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,416
You know exactly what to
say to make a girl angry!

180
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,291
Hold on just a minute!
I think she's mad at you, too!

181
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,083
[ERU] Just 'cause wrath
is a sin doesn't mean

182
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,166
it's good to never get angry.

183
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,500
The same goes for the other
deadly sins, too, doesn't it?

184
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,000
Pride and greed can be useful

185
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,208
as long as they're
kept in balance.

186
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,583
What do you mean?

187
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,333
Well, imagine a person who
has no pride whatsoever.

188
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,208
Doesn't that mean they
also have zero confidence?

189
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,916
And if a person doesn't have
an ounce of greed at all,

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,625
wouldn't it be difficult
for them to take care

191
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,166
of themselves or a family?

192
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,541
And think about envy.

193
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,333
If people didn't ever feel it,

194
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,083
there wouldn't be
as many innovations,

195
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,250
new technologies or ideas.

196
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,041
Oh! Um...

197
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,166
I didn't mean to go into lecture
mode or anything, sorry.

198
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,000
Hmm... That's okay.
Interesting take.

199
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,458
[HOTARO]
So they're fine in moderation?

200
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,208
I just don't think it's wise
to take the term "deadly sins"

201
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,291
so literally, and then
live our lives as if

202
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,000
those seven
normal human emotions

203
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,666
are gonna kill us or something.

204
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,000
So then what you're saying is

205
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,375
that it's not necessarily
a bad thing to get mad?

206
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,666
Yeah, pretty much.

207
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,458
I mean, if you always
stifle your anger,

208
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,291
it might start to get
in the way of your ability

209
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,958
to enjoy your life, too.

210
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,958
[HOTARO]
I definitely get mad.

211
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,541
But, like, if that's
your philosophy,

212
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,458
then why don't you ever get mad?

213
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,083
Because it's draining.

214
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,458
And I avoid doing
things that wear me out.

215
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,791
No!

216
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,541
Our Chitanda has been
corrupted by Hotaro!

217
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,958
How could we have
let this happen?

218
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,250
There are evil spirits
roaming the halls of Kami high!

219
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,458
Ghosts hell-bent
on conserving energy!

220
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,458
Please, Chi, snap out of it!

221
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,875
[HOTARO] That's right,
laugh it up, you jerks.

222
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,166
[ERU]
I'm kidding.

223
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,833
--[SATOSHI] Huh?
--[MAYAKA] Huh?

224
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,333
I was just playing!

225
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,250
[HOTARO]
It was a joke?

226
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,166
And here I thought
I'd found my twin flame.

227
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,291
Sorry to scare you.

228
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,833
I just thought it'd be funny.

229
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,208
But it isn't like
I don't get angry.

230
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,875
Everyone does, even me!

231
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,083
Yeah, for example,
I get mad when...

232
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,916
I get really angry when I
see people wasting food.

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,166
In my house, a grain of rice
equals a drop of sweat.

234
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,166
[HOTARO] She's totally a
true farmer's daughter.

235
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,583
Hey, I almost forgot.

236
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,333
Speaking of flying
off the handle,

237
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,291
wasn't that you I heard
yelling at Mr. Omichi

238
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,583
during fifth period today?

239
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,625
[ERU gasps]

240
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,791
Yeah, you're right.

241
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,666
I can't believe
I forgot about that!

242
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,166
I want to hear your thoughts!

243
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,833
Tell me what you make of my
angry outburst today, Oreki!

244
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,958
[HOTARO]
Aw, crap.

245
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,000
[ERU ANGELS chattering]

246
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,208
Well... I gotta get going.

247
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,375
[ERU]
Wait!

248
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,416
Before you go, I just want
to hear what you think

249
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,875
about what happened!

250
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,250
Did something crazy go down?

251
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,125
[ERU] Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it was crazy!

252
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,625
I still can't believe it.

253
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,250
In math... I got angry.

254
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,875
Whoa. Chi, are
you kidding again?

255
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,458
[ERU]
No, I'm serious.

256
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,125
But I can't really figure out
what specifically made me mad,

257
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,625
only that I had gotten mad.

258
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,333
Ordinarily, I would
have made the choice

259
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,625
not to have gotten mad,
but I made the mad choice,

260
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,166
and now being made mad
makes me really curious.

261
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,291
Which kind of makes
the being made mad okay,

262
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,708
if you think about it.

263
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,166
Have you gone mad?

264
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,791
I was made mad
and then made curious

265
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,583
about being made mad!

266
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,458
Never mind the semantics!

267
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,041
I have to know!

268
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,000
[GIRL ATHLETES] Go! Fight!
Go! Fight! Go! Fight!

269
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,833
[ERU] Today my class
had math fifth period.

270
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,291
Mr. Omichi was teaching,
and in a bad mood.

271
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,333
Oreki and Fukube,
you guys have him, too,

272
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,250
so you know pretty well
what he can be like

273
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,958
when he gets himself riled up.

274
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,458
I guess I should
explain what happened

275
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,958
from the very beginning.

276
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,625
Let's see.

277
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,666
Mr. Omichi opened the
door to the classroom

278
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,041
right as the tardy
bell started to ring.

279
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,250
Before he came in, he
stopped outside the doorway

280
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,000
and looked up
at the class plate.

281
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,666
I guess so he would know
what class he was teaching.

282
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,375
But that's not unusual.
He does it every time.

283
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,208
Once he got in,
the first thing he did

284
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,916
was write a quadratic
equation up on the board.

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,125
It was simple enough, but he
did something new this time.

286
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,666
He included bounds for X,

287
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,916
which wasn't something
we knew how to do.

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,125
Then Omichi called on Kawasaki.

289
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,083
He told him to stand up
in front of the class

290
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,208
and solve the equation
for the range of Y.

291
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,833
Kawasaki froze.

292
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,750
He was confused,
which is only natural,

293
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,166
considering we hadn't
learned about ranges yet.

294
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,916
We were all nervous
at this point.

295
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,250
Kawasaki said that he didn't
know how to solve for Y,

296
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,791
which is what started it.

297
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,500
That's when Mr. Omichi
flipped out

298
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,750
and started screaming at us
for being bad students.

299
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,166
He calmed down after
a bit and called on Tamura,

300
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,666
who is really good at math.

301
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,791
Unfortunately, Tamura didn't
know what to do, either.

302
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,250
When the best guy at math
in the class didn't know,

303
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,250
I got the idea
that maybe Mr. Omichi

304
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,500
had been mistaken
about the lesson plan.

305
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,500
The other students must
have figured it out, too,

306
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,458
and things got a little chaotic.

307
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,833
Well, that really
set Mr. Omichi off,

308
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,041
so he started being
even harsher with us.

309
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,541
He even started beating the
chalkboard like a maniac,

310
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,041
which had never happened before.

311
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,708
Someone in class may have been
able to solve the problem,

312
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,041
but at that point,
no one wanted to speak up.

313
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,000
Everyone just stared
at their desks.

314
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,166
Then Mr. Omichi made
Tamura stand up again,

315
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,458
and started berating him,

316
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,750
trying to make an example
out of him, I guess.

317
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,375
That's when I just
couldn't take it anymore

318
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,750
and had to stand up.

319
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,416
I told Omichi he must be
mistaken and to double-check

320
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,833
our class's progress
in the lesson plan.

321
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,083
So now I see that's the
exact point when I got angry.

322
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,875
[MAYAKA]
Well, what happened next?

323
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,125
Let me see.

324
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,166
Then he just turned the
page in his textbook.

325
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,291
He saw something there
and said, "Oh, that's right."

326
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,791
Then he apologized.

327
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,541
After that, he told
Tamura to sit down

328
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,250
and continued teaching like
nothing had even happened.

329
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,791
So that's Mr. Omichi's
teaching style, huh?

330
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,041
Oh, for sure.

331
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,875
You would be traumatized
if I went into detail

332
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,041
about the kind of grief that
man gave me after midterms.

333
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,916
[HOTARO] We had teachers
like him back in elementary

334
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,916
and middle school,
though, right?

335
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,166
Ones with really bad tempers?

336
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,208
Besides, your crappy grades
are your own fault, not his.

337
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,666
You better study for the final.

338
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,416
[SATOSHI whines]

339
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,958
So anyway, that's the story.

340
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,166
What do you think?

341
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,458
Is anything about that
out of the ordinary?

342
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,333
Ah!

343
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,833
What I'm curious about
is how Mr. Omichi

344
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,083
made that kind of mistake
in the first place.

345
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,083
It seems so out of
character for him.

346
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,416
He's usually kind of a
perfectionist, so it's odd.

347
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah, you're right.

348
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,416
And I think the reason Omichi
is so strict with the students

349
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,625
is that he's equally
hard on himself.

350
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,250
So then how could he have
made such a simple mistake?

351
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,875
That's the part
I don't understand.

352
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,208
Yeah, weird.
I don't understand it either.

353
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,250
Hey, Oreki!

354
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,458
Beats me.

355
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,708
Look, if you really
wanna know that badly,

356
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,000
why don't you go
right to the source

357
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,916
and pick Omichi's
brain instead of mine?

358
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,083
Because that would take
all the fun out of it.

359
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,291
Oh, yeah?

360
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,625
Well, I guess you'll
never know the answer.

361
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,833
You might as well give it up.

362
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,416
I'm too curious for that!

363
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,000
Oreki, why don't you want to
think about this with me?

364
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,333
[HOTARO]
Why me?

365
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,041
Come on, silly, don't
you think it would be fun

366
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,000
for us to try to
figure this out together?

367
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,250
[SATOSHI]
Oh!

368
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,208
[HOTARO] I don't like
her talking to me like

369
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,791
I'm a little kid.

370
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,041
Look, Chi.

371
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,208
You might want to avoid
getting your hopes up

372
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,375
about this guy.

373
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,500
He was a sloth in
one of his past lives.

374
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,625
What? Mayaka, you can
do past life regression?

375
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,041
[HOTARO]
Nice distraction, Mayaka!

376
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,541
Interesting, but right now
I want to know about Omichi.

377
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,625
[HOTARO]
Damn! She won't be swayed.

378
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,083
I just... I have to know!

379
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,541
[ERU] Mr. Omichi always
makes a point to write a note

380
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,666
in his textbook at the
end of every class.

381
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,541
Why do you think he
takes the time to do that?

382
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,958
[HOTARO] So he can
remember how far he got

383
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,500
in each lesson and pick up
there for the next class.

384
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,750
[ERU]
That's what I thought.

385
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,458
He also does that weird
thing where he looks

386
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,000
at the class plate before
he comes in to the room.

387
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,875
It seems like a
fool-proof system,

388
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,250
so how is there room for
any mistakes on his part?

389
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,291
[HOTARO] He probably writes
the name of the class

390
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,208
and the date on the
page where they stopped.

391
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,333
Like, on page fifteen, "Class A,
July first," or something.

392
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,541
Otherwise, it would be really
easy for him to lose track.

393
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,041
Do you think maybe
he could have forgotten

394
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:07,958
what the date was?

395
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,083
If that were the case,

396
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,583
he would have gone
back a previous day,

397
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,750
not skipped ahead.

398
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,250
Use your brain a little, dummy.

399
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,750
Well, she's not wrong.

400
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,375
Something's bugging
me about this.

401
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,083
Wanna hear?

402
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,458
Of course, go ahead.

403
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,833
I can understand
you getting mad

404
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,208
about something like that.

405
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,666
But I can't imagine you
feeling so strongly about it

406
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,250
that you'd take the risk
to talk back to a teacher.

407
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,708
Why do you think you did?

408
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,916
I was angry,
but I didn't just speak up

409
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,500
because he was being mean to us.

410
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,875
That's not unusual
for Mr. Omichi.

411
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,916
[MAYAKA] Then, was it that the
people who knew the answer

412
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,041
didn't come forward?

413
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,583
No way.

414
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,708
Who would have wanted
to solve it in that situation,

415
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,708
even if they did
know the answer?

416
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,125
[MAYAKA] Could you have
been mad that no one else

417
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,750
had the courage to correct him?

418
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,125
Uh, no.

419
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,875
Do you think you just
felt sorry for him? Tamura?

420
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,500
I mean, I did feel
pretty bad for the guy.

421
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,166
But I can't imagine why
that would make me

422
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,750
mad enough to talk back.

423
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,916
It's kind of a regular
occurrence that a student

424
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,625
who doesn't know the
answer to a problem

425
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,833
we've already covered
in class would get berated

426
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,500
by the teacher, isn't it?

427
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,708
But as far as what made me
stand up to Mr. Omichi...

428
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,708
It's really hard to understand
ourselves sometimes.

429
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,791
You're right.

430
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,833
[HOTARO]
What pushes Chitanda's buttons?

431
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,916
What makes her tick?

432
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,750
I still don't feel like
I know her well enough

433
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,416
to be able to say
one way or the other.

434
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,833
So what's your take?
What do you think?

435
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,916
[HOTARO] The clue about
Omichi writing the note

436
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,791
in his book on
the class's progress

437
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,000
is the one that might
lead to an answer here.

438
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,916
But even doing that,
he still made a mistake.

439
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Since it's math,
which is cumulative,

440
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,916
they're going in order,
so there had to be notes

441
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,583
written on the previous
pages in the chapter, too.

442
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,458
[HOTARO] You're absolutely
100% positive that your class

443
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,583
hadn't learned about ranges?

444
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,541
I'm sure. Positive.

445
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,750
Well, suppose you had
already learned about them,

446
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,458
then what?

447
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,375
I don't see what
you're getting at.

448
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,333
Omichi teaches the same
concepts every school term.

449
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:11,083
Class 1-A had the same lesson
last year, didn't they?

450
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,000
If you're saying he saw
the previous year's mark

451
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,708
and got confused, that
isn't a possible answer.

452
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,125
How can you be sure?

453
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,541
[SATOSHI] The teachers' editions
are replaced every year.

454
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,666
The publishers go through
and make slight corrections,

455
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,708
put in new problems, et cetera.

456
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,041
In order to make sure
they're all on the same page--

457
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,708
No pun intended--
they just reissue them.

458
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,750
They're currently
on the fourth edition.

459
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,458
I can't believe
you know that.

460
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,000
If it weren't for us,
all of your knowledge

461
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,458
would be useless.

462
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,708
Databases are never useless.

463
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,166
[HOTARO] Maybe Omichi
just wrote the wrong thing

464
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,125
in his book.

465
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,541
It could be the case, but...

466
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,166
I doubt that answer would
satisfy Chitanda's curiosity.

467
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,708
[SATOSHI] I gotta admit, I don't
understand ranges, either.

468
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,208
It's all I can do to put X
and Y in the same plane,

469
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,000
and even that's a chore,
which is kind of pathetic.

470
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,541
I'm gonna be in
for a world of pain

471
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,916
if Omichi sets his sights on me.

472
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,458
[HOTARO] 
Wait a second.

473
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,291
Do you mean Class 1-D
has already covered

474
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,750
the ranges unit?

475
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,541
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

476
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,541
[HOTARO] So Satoshi's class
would have been able

477
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,208
to solve the problem,
but Chitanda's couldn't.

478
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,750
Mine wouldn't have, either.

479
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,500
[HOTARO]
Then that's the answer.

480
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,083
Oh, man, I recognize that look.

481
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,500
You figured it out, huh?

482
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,291
[HOTARO]
I might have.

483
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,208
Chitanda.

484
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,375
Yes?

485
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,833
You're absolutely
certain there was a note

486
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,625
in the textbook farther
ahead than the point

487
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,375
your class had reached,
is that right?

488
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,166
Yes. No doubt about it.

489
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,541
[HOTARO] And it had to be
one he's written this year;

490
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,583
it was just not on the
page where Class 1-A

491
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,125
had actually stopped?

492
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,958
Right.

493
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,708
So what if we were
to assume that the note

494
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,541
was on the correct page,
just for the wrong class?

495
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,041
What if the note was a progress
marker for Satoshi's, not yours?

496
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,375
My class? Hmm...

497
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:01,375
[SATOSHI] Omichi teaches math
to four classes, A, B, C, and D.

498
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,041
Even if the note
wasn't for A or B,

499
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,625
that doesn't mean it
has to be for Class D.

500
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,458
And even if it
was for that class,

501
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,083
why would it matter?

502
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,625
Well, if that were the case,

503
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,708
it makes sense that he would
mistake the mark for Class A's.

504
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,750
There's not much chance he'd
confuse a C for a D, is there?

505
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,541
Huh? Now you're
talking nonsense again.

506
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,958
No one would mistake
an A for a D, either.

507
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,875
[HOTARO]
But Omichi is a mathematician.

508
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,750
[MAYAKA]
Yeah, so what?

509
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,208
That's why it's likely.

510
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,166
It's really easy to
mistake those two letters

511
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,750
when you do math.

512
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,833
How?

513
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,708
[HOTARO] Let's say on
page 10 Omichi wrote,

514
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,958
"July first, Class A,"

515
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,833
then on page 15
he would have written,

516
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,333
"July first, Class D."
Does that make sense?

517
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,625
[MAYAKA] Okay, so what
exactly are you getting at?

518
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,708
Why would anyone confuse
one for the other?

519
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,375
[HOTARO]
Just assume he did for a sec.

520
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,125
If so, then what went down today
is pretty likely, right?

521
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,583
[MAYAKA]
Huh?

522
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,250
[ERU] Wait... I don't get
how that would ever happen.

523
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,583
'Cause when you
write equations,

524
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,833
A and D would look like this.

525
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,958
I get it! He thought a
lowercase D was an A!

526
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,750
You solved it!

527
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,291
[groans]
I guess you're right.

528
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,791
One time, on an English
test, I lost points

529
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,416
because the teacher
couldn't tell some of my

530
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,875
lowercase letters apart.

531
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,041
Same here. It's difficult.

532
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,375
On my test, the teacher couldn't
distinguish the Ns from the Hs.

533
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,041
That's what happened.
It seems so obvious now.

534
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,458
[HOTARO]
Man. I'm glad that's settled.

535
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,416
[HOTARO]
Huh?

536
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,166
D and A.

537
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,416
I can't blame him
for mixing those up.

538
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,750
I feel bad now.

539
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,916
I guess I was a bit out
of line for getting so mad

540
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,250
and yelling, huh?

541
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,833
I'm surprised I didn't
get in trouble for it.

542
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,708
What?! How can you say that?

543
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,166
He was a total "D" and screamed
at the class for no good reason!

544
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,666
You have to stand up
for what's right!

545
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,750
Hey, calm down.

546
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,458
Just look at how
late it's gotten.

547
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,166
Don't you think it's
time we headed home?

548
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,208
[MAYAKA] But wait...
I wasn't finished.

549
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,250
[SATOSHI] I know,
but why does it matter?

550
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,708
The mystery's been solved.

551
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,500
[MAYAKA]
Hey! I'm not done with you!

552
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,541
[HOTARO] Chitanda, who's
usually slow to anger,

553
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,083
got mad today and
had to know why.

554
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,666
She said herself that wrath
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

555
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,166
But I wonder...

556
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,583
For some reason, she still
seems to avoid getting riled up.

557
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,458
Could her quest to
pinpoint the cause

558
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,958
of her anger have been
motivated by some desire

559
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,166
to let Omichi off the hook?

560
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,708
Did she just want
to find some proof

561
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,666
that she was wrong to get
mad in the first place?

562
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,208
Is that the kind of person Eru
Chitanda really is, at her core?

563
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,166
Nah.

564
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,583
Who am I kidding.
I don't truly know her at all.

565
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,625
Even if I knew her well
enough to make predictions

566
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,125
about her behavior,

567
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,291
if I ever presumed to be able
to read her mind, well...

568
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,458
I know what that'd be.

569
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:54,458
A cardinal sin. Pride.

570
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,250
One of the seven deadly ones.

571
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,958
Avoid those at
all costs, they say.

572
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,208
I mean, come on.

573
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,333
How many times has
Chitanda surprised me,

574
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,416
in this afternoon alone?

575
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,000
[ERU]
Hey, Oreki.

576
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,791
Aren't you coming with us?

577
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh. Of course. I'm sorry.

578
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,375
[ERU]
Hey, listen.

579
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,250
Thank you for your
help with everything.

580
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,208
I mean it feels like
you're always solving

581
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:21,291
these mysteries
for me, doesn't it?

582
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,750
Yeah, and it's becoming
a real hassle.

583
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,125
[ERU chuckles]

584
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,541
What are you guys still
waiting around for?

585
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah, you wanna
live at the school?

586
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,083
No. We're right behind you.

587
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,000
Well, should we be going, then?

588
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,125
Sure.

589
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,791
[HOTARO] I guess tomorrow
I'll pick up where I left off.

590
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,916
[ERU]
C'mon, Oreki!

591
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That may be true
for you, Mayaka.

592
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,875
Think about it from
her perspective.

593
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,291
[HOTARO] And so, another
afternoon of my high school life

594
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,500
is spent squandering my energy.

595
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,541
I've got my hands full
with one deadly sin, sloth.

596
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,958
That's plenty for now.

597
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,625
[ERU] Next time:
"Upon Seeing The True Nature."
