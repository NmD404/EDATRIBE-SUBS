00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,333
[beeping]

2
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,583
[keyboard tapping]

3
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,041
[keyboard tapping]

4
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,291
[keyboard tapping]

5
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,541
[keyboard tapping]

6
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,041
[keyboard tapping]

7
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,958
[keyboard tapping]

8
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,416
[keyboard tapping]

9
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:55,916
[keyboard tapping]

10
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,750
[SATOSHI] Wow. Looks like
Sho made the finals.

11
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,708
[HOTARO]
Yeah. That's what it says.

12
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,625
[SATOSHI]
Mm-hm!

13
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,416
He's amazing.

14
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,000
Seeing something like
that makes me wonder

15
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,958
if I have any natural
talents, but I doubt it.

16
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,916
I'm pretty sure the gifted
genes skipped right over me.

17
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,500
I keep trying to
tell myself I'm just

18
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,333
a late bloomer. That's only
wishful thinking, though.

19
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,458
Come on, what do ya mean?
You're a human database.

20
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,458
[SATOSHI] Yeah, I am quite
proud of that trait:

21
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,333
my ability to store information.

22
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,208
But even if I put effort
into developing it,

23
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,375
I'll never be a quiz show king.

24
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,250
Really?

25
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,791
Heck no. And I resent it.

26
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,166
I envy people like Sho.

27
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,750
Being a talented genius has
its disadvantages, too.

28
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,041
Yeah, like what?

29
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,708
Extraordinary people don't
even have the option

30
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,375
to lead a normal,
boring existence

31
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,000
like the rest of us do.

32
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,041
Uh--

33
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,208
Hold on.

34
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,625
You think a mundane life
is better somehow?

35
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,791
You would think that.

36
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:23,833
You're such a weirdo.

37
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,833
[HOTARO]
Mm...

38
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,375
I wonder if you'll
actually be able

39
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,583
to live a normal life.

40
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,875
What is that supposed to mean?

41
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,000
[sighs]

42
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,625
Look, I've accepted
that I don't have

43
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,208
any special talents.

44
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,041
I think the jury is
still out on you, though,

45
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:40,166
so I'm gonna hold off on making
a determination a bit longer.

46
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,333
If you think I could live
an extraordinary life,

47
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,500
I have to question your
powers of observation.

48
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,125
Hey, I'm still
gathering evidence.

49
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,833
Gimme a break here.

50
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,083
Anyway...

51
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,083
We should probably hurry
along to the meeting.

52
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,083
Mayaka will have both our hides
if we show up late again.

53
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,458
[HOTARO]
That's for sure.

54
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,125
[HOTARO] It's summer vacation,
for crying out loud.

55
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:58,916
You're late!

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,083
Ah--!

57
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,333
[laughs nervously]

58
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,333
[MAYAKA]
Yeah, laugh it up.

59
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,083
You two are in deep trouble.

60
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,416
Where's Chitanda?

61
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,583
Oh. She hasn't
shown up yet either.

62
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,666
I'm a little worried.

63
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,375
That's a pretty stark disparity.

64
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,208
There's a disparity
in your behavior.

65
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,791
[ERU]
I'm so sorry I'm late!

66
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,750
There's a film screening!

67
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,625
You guys!

68
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,333
Do you wanna see a student film?

69
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,500
Class 2-F produced a movie,
and they're gonna

70
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,666
be showing it in a few minutes!

71
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,875
[SATOSHI]
Hm?

72
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:25,875
[ERU] I have a friend
who's in that class,

73
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,416
and we were just
talking about it.

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,041
That's actually why I was late.

75
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,625
She wants some outside
input on the film,

76
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,291
so she asked if
we would watch it.

77
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,666
[MAYAKA]
What kind of movie is it?

78
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,916
[ERU] Um, she said it
was a murder mystery.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,083
[MAYAKA]
Oh, yeah?

80
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,333
[SATOSHI]
Well, that's right up our alley.

81
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,000
[ERU]
I think this is the place.

82
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,875
[ERU] We decided to take
you up on your invitation.

83
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,000
[IRISU]
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

84
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,500
Thanks for coming.

85
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,041
I appreciate you taking the time
to help us out with this.

86
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,208
This is Mayaka Ibara.

87
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,541
That's Satoshi Fukube.

88
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,208
And he's Hotaro Oreki.

89
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,875
We're all in the
Classic Lit Club together,

90
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,250
as I mentioned earlier.

91
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,541
Nice to meet you.

92
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,541
My name is Fuyumi Irisu.

93
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,916
Oh! Now I remember.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,375
You and I have met before.

95
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,458
I thought you looked
familiar. I was right!

96
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,208
[IRISU]
Uh, I don't remember you.

97
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,458
Sorry about that.

98
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,291
Oh, we were both on
the cultural festival

99
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,375
planning committee.
We mediated that dispute

100
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,666
between the Light Music Club
and the Drama Club?

101
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,375
Talk about drama!

102
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,375
[HOTARO] I've never seen
Satoshi so eager to please.

103
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,125
Yeah, sorry, still
doesn't ring a bell.

104
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,791
[SATOSHI]
U-Uh-- No worries.

105
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,916
Hey, Chi, how do
you know this girl?

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,916
My family and the
Irisu family have been

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,333
close for generations.

108
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,416
I've know her for as
long as I can remember.

109
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,875
[HOTARO] Being old money sure
seems like a lot of work.

110
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,166
[IRISU] Anyway...
Here is a copy of the movie

111
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,208
the other kids in
my class produced.

112
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,791
I'd be grateful if
you would watch it

113
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,916
and tell me your
honest opinions of it.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,541
Sure, we can't wait!

115
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,250
[HOTARO]
So all we have to do is watch it

116
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,458
and tell you what we think?

117
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,583
[IRISU]
Yes, is that strange to you?

118
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,125
[HOTARO] Well, if we don't
like it, does that mean

119
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,083
you're going to reshoot
the parts we criticize,

120
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,125
or are you just showing us
for some free publicity?

121
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,208
Neither.

122
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,500
Then I don't understand
what you gain

123
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,041
from showing it to us.

124
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,166
You bring up a legitimate point.

125
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,583
The purpose involves
your opinions,

126
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,791
but it's not about
the quality, per se.

127
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,958
I just think it's more
efficient to show you the film

128
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,041
before explaining further.

129
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,625
So?

130
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,666
I guess I'll wait and see.

131
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,041
[IRISU] Our movie doesn't
have an official title yet,

132
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,750
but the working
title is "Mystery."

133
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,666
Once the film is over,
I'll be asking you

134
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,458
specific questions,
so please pay attention.

135
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,500
All right. Let's get
things started.

136
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,541
I'll be back in a bit.
Happy hunting.

137
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,708
[HOTARO]
"Hunting?"

138
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,291
[NARRATOR 8A]
These students from Class 2-F

139
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,833
have decided to participate
in the Kanyasai.

140
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,875
They need supplies
from the Narakubo area

141
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,916
for their exhibit and are
now heading to the site.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,833
How much farther is it?

143
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,708
Not much farther.

144
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,958
We should be there
in five more minutes.

145
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,458
You said the same thing
five minutes ago!

146
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,708
This is pretty tough going.

147
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:09,916
I'm hot, and I'm
starting to feel

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,333
tired and hungry.

149
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,791
You're not the only one
who is hot and tired!

150
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,666
Now! We gotta keep marching!

151
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,500
[MAYAKA sighs]

152
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,541
[HOTARO] About what I'd
expect from a student film.

153
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,166
[SUGIMURA]
Mm-hm. Yes, I see it.

154
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,916
That's Narakubo over there.

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
[KONOSU]
So awesome.

156
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,291
[KATSUTA]
You're right.

157
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,541
I think it was worth
the trek to get supplies.

158
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,666
All that aside, it would
be wise to find a place

159
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,875
to camp for the night before
hunting for materials!

160
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,291
[KONOSU]
You're right.

161
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,041
That looks like a good place,
over there, doesn't it?

162
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,375
Let's go see!

163
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,500
[KONOSU]
I dunno, guys.

164
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,708
I have a bad feeling about this.

165
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,541
A haunted theater!

166
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,125
A haunted theater?

167
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,208
It's so dusty.

168
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,958
The roof seems like it's
holding up okay, though.

169
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,333
It's too dangerous
to sleep in this room.

170
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,416
There's glass scattered about!

171
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,916
We need to find
somewhere to camp

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,666
before it gets dark out.

173
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,458
I think I found a
floorplan over here.

174
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,583
[SATOSHI]
Oh! It is a floorplan!

175
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,583
Let's split up and
explore the building!

176
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,125
Hey! That sounds dangerous!

177
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,583
And I am certain all the
doors in here are locked!

178
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,500
There has to be a set
of keys lying around

179
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,708
this place somewhere.

180
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,083
[SUGIMURA]
What is that? An office?

181
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,125
[SUGIMURA] What do you
think those keys are for?

182
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,333
[KONOSU] I think those
are the master keys.

183
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,875
We should leave them here.

184
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,833
It would be bad
if they got lost.

185
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,833
[SUGIMURA]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

186
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,416
[KONOSU] We found keys.
They should unlock

187
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,416
all the rooms in the house.

188
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,416
[KAITO] Okay, let's split up
and see what we can find.

189
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,458
[KONOSU]
Right.

190
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,958
If this were reality,

191
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,291
there's no way they'd all
split up, you know what I mean?

192
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,541
What are you getting at?

193
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,916
Something's about to happen.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,875
I can feel it--can't you?

195
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:39,666
[MAYAKA growls]

196
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,541
[HOTARO]
What?

197
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,416
He was the one talking to me!

198
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,958
[NARRATOR 8A] The incident
occurred soon after.

199
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,083
[SATOSHI]
See, I told you so!

200
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:53,916
[MAYAKA growls]

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,208
[HOTARO]
Hm?

202
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,875
Did you find anything?

203
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,000
There are pieces of
broken mirror everywhere.

204
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,333
We can't use any of
the rooms I've seen.

205
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,208
None of the rooms that
I saw would work, either.

206
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,708
Hey, Sugimura!

207
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,166
What did you find up there?

208
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,791
[SUGIMURA]
Well, it's pretty clean, mostly.

209
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,083
The rooms in this wing...

210
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,708
...might be our best options.

211
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,333
Hey, where's Kaito?

212
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,791
He must still be lookin' around.

213
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,875
Let's go find him.

214
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,000
Maybe he found
something worth seeing.

215
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,791
Is this a sitting room?

216
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,875
[KATSUTA]
No Kaito here.

217
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,708
[KATSUTA]
Hm? Not in here, either.

218
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,791
Farther down, maybe?

219
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,916
[KATSUTA]
This one's locked.

220
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,958
It won't budge.

221
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,041
That's kinda weird.

222
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,166
[SENOUE]
What should we do?

223
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,625
[KONOSU]
I'll go get the master keys.

224
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,333
[SENOUE]
Yeah, I'll come with you.

225
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,875
[SUGIMURA]
Kaito!

226
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,416
[SUGIMURA]
Th-There's blood everywhere!

227
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,291
[fake screams]

228
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,208
[YAMANISHI]
Oh, no. What is that?

229
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,791
[SENOUE]
Oh, no. What is that?

230
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,791
[ERU gasps]

231
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,833
[HOTARO] I'm amazed she can
buy into this nonsense.

232
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,958
Damn it! He's dead!

233
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,166
[KATSUTA grunting]

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,375
[KATSUTA pants]

235
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,166
[KATSUTA]
Oh, no.

236
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,083
[MAYAKA]
Um... Is that it?

237
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,250
But, wait.

238
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,541
There's no way
that's the ending!

239
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,416
[IRISU]
That's all we have so far.

240
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,416
So, what's the point
of this screening?

241
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,875
I'd like to know
who you all think

242
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,875
is the culprit in the film.

243
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,625
[IRISU] I will explain the
whole thing in a moment,

244
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,666
but first, I want to hear
each of your opinions.

245
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,000
Technically speaking,

246
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,666
what would be your
impressions of our film?

247
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,916
Well, if I could
be perfectly honest,

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,625
I think it's a bit clumsy.

249
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,291
I agree with that assessment.

250
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,416
No matter how much passion
goes into a film,

251
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,625
without real skill,
it feels amateur.

252
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,666
But isn't that okay?

253
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,500
I mean it is an amateur film.

254
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,416
Yes. I think it's fine
enough work for what it is.

255
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,208
A student film should
get some leeway

256
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,208
to be a bit
self-indulgent, right?

257
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,708
[HOTARO]
Mm-hm.

258
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,416
[IRISU] Let's not get bogged
down discussing aesthetics.

259
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,166
I was just curious.

260
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,250
What's the most obvious
issue with the project,

261
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,833
as it stands?

262
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,250
The fact that it's
nowhere near finished?

263
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,583
Yes.

264
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,291
Even if it's not perfect,
we have to complete it.

265
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,166
The crew shot at
a unique location,

266
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,625
and we were only able to do
so during the summer break,

267
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,666
which has proven
to be problematic.

268
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,666
Why do you say that?

269
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,791
Did the shoot not
go as scheduled?

270
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,125
The actual shoot
went according to plan.

271
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,625
We were supposed to
wrap everything up

272
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,208
right on time, next Sunday.

273
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay, so what's
the problem, then?

274
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,375
The script's not done.

275
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,958
Mayu Hongo has written manga,

276
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,333
which is more experience
than anyone else in class,

277
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,541
so she agreed to write
the hour-long screen play.

278
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,791
That's a tall order!

279
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,791
She did pretty well
with it, overall.

280
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,458
But when she reached
the point that you saw

281
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,333
in the film, she got very
sick and couldn't finish.

282
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,541
[gasps]

283
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,500
Wait a minute.

284
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,083
Do you expect us to take over?

285
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,583
I could never ask
anything like that of you.

286
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,875
Now then, getting back
to my earlier question.

287
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,958
Who do you think
committed the murder?

288
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,875
Hongo got sick just
as we were getting

289
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,041
to the resolution.

290
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,500
I think that someone
who watched the film

291
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,500
up to this point should
be able to deduce who did it.

292
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,250
But are there really
going to be enough clues

293
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,791
to figure that out in a
screenplay by a novice writer?

294
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,500
I believe there should be.

295
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,458
Hongo immersed herself
and focused mostly

296
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,125
on Sherlock Holmes. She
followed the Ten Commandments,

297
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,125
Nine Propositions,
and the Twenty Rules.

298
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh, yeah?

299
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,750
What, like from the Bible?

300
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,041
No, Knox's Ten Commandments.

301
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,500
Those, plus the Nine
Propositions and Twenty Rules

302
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,625
dictate what makes
a good detective story.

303
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,875
Correct.

304
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,333
They say the keys to
solving the crime must

305
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,541
always be presented
fairly to the reader.

306
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,125
So, with that in mind,
who do you think

307
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,625
is the culprit in this case?

308
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,750
[HOTARO] That's what she
meant by, "Happy hunting."

309
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,083
I'm not very good with
that kind of question.

310
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,750
I store information. I don't
know how to interpret it.

311
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,833
Me, either.

312
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,791
I don't pay much
attention to details.

313
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,333
Though, I suspect there's
someone here who does.

314
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,708
[HOTARO]
Hm?

315
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:08,958
Don't look at me.

316
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,041
[SATOSHI]
Why not?

317
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,625
This is right up
your alley, isn't it?

318
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,875
You are the star detective of
the Classic Lit Club, after all.

319
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,583
C'mon, why the sour face?

320
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,666
I wasn't watching
with that in mind.

321
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,083
In that case, let's ask her
to show us the movie again.

322
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,500
What? Give me a break!

323
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,375
There's no need to overthink it.

324
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,125
I just want an outside opinion.

325
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,583
Oh, is that right?

326
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,791
Well, then I think Yamanishi
is the murderer for sure.

327
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,000
[gasps] What makes
you say that?

328
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,416
'Cause I don't like
her crappy attitude.

329
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,875
Oreki! Don't play around!

330
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,375
Hey, Irisu, why don't
you try to figure out

331
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,416
who the murderer is?

332
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,875
I don't have any
experience with mysteries.

333
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,333
No?

334
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,500
Well, if that's the case,
then why'd you let the class

335
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,625
choose it as the genre
for your project?

336
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,041
I wasn't attached
to the film yet

337
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,750
when they were
making those decisions.

338
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,083
I got back from my family
vacation to Hokkaido,

339
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,625
and the film was already
in this sticky predicament.

340
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,083
I jumped in the day before
yesterday to sort it out.

341
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,166
If I'd been involved, I doubt
it would have moved forward.

342
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,708
One more question.

343
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,416
Why did you call on
the Classic Lit Club

344
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,916
to help you out with this issue?

345
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,458
[IRISU]
Well, first, I knew Chitanda

346
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,083
would have my back on this.

347
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,416
And secondly, I heard all
about the <i>Hyouka</i> business.

348
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,250
Huh?

349
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,375
I didn't think anyone
else knew about that.

350
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,166
[HOTARO]
Did Miss Itoigawa tell her?

351
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,666
When I agreed to
help my classmates

352
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,166
out of this mess, I remembered
what I'd heard about you.

353
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,500
I thought that perhaps I could
enlist you as my detectives

354
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,416
and solve the
problem even faster.

355
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,416
Well, don't expect us
to do all the work.

356
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,791
Not at all.

357
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,583
I sincerely apologize if
I gave you that impression.

358
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,041
Please forgive me.

359
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,583
So, that's the end of
this morning's screening.

360
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,250
Well, then. Thanks for coming.

361
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,041
[gasps]

362
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,041
Hey! Please, wait a minute!

363
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,208
What's going to
happen with the end

364
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,791
of the movie, then?

365
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,583
I don't know.

366
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,375
We'll do our best
with what we have.

367
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,875
But I am bracing
for the possibility

368
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,083
that we won't finish.

369
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,500
We can't let that happen.

370
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,583
I would be heartbroken
to know all their hard work

371
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,625
was done in vain!

372
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,625
I just don't think
I could bear it!

373
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,666
[HOTARO]
What's it to her?

374
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,000
Irisu should be upset.

375
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,500
Yeah.

376
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,541
It would be frustrating to
leave it unfinished like that!

377
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,875
I agree.

378
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,916
You all came together
as a team to get it done.

379
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,125
And also, Hongo worked
herself to the point

380
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,000
of illness for this project!

381
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,500
Why would she go
to such great lengths

382
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,833
just to give up halfway through?

383
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,583
I just... I have to know!

384
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,958
[SATOSHI chuckles]

385
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,250
Let's help them out,
Hotaro. Why not?

386
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,833
Got something better to do?

387
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,375
We must do this, Oreki.

388
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,541
Let's avenge Hongo's death
and solve this crime!

389
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,083
Hongo isn't dead. She's sick.

390
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,458
Ah! Oh, that's right.

391
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,625
We have to help them, Oreki!

392
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,833
[HOTARO sighs]

393
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,291
What happens if we
do decide to help,

394
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,833
but we can't figure out
who the murderer is either?

395
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,541
Are we supposed to
just bow down and beg

396
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,541
for forgiveness from Class 2-F?

397
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,375
I don't want that
kind of responsibility.

398
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,375
[IRISU]
I'll make you a deal.

399
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,958
How about you act as observers,
rather than detectives?

400
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,750
Observers?

401
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:07,708
Uh--

402
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,791
You'd listen to the opinions

403
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,416
of our class's
appointed detectives,

404
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,500
then offer your viewpoints,
and that'd be the extent of it.

405
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,750
Well?

406
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,000
[sighs]

407
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,500
That sounds okay. Deal.

408
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,083
[gasps]

409
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,541
Thanks so much. I appreciate it.

410
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,208
[SATOSHI]
Irisu's family is pretty famous.

411
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,833
That's the reason
right over there.

412
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,666
The Irisus have run
the general hospital

413
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,250
for decades now.

414
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh, so she's the heiress
to a giant medical fortune.

415
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,041
Yeah, but that's not
the only reason Irisu,

416
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,750
herself, is well-known
around here.

417
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,583
People at school have
given her a nickname.

418
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,000
Do you know what they call her?

419
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,333
No idea.

420
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,416
"The Empress."

421
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,916
Why--does she rule people?

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,916
Ugh, she's not a dominatrix.

423
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,458
[HOTARO] I set it up,
you knocked it down.

424
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,166
I salute you.

425
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,541
What are you doing?

426
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,500
Well, she's pretty, but
that's not the whole reason.

427
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,125
I've heard she can get
anyone to do her bidding.

428
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,083
People are drawn to her,
and before they know it,

429
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,166
she's manipulated them
into being her pawns.

430
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,875
What? Well, that's
not creepy at all.

431
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
Maybe, but I have to say,

432
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,291
the Empress was generous
enough to grant us

433
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,791
an audience with her.

434
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,541
We might do well to adopt
our own symbols in her honor.

435
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,666
What do you mean?

436
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,083
Mayaka should be... "Justice."

437
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,125
It's between that
and "Judgement."

438
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,375
I don't get it.

439
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,958
Symbols from the Tarot deck.

440
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:27,958
[HOTARO]
Huh.

441
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,833
Well, Fuku, what would you be?

442
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,375
"The Fool," I think.

443
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,750
Nah, "The Magician" is better.

444
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,375
I think Chitanda
should be "The Fool."

445
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,250
[gasps] Yeah, you're right.

446
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,041
"The Fool" really does suit me,
now that you mention it.

447
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,666
Impulsiveness is definitely

448
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,791
one of my
shortcomings, after all.

449
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,875
I'm lost.

450
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:47,750
[HOTARO]
Yeah, same.

451
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,041
What about Oreki?

452
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,166
That's a no-brainer.
He'd be "Strength."

453
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,666
Huh? Seriously?

454
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,000
If I had to pick, I would
label him "The Star," instead.

455
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,916
Nope. This guy's
Strength, for sure.

456
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,458
It's perfect for him.

457
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,250
[HOTARO]
Hmph. I have a suspicion

458
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,166
that's not a compliment.

459
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,791
That's a fair assessment.

460
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,708
[HOTARO]
You're a total jerk.

461
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,000
[HOTARO]
Not a chance.

462
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,000
[doorbell rings]

463
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,291
[HOTARO]
Yeah?

464
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,583
Well, good morning, Oreki.

465
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,291
I thought we could
walk together.

466
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,333
[HOTARO grumbles]

467
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,875
[HOTARO] Does she have to be
so polite all the time?

468
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,166
Good morning, everyone!

469
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,041
[MAYAKA]
Morning.

470
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,583
[SATOSHI]
Mornin'!

471
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,458
I'm excited that we get
to meet the detectives today.

472
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,583
I'm looking forward to
listening to their hypotheses

473
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:49,791
about the murderer.

474
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,833
When did you have time
to make this happen?

475
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,166
Over chat.

476
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,458
Kamiyama High School has
a private online chat room

477
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,333
that only the students
are allowed to use.

478
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,583
Wow! I didn't know that!

479
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,875
You'll have to show me!

480
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,166
Yeah, that sounds fun!

481
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,458
[knocking]

482
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,958
[ERU]
Yes? Come on in!

483
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,916
Is this the
Classic Lit Club room?

484
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,208
It is.

485
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,458
Are you the girl who
Irisu sent from Class 2-F?

486
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,708
That's right. My name is Eba.
It's very nice to meet you all.

487
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,125
I believe I'm
supposed to take you

488
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,750
to meet our detectives?

489
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,333
Irisu told me she had briefed
you on the film situation.

490
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,875
All right, follow me.

491
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,791
[MAYAKA]
Chi, did you bring snacks today?

492
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,291
[ERU]
Yep!

493
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,541
I brought these fancy chocolates
someone sent to our house.

494
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,208
I thought that it would
be nice to share them

495
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,375
with everyone while
we were working today!

496
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,833
Sounds great!

497
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,500
I mean, after all, it's so
much harder to think clearly

498
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,416
when you're hungry, ya know?

499
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,541
Man, I can't wait to hear
the detectives' theories

500
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,416
about the film!

501
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,291
Aren't you so excited, Hotaro?

502
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,166
I'm glad you're all
having such a good time.

503
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,000
Hey, Eba! I have
a question for ya.

504
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,208
[EBA]
Go ahead.

505
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,208
[SATOSHI] Who are these
detectives, anyway?

506
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,583
[EBA] The assistant director,
the props master,

507
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:01,625
and the PR girl.

508
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:02,666
Cool!

509
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,958
So what exactly
is your involvement

510
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,750
in the filmmaking process?

511
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,416
I don't have anything to do
with it, as a matter of fact.

512
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,000
To be honest,
I wasn't interested.

513
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:10,958
[HOTARO]
Well how about that?

514
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,208
A girl after my own heart.

515
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,875
Eba, if you don't
mind my asking,

516
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,500
were you and Hongo close?

517
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,000
[EBA]
Why do you ask?

518
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,166
Oh.

519
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,916
I was just curious
about the kind of person

520
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,958
who would be able to write

521
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,291
a murder mystery
script like this.

522
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,041
[EBA]
If I had to describe her,

523
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,583
I'd say...

524
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,875
She's a no-nonsense, meticulous
person, really responsible,

525
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,250
kind to a fault, and fragile.

526
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,958
[EBA]
She's one of my best friends.

527
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,041
Interesting.

528
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,333
[EBA]
Here we are.

529
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:48,916
The film is on hiatus right now,

530
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,916
so I doubt anyone else
is gonna show up.

531
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,416
You shouldn't be interrupted.

532
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,041
[EBA] Everyone, I'd like you
to meet our detectives.

533
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,791
[HOTARO]
Next time:

534
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,375
"The Case of the Furuoka
Deserted Village Murder."
