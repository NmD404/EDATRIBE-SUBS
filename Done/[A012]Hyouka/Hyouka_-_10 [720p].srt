00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,541
[WAITRESS 10A]
Please enjoy!

2
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:15,958
[IRISU]
Is something wrong?

3
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,333
Uh-- No.

4
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,250
When you asked me if I
wanted to have tea with you,

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,916
I didn't know you
were being literal.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,416
Don't worry. I'll get the tab.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,583
Oh.

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,625
[IRISU] Nakajo's theory
didn't pan out, then?

9
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,000
Nor Haba's?

10
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:33,875
Right.

11
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,375
Neither did Sawakiguchi's?

12
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,333
No, I don't believe hers did.

13
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,333
[sighs] I see.

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,541
I'm sorry to disappoint.

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,291
[IRISU] You don't have
to be nice about it.

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,125
[gasps]

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,791
[IRISU]
I'm incredibly curious.

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,166
What was so wrong
about their theories?

19
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,166
Well, first,

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,000
let's talk about
Nakajo's hypothesis.

21
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,041
You see? That's why
Sawakiguchi's theory

22
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,958
doesn't hold up
to scrutiny, either.

23
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,500
Indeed.

24
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:41,458
Which member of your group
turned down Nakajo's idea, then?

25
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,625
That'd be me.

26
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,916
As well as Haba and
Sawakiguchi's ideas?

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,291
Yeah, that's right.

28
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,500
When I first approached you
about this, you told me

29
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,458
I shouldn't expect
too much from you.

30
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,041
I guess our standards
of expectation differ.

31
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,958
Because you proceeded
to disprove the theories

32
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,583
our detectives put forth.

33
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,125
But to be honest,
that was my expectation.

34
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,666
You knew I'd disprove them?

35
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,666
[IRISU] I never thought they'd
be up to the challenge.

36
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,250
I was right.

37
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,166
None of them possesses the level
of deductive reasoning skills

38
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,416
necessary to tackle
something like this.

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,791
You mean the whole
detective thing was a ruse?

40
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,916
Of course.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,333
I'm not calling
them incompetent.

42
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,791
They have their own
strengths, to be sure.

43
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,333
But that doesn't make
them useful to me

44
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,000
in a situation like this, and I
had to interest you somehow.

45
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:19,708
Why not just--

46
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,250
If it weren't for you.

47
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,125
If it weren't for you,
we would have gone with

48
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,791
one of their ideas,
and the whole production

49
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,125
would have ended in failure.

50
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,625
And I refuse to have my name

51
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,916
attached to anything
that isn't a success.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,708
Man, that's pretty cold.
You're heartless, aren't you?

53
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,125
If I must be cruel in order
to get the best product,

54
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,791
so be it. I will do
whatever it takes.

55
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,375
I had heard from
three different people

56
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,208
that only you could fix this.

57
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,833
Eru Chitanda said it,

58
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,916
as well as someone from
outside our school.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,583
Masashi Togaito championed
your prowess, too.

60
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,666
When I learned of your
reputation, I was convinced

61
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,166
you had to be our detective
and save our film.

62
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,541
There was no doubt in my mind.

63
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,708
I was after you from
the very beginning.

64
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,625
Not the Classic Lit Club.

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,666
So, Oreki.

66
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,625
After carefully weighing
all the rumors about you

67
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,125
against your own assessment
of the detectives' theories,

68
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,041
I have decided.

69
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,375
It's all true.

70
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,291
You are special.

71
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,625
[HOTARO gasps]

72
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,125
[IRISU]
You're gifted. A true genius.

73
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,458
So I'll ask again:
will you help us?

74
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,958
Say yes.

75
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,833
You are the only person who
can save our class project.

76
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,708
I couldn't bear it
if all that hard work

77
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,750
went to waste.

78
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,916
I'm really not a genius.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,250
I just... get lucky
from time to time.

80
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,083
That's a real shame.

81
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,875
Let me tell you a little story.

82
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,791
It might change your
perspective a bit.

83
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,583
Once, there was a sports
team with a benchwarmer.

84
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,125
[IRISU] The benchwarmer did
her very best to get herself

85
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,875
off the bench
and onto the field,

86
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,000
but all her efforts
were in vain.

87
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,000
Try as she might,
her hard work was no match

88
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,541
for the athletic ability
of the other team members.

89
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,000
There was one
player in particular

90
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,250
whose natural talent
was undeniable.

91
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,500
Compared to our benchwarmer,

92
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,750
the difference was
like night and day.

93
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,625
At one match, the
talented girl performed

94
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:17,333
exceptionally well, even for
her, and was named the MVP.

95
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,125
Interviewers flocked to
her, hungry for a quote.

96
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,458
One said, "You're amazing!

97
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,666
We're dying to
know your secrets!"

98
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,625
She answered humbly.

99
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,458
"Secrets?

100
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,708
Oh, no, I just got lucky!"

101
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,125
[HOTARO grumbles]

102
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,250
I believe the poor
benchwarmer took great offense

103
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,833
upon hearing such
an inconsiderate remark.

104
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,083
Do you?

105
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,666
It's not wrong to acknowledge
who you really are.

106
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,166
If you don't,

107
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,541
you make fools out of
those who praise you.

108
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,125
[HOTARO]
Is she right? Am I special?

109
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,916
[HOTARO] Do I deny myself
credit for being who I am?

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,500
If so, then why?

111
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,291
Do I think it's wrong
to believe in my talent?

112
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,208
[HOTARO gasps]

113
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,916
[exhales]

114
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,416
All right, Irisu.

115
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,666
My answer--

116
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,666
[SATOSHI] You're going to
school of your own accord

117
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,250
during summer vacation?
Are pigs flying?

118
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,625
Do you have to?

119
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,541
No, but am I not
allowed to go to school

120
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,750
if I want to?

121
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,750
You are.

122
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,791
It's just not like
you, that's all.

123
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,416
I'm fulfilling a personal
request from Irisu.

124
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,750
I'm going to solve the
murder in Class 2-F's film.

125
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,333
What? No way! Who are you?

126
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,666
I am Hotaro Oreki, the
hard-working teenage detective.

127
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,333
Did you say "hard-working"?

128
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,375
This is spooky.

129
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,666
[HOTARO]
Hmph.

130
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,041
Seriously, I never thought
I would see the day.

131
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,250
Are you doing this
because of Chitanda again?

132
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,125
No.

133
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,750
Then, what's your motivation?

134
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,666
"If I don't have to,
I'm not going to," remember?

135
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,083
That is your motto.
Am I correct?

136
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,125
[HOTARO]
Satoshi.

137
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,083
[SATOSHI]
Hm?

138
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,666
Ah--

139
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,250
Please be honest.

140
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,333
Do you believe that there's
anything which only you can do?

141
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,375
No way.

142
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,416
Really?

143
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,833
Don't you remember?

144
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,875
I don't have any
special talents.

145
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,125
Here, check it out.

146
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,583
I think of myself
as a Sherlockian.

147
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,541
But I know deep down that
I couldn't really be one.

148
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,875
I don't have the kind of
iron-clad constitution

149
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,291
that could handle
diving headlong

150
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,416
into the murky depths
of obscure knowledge.

151
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm nothing but an impostor.

152
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,291
If Mayaka suddenly took

153
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,791
a serious interest
in Sherlock Holmes,

154
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,750
I guarantee this: She'd surpass
me in three months, flat.

155
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,958
I'm a jack of all trades,
but a master of none.

156
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,375
I'm a serious dabbler,
that's all.

157
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,833
I get my passport stamped
and I go on my way.

158
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,166
I'm an expert at nothing,
but that's all right.

159
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,583
But, I get it.

160
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,875
Irisu roped you
into this somehow.

161
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,000
[HOTARO grumbles]

162
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,583
Even so, you still
doubt your aptitude.

163
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,250
Which is normal, I suppose.

164
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,208
Don't you have any
doubts about yourself?

165
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,458
Even a little?

166
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,208
I don't. I know I'm average.

167
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,333
Let's go.

168
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,333
Mayaka is probably
at school already.

169
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,375
I wanna say hi.

170
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,458
Satoshi!

171
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,833
[SATOSHI]
Hm?

172
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,333
What I think may not matter,
one way or the other,

173
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,500
but, in my opinion, you're
way better than just average.

174
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,000
If you wanted to be
a Sherlockian someday,

175
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,833
I believe that you would
be one of the finest

176
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,208
Japan had to offer.

177
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,666
There are about a million things

I'd rather aspire to
than being a Sherlockian.

kind of apocalyptic disaster.

help solve the mystery.

after you left yesterday?

You mean with Chi?

198
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,125
Well, I know she made
it home all right.

199
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,666
But when I called
her this morning,

200
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,333
she was in bed with a hangover.

201
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,416
That's funny.

202
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,458
And all from those chocolates.

Ahem.

204
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,083
Well, anyway.

205
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,791
I think it would help if
we watched the movie again.

Wow, Kaito's severed arm

211
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,500
looks so lifelike in that shot.
I'd swear that it was real!

212
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,583
I think the prop team
is the most talented

part of this entire production.

[KATSUTA]
Oh, no.

215
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,791
It sure doesn't seem

216
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,166
like a very complicated
set-up from my perspective.

217
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,666
That's true.

218
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,583
They did an excellent job
of making it look simple, huh?

219
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,208
No, they didn't.

220
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,833
The reason the setting
looks so simple

221
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,083
doesn't have anything to do
with the filmmakers at all.

222

[HOTARO]
What, then?

223

Here's my assessment:

224
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,375
Anything good in this film
is a complete accident.

225
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,625
They don't know
what they are doing,

226
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,583
so the mystery
ends up falling flat.

You're right.

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,583
The first time I saw it,
I assumed at this point

232
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,458
it was a regular documentary,
not a murder mystery.

233
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,333
The production values are
extremely weak, overall.

234

Like, which part?

235
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,500
The camerawork, for starters.

236
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,625
Yeah, I agree.

Okay.

Hold on. Right here.

242
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,916
Wouldn't it be better to
use a wide shot here?

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,958
Just to give some perspective
on the size of the room

244
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,083
and how small the
characters are in it?

245
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,333
Good point.

[SUGIMURA]
Well, it's pretty clean, mostly.

251
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,208
The rooms in this wing...

252
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,666
[MAYAKA] I think it would
be smarter to shoot

253
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,125
from Sugimura's perspective,
so the audience could see

254
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,666
that the lobby's in
full view from up there.

255
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,750
If the viewers only see
him from down there,

256
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,291
there's no way they would
be able to tell that.

Right.

that the locked

to have come or gone by
any way except the door.

creates a second locked room.

355
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,458
They couldn't have
gotten the master key

356
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,583
from out of the office
and gone down that hall

357
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,250
without going through the lobby.

358
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,750
He'd spot them.

359
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,083
So what possible
explanations does that leave?

360
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,625
If none of the six
could have done it

361
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,458
without being seen,
there's just one answer.

362
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,750
A seventh character must
have committed the murder.

363
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,750
Interesting.
Sawakiguchi said that.

364
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,791
Yes.

365
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,333
When she first
brought it up to us,

366
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,833
I thought it was ridiculous,
and I wrote it off completely.

367
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,708
It didn't seem like
a viable option.

368
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,916
But then she said that

369
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,208
Hongo was trying to cast
a seventh character.

370
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,375
Remembering that piece is
what ultimately convinced me.

371
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,708
But...

372
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,750
Hongo had written the
rest of the film's script

373
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,375
to be pretty straightforward.

374
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,125
It seemed unlikely
that she'd introduce

375
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,000
a new character at that point.

376
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,541
However,

377
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,125
we noticed a few odd occurrences
at other points in the film.

378
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,666
Satoshi pointed them out
for me in his notes.

379
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,750
"Konosu finds the floorplan.
It seems illuminated.

380
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,833
I think it's lit
by a flashlight."

381
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,083
"I saw it again.

382
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,375
In the part where they
go looking for Kaito."

383
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,333
"The hall is pitch black.
Can't see a thing.

384
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,208
Suddenly, a flashlight, again."

385
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,750
What's weird about a flashlight?

386
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,291
Nothing.

387
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,250
Except that none of the six
kids is ever seen holding one

388
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,041
at any other point
in the whole movie.

389
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,333
If you look closely
at the scene

390
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,958
where they discover
Kaito's body,

391
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,291
immediately after the
illumination in the hallway,

392
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,291
you can clearly see that
no one has a flashlight.

393
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,083
There was enough time
for them to have hidden it,

394
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,416
but why would they do that?

395
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,750
There's no good reason to.

396
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,166
I know, I know.

397
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,166
You assumed it's scene lighting,
but hold that thought.

398
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,125
Just keep everything I
said about the flashlight

399
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,500
in mind for later.

400
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,833
There's something else.

401
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,000
And don't get offended.

402
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,416
Know it's coming from
a true film buff.

403
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,458
She complains that
the movie is boring.

404
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,000
And it's poorly produced.

405
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,208
The camerawork in particular
lacked any innovation or skill.

406
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,000
But what if that
was intentional?

407
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,208
A clue for the viewers?

408
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,583
How was it shot?

409
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,375
The camera appears
to be in the same place

410
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,458
as the other six
for the whole movie.

411
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,500
Well, then,

412
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,500
it seems like you've
figured it out.

413
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,708
I think I have.

414
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,625
Do you mean...

415
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,583
...that the cameraman
is the seventh character

416
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,708
and the killer?

417
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,250
[HOTARO]
Mm-hm.

418
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,125
There were seven characters
from the beginning of the film.

419
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,625
The six that you see
on screen the entire time,

420
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,833
and the person behind
the camera shooting.

421
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,083
That makes seven.

422
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,166
Now, watch closely.

423
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,791
In some of the scenes,
the actors seem

424
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,000
to be aware of the camera.

425
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,250
They pay subtle
attention to him.

426
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,625
They look at him occasionally,
though not very much.

427
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,208
Calling him the
cameraman is confusing.

428
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,458
Let's rename him
the seventh man.

429
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,125
Now remember the flashlight.

430
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,875
It wouldn't be odd for him
to be carrying one,

431
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,166
if it's his job to
chronicle the experience.

432
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,125
The poor quality of the
camera work, and the fact

433
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,375
that none of the
scenes were shot

434
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,583
from multiple angles
makes sense.

435
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,208
If the guy behind the
camera is a character

436
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,041
in the story, that's expected.

437
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,041
Also--

438
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,833
and this part is
really important--

439
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,666
When the characters
split up to look around,

440
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,041
the camera stayed in the lobby

441
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,166
after all six of
the others had left.

442
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,500
There's that weird,
empty moment,

443
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,333
and the scene fades out.

444
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,583
So check it out.

445
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,208
After the others were
gone, the seventh man

446
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,208
stopped filming for
a few minutes, left.

447
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,750
Came back, started rolling,
and waited for them.

448
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,375
And so, it was a
really simple crime.

449
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,291
The seventh man made
sure they were gone,

450
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,000
stopped his camera,
and ran to the office

451
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,208
to get the master key.

452
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,083
Then, while the others
were busy elsewhere,

453
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,250
he found Kaito and killed him.

454
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,708
After he committed the murder,
he used the master key

455
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,666
to lock the room behind him.

456
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,208
Then he returned quickly to the
lobby and waited for the others.

457
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,875
That is the conclusion I drew.

458
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,458
If Hongo hadn't already
cast a seventh actor,

459
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:43,666
then I suggest you try to
find one as soon as possible.

460
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,041
Two questions.

461
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,333
First, if your theory is true,
the fact that no one

462
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,666
ever talks to the seventh man
or acknowledges him much

463
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,041
seems a little
awkward, doesn't it?

464
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,833
Maybe Hongo was
using that as a way

465
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,333
to establish a motive.

466
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,875
The seventh man
could be an outcast,

467
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,791
someone that others
usually ignore.

468
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,291
As a result, he never felt
confident speaking up

469
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,250
when they were around,
hence his silence.

470
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,833
Next question.

471
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,333
If your hypothesis is correct,
wouldn't the other characters

472
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,875
figure it out eventually,
the same as you did?

473
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,500
They would all suspect
the seventh man

474
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,375
because he'd stayed
in the lobby.

475
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,583
Also, the "second locked
room" part of your theory

476
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,083
is still intact.

477
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,208
His exit from the lobby and
his return after the murder

478
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,833
would have been in public
view the whole time.

479
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,250
In which case,
everyone would know

480
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,000
who the murderer
was immediately.

481
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,083
[HOTARO chuckles]

482
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,541
[gasps]

483
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,541
[HOTARO] I don't mean to be
rude when I say this, but,

484
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,833
what does it matter?
Like, who cares?

485
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,000
[gasps]

486
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,291
It's not important
whether the characters

487
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,083
know who the killer is or not.

488
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,458
As long as the audience is
intrigued by the mystery,

489
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,083
don't you think
that's the point here?

490
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,875
That may be the reason
the film doesn't have

491
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,041
a detective character
in the first place.

492
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,166
The movie doesn't deal
with the people in the story

493
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,375
figuring it out.

494
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,750
They know who among them
would be the killer.

495
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,333
[IRISU]
Congratulations.

496
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,708
Huh?

497
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,541
I believe that you have just
solved Hongo's mystery.

498
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,416
It's an astoundingly
bold approach.

499
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,916
That's for certain, but it
corresponds to all of the facts,

500
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
so I can't imagine there's
any legitimate reason

501
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,500
to dispute it.

502
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,541
Anyway, thank you.

503
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,833
Now we can resume
our production.

504
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,083
[gasps]

505
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,291
I guess my
assumption about you

506
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,875
has proven correct after all.

507
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:35,041
You do have formidable skill.
The power no one else possesses.

508
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,833
Uh, thank you.

509
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,208
That's nice to hear.
I'm very flattered.

510
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,666
I mean it.

511
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,083
So, what do you think the
title of our film should be?

512
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,583
Oh, the title?

513
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,166
Off the top of your head.
I'm sure everyone will approve,

514
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,791
and I know I would like
anything you dream up.

515
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,083
Huh.

516
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,208
Well, let me think.

517
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,666
In light of the culprit...

518
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,291
How do you feel about,
<i>A Blind Spot to All</i> ?

519
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,250
[IRISU chuckles]
That's a good idea.

520
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,125
I think it's the one.

521
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,458

[PRINCIPAL] It's October,
time for everyone's favorite:

the cultural festival!

It's strange.

How could anyone have
gotten into that room

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,416
without us seeing?

530
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,750
[KATSUTA]
I don't know. But I think...

531
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,166
...there's one person
who could've.

532
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,708
Did you murder Kaito?

533
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,416
You did it, didn't you?

534
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,083
[SENOUE]
Murderer!

535
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,416
[KATSUTA]
You're gonna pay for this!

536
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,958
Turned out great, huh?

537
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,125
[KATSUTA]
You can't run away from this!

538
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,791
[gasps]

539
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,416
[NAKAJO]
He pulled it off, didn't he?

540
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,666
[KAITO]
Man, I gotta tell ya,

541
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,041
I was amazed by
that surprise ending!

542
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,416
[HOTARO]
It's the real-life Kaito!

543
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,125
[NAKAJO]
Hey, you're the guy!

544
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,875
Everybody's saying
you're the mastermind

545
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,541
behind the whole thing.

546
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,375
Yeah. Sure.

547
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,583
Man, that ending
was genius, kid!

548
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,250
Sure surprised me!

549
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,208
Hey! It's The Great Detective!

550
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,041
"Great detective"?

551
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,750
Yeah! Good work!

552
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,000
Though, I have to say, it's sad

553
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,541
that when the seventh
character is revealed

554
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,708
to be the killer, the
others turn violent, too.

555
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,625
They should have
just turned him in.

556
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:32,666
Yeah.

557
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,458
Well, anyway, thanks
for everything.

558
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,750
See ya!

559
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,416
Cool.

560
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,916
Listen, Nakajo...

561
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,291
What's up?

562
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,583
[SAWAKIGUCHI] Your pit stains
are out of control.

563
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,000
That arm was worth all
the work we put into it.

564
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,458
Tch.

565
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,708
[HOTARO] I guess Haba wasn't
satisfied with the ending.

566
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:48,666
[SATOSHI]
Hotaro!

567
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,500
Huh?

568
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,375
[SATOSHI]
We saw the film.

569
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,000
[HOTARO]
What did you think?

570
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:52,666
It's pretty good.

571
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,500
[gasps]

572
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,958
It was very interesting.

573
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,875
Who would've have pinned
it on the cameraman?

574
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,375
The other day when we met.

575
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,125
Had you already
figured it all out?

576
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,166
No, at that point,

577
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,750
I hadn't quite
come up with it yet.

578
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:03,708
Really.

579
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,541
Huh?

580
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:05,541
[HOTARO]
Weird.

581
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,833
She doesn't seem
surprised at all.

582
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,375
Then again, it is Mayaka.
What'd I expect?

583
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,208
Hey, Oreki.

584
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,875
[HOTARO]
Hm? Yeah?

585
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,416
Listen.

586
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,791
I-I thought...

587
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,083
I'll tell you later.

588
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,541
Well, you did a great job,
as usual, my friend.

589
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,083
And as for the
Empress. She's happy.

590
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,083
Plus the audience loved
the element of surprise

591
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,416
with the seventh man at the end.

592
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,500
[MAYAKA]
Oreki...

593
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,333
There's something I have to ask.

594
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,083
What's that?

595
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,625
What are you doing?

596
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,458
Now you're solely responsible
for that ending, aren't you?

597
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,250
[HOTARO]
That's right.

598
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,000
All of it?

599
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,208
Mostly.

600
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,875
[MAYAKA]
Hm...

601
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,791
Then how do you account
for what Haba said

602
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,625
when we met with the detectives?

603
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:52,500
Haba?

604
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,916
[gasps] It's just...

605
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,083
They didn't use a rope
anywhere in that movie,

606
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,500
and Hongo specifically
asked him for one.

607
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,750
[gasps]

608
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,541
[HOTARO] Next time:
"Credit Roll of Fools."
