1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,000
[MAYAKA]
All right, then, Fuku.

2
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,708
Let me get this straight.

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,375
You mean this chocolate,
poured into a form,

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,583
cooled and hardened,
isn't homemade.

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,750
So you refuse to accept it.

6
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,583
Is that what you're telling me?

7
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,666
Yeah. That is what I'm saying.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,583
[MAYAKA]
I see.

9
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,583
Okay, fine!

10
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,500
If that's how you really feel...

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,625
I won't forget about this!

12
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,916
Next year,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,416
I'm going to shove a
masterpiece into your face

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,375
that's so amazing even you
won't be able to turn it down!

15
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,916
[MAYAKA] Making chocolate
from cocoa beans

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,666
is just too hard, isn't it?

17
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,125
[ERU]
Yes, it is difficult.

18
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,000
[MAYAKA] But I'm still
not going to give up!

19
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,291
I'll just have to make the
best dang homemade chocolate

20
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,541
anyone has ever had,

21
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,541
and if stupid Fuku
has any complaints,

22
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,791
I will chain him to a wall
and read every last word

23
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,000
of this book to him.

24
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,166
And if he still wants
to give me attitude,

25
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,833
I'll cram that chocolate
down his throat!

26
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,750
[ERU]
Mayaka...

27
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:38,666
I will help you!

28
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,500
[HOTARO]
What?

29
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,625
[HOTARO]
Ruthless.

30
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,041
If there's anything
I can do for you,

31
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,833
please let me know!

32
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,750
There is. Do you know
of any stores nearby

33
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,916
that sell fancy
baking ingredients?

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,458
Let me see.

35
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,958
There is a store by the market
that sells culinary supplies

36
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,333
for professional chefs.

37
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,583
Want me to show you where?

38
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,833
--[MAYAKA] Seriously?
--[ERU] Yes.

39
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,083
Hooray!

40
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,083
Promise that you
won't tell Fuku.

41
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,083
You have my word.

42
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,291
[HOTARO]
Have they forgotten I'm here?

43
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,500
[MAYAKA]
Okay, it's a date.

44
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,958
Oh, Oreki?

45
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,833
[HOTARO]
Hmm?

46
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,708
Don't you say anything, either.

47
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,791
Sure.

48
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,416
I mean it.

49
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,875
I won't say a word.

50
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,375
[HOTARO] And I'd appreciate
it if you'd stop giving me

51
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,625
that devil glare.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,250
[HOTARO]
That's Satoshi's bike.

53
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,750
[SATOSHI]
Hey, Hotaro!

54
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,083
What a crazy coincidence,
running into you here like this.

55
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:35,083
So... Wanna play a game,
for old time's sake?

56
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,250
[HOTARO] I guess there's
no reason to hurry home.

57
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,208
[HOTARO] I haven't been
here since middle school.

58
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,625
[SATOSHI]
I hadn't, either.

59
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,666
[SATOSHI]
I'll take the Viper Two.

60
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,416
You'll take the Raiden, right?

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,125
[HOTARO] It's the only
one I know how to use.

62
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,625
[GAME VOICE]
Airport. Get ready.

63
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,958
[HOTARO] I was sure he'd
focus on evasion tactics.

64
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,625
[HOTARO] Is this how
Satoshi usually fights?

65
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,000
[HOTARO]
No.

66
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,708
This is a definite change.

67
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,791
Satoshi's gaming
strategy when we were

68
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,375
in middle school was to
keep his eye on the prize.

69
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,291
[HOTARO] He would play
to win at all costs.

70
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,750
[SATOSHI chuckles]

71
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,333
[HOTARO]
And if that didn't work,

72
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,041
he was an awfully sore loser who
would throw tantrums and pout.

73
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,916
[SATOSHI] Let's switch
players and go again!

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,583
[HOTARO]
Is he trying to draw me in?

75
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,666
[SATOSHI]
Man! That sure was a good game!

76
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,666
Way to work that
joystick, buddy.

77
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,541
I mean it. That was fun.

78
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,125
[HOTARO]
Uh-huh.

79
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,708
Hey... toward the
end of the round,

80
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,958
why did you charge
in like you did?

81
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,875
When it comes to robot fights,
hand-to-hand is best.

82
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,541
It's more adventurous that way.

83
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,750
[HOTARO]
Yeah. This is the new Satoshi.

84
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,791
He's changed a lot
since middle school.

85
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,791
Man!

86
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,250
It does me no good
to tense up and overthink!

87
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,958
I'm certain that he'll
accept it this year.

88
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,750
I really hope you're
right about that.

89
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,708
By the way, Chi,
I've been wondering.

90
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,916
Who is your crush?

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,583
What?!

92
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,500
Well, um... I don't know.

93
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:48,916
Itchy.

94
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,000
[TOMOE] "This chocolate
is a gift for you

95
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,291
from your devoted older
sister, Tomoe Oreki,

96
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,916
trembling with what you
could call, 'sympathy.'"

97
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,875
Good morning, Oreki.
How are you?

98
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,208
Fine, thanks.

99
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,125
So how did Ibara's
chocolate experiment end up?

100
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,583
It's finished.

101
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,125
It turned out to be
quite a bit of work.

102
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,458
She had to sample all
kinds of chocolate.

103
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,791
I'll bet that was no problem.

104
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,416
She probably gobbled
all of it up.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,166
[gasps]
That's not a nice thing to say!

106
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,416
[HOTARO]
Sorry.

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,625
But anyway,
because of that,

108
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,625
she was able to complete
her masterpiece.

109
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,833
I guess that's
what it looks like

110
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,791
to put your whole
heart into a project.

111
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,166
It's admirable.

112
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,041
[HOTARO] So, what's she gonna
do with the chocolate?

113
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,583
[ERU] Well, from what she
told me, it's complicated.

114
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,750
She couldn't manage
to get out of Manga Club.

115
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,875
I think she's just going to have
to leave it in the clubroom

116
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,041
or something. It's too bad.

117
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,333
[HOTARO]
Hmm...

118
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,791
I think Satoshi's
going to be thrilled

119
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,291
with the whole production.

120
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,375
[ERU]
Oh...

121
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,458
[ERU]
Hey, Oreki. Um...

122
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:09,250
Today is...
Well, it's Valentines' Day.

123
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,916
And in my family,

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,625
we don't traditionally
give anyone gifts

125
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,166
at the end of the year
or in the summer,

126
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,041
not in the way a lot
of other families do.

127
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,875
Also--not on Valentine's Day.

128
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:20,750
[HOTARO]
Does this mean...?

129
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,958
[ERU]
But still...

130
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,250
[HOTARO] So she's saying...
what, exactly?

131
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,833
[BOY 21A]
It's supposed to snow today.

132
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,166
[BOY 21B]
No way!

133
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,750
I didn't even bring any gloves.
I'm such a dummy.

134
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,333
Well, we're gonna be late!

135
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,083
Uh... yeah.

136
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,416
Shall we go, then?

137
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Yeah. Sure.

138
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,416
[door opens, closes]

139
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,333
[SATOSHI]
Hotaro.

140
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,583
Hey, are you on your
way to the clubroom?

141
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,000
[HOTARO]
No, too cold in there.

142
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,541
I'm gonna wait in the
library till the sleet stops,

143
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,458
or turns to snow.

144
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,000
But you are, I take it?

145
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,500
Yeah. Sure am.

146
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,291
Apparently, Ibara's stuck in
Manga Club and can't come.

147
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,916
Word travels fast.
Chitanda, right?

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,375
Well, I'll see you later.

149
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,541
[HOTARO]
Satoshi.

150
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,750
Good luck to you.

151
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,333
What on Earth
would I need luck for?

152
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,333
[ERU]
Hey, Oreki.

153
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,708
Oh. Chitanda.

154
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,000
Do you have any
idea where Fukube is?

155
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,458
He didn't show up?

156
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:57,125
No. I thought something
arose unexpectedly.

157
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,166
[HOTARO] I saw him
a half an hour ago.

158
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,708
He was on his way
to the clubroom.

159
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,958
If you say so.

160
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,875
I'll wait for him
a little bit longer.

161
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,208
Fukube's late?
Something's off.

162
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,333
[ERU]
Oreki!

163
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,000
Please wait!
Something awful's happened!

164
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,583
It finally stopped sleeting,

165
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,583
and I was just about
to head on home.

166
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,250
Sorry, you'll have
to tell me tomorrow.

167
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,083
For real?

168
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,541
I'm sorry, but you
need to hear me out.

169
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,958
This is entirely my fault.

170
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,750
I carelessly left
the room unlocked.

171
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,166
And as a result...

172
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,333
Mayaka will be devastated.

173
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,958
[HOTARO]
Satoshi.

174
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,083
What happened?

175
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,416
Well... You see...

176
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,041
[ERU]
The chocolate...

177
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,625
Mayaka's labor of love...

178
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,125
...has been stolen!

179
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,333
[sighs]

180
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,416
All right.
I'll help you find it.

181
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,750
[ERU]
Okay.

182
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,125
[HOTARO] The last thing
I wanted was to be around

183
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,541
when Ibara got the news
that her chocolate was gone.

184
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,958
She worked so hard on it,

185
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,083
and I don't have much
of a stomach for horror.

186
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,875
Ah. Oreki, wait.

187
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,708
It doesn't look like we
can use the west stairs

188
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,166
to get to the fourth floor.

189
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,958
Then let's use the
east stairs instead.

190
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,166
Oh, excuse me a second.

191
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,041
Um... Does this look level?

192
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,333
It's kind of crooked.

193
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,333
Trapezoid?

194
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,625
It dropped too much.

195
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,000
What? Hmm...

196
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,333
How did that happen?

197
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,166
[ERU]
It was sitting right here!

198
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,833
Heart-shaped,
wrapped in plastic,

199
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,500
and about this big,
or maybe a bit bigger.

200
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,833
[HOTARO]
That's pretty big.

201
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,375
[ERU] It was sitting
right there on the table

202
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,625
when I left to go
look for Fukube.

203
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,916
Right, and when did you
get back to the clubroom?

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,458
Just after five.

205
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,708
I should have locked the door,

206
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,166
but I knew that I was
only going to be gone

207
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,833
for a few minutes.

208
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:15,000
Chitanda, there's no need to
beat yourself up about this.

209
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,458
It's completely my fault
for having been so late.

210
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,083
Have you mentioned
this to Ibara yet?

211
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,375
[ERU]
No, I haven't.

212
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,375
Call me a coward,
but I can't bring myself to

213
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,666
until I've done all
that I can to find it.

214
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,416
[HOTARO] And it's
definitely not in this room.

215
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,708
[ERU]
Right.

216
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,250
Fukube and I have scoured
every corner in here

217
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,458
and all around the building.

218
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,708
[HOTARO]
Satoshi, too?

219
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,375
[SATOSHI] I ran into her
coming down the stairs,

220
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,250
so we came up
and looked together.

221
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,583
Ah, that makes sense.

222
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,958
And the Industrial Arts guy?

223
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,291
How long was he there?

224
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,541
Wait, which guy?

225
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,125
[HOTARO]
The one with the poster.

226
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,083
[ERU] You mean the boy
with the glasses?

227
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, he was already
on the stairs

228
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,416
messing with that thing
when I left the room

229
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,458
to look for Fukube.

230
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,708
[HOTARO]
Perfect.

231
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,000
If the Industrial Arts
kid was on the stairs

232
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,291
the whole time you were gone,

233
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,333
he would have seen
who came and left.

234
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,208
That's lucky!

235
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,250
Hold on.

236
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,291
Isn't it possible
that he did it?

237
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,791
That's not likely.

238
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,666
What kind of culprit lingers
near the scene of the crime,

239
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,041
casually hanging up
a poster like that?

240
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,291
Yeah, fair enough.

241
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,000
[INDUSTRIAL ARTS CLUB 21A]
People who've passed by here?

242
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,041
[ERU]
Yes.

243
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,291
Yeah, I remember.

244
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,666
There were only three.

245
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,791
Three people?

246
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,625
Well, what did they look like?!

247
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,250
Were there any
distinguishing characteristics?

248
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,750
One.

249
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,375
And two.

250
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,541
And three?

251
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,375
Mm-hmm.

252
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,416
[HOTARO] In other words, the
culprit is still lurking around

253
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,125
on the fourth floor.

254
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,375
Satoshi, what clubrooms
are located on this floor?

255
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,333
The Classic Lit Club,
Light Music Club,

256
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,958
Astronomy Club,
and the Philosophy Club.

257
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,291
But then...

258
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,083
Other than us, the Astronomy
Club is the only one

259
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,000
that hasn't gone home yet.

260
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,583
[SATOSHI]
I have to say, this is weird.

261
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,708
You're really getting
into this, huh.

262
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,750
It could start
sleeting again, you know.

263
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,250
Leave me alone.

264
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,166
We'll be able to find it,
won't we?

265
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,000
Even so, why would
anyone just steal like that?

266
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,291
[HOTARO]
That's a great question.

267
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,791
Why would they?

268
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,000
Why don't we start by exploring
all of the possibilities?

269
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,375
[knock on door]

270
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,500
[SAWAKIGUCHI]
Coming!

271
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,000
[SAWAKIGUCHI]
What? Classic Lit Club?

272
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,916
Kindly give us
back our chocolate!

273
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,000
Never mind her.

274
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,958
We just came to ask you
a question, that's all!

275
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,125
--Yeah? What?
--Well...

276
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,416
[HOTARO] It's just that someone
stole Valentine's chocolate

277
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,333
from our clubroom,
and we only came to ask

278
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,916
if you might have seen anything.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,166
Huh?

280
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,708
Sounds like we've got
ourselves a love bandit!

281
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,583
Did you see anyone
suspicious up here

282
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:36,041
between around 4:45 and 5:00?

283
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,541
Umm...

284
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,041
We were pretty much already
in the swing of things here.

285
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,125
I don't know what time,

286
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,000
but Nakayama and
Yoshihara stepped out.

287
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,583
Oda might have left,
too, but again,

288
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,041
I don't know when they did.

289
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,833
[HOTARO]
Three out of five, huh?

290
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,833
Did anyone start to pack
up their things to go home?

291
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,208
No, nobody did.

292
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,375
So that girl in the group
over there, is that Oda?

293
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,916
That's Nakayama.

294
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,958
Just so you know, Detective,

295
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,791
nobody came in this room
with any stolen chocolate!

296
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,958
Hey, guys.

297
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,375
Did any of you catch
a whiff or a glance

298
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,250
of anything chocolatey?

299
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,541
Man, nobody here got
any Valentine's sweets.

300
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,208
You don't have to rub it in!

301
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,291
I really wish that I had!

302
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,833
Turned down again?

303
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,166
[laughing]

304
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,291
There you have it.

305
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,250
Anything else
you'd like to know?

306
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,791
No, that's it.
Thank you all for your time,

307
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,041
and I truly didn't
mean any disrespect.

308
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,750
Fine. I guess I forgive you.

309
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,208
[SAWAKIGUCHI]
Okay, let's get back to it!

310
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,791
[ODA] Too late,
you're out of the game!

311
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,375
She seemed annoyed.

312
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,000
Or did I imagine that?

313
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,458
Of course she was.

314
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,291
But we have to do
everything we can

315
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,833
to get Mayaka's chocolate back!

316
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,166
Hotaro...

317
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,375
[HOTARO] For now, I think we
should just go back

318
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,541
to the clubroom.

319
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,166
We'll plan our next step there.

320
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,541
[HOTARO] Is there any way
to get to the fourth floor

321
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,125
besides the stairway?

322
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,166
Unless you count climbing
the outside walls,

323
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,666
just the stairs that were
closed and being waxed,

324
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,875
but there was no sign
that they were used.

325
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,375
Okay.

326
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,583
Come to think of it, we didn't
check the girls' restroom.

327
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,916
[ERU]
I'll go check now!

328
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,833
Do you really think it
could be in the bathroom?

329
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,583
The odds are about
one in a million.

330
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,041
So you're saying
there's a chance?

331
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,375
Satoshi!

332
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,500
I have a good idea
of what happened.

333
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,125
Just keep your mouth shut.

334
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,708
Okay.

335
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,916
It wasn't in there, either.

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,166
Well, that leaves
one more option.

337
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,083
[MAYAKA]
Huh?

338
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,041
What are you guys
doing in here?

339
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,208
--Listen. Mayaka--[gasps]
--[MAYAKA] What did you think?

340
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,875
How was it?
My homemade chocolate?

341
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,750
[HOTARO]
She wasted no time.

342
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,833
--Ibara--
--I'm so sorry, Mayaka.

343
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,750
I left the room for a few
minutes to look for Fukube.

344
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,916
and someone stole the
chocolate while I was gone.

345
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,500
I feel terrible!

346
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,375
Really? So someone stole it?

347
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,916
Mayaka. I apologize.

348
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,333
Please don't feel bad.

349
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,583
You have no reason to
be sorry, Chi, seriously.

350
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,250
Although, it is unfortunate.

351
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,875
I'm going home now.

352
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,000
For real,
don't let it bother you.

353
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,458
Please step aside.

354
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,416
Where are you going?

355
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,958
I will find that
chocolate even if

356
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,416
I have to resort to
desperate measures.

357
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,208
If I don't, there's no way
I can show my sorry face

358
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,791
to Mayaka tomorrow.

359
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,958
[HOTARO] This isn't
your fault, you know.

360
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,750
You're wrong, and I
can't forgive myself

361
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,250
for what happened!

362
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,708
Today was supposed to be
a happy day for Mayaka.

363
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,166
She deserved that!

364
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,583
[HOTARO] I can't say I
identify with how you feel.

365
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,333
I'm not as sensitive
to others as you are.

366
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,416
But please just
let me handle this.

367
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,125
There are a few things
I need to check out,

368
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,416
and I can't do that
with you around.

369
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,375
Do you have a suspect?

370
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,916
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

371
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,166
Nakayama, from
the Astronomy Club.

372
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,625
[HOTARO] Ibara's chocolate was
a pretty decent size, right?

373
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,333
So it couldn't be hidden
under a guy's uniform.

374
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,791
You could try to conceal it,

375
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,916
but it would make your
movements awkward.

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,583
It would be easier with
the girls' sailor uniform.

377
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:40,416
If you strapped it to your leg,
the skirt would hide it easily.

378
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,083
I promise I'll get
Ibara's chocolate

379
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,375
to Satoshi by
the end of the day.

380
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,041
Let me take over from here.

381
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,000
You just go home and relax.

382
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,291
Okay, I will.

383
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,166
I'm trusting you
with this, Oreki.

384
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,791
Should we get going?

385
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,375
Sure.

386
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,500
[HOTARO] Satoshi. Let me
see your drawstring bag.

387
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,833
[HOTARO] I am now giving
Ibara's chocolate to you.

388
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,166
This fulfills the promise
I made to Chitanda.

389
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,458
[HOTARO] I did know
who took the chocolate.

390
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,166
It was Satoshi.

391
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,250
Excellent work, Hotaro.

392
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,541
[HOTARO] The moment I heard the
chocolate had been "stolen,"

393
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,541
I suspected that Satoshi had
taken it from the clubroom.

394
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,583
My suspicions were confirmed

395
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,833
when we talked to
the boy on the stairs.

396
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,458
Satoshi said,
"it dropped too much."

397
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,041
Unless he had told the kid to
drop it at some point earlier,

398
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,958
he wouldn't have
responded that way.

399
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,166
Satoshi probably waited
in the boy's restroom

400
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,041
on the third floor for
Chitanda to pass by.

401
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,708
Then he got the chocolate
from the clubroom.

402
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,083
But it was bigger
than he expected.

403
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,291
It wouldn't fit in his
bag in one piece,

404
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,541
and there wasn't
a large enough bag

405
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,125
anywhere in the room.

406
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,041
If he didn't hide it, and
happened to bump into Chitanda,

407
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,708
he'd have been caught.

408
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,250
Which meant his only
option was clear.

409
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,000
You didn't even think twice
about breaking it in half.

410
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I guess this means we're even.

411
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,416
Even?

412
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,666
Yeah, last April.

413
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,000
You invented that story
about the Spider Society

414
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,000
so I could escape Chitanda.

415
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,791
Ah, you're right.
I had forgotten about that,

416
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,416
but no one was hurt
in the process there.

417
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,958
Except for you, that is.

418
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,583
Well, are you at least gonna
tell me exactly why you did it?

419
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,875
And don't even try to
say that it was just a joke.

420
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,000
What if it was?

421
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,541
[SATOSHI grunts]

422
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,291
Then I'd have to
teach you a lesson.

423
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,958
For Chitanda and Ibara.
By force.

424
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,333
Well, I don't
want to get beat up.

425
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,750
I'd rather not say. Still...

426
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,416
I guess I'm gonna have to tell
you one way or another.

427
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,208
Hotaro, be honest, now.

428
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,791
Do I strike you as
the compulsive type?

429
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,958
I think you fixate
on your interests.

430
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,625
That's where
you're wrong, though.

431
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,666
People like that will
actually apply themselves

432
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,041
and not let others beat them

433
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,291
when they are truly passionate
about what they do.

434
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,791
And you're different somehow?

435
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,041
I am.

436
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,833
I'm never going to be
the best at anything,

437
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,750
but to be more specific,
I've given up any chance of it.

438
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,166
I'm no longer trying
to be the best.

439
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,666
You sensed something had
changed at the arcade, right?

440
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,541
I wasn't the way I used to be?

441
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,250
I wasn't obsessed
with winning anymore?

442
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,833
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

443
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,833
[SATOSHI] The old me wanted to
win just for the sake of glory,

444
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,958
and I was a lot
fussier in general.

445
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,041
It stopped being fun
for me, you know?

446
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,333
Caring so much about the
prize took the joy out of it,

447
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,500
even when I did win.

448
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,083
I couldn't handle that.

449
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,541
If you don't have fun when you
win, what's the point of it all?

450
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,208
So one day I just
decided to let go.

451
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,791
I chose to be particular
about not being particular.

452
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,583
Once that changed,
I could enjoy life again.

453
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,708
I can have a good time now.

454
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,541
But there was one little
problem with my plan.

455
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,708
Mayaka.

456
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,833
Mayaka is awesome. Really.

457
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,750
There's truly
no one else like her,

458
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,125
and the fact that she likes
me and wants to be with me

459
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,125
is nothing short of
a dream come true.

460
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,000
What, then?

461
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,291
That's the rub.

462
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,541
How can that be okay?
To be so obsessed with her?

463
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,375
[SATOSHI] I want to be with her,
there's no question about that.

464
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,458
But I don't want
to fixate on her.

465
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,083
It's all about what I want.

466
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,291
I don't even consider
how Mayaka feels.

467
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,625
[chuckles] I know that
sounds self-centered,

468
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:16,500
but I don't want to take
Mayaka for granted, either.

469
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,583
Besides, if I let go
of my new philosophy

470
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,375
and give in to my
feelings for Mayaka,

471
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:24,208
I take the chance that I'll
revert back to my old ways.

472
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,416
I'm terrified by that prospect.

473
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,541
That's why you didn't
accept the chocolate?

474
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,791
Exactly. It's been a year.

475
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:35,416
And I still haven't figured
out a real solution.

476
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,750
This was the only
way I could try

477
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,708
to avoid accepting a gift
that I couldn't receive.

478
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,250
But you also hurt Chitanda
in the process.

479
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:48,583
Things don't work for me
the same way they do for you.

480
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:51,750
I didn't think about Chitanda
when I dreamt all this up.

481
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,958
[ERU]
Mayaka!

482
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:55,916
Please, wait a sec!

483
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,375
[MAYAKA]
Hey, Chi.

484
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,083
--[ERU] Look.
--[MAYAKA] I'm sorry!

485
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,916
I actually know who stole
the chocolate, already, okay?

486
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,583
What?

487
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,250
The truth is, last year,

488
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:09,291
I told Fuku I'd wait till this
Valentine's Day for his answer.

489
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,250
This whole thing
was just to test him.

490
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,916
Then the chocolate...?

491
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,583
[MAYAKA] I'm pretty sure that
he's the one who stole it.

492
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:22,000
Huh... That's what happened.

493
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,083
I feel really terrible that
you went to so much trouble.

494
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,708
I'm sorry I tricked you.

495
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,125
No.

496
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,791
I am the one who blew everything
way out of proportion

497
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,500
in the first place.

498
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,666
So...

499
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,958
That means when Oreki
said that the girl

500
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,083
from the Astronomy
Club stole it...

501
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,541
[MAYAKA]
I think that he was just telling

502
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,541
a white lie to cover for Fuku.

503
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,083
[ERU]
That makes sense.

504
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,833
But that's so mean of Fukube

505
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,583
to play along like
he didn't do it!

506
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,666
You think so, too?

507
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,666
I do!

508
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,583
It's just appalling!

509
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,833
But not as appalling
as me still liking Fuku

510
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,083
after everything
he has done to me!

511
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,458
That's it, Chi.
We deserve some cake right now!

512
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,583
We do!

513
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,375
[SATOSHI]
Well, Hotaro...

514
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,791
Now you've heard
everything that I have to say.

515
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,875
So?

516
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:11,250
This is probably not something
we should share with Chitanda.

517
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,291
No way.

518
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,958
I really don't
wanna get beat up.

519
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,208
That said...

520
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,375
What are you going to tell her?

521
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,458
When will you give
Ibara an answer?

522
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,708
[SATOSHI] I think my
answer will come very soon.

523
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:26,958
[HOTARO]
That's good.

524
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:36,125
[HOTARO] For all your
deftness, you're still clumsy.

525
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:43,791
[HOTARO] "Sorry. I now see I
don't know anything about you."

526
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:47,041
That's what I thought, but I
couldn't bring myself to say it.

527
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,083
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

528
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,833
I ended up getting the chocolate
back safely to Satoshi.

529
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:56,583
Did you really?
That's such a relief.

530
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:57,625
[HOTARO]
Good.

531
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,166
So don't give it
too much thought.

532
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,375
[ERU]
Oreki...

533
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,791
I want to thank you
for everything you did

534
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,250
to help today.

535
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,750
Sure.

536
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,000
[SATOSHI]
Hello, Mayaka? It's me.

537
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,250
Listen, I really need
to talk to you.

538
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,708
[HOTARO]
Bitter.

539
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,333
[HOTARO] Next time: "The Doll
That Took the Long Way Around."
