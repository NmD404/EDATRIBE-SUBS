1
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,708
[SATOSHI]
If what you suspect is true,

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,750
it means that our
Kanyasai came at the cost

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,625
of somebody's
high school career.

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,916
That's pretty major.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,250
You surprised me, you know.

6
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,333
How'd I do that?

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,791
I wouldn't expect
you to put effort

8
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,250
into solving a
mystery like this.

9
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,333
Yeah, I didn't
expect it either.

10
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,250
[SATOSHI] Funny thing is,
it's not even the first mystery

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,375
you've solved since
high school started.

12
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,208
And I think I know why you're
going to all this trouble.

13
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,666
It's for Chitanda.

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,541
[HOTARO]
It's her fault, all right.

15
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,875
Put it how you want.
You do this stuff 'cause of her.

16
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,041
I mean, you could've
bailed on us today.

17
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,208
The responsibility for
unraveling that mystery

18
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,000
was split between
the four of us.

19
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,166
If you'd said "I've got no
clue" and left it at that,

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,041
I doubt anyone
would've blamed you.

21
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,583
Instead, you locked
yourself in the bathroom

22
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,583
until you could come up
with an answer.

23
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,541
Why do something like that
if not to help Chitanda?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,166
Couldn't tell you.

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,041
Maybe I'm just tired of
my little black cloud.

26
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,041
[sighs] I don't know
anyone in this world

27
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,125
less energy efficient
than Chitanda.

28
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,125
Being a club president,
taking midterms,

29
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:21,083
writing an anthology,
solving riddles from the past?

30
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,666
I'm surprised
she isn't exhausted.

31
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,125
Same thing goes
for you and Ibara.

32
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,291
All of you just do
so much, you know?

33
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,291
It seems wasteful.

34
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,875
Yeah. To you, maybe.

35
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,375
The thing is...

36
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,416
I'm starting to wonder if you
might have the right idea.

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Sometimes when I watch you guys,
it makes me feel restless.

38
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,166
And I don't like that feeling.

39
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,541
I mean...
All I wanna do is relax.

40
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,000
Except relaxing's begun
to feel boring lately.

41
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,708
So I thought, why not?

42
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,291
I'll give it a try.

43
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,875
I'll really get
invested in something,

44
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,541
the way you guys do.

45
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,666
Maybe it'll make
for a nice change.

46
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,875
[HOTARO]
Well, say something!

47
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,958
[SATOSHI]
Hotaro...

48
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,875
Are you starting to see
that living a sunny life

49
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,625
isn't so bad after all?

50
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,500
Yeah, maybe.

51
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:59,000
A sunny life. Huh.


52
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:03,041
At the end of the day,
is that really what I want?

53
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,958
I don't know.

54
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,250
Chitanda's search
for the truth...

55
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,333
Jun Sekitani's battle
for the Kanyasai...

56
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,791
Am I cut out for
that kinda thing?

57
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,916
Is that the type
of person I want to be?

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,458
I don't know.

59
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,000
What does it even mean
to have a sunny life?

60
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,291
I don't know.

61
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,250
[HOTARO] Then there's my sister,
the queen of sunshine.

62
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,541
[HOTARO]
"This has been a lot of fun,

63
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,333
and I know I'll look back in
10 years and be glad I did it."

64
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,041
[HOTARO]
Ten years from now,

65
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,208
how will I feel when
I look back at my life?

66
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,583
Jun Sekitani wouldn't
have any regrets. But me?

67
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,916
[phone ringing]

68
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,375
[HOTARO]
Hello, Oreki residence.

69
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,041
[TOMOE]
Hotaro? That you?

70
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey, sis, you're
still alive, huh?

71
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,916
[TOMOE]
Don't underestimate me!

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,666
You think I can't survive
a mugging or two?

73
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,208
So that's the kind of trouble
you're getting yourself into.

74
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,458
[TOMOE] I just reached
Pristina yesterday.

75
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,541
Nothing in particular to report.

76
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,500
I'll send another letter that
way once I get to Sarajevo.

77
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,625
How are things on your end?

78
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,708
[HOTARO] We're working on
the anthology. <i>Hyouka</i> .

79
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,458
[TOMOE]
Oh, yeah? Good!

80
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,666
[HOTARO] We've been
looking into Jun Sekitani.

81
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,250
[TOMOE]
Jun Sekitani?

82
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,125
There's a name
that takes me back!

83
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,416
So his story is
still going around.

84
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,458
Is "Kanyasai" still off-limits?

85
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,958
Sorry, what'd you say?

86
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,541
[TOMOE] What a tragedy, huh?
The poor kid.

87
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,250
Wait. Off-limits?
Tragedy? The poor kid?

88
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,916
Hold on a sec, I'm
talking about Jun Sekitani.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,500
[TOMOE]
Yeah, so am I.

90
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,083
The so-called
kindhearted hero, right?

91
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,750
That's who you mean, isn't it?

92
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,916
Well... I'm not
so sure anymore.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,250
What else can you tell me
about Jun Sekitani?

94
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,583
[TOMOE]
Nothing right now. I gotta go!

95
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,791
[HOTARO]
Hey! Wait!

96
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,666
So not cool, Tomoe!

97
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,750
[grunts]

98
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,250
[HOTARO]
I've still got work to do.

99
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:09,083
I presented my theory
to the others, but...

100
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,333
It's either incorrect,
or incomplete.

101
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,000
If he's still alive,
does Jun Sekitani

102
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,208
have any regrets about
his time in high school?

103
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,541
I wouldn't have thought
there'd be any reason to.

104
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,833
He was a hero.

105
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,625
He left school as a
martyr for what he thought

106
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,750
was a noble cause.

107
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,666
He was totally happy
to fall on his sword.

108
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,458
Or at least that's
how I imagined it.

109
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,208
But is that really
how it happened?

110
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,250
To be kicked out of
school over a festival

111
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,166
and have a whole phase
of his life altered?

112
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,833
High school's all
sunshine and roses.

113
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,916
But having your high-school
experience cut short

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,916
because you and your friends
wanted a longer festival?

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,541
That doesn't exactly
sound sunny or rosy to me.

116
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,375
We're missing something.

117
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,458
How many people could
sacrifice everything

118
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,833
and not feel a bit of
resentment or regret?

119
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,250
What's more,
sis called it a tragedy.

120
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,166
She felt sorry for him.

121
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,458
Was Jun Sekitani's high school
life really all that sunny?

122
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,708
[HOTARO]
I've gotta figure this out.

123
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,250
[MAYAKA]
Oh, hey, Fuku.

124
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,708
[SATOSHI]
Hey...

125
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,041
So you got marching orders
from Hotaro too, I take it?

126
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,291
[MAYAKA] Mm-hmm. We all have
to meet up in the clubroom

127
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,958
to talk about something.

128
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,833
[SATOSHI] I can't believe he's
actually calling a meeting.

129
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,416
I guess this means that,
somewhere, pigs are flying.

130
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,916
[MAYAKA]
I hope it doesn't take long.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,041
I'm busy with Manga Club.

132
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,375
Oh, hey you two.

133
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,000
Thank you again for
your help yesterday.

134
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,500
[MAYAKA] Sure.
Honestly, it was kinda fun.

135
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,458
[SATOSHI]
So... No sign of Hotaro?

136
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,916
Not yet.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,250
Here's the man himself.

138
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,708
[HOTARO]
You all made it.

139
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,416
What did you wanna talk about?

140
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,583
[HOTARO] It's the whole
Jun Sekitani thing.

141
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,208
I don't think we've
completely settled it all yet.

142
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,666
What? Are you kidding me?

143
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,333
So, Oreki. What's up?

144
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,666
I don't really think you would
call a meeting like this

145
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,833
unless something
important was going on.

146
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,833
It's all right.

147
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,958
There are some
gaps in the story,

148
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,833
but I think we can fill them in.

149
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,416
Great!

150
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,791
Well, let's get on with this.

151
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,250
What do you mean by "gaps"?

152
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,666
By gaps I mean gaps.

153
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,625
There are still a few
tiny holes in our theory

154
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,541
about Chitanda's uncle,
and I'm trying to close them.

155
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,916
[SATOSHI]
Hold on.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,166
Are you suggesting that
your theory was incomplete?

157
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,500
I don't know.

158
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,208
I mean either we went off
in the wrong direction

159
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,041
or we didn't go far enough.

160
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,833
You don't know?

161
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,041
You called us in
to say you don't know?

162
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,000
--Seriously?
--Just listen.

163
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,375
I think we should've
given more weight

164
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,333
to what it said in <i>Hyouka</i> .

165
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,791
It clearly states
in the foreword

166
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,416
that Jun Sekitani's story
is in no way a heroic tale.

167
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,291
We read that but excluded
it from our deliberations.

168
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,125
Because it seemed like
it was just an opinion

169
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,583
and not a fact.

170
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,125
Yeah, but I think maybe we
shouldn't have excluded it.

171
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,208
It's a little late for th--

172
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,458
Look at this. What does it say?

173
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,083
"The struggles
that were endured.

174
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,791
The sacrifices that were made."

175
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,791
Does it really
mean "sacrifices"?

176
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,000
It can also be read
as "offerings," right?

177
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,083
Except "offerings"
is spelled differently.

178
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,875
It starts with the
character for "alive."

179
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,083
No. It can be read as either
"sacrifice" or "offering."

180
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,375
Originally the two
meant the same thing.

181
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,541
There you go.

182
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,750
Our resident academic
genius has spoken.

183
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,625
[SATOSHI] Okay, great, so it
could mean one of two things.

184
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,500
But only the person who
wrote it knows for sure

185
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,708
which one it is.

186
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,958
The best that we're
going to be able to do

187
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,583
is make an educated guess.

188
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,000
Not true.
We can go to the source.

189
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,291
Wait, "the source"?

190
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,250
[HOTARO] The person
who wrote the foreword.

191
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,750
Yoko Koriyama.

192
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,208
Forty-five years ago she was
a first-year in high school,

193
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,291
so today she'd be around 60.

194
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,583
You looked for her, then?

195
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,833
Where is she?

196
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,250
A lot closer than you
would probably think.

197
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,166
Right, library assistant?

198
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,166
No way! Seriously?

199
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,750
Yep.

200
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,625
Seriously what?

201
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,375
Would you please just tell us?

202
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,166
It's our librarian.

203
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,250
That's who you mean, right?

204
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,083
She's Yoko Itoigawa,

205
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,416
but she used to be
Yoko Koriyama.

206
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,750
[HOTARO]
That's right.

207
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,916
She has a unique way
of spelling her first name.

208
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,416
And she looks around 60,
which is just about how old

209
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,041
the foreword's author
would be at this point.

210
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,500
And let's not forget
how she reacted

211
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,833
when she found out we were
in the Classic Lit Club.

212
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,250
Wow, you are
freaky good at this.

213
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,083
I mean, I've been working
with her this whole time

214
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,666
and the name thing never
even occurred to me.

215
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,916
Really. You should donate your
brain to science or something.

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,083
Like I've said before,
I'm not doing anything special.

217
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,541
It's just luck, that's all.

218
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,041
So nobody needs to go poking
around in my brain, okay?

219
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,458
Okay, so then...

220
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,875
If we go and ask Miss
Itoigawa about all of this...

221
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,333
We'll find out what
happened 45 years ago.

222
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,625
Why it was in no way
a heroic tale.

223
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,791
Why the picture on the
anthology cover is what it is.

224
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,041
Why they chose
the name <i>Hyouka</i> .

225
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,791
And also, what really
happened to your uncle.

226
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,625
Sure, it's possible
that Miss Itoigawa

227
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,250
is who we're looking for,
but do you have any solid proof?

228
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,625
Of course I do.

229
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,416
In fact,
I've confirmed it already.

230
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,666
What, with her?

231
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,291
Yeah. She said that when
she was a second-year,

232
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,666
she was the club president.

233
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,333
I set up an appointment
so we could all talk to her.

234
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,791
Actually, it's
almost time for it.

235
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,125
We should probably start
heading to the library.

236
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,666
Just admit it. You're pumped!

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,125
Maybe I am.

238
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,416
Hi, Miss Itoigawa!

239
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,750
Hi there, Classic Lit Club.

240
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,541
I still have a bit
of shelving to get done.

241
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,916
You don't mind if we
talk out here, do you?

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,958
No problem. I'll help you.

243
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,583
[ITOIGAWA]
Thank you, Ibara.

244
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,916
Now, then, you said
there was something

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,333
you wanted to ask me about.

246
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,583
Yes.

247
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,041
But before we go any further,
Miss Itoigawa,

248
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,458
could you do me
a favor and confirm

249
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,500
for my fellow club members
here that your maiden name

250
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,541
is, in fact, Yoko Koriyama?

251
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,958
Yes.

252
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,750
[HOTARO] So... You're the
one who wrote this, then?

253
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,916
Why, yes, I did write it.

254
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,416
A long time ago.

255
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,333
I'm surprised to see it
unearthed like this.

256
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:21,583
I think I might know what
it is you want to ask me.

257
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,041
Unless I'm mistaken,

258
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,166
you're curious about the
protests that occurred

259
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,708
45 years ago.

260
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,250
[HOTARO] I was right.
She's got the info we need.

261
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,500
[ITOIGAWA]
But what I don't understand

262
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,208
is why anyone is
asking about it now.

263
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,291
I thought everyone would
have forgotten about it

264
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,208
by this point.

265
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,541
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

266
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,791
If Chitanda wasn't such
a crazy curiosity monkey,

267
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,875
I seriously doubt that
we'd all be here asking you

268
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,166
about it right now.

269
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,041
A crazy curiosity monkey?

270
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,166
[HOTARO]
Sorry. I meant curiosity junkie.

271
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,250
[ERU]
Either way, Oreki,

272
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,375
that's not very nice.

273
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,125
Well, whatever the case may be,

274
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:57,291
why are you kids so interested
in what happened back then?

275
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,250
Because Jun Sekitani...

276
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,166
You see ma'am, he's my uncle.

277
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,041
[ITOIGAWA]
Oh, really, your uncle, huh?

278
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,125
Jun Sekitani. That name
brings back memories.

279
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,458
How is he doing these days?

280
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,708
[ERU]
I don't know.

281
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,000
He left for India,
and then he went missing.

282
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,208
I'm sorry to hear that.

283
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,916
You know, I'd always
hoped I'd be able

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,750
to see him again someday.

285
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, me too.

286
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,875
I would like to see him
again so very much.

287
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,958
[ERU] Miss Itoigawa...
Will you please tell us?

288
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,416
Just what happened here
all those years ago?

289
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,041
Why was the story involving
my uncle not a heroic one?

290
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,958
Why is the club's
anthology called <i>Hyouka</i> ?

291
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,875
How much of Oreki's theory
about the protest is correct?

292
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,916
I'm sorry, Oreki's theory?

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
What exactly does that mean?

294
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,708
[SATOSHI]
Well, you see...

295
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,416
Oreki pieced together
some information

296
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,666
and came up with a possible
outline of what went down

297
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,875
during the protest
all those years ago.

298
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,458
I'm sure he'll
tell you all about it

299
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,083
if you don't mind listening.

300
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,333
[ITOIGAWA]
Sure.

301
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,583
Why don't we talk about
this more in my office?

302
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,041
[ITOIGAWA]
Very interesting.

303
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,083
And that's why you assume
his expulsion was delayed

304
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,583
until October; they wanted
to let the tension die down?

305
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,708
Yes, that's my
conjecture anyway.

306
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,125
And you put
together this theory

307
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,625
from nothing more than
the material you have here?

308
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,458
Everyone else did the real work.
I just summarized it.

309
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,250
[SATOSHI laughs]

310
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,083
Well, I'm truly astounded.

311
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,416
[HOTARO]
Am I way off base?

312
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,083
[ITOIGAWA] No! It's like
you witnessed it yourself.

313
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:35,583
What you describe is almost
exactly how it happened.

314
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,583
I'm not sure what more
I can tell you about it,

315
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,083
to be honest.

316
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,500
Well, um...

317
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,041
Hotaro seems to think that
something about his theory

318
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,750
is either wrong or incomplete.

319
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,041
There's just one thing
I'm not totally sure about.

320
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,041
Did Jun Sekitani willingly take
the hit for the other students

321
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,833
who were involved?

322
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,166
Did he make a brave stand,
holding his head high

323
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,666
as he knowingly sacrificed
his whole high school career

324
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:04,583
for the greater good
of the protest movement?

325
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,291
Quite impressive.

326
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,416
You see right
through things, eh?

327
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,208
Well...

328
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,000
It was a very long time ago now,

329
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,833
but I still remember
it so clearly.

330
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,000
The high school cultural
festival was a very big deal.

331
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,791
For a lot of kids, it seemed
like the only purpose in life.

332
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,125
In those years, it was
almost as if students

333
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,708
were channeling the
nation's restless energy

334
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,541
and using the festival as
an outlet for self-expression.

335
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,291
But the year I started school,

336
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,000
that restless energy
became more agitated,

337
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,250
and we found ourselves at
the edge of a full-blown riot.

338
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,791
That year the principal
dropped a bombshell, saying:

339
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,750
"We can't content ourselves
with being a small-time school

340
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,375
in a sleepy little town."

341
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,916
Everyone was afraid that
meant the cultural festival

342
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,166
would be abolished.

343
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,333
It wasn't, but the
principal did inform us

344
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,583
that the festival would
last for only two days,

345
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,125
rather than the normal five.

346
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,875
That announcement triggered
an unprecedented uproar.

347
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,750
The whole school was on edge.

348
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,125
People hung banners
and made speeches.

349
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,625
They cried out about
injustice and autonomy,

350
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,375
hoping to bend the
administration to their will.

351
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,041
Sounds like they
were very committed.

352
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,125
Yeah!

353
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,166
Those kids weren't
afraid to stand up

354
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,750
for what they
really cared about.

355
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,958
[ITOIGAWA chuckles]

356
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,208
Honestly, it wasn't
as noble as all that.

357
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,958
I'd say it was more like
someone had threatened

358
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,166
to take away our toys,

359
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,375
so we were throwing
a tantrum about it.

360
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,583
[MAYAKA]
Really?

361
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,791
[ITOIGAWA]
Yes.

362
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,833
That's how it seems,
looking back on it now.

363
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,916
At any rate, we formed
a sort of coalition

364
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,833
to protest the shortening
of the cultural festival.

365
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,708
Nobody wanted to be
the official leader.

366
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,875
Pathetic as it sounds,

367
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,250
we were all too afraid
of being punished.

368
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,708
Jun Sekitani drew
the short straw.

369
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,666
He wound up as the scapegoat
for the whole movement.

370
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,625
Somebody else was
actually running the show

371
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,875
behind the scenes.

372
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,083
But he never made
his name public.

373
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,583
The administration would
give in to us eventually,

374
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,083
but we didn't know that.

375
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,458
We'd whipped ourselves
into a self-righteous frenzy

376
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,041
as only the young can.

377
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,416
And in the end, we went too far.

378
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,833
In addition to all
the rallies and speeches,

379
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,916
students were
boycotting classes.

380
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,333
And then, as part of a
demonstration one night,

381
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,166
we built a bonfire to
show how serious we were.

382
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,375
That's when it happened.

383
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,000
The fire spread to the
combat sports building.

384
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:33,250
Despite firefighting efforts,
it was partially destroyed.

385
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,583
At that point,

386
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,583
the school couldn't
possibly look the other way.

387
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,333
Rather than involve the police,

388
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,750
they conducted their
own investigation.

389
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,666
Since almost all the
students were involved

390
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,083
with the movement, they couldn't
very well punish everyone.

391
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,208
Instead, they settled
for making an example

392
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,625
of the movement's nominal
leader, Jun Sekitani.

393
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:56,333
Eventually, he was found guilty
and expelled from the school.

394
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,375
The rest of us did nothing.

395
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,041
We just sat back and
watched as it happened.

396
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,708
But, despite our cowardice,

397
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,541
Sekitani never
broke his silence.

398
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,750
That's what you wanted
to know about, right?

399
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,000
Whether he volunteered
himself as a sacrifice

400
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,666
for the other students?

401
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,708
I assume that answers the
question for you, then.

402
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,000
The years passed,
and sure enough,

403
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,291
the cultural festival
was shortened anyway,

404
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,500
a little bit at a time.

405
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,333
Now it only lasts
for three days.

406
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,833
Well, that's the
end of my story,

407
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,291
unless you have
any other questions

408
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,041
that you'd like to ask me.

409
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,125
I have one.

410
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,791
The drawing on the
anthology's cover

411
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,500
is supposed to symbolize
what happened, right?

412
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,000
The dog is the school.

413
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,750
The rabbits are the students.

414
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,833
And the rabbit fighting
the dog is Jun Sekitani.

415
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,375
The combat sports
building is by far

416
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,208
the oldest facility
we have at Kami High.

417
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,208
Is that because it
was rebuilt back then?

418
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,416
[ITOIGAWA]
That's right.

419
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,791
So 20 years ago when
the rest of the school

420
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,250
was remodeled, that building
was still new enough

421
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,375
that it didn't need to be
fixed up like the others.

422
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,250
You know,
I've noticed something.

423
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,833
Most people call the
cultural festival Kanyasai,

424
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,458
but you don't.

425
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,666
I was wondering...

426
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,125
The way "Kanya" is
written in "Kanyasai"...

427
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,250
Does it stand for "Sekitani"
instead of "Kamiyama"?

428
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,625
I don't understand
what you're saying.

429
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,791
The origin of
the term Kanyasai.

430
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,416
They took "Sekitani-sai"
and switched the reading

431
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,458
to make it "Kanyasai"
to honor Jun.

432
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,708
Oh.

433
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,875
Except calling it
that's kind of misleading,

434
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,375
since Jun Sekitani was
really more of a victim

435
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,500
than a hero.

436
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,041
Something tells me
if people knew that,

437
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:46,083
they probably wouldn't
even use the term Kanyasai.

438
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,416
So is that really true?

439
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,583
[ITOIGAWA]
Yes.

440
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,291
As a matter of fact,
we banned that name

441
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,083
in the Classic Lit Club.

442
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,166
And the title?

443
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,333
Do you have any idea why
my uncle chose <i>Hyouka</i>

444
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,791
to be the title of
the club's anthology?

445
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,083
We're still missing
that piece of the puzzle.

446
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,250
I don't know.

447
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,375
Sekitani could sense he
was going to be expelled,

448
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,541
and he was uncharacteristically
intent on using that title,

449
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,416
so how could we argue?

450
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,333
He said that it was the
only thing left he could do.

451
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,583
I'm sorry, but...

452
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,583
If it does mean something,
I don't know what.

453
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,791
You really don't know?

454
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,958
[HOTARO]
How is that even possible?

455
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,791
Nobody ever figured it out?

456
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,875
I mean...
The message was obvious.

457
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,666
Wanna tell us
what you're thinking?

458
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,458
[HOTARO] The story we
just heard makes it clear

459
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,583
what the anthology's
title means.

460
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,375
<i>Hyouka</i> is wordplay,
plain and simple.

461
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,875
It's wordplay?

462
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,208
[HOTARO] Jun Sekitani wanted
to leave an enduring message

463
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,583
about what happened to him,

464
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,666
something that would resonate
for decades to come.

465
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,500
So he put it right there
in the title of the anthology.

466
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,250
[ERU]
I still don't get it.

467
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,875
If you know what <i>Hyouka</i> means,
will you please just tell us?

468
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,666
Yeah, out with it already!

469
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,333
[SATOSHI]
Come on, Hotaro.

470
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,250
Uh, Hotaro?

471
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,208
How do you translate
<i>Hyouka</i> into English?

472
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,833
I think it's "ice cream."
Isn't it?

473
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,625
Ice cream? Okay.

474
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,416
That's not much of
a message, though.

475
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,833
[HOTARO] Like I said
before, it's wordplay.

476
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:28,541
Hey. You guys... I don't...

477
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,791
[HOTARO]
This is it.

478
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,416
The real statement that
Jun Sekitani was making.

479
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:04,875
Yes. I remember now.

480
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,500
I went to my uncle, and asked

481
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,333
if he'd tell me
what Hyouka meant.

482
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,583
He told me.

483
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,916
And then he also said...

484
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Right.

485
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,250
He said that I had to be strong.

486
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,750
And that if I was ever
weak, if someday...

487
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,541
Yes. If a day ever came
when I couldn't even scream...

488
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,666
If that day came... Then...

489
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,375
I would be eaten alive.

490
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,916
[ERU] And that's why
I started to cry.

491
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,750
I was terrified of
being eaten alive.

492
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,333
[ERU] I remember.
Finally, I remember!

493
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,583
Now... I can let my uncle go.

494
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,791
And it's all
thanks to you, Oreki.

495
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,708
Thank you so very much.
I mean it!

496
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,291
Yeah, well...

497
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,791
It was just luck.

498
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,625
Okay. If you say so.

499
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,875
Just luck.

500
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:24,375
Ice cream. I scream.

501
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:27,041
It all depends on
how you say it, huh?

502
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,666
[MAYAKA]
Okay.

503
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,000
I drew up an outline
and a schedule

504
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,541
for writing the anthology.

505
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,041
Wow, thanks for putting
all this together, Mayaka!

506
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,708
It's an incredible outline!

507
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,375
Oh. Uh, is it?

508
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,708
Absolutely!

509
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,291
Where'd you learn to make
a storyboard like this?

510
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,166
[laughs] Just something
I picked up, I guess.

511
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,500
Wait a sec.

512
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,333
I've got a question
about this special feature.

513
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,625
The one you call "The Case
of the Kindhearted Hero:

514
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,833
The Truth that was Hidden
for Forty-Five years."

515
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,083
What's wrong?

516
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,291
How did I end up being
in charge of writing it?

517
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,416
Come on, Oreki,

518
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,708
you're the one who
solved the mystery.

519
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,708
It only makes sense.

520
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,708
It's the longest story
in the whole thing.

521
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,125
Of course it is.

522
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,625
It's the anthology's
featured article.

523
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,791
I know it's a
big responsibility.

524
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,583
If you'd prefer, I can try
to take it on myself, instead.

525
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:17,666
Yeah. That sounds grea--

526
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,041
[MAYAKA]
No, don't do it, Chi!

527
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,416
We've got to put Mr.
Lazy Bones to work somehow,

528
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,041
and this is our best chance.

529
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,958
[laughs]
Yeah, right.

530
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,250
We don't want him
getting complacent.

531
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,375
Don't waste time
complaining, Oreki.

532
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,208
Just get to work
on your outline.

533
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:33,875
Now, Fuku, about the article
you'll be writing...

534
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,666
[ERU]
You know, I'm kind of surprised.

535
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,916
[HOTARO]
About what?

536
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,291
[ERU] That you accepted
the anthology assignment

537
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,500
Mayaka gave you.

538
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,958
Can you really
call it "accepting"

539
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:47,250
if somebody forces
you to do something?

540
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,708
[HOTARO]
Well...

541
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:53,375
I guess Jun Sekitani would know
all about that, wouldn't he?

542
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,666
[HOTARO] Y'know...
You surprised me, too.

543
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,750
[ERU]
How?

544
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,958
[HOTARO]
When this whole thing started,

545
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,583
I suggested that you
ask Satoshi and Ibara

546
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,958
to help you out with it.

547
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,041
You didn't seem to like
the idea much at first,

548
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,916
so what made you change
your mind about it?

549
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,375
[ERU]
It's hard to explain.

550
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,333
I'm sure it had something to do
with what you said to me before.

551
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,125
About how we would
probably need help

552
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,583
if we were going
to solve the mystery

553
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,583
before my uncle's funeral.

554
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:17,750
I know it's possible
that 10 years from now,

555
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:20,166
I won't care so
much about all this.

556
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,375
But I'm just not sure that's
a gamble I'm willing to take.

557
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,583
Whether or not things
change as time passes,

558
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,708
what I'm feeling now is real.

559
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,916
I can't pretend those
feelings don't matter.

560
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,875
I want to live my
life in the present.

561
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:37,166
Not the future.

562
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,416
Which is why...

563
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,291
I'm babbling, huh?

564
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,958
Sorry, I'm still trying
to figure it all out.

565
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:50,125
That's okay.
I can understand that.

566
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,958
Well at least we
solved the mystery.

567
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,708
Yeah. Well, see ya.

568
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,875
[HOTARO]
"Hey there, sis.

569
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,166
I'm writing because I've
got some questions for you.

570
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,750
How much did you know
about the Classic Lit Club?

571
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:15,125
And why was it so important to
you that I get involved with it?

572
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,625
You know I'm an
energy conservationist.

573
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,416
That's just my way of living.

574
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,625
If I hadn't joined the
Classic Lit Club this year,

575
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:25,458
I probably wouldn't have
given that a second thought.

576
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,166
Is that why you
wanted me to do it?

577
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,833
Did you know somehow
that it would force me

578
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:32,041
to reconsider my
priorities in life?

579
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,416
This whole Hyouka thing.

580
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,958
It's got me wondering.

581
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,833
Am I doing things right?

582
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,458
Does being more
passionate about stuff

583
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:43,000
make life more exciting
or just more heartbreaking?

584
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,375
I dunno. Maybe it's both.

585
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,958
That's always possible.

586
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,250
Did you know I'd start
wondering about this stuff?"

587
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,625
[chuckles]
No, that's silly.

588
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:58,583
"Anyway, that's all I've
got to report for now.

589
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,708
I'll go ahead and
wrap this letter up.

590
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,458
Have a nice trip.

591
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,416
And thanks for the advice.

592
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,458
Your brother, Hotaro."


593
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,958
[HOTARO] Next time:
"Committing a Cardinal Sin."
