[MAYAKA] I'm sorry.
I don't have it for you.

[KOCHI]

3
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,666
You couldn't find it
or something?

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,333
[MAYAKA] I must have brought
it with me when I went

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:28,125
to the country on vacation.

6
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,916
[KOCHI]
Is that the truth?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,583
[KOCHI]
Fine.

9
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,041
Why don't you help
with the posters, then?

10
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,208

Sure. Which ones?

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,041
Well... Start with <i>moe</i> .

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,958

for a little bit.

13
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,291

[SATOSHI]
So Chitanda, Mayaka...

15

contest starts at 11:30, okay?

16
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,250
Right!

17

but I promised that I would help

19
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,625
What? Oh, bummer.

20
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,041
Well, let me see here.

21
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,125

put you in the last position...

22

by 12:10, we should be fine.

23

[MAYAKA]
That sounds great!

24
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,916

make it by then.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
See ya!

26
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,541
Well, I need to pop by
the executive committee room,

27
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,083
so I'll see you guys
around in a little while.

28
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,958
[HOTARO] He's enjoying
this way too much.

29
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,208
[TANABE]
Hey!

30
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,625
Sorry, but would you mind taking
that box to the gym for me?

31
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,416
[SATOSHI]
Sure, no problem.

32
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,958
By the way...

33
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,916
Have you had a chance to look
around the festival at all?

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,708
[TANABE] Not really. I keep
having to put out little fires,

35
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,291
but I have been able
to do some exploring.

36
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,208
Why? Have you picked up
any interesting stories

37
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,583
along the way?

38
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,416
[SATOSHI] Oh, man, all kinds
of stuff has gone down.

39
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,625
Ah!

40
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,375
I heard a thief struck
over at the Go Club.

41
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,333
What?

42
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,833
They stole some of the Go stones

43
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,333
and left a mysterious
confession note behind.

44
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,125
Wow. I see.

45
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,541
You said the Go Club?

46
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,333
[SATOSHI]
Yeah, but if you ask me,

47
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,625
I think one of their own
members is to blame.

48
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:47,833
[TANABE]
No.

49
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,958
There was another theft,
according to Okano.

50
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,791
Apparently something
with the Acapella Club.

51
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,666
[SATOSHI]
Yeah? What got stolen there?

52
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,875
[TANABE] He said someone took
a drink from their cooler--

53
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,458
some kind of juice, I think.

54
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,958
[SATOSHI] Did the thief
leave a confession note?

55
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,833
[TANABE] Yeah, they mentioned
finding a weird message

56
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,125
in there.

57
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,833
[SATOSHI] Things just took
an interesting turn.

58
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,333
What's up now, Fukube?

59
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,583
Why are you smiling?

60
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,625
[SATOSHI] Oh, nothing,
don't worry about it.

61

62
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,916

[IRISU]
That's fine. I'll help you.

64
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,458
[ERU] You're saying that
I can leave them here?

65
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,958
Yeah.

66
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,625
Oh... Wow!

67
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,250
I appreciate it
more than you know!

68
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,125
[IRISU] Better not say that
until they're all sold.

69
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,250
So... How many,
and what's the price?

70
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:42,583
We're selling at 200 each,
and we printed... 200 copies.

71
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,208
[IRISU]
That's a lot.

72
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,333
[ERU] We meant to get 30,
but we made a mistake,

73
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,541
so we need to sell as many
as possible to pay for them.

74
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,583
We're desperate. We need help.

75
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,625
Why don't we lower the
price of <i>Hyouka</i> to 150?

76
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,458
I'll sell them with the
pamphlets for 200 total.

77
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,333
Great.

78
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,166

What's in the gym?

79
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,375
[BOY 14E] I don't know,
probably something dumb.

80
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,750
What are you doing?
I want a copy of <i>Hyouka</i> .

81
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,916
Oh, right.
I was confused by your hand.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,083
I'm sorry,
but I didn't bring one.

83
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,666
From now on, you should
carry a copy with you.

84
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,041
Your presentation
is important as well.

85
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,875
Irisu...

86
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,250
Uh... What is it?

87
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,875
[ERU] You're an expert
at getting what you want

88
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,041
when you need a favor, right?

89
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,333
[IRISU]
Uh...

90
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,291
[ERU] Would you be willing
to share the secrets

91
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,916
of your success with me?

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,208
[IRISU]
What?!

93
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,375
[GIRL 14E]
What the--?

94
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,833
Yeah, okay.

95
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,750
First of all, no matter what
it is that you're asking for,

96
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,250
you have to make the
other person think

97
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,625
that it's their idea.

98
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,250
Their idea?

99
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,250
To do that, you have to
set up an environment

100
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,875
in which they feel emotional
contentment and trust.

101
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,541
There's a myriad of
ways to achieve this,

102
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,583
but your most
effective style would be...

103
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,250
...expectation.

104
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,458
Oh, yeah?

105
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,833
[IRISU]
Yes.

106
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,041
Make the other person think
you expect this of them,

107
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,125
and they'll feel obligated.

108
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,583
[ERU]
Obligated...

109
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,125
If you can do that much,

110
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,458
their conscience will do the
rest and they'll commit to it.

111
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,083
They'll commit to it?

112
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,791
[IRISU] Yes, but you have
to make the favor seem

113
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,041
like less of an ordeal
than it actually is.

114
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,791
Like less of an ordeal?

115
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,750
Like it's not that big
of a thing to you,

116
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,500
but that it will pay
them major dividends

117
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,208
if they agree to it.

118
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,791
One other tip,
and it's a big one.

119
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,000
If possible, ask someone
of the opposite sex,

120
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,500
and do it
out of public view.

121
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,583
Right.

122
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,708

00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:53,041
Number two.
Team... Fata... Morgana!

175
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,041
[STUDENTS cheering]

176
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,333
[COOKING CLUB VP]
Number three!

177
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,708
Team... Astronomy Club!

178
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,500
[STUDENTS cheering]

179
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,625
[COOKING CLUB VP]
Team number four!

180
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,750
Team Classic Lit Club!

181
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,083
All right! Yeah!

182
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,041
[COOKING CLUB VP] Here are the
rules, so listen carefully.

183
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,125
Each team member has 20 minutes
to cook their individual dish.

184
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,375
After that 20 minutes is up,

185
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,375
they must pass the baton
to the next person.

186
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,791
Team members outside of the
cooking area are not allowed

187
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,333
to talk to the member
who is cooking,

188
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,958
so keep that in mind
and follow the rules!

189
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,083
Fukube, do you know what
dish you're going to cook?

190
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,291
I'm really delighted you asked!

191
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,291
My special:
Fuku hoisin fried rice.

192
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,416
That's great!
Although, by the rules,

193
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
we would have to boil
the rice from scratch.

194
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,916
So that means you'd have to be
our anchorman and finish us out.

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,958
No, I don't think my plan
is going to work after all.

196
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,500
Since I can't make my rice,
I'll lead us off

197
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,291
and get the ball rolling
with some other dish.

198
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,041
Whatever you make will be great.

199
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,375
Now!

200
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,666
Each team member must
prepare at least one dish.

201
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,416
Ingredients are first-come,
first-serve,

202
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,625
in bowls in the center.

203
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,333
Once they're gone, don't worry.

204
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,958
You are allowed
to procure others,

205
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,375
but only from on school grounds.

206
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,500
All that said,
get ready for the first round!

207
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,541
[COOKING CLUB PRESIDENT]
To your kitchens!

208
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,125
Here goes!

209
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,791
[COOKING CLUB VP] Without
further ado, let's begin!

210
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,041
It's Wild...

211
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,041
[STUDENTS]
...Fire!

212
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,250
[whistle blowing]

213
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,666
[STUDENTS cheering]

214
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,916
Fire.

215
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,208
[COOKING CLUB VP]
Okay, everybody,

216
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,250
Wild Fire is underway.

217
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,666
I don't know about you, Prez,

218
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,500
but I'm certainly looking
forward to what each team

219
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,750
will present to us.

220
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,541
Let's hope it's good!

221
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,333
[COOKING CLUB VP]
Oh, Team Classic Lit Club

222
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,833
is pulling the heads
off dried fish

223
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,041
and cleaning each
one individually!

224
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,166
That looks like
some pretty precise work.

225
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,083
What do you have to say, Prez?

226
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,916
This is the kind of prep work
that sets a team apart, VP.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,208
[COOKING CLUB VP] Team Fata
Morgana is doing great things

228
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,541
with clam meat!

229
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,583
[ERU] Is he going to make
daikon radish miso soup?

230
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,708
Huh?! Fukube!
You shouldn't be doing that!

231
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,708
You're supposed to
peel the daikon first!

232
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,166
Fu--

233
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,333
[ERU]
Oh, no!

234
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,208
I forgot I'm not supposed
to talk to him!

235
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,708
I've gotta follow the rules!

236
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,416
The daikon...

237
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,541
Peel it! Peel it!

238
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,291
Come on, Fukube!

239
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,541
[ERU]
Ah!

240
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,625
Did he figure out what
he's doing wrong?

241
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,791
What?!

242
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,166
Is he peeling each
radish wheel separately?

243
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,916
The water!
The water's boiling over! 

244
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,083
[COOKING CLUB VP]
That looks like it's gonna take

245
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,083
quite some time,
Team Classic Lit Club!

246
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,125
[COOKING CLUB PREISDENT] Don't
get stuck in a loop, kid!

247
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,500
[SATOSHI sighs]

248
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,000
That's that.

249
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,583
What next?

250
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,000
[COOKING CLUB VP] We're still
not able to tell at this point

251
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,625
what each team is making.

252
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,916
Uh-oh, Team Classic Lit
is tilting his head!

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,375
What does that mean?

254
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,750
[SATOSHI]
Ow! Hot!

255
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,708
[ERU]
Ah, I think I get it now!

256
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,541
He's making miso meat stew!

257
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,375
[COOKING CLUB VP] Looks like
Team Ajiyoshi is preparing

258
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,833
a basic meat sauce!

259
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,208
That sounds tasty!

260
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,083
[MAYAKA] There's no way
I'll make it at this pace!

261
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,333
[COOKING CLUB VP]
All right, lead cooks!

262
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,875
Your time is almost up!

263
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,708
[COOKING CLUB VP]
Five! Four! Three!

264
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,500
Two! One!

265
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,250
Time to switch!

266
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,291
Sorry.

267
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,000
I was only able
to prepare one dish.

268
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,625
That's okay. You just
leave this round to me!

269
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,458
For sure!
Get 'em, Chitanda.

270
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,958
[COOKING CLUB VP]
That's amazing!

271
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,000
Team Classic Lit Club
is paring that daikon

272
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,833
like she's been to
culinary school!

273
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,208
[COOKING CLUB PREISDENT]
You're absolutely correct.

274
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,916
That is professional level work.

275
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm impressed.

276
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,208
She could skim the skin
off a pudding,

277
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,625
judging by the way she's
peeling that thing.

278
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,708
[SATOSHI]
That's amazing.

279
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,000
She's already
completed one dish.

280
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,458
[SATOSHI]
Well, that's Chitanda for you.

281
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,291
[COOKING CLUB VP] Team Classic
Lit Club is hand-washing

282
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,333
her rice!

283
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,791
They've already
gone through all six

284
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,875
liters of water that they
were allotted at the start!

285
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,250
[COOKING CLUB PRESIDENT] That's
an admirable way to do it.

286
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,250
the flavor of the
rice is crucial.

287
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,291
Whoa!

288
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,000
Take a look at Team
Astronomy Club!

289
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,500
What's going on?

290
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,416
If that's not a flambé,
they should be worried!

291
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,458
[COOKING CLUB PRESIDENT]
Get the fire extinguisher ready!

292
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,791
[COOKING CLUB VP]
Meanwhile...

293
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,875
is Team Classic Lit Club
making <i>giseyaki</i> ?

294
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,416
I sure love
down home cooking!

295
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,416
[COOKING CLUB PRESIDENT]
Like mom used to make!

296
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,875
[SATOSHI] I've never
even heard of <i>giseyaki</i> !

297
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,541
[COOKING CLUB VP]
And, over at Team Fata Morgana,

298
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,375
the yellowtail teriyaki
is nearing completion!

299
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,250
[COOKING CLUB PREISDENT]
Brilliant!

00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,208
[COOKING CLUB VP] Team Classic
Lit Club is plating up

301
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,750
that <i>giseyaki</i> !

302
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,416
[COOKING CLUB PRESIDENT] I'm
starting to get really hungry!

303
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,083
[COOKING CLUB VP] Just who is
that second cook of theirs,

304
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,375
anyway?

305
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,833
[SATOSHI]
She's Miss Eru Chitanda,

306
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,666
of the famous
farming Chitandas,

307
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,208
and don't you forget it!

308
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,708
[COOKING CLUB VP] Meanwhile,
Team Astronomy Club

309
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,916
still seems to be using
an avant-garde cooking style!

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,875
[COOKING CLUB PRESIDENT]
Looks pretty far out there!

311
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,083
Team Classic Lit Club
is rolling boiled potatoes

312
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,291
in starch and putting
them in ceramic ware.

313
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,000
Now she's making <i>imochi</i> cakes?

314
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,208
This girl definitely knows
what she's doing!

315
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,041
Oh... That's trouble!

316
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,541
This is making me nervous.

317
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,416
[SATOSHI]
Trouble? What trouble?

318
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,916
[SATOSHI gasps]

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,166
[COOKING CLUB VP]
No outside help is allowed,

320
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,875
Team Classic Lit Club!

321
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,791
[SATOSHI] It's no use.
I'm not getting through.

322
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,916
All right, teams,
your 40 minutes are up.

323
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,916
Time to switch
to your anchormen.

324
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,291
[ERU]
Hey, Fukube.

325
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,458
How'd I do?

326
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,416
You were amazing, Chitanda.

327
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,458
I had no idea you had such
advanced culinary skills.

328
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,958
Cooking's fun!
It's one of my hobbies.

329
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,791
Yeah, well done out there.

330
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,541
Although...

331
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,916
What's wrong?

332
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,250
[ERU] We're already out of
ingredients!

333
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,750
Mayaka. I'm sorry.

334
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,333
[COOKING CLUB VP] Okay, the time
has come for the anchormen

335
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,125
to bring it home!

336
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,250
[MAYAKA]
Finished!

337
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:13,791
[MAYAKA]
'Scuse me!

338
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,750
Pardon me!
Coming through!

339
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,375
[COOKING CLUB VP]
Very nice!

340
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,958
It looks like Team Ajiyoshi
is preparing apples

341
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,041
for a dessert course!
Adorable!

342
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,375
Those little bunnies are taking
shape right before our eyes!

343
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,458
As of right now, Team Classic
Lit Club's anchorman

344
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,500
has yet to appear!

345
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,541
Oh, my! Team Ajiyoshi
