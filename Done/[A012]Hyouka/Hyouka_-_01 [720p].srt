[STUDENTS shouting]

2
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,875
[HOTARO] They say high school
is all sunshine and roses.

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,375
Sunshine, roses,
rainbows, and unicorns.

4
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,500
I've heard so much about
the bliss and excitement

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,750
of being a high school student

6
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,500
that I've written it off
as a worn out cliché.

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,958
Who's to say that all teenagers
even want high school

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,500
to be like some
fairy tale fever dream?

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,375
It seems ridiculous to me.

10
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,958
There's all the studying,

11
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,708
and the sports hysteria,

12
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,458
and the saccharin-sweet
romantic affairs.

13
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,833
Those are the worst.

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,958
A lot of teenagers
have no interest

15
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:46,041
in that kind of
nonsense, right?

16
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,125
[HOTARO]
Well...

17
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,625
I guess when you
rule out all that crap,

18
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,791
there's not much
left over, is there?

19
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,208
Wow, Hotaro,

20
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,291
I never knew you were such
a full-fledged pessimist.

21
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,875
[HOTARO]
Wait, a pessimist?

22
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,416
Why have you got a problem with
studying, sports, romance?

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,333
Things the normal kids enjoy.

24
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,250
You make it sound so dismal.

25
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,541
[HOTARO]
That's not what I said.

26
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,666
You misunderstood me.

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,291
I'm telling you what I hear.

28
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,541
Maybe you're just lazy.

29
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,125
What do you think of that?

30
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,041
Anytime you think
something's a hassle

31
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:16,291
or seems like it might be
frivolous, you refuse to do it!

32
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,791
Which explains... your motto!

33
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,666
"If I don't have to,
I'm not going to.

34
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,333
And if I have to, I'll do it
as quickly as possible."

35
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,750
That's the one.

36
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,333
But just so you know,

37
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,750
by not joining any of the
offerings at the veritable

38
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,458
Mecca of clubs which
we call Kamiyama High,

39
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,333
you've made a little black
cloud appear above your head.

40
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:37,541
You might think you're slick,

41
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,458
but you're only
punishing yourself.

42
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,041
You've crossed over
into downright masochism.

43
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,708
You sure like
to run your mouth.

44
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,250
You're just now noticing?

45
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,750
We've been friends
since middle school.

46
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,625
Whatever. Go without me.

47
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,916
What do you mean,
"without you"?

48
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,166
What the--?!

49
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,500
Is that what I think it is?
A club application?

50
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,000
Hotaro! You're joining one?

51
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,500
Classic Lit club? Really?

52
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,791
--[HOTARO] Oh, you know it?
--[SATOSHI] Of course I do!

53
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,250
Since when are you
into classic lit?

54
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,166
[SATOSHI]
What's that?

55
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,208
What does a letter from your
sister have to do with it?

56
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,958
[HOTARO]
She sent it to me from India.

57
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,416
Some place in the
north called Varanasi.

58
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,458
Oh, yeah?

59
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,000
I see what's going on.

60
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,666
Your sister's blackmailing you.

61
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,833
[HOTARO] They're threatening
to shut it down

62
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,291
for lack of members.

63
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,916
She wants me to join and
help keep the club alive.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,083
But I thought your sister
was more into martial arts.

65
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,000
[HOTARO] Aikido, actually,
which is worse.

66
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,083
If she wants to hurt you,
she knows just how to do it.

67
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,125
[SATOSHI laughs]

68
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,666
Then you should
do what she says!

69
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,916
[HOTARO] Well, it's not like
I have anything better to do,

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,041
and believe me, I've tried
to think of an excuse.

71
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,041
[SATOSHI] So the club
doesn't have any members?

72
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,083
[HOTARO]
Nope.

73
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,166
Well, then look
on the bright side:

74
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,041
You'll have the clubroom
all to yourself!

75
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,791
[SATOSHI] It'll be nice to have
your own private space

76
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,208
on school grounds, at least.

77
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,416
Sounds like a dream!

78
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,791
"My own private space?"

79
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,250
[TEAM CAPTAIN]
Come on, ladies!

80
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:56,083
[HOTARO] I salute people who
have that kind of energy.

81
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,416
[HOTARO]
Knock, knock.

82
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,083
[HOTARO] People usually
misunderstand me on this.

83
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,750
It's not like I think
my way of doing things

84
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,625
is better than theirs,
by any means.

85
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,291
And I don't see
myself as superior

86
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,541
to those who choose
to get involved.

87
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,708
I'm just true to
my motto, that's all.

88
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,125
If I don't have to,
I'm not going to.

89
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,791
And if I have to, I'll do
it as quickly as possible.

90
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,000
There, see?

91
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,375
Ew!

92
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,041
[HOTARO] Fourth floor
of the auxiliary building.

93
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,125
That's as remote as it gets.

94
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:00,875
Hello, there.

95
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,083
I didn't know you were in
the Classic Literature club.

96
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,333
Oreki, right?

97
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,125
Who're you?

98
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,041
Oh, you don't know?

99
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,333
My name's Eru. Eru Chitanda.

100
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,041
Sorry. I have
no idea who you are.

101
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,125
Hotaro Oreki
from class 1-B?

102
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,541
That is your name, isn't it?

103
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,541
Yeah.

104
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,833
I'm in class 1-A,
so we have met.

105
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,833
I'm sorry, but...

106
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,416
That's not ringing
any bells, so...

107
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,375
[HOTARO] 1-A?
Maybe we share an elective.

108
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,833
Wait a sec,
you wouldn't happen to be

109
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,458
in my music class, would you?

110
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,958
Yep!

111
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,250
[HOTARO] We've only had that
class once so far this term.

112
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,750
Her memory is incredible.

113
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,375
[HOTARO]
So, uh, Chitanda...

114
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,041
What are you doing in here?

115
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,458
Are you lost or something?

116
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,500
Nope!

117
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,875
You see, I joined
the Classic Lit club.

118
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,000
This is where it says
we're supposed to meet!

119
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,666
[ERU]
I joined the Classic Lit club.

120
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,750
I joined the Classic Lit club.

121
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,500
Are you for real?

122
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,125
Why would you do that?

123
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,583
I have my reasons, but
they're kind of personal.

124
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,791
Why did you join?

125
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,125
Oh, uh...

126
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,291
No reason really, I'm
just glad we have members.

127
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,750
[HOTARO]
Are you happy now, Sis?

128
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,458
Classic Lit club lives
to see another day.

129
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,833
[HOTARO]
Well, see ya later.

130
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,416
[ERU]
Wait, you're leaving already?

131
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,416
[HOTARO]
Sure am. Have fun in here.

132
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,041
And be sure to lock up
when you leave.

133
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,166
[ERU]
What?

134
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,708
I can't lock up
if I don't have a key.

135
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,833
What's that?

136
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,250
I was saying that
I don't have a key.

137
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,625
Oh, yeah.

138
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,833
Here.

139
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,041
Wait a sec...

140
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,791
Why do you have the key
to this room, Oreki?

141
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,250
[HOTARO]
What do you mean by that?

142
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,833
How in the hell was
I supposed to get into

143
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,166
a locked classroom without one?

144
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,541
Pardon my French. I'm confused.

145
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,083
I don't understand how you
got in before I showed up.

146
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,416
The door was open
when I got here.

147
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,916
[HOTARO] Well, then you must
have just locked it behind you.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,875
[BOTH gasp]

149
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,083
Are you saying what I think?

150
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,291
I was locked in here?

151
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,375
Yeah, you were.

152
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,958
So someone came along
and trapped me

153
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,833
alone in this room
until you showed up?

154
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,708
Look, I'm sure you
just did it yourself.

155
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,791
Are you certain that you didn't?

156
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,666
Yes, I'm absolutely certain!

157
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,416
But I'm the only one with a key.

158
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,791
I mean what else could have
possibly happened here?

159
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,333
Maybe we should ask the guy
who's hiding in the hallway.

160
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,375
Huh?

161
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,875
[HOTARO]
Satoshi...

162
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,041
[SATOSHI]
Hey! Sorry about that.

163
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,291
I totally didn't mean to
eavesdrop on you guys.

164
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,375
You "totally" did.

165
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,083
[SATOSHI]
Okay, guilty as charged.

166
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,958
But I gotta admit, when I
see my good buddy, Hotaro,

167
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,500
known for his stoicism,
in an empty classroom

168
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,625
with a young lady,
and dusk fast approaching,

169
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,416
I get more than
a little curious.

170
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
I had no intention
of barging in--

171
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,958
[ERU]
Hey!

172
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,875
We weren't--
No! I wasn't--!

173
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,416
You've gotta be kidding me.

174
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,583
Of course. Just joking.

175
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,041
Oh, thank goodness.

176
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,458
Sorry 'bout that.
This guy has no manners at all.

177
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,083
Nothing beats a good joke!

178
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,458
"Don't ever take
life too seriously."

179
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,500
I live by that motto.

180
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,916
Right.

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,583
Oreki, who is this boy?

182
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,416
[HOTARO] This is Satoshi Fukube,
would-be comedian.

183
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,166
I see.

184
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,458
Hey, good one!

185
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,041
I'm honored that you
think so, my good friend.

186
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,416
Nice to meet you.
And you are...?

187
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,916
I'm Eru Chitanda.

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
Did you say Chitanda?

189
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,833
As in the very famous Chitandas?

190
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,250
What's the matter with you?

191
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,958
[SATOSHI] Wait, are you telling
me you've never heard

192
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,500
of the Chitanda family?

193
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,458
Kamiyama has more than
a few prestigious dynasties.

194
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,000
But none of them are as notable

195
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,208
as the four
Higher Power Families.

196
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,208
[SATOSHI] There's the
shrine-owning Jumonji family,

197
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,000
the Sasusuberi
Bookstore Tycoons,

198
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,375
the wealthy Chitanda farmers,
and the Maninbashi landowners.

199
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,083
Written this way,
the kanji for each name

200
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,333
increases by the power
of ten, hence the name

201
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,708
"Higher Power Families."

202
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,916
Is that true?

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,875
I wouldn't say we're
a prestigious family.

204
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,500
And I've never heard us
referred to by that name before.

205
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,583
You made up the name.

206
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,958
It sounds cool,

207
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,625
and I thought I could be
the one to coin the phrase.

208
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,000
They really increase
by powers of ten, huh?

209
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,666
Don't act so impressed.
He'll get a big ego.

210
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,625
They also say the
oldest Chitanda girl

211
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,708
is known for her beauty
and incredible grades.

212
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,291
And that she's the most refined
girl in all of Kamiyama.

213
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,083
In middle school,
she got a perfect score

214
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,041
on the prefectural exams, and
the school board went crazy!

215
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,541
No way. Is he right?

216
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,833
It's just a fluke.

217
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,166
I have a knack for acing
standardized tests.

218
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,666
[SATOSHI]
Well, I beg your pardon.

219
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,958
Anyway, I happened to
hear you guys talking.

220
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,541
Wow, what a mystery, am I right?

221
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,041
[HOTARO]
I'm not following.

222
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,916
[SATOSHI] How in the heck did
Chitanda get locked inside

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,166
this room earlier?

224
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,583
Oh, I forgot!

225
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,625
When I showed up,
the door to this room

226
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,500
was most definitely unlocked.

227
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,333
But when Oreki got here,
it was bolted,

228
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,666
and he had to use his key
to get inside, so what happened?

229
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,125
Well, that's easy.

230
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,000
You must have locked it when
you came in and forgotten.

231
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,500
Try again!

232
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,458
Kami High School's doors can
only be locked using a key,

233
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,583
from the inside or the outside.

234
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,583
So that means it's not
even possible for Chitanda

235
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,458
to have locked herself in!

236
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,833
That's crazy!

237
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,250
Man, you've always been
such a know-it-all.

238
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,333
I prefer the term
"database," sir.

239
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,458
Well, I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation

240
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,833
for this whole lock thing.

241
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,625
See you guys later.

242
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,333
No, please don't go just yet!

243
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,458
Why not?

244
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,333
I have to know.

245
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,791
How did I come to be locked
in this room like that?

246
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,666
And if the door was
supposed to be locked,

247
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,458
why was it open when I got here?

248
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,416
Did someone leave
it open on purpose?

249
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,875
And if they did, why?

250
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,541
If not, how did they lock it
again without me noticing?

251
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:12,041
I beg you, Oreki,
think about it carefully.

252
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,666
I need your help.

253
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,625
Please. I have to know!

254
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,750
Yeah. Okay. I'll help.

255
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,916
It is interesting, after all.

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
Thank you so very much!

257
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,083
So do you have any ideas,
just off the top of your head?

258
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,416
Whoa, Chitanda.
Give him some time.

259
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,083
While I'm full of
useless information

260
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,666
and can't make any deductions,

261
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,208
Hotaro is the opposite.

262
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,541
Once he's had
some time to think,

263
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,916
his conclusions
are fairly accurate.

264
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,416
That's enough.

265
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,625
Let's see.

266
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,666
So how long were
you here before me?

267
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,291
[ERU] It couldn't have more
than about three minutes.

268
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,958
Did you notice
anything unusual?

269
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,250
Well, actually...

270
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,250
I've been hearing this
weird rattling below us

271
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,625
this whole time.

272
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,208
[SATOSHI]
What? I don't hear anything.

273
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,333
[ERU]
It's really faint. Listen.

274
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,375
[SATOSHI]
You must have really sharp ears.

275
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,583
[SATOSHI] So... Have you
figured anything out yet?

276
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,041
[HOTARO]
Maybe.

277
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,916
I bet the culprit is on the
floor below us right now.

278
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,291
[JANITOR]
Last one. Good.

279
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,541
[SATOSHI]
A-ha.

280
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,125
Chitanda must have
gone into the room

281
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,625
while the maintenance
guy was working,

282
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,666
and accidentally gotten locked
inside without knowing it.

283
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,333
I have the regular key
to the science room

284
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,291
in my pocket.

285
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,166
I know the janitor has a master,

286
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,125
and they don't give
those out to students.

287
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,666
That's how you knew
he was working.

288
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,708
But still... You guessed
that just from a noise!

289
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,125
Yeah, I did.

290
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,208
Anyway, I still don't understand
why you didn't notice

291
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,250
the sound of the door
locking when you were inside

292
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,208
the science room, if you
could hear the janitor

293
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,208
through the floor.

294
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,500
Ah. A simple explanation.

295
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,416
I was distracted
by that old building.

296
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,458
[SATOSHI]
It's ancient!

297
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,458
[ERU]
Yep.

298
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,458
Is it really?

299
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,416
Yeah. Look at it!

300
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,125
[ERU] By the way, I think we
should talk about the club.

301
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,291
[HOTARO]
Oh, that's right.

302
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,125
[ERU]
Yeah.

303
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,375
From the look of things,

304
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,666
I'd say it's only going
to be the three of us.

305
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,916
"Three of us?"

306
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,375
[ERU] Fukube, what do
you think? Wanna join?

307
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,333
Why not? I sure had
a lot of fun today.

308
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,916
I'll have to juggle
Executive Committee

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,916
and handicrafts, but uh...

310
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,875
Yep! I'm in!

311
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,500
Hotaro is in, too.

312
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,750
He's already filled
out the application.

313
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,708
Have you really?

314
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,791
Huh? Yeah, I filled it out.

315
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,875
[ERU]
Great.

316
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,291
Huh?

317
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,166
Right! I'll turn this in!

318
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,583
I'm really looking forward
to seeing you again.

319
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,208
Yeah, same here!

320
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,166
And Hotaro is, too.

321
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,250
[ERU] I guess we're gonna have
to choose a club president!

322
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,750
Who should we pick?

323
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,583
[SATOSHI]
Huh, good question.

324
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,500
I don't think Hotaro would
be the best candidate.

325
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,958
[HOTARO]
Well, there you have it, Sis.

326
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,708
Your precious Classic
Literature Club

327
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,458
lives to see another term.

328
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,583
As a result, my dreams of
conserving energy are dead.

329
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,833
No! I'm not gonna lay them
to rest without a fight.

330
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,416
I refuse to give up my
peace of mind that easily.

331
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,750
I will devote all my efforts
to doing as little as possible.

332
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,208
There's just one problem.

333
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,583
...and the tranquil
temperament of a great leader!

334
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,958
[HOTARO]
That little lady.

335
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,125
[SATOSHI] It happened
yesterday after school.

336
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,083
A first year girl climbed
to the fourth floor

337
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,583
of the auxiliary building.

338
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,666
When she arrived,
she heard the somber strains

339
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,916
of "Moonlight Sonata"
coming from the music room.

340
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,916
The setting sun bathed the
hallway in a crimson glow.

341
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,083
The warm tones--

342
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,833
[HOTARO]
Objection. It rained all day.

343
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,083
You couldn't see the sunset.

344
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,166
[SATOSHI]
Fine.

345
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,666
It was a dark and
gloomy afternoon,

346
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,708
and dusk was drawing near.

347
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,500
A feeling of unease
clung to the girl,

348
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,625
and the rain on her
skin made her shiver.

349
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,791
[HOTARO]
You're embellishing.

350
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,416
[SATOSHI]
Lured by the mysterious tones,

351
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,666
she entered the room.

352
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,666
Immediately, the music stopped.

353
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,083
The lid of the piano was up,

354
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,833
but no one was
seated at the keys.

355
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,625
The drawn curtains
and gloomy weather

356
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,125
made the room darker than usual.

357
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,916
That's when she saw her!

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,041
A female student with
long, messy hair

359
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,833
hanging over her face, was
slumped over across the room!

360
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,250
Her eyes were so bloodshot
they almost glowed.

361
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,583
As the apparition stared
menacingly at our heroine...

362
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,333
[GIRL screams]

363
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,000
[SATOSHI] It was the ghost of a
piano club member of the past,

364
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,916
who had met a tragic end
in that very room,

365
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,416
minutes before a
national competition!

366
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,458
[HOTARO]
Oh, really?

367
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,458
Huh? Well...

368
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,458
I don't know about that part for
sure, but it's not impossible.

369
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,750
[HOTARO]
Yeah, that's what I thought.

370
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,916
[SATOSHI] I've gotta say,
this is a surprise.

371
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,500
I don't think you've ever
forgotten your homework

372
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,875
in all the years I've known you.

373
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,625
I didn't forget to do it.

374
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,583
I just left it at home this
morning, that's all.

375
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,083
So now I have to
stay after class

376
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,833
and write the same
stupid essay again,

377
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,291
while you talk my ear off.

378
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,041
Yeah, lucky you.

379
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,333
Anyway, I heard there really
was a crazy-haired ghost

380
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,416
in the music room.

381
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,791
That's all anyone in class A

382
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,416
could talk about
during lunch today.

383
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,625
The real question is how
quickly the story will spread

384
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,833
through the rest of the school.

385
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,250
And if it will change at all.

386
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,541
It's one of the seven wonders
of Kamiyama High School.

387
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,958
Number two! You know?

388
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,416
I'm interested to see
how many days it takes

389
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,083
the news to spread
to D, my class.

390
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,666
Hold on a second.

391
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,500
Exactly when, where, and from
whom did you hear this story?

392
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,250
[SATOSHI] Earlier today, in the
club room, from Chitanda.

393
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,583
If the music room
ghost is the second

394
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,458
of the seven wonders,
what's the first?

395
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,625
I'm sure you're
dying to tell me.

396
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,875
Hey!

397
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,875
I suspected I might
find you two in here.

398
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,791
I wrote it up for you.
Here ya go.

399
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,500
Thanks, I appreciate that.

400
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,625
I'm sorry.

401
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,208
As a member of the
Executive Committee,

402
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,208
I'm forced to delegate some of
my responsibilities to others.

403
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,375
No worries!

404
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,708
After all, I am the
club president now.

405
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,000
[ERU]
Hi, Oreki!

406
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,541
[HOTARO] You came at
the perfect time!

407
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,916
Satoshi just finished telling me
quite an interesting story.

408
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,583
Yeah! I'm glad
you brought that up!

409
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,833
I heard it at lunch!

410
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,041
[HOTARO] It's about the
mysterious Secret Club

411
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,583
Recruitment Notes.

412
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,375
Have you heard it?

413
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,916
A secret club?

414
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,958
[HOTARO] Yes, why don't you
tell her the story, Satoshi?

415
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,875
Huh?

416
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,583
Well, what do you say?
Wanna hear it?

417
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,500
Honestly, it's
pretty fascinating.

418
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,541
Yes.

419
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,916
Ahem.

420
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,375
I heard it today at the
Executive Committee meeting.

421
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,125
Well, you already know this
school has a million clubs.

422
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,041
So of course there are
recruitment posters

423
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,666
plastered all over the place.

424
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,208
There are so many
that the bulletin boards

425
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,708
get buried underneath them.

426
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,291
When the Executive Committee
finds unauthorized posts,

427
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,250
we take them down.

428
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,666
No exceptions.

429
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,000
However...

430
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,208
For the past few years, a
strange recruitment note

431
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,208
has been turning up,
and no one claims to know

432
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,583
a thing about it.

433
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,750
Last year, it showed up
as a scrap of notebook paper

434
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,458
with just a meeting place
and time scribbled on it.

435
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,041
This club has been gathering,
conducting secret business,

436
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,375
and recruiting new members,

437
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,875
all without the Executive
Committee's knowledge.

438
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,375
No one knows for sure who
they are or what they do,

439
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,583
but we do have one
piece of information:

440
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,458
Their name.

441
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,458
[ERU]
Yeah, what is it?

442
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,375
Joro Spider Society.

443
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,208
Joro Spider?

444
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,333
So you know Tanabe,

445
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,041
the chair of the
Executive Committee?

446
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,583
Well, he tried to bust
them up last year

447
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,041
by going to the
alleged meeting place

448
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,083
at the exact time the note said.

449
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,166
That plan didn't
go over so well.

450
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,500
He didn't find anything
and decided it was a hoax

451
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,166
to make the
committee look stupid.

452
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:44,916
However...

453
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,458
[ERU]
What happened?

454
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,083
[SATOSHI] On graduation day,
one of the departing students

455
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,541
pulled him aside and said...

456
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,708
"I was the president
of the Joro Spider Society.

457
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,666
Please give my warm
regards to the one

458
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,750
who succeeds me.

459
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,291
Which will be hard,

460
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,458
because we will ensure that
you never unveil his identity."

461
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,000
[SATOSHI] They're likely
recruiting new members

462
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,500
for this year, too.

463
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,625
But we haven't been able to
find their secret base yet.

464
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:14,000
The cryptic recruitment note
of Joro Spider Society!

465
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,875
That's it. I must know!

466
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,958
[HOTARO]
Yes!

467
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,375
[HOTARO]
I had a feeling you'd say that.

468
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,041
Which is why I said you
came at the perfect time.

469
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,375
And what do you mean by that?

470
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,958
You're just in time
for the next step:

471
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,458
To find the note.

472
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,541
Right!

473
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,166
[SATOSHI] There's a total
of 30 bulletin boards

474
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,375
throughout the school.

475
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,583
[ERU]
That many?

476
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,916
Are we going to
search all of them?

477
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,041
[HOTARO]
No, we're not.

478
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,291
It's faster to just
search the boards

479
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,916
where they're most
likely to hide the note.

480
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,375
[ERU]
That makes sense.

481
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,208
[HOTARO] Where would you put
a secret recruitment note?

482
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,750
[ERU]
Well, if it were up to me...

483
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,958
I think I'd pin it to one
of the corner bulletin boards,

484
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,416
where it would attract as
little attention as possible.

485
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,666
[HOTARO] That's where
you're wrong, though.

486
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,916
[ERU]
Wait, why is that?

487
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,375
[HOTARO] Remember that
the purpose of this note

488
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,750
is to recruit new members,
so they'd probably put it

489
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,666
on the board at the
first floor entrance.

490
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,041
[ERU]
What?

491
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,375
But everyone in school
would see it, wouldn't they?

492
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,125
[SATOSHI]
Hold on, Chitanda.

493
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,083
I'm sure Hotaro has a
brilliant idea up his sleeve.

494
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,041
Wow!

495
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,625
It's pretty impressive that our
school has all these clubs!

496
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,875
Kinda hard to believe.

497
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,333
[ERU]
It is remarkable.

498
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,416
A calligraphy club, a
basketball club, a track club.

499
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,875
The list just keeps going.

500
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,791
There's barely any open
space left on the board.

501
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,083
Hey, Oreki.

502
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,333
Are you doing okay?

503
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,916
Yeah.

504
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,666
I'm just a little overwhelmed
by all this activity, I guess.

505
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,666
[SATOSHI laughs]

506
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,250
This world must be unfathomable

507
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,041
to our energy-conserving
friend here.

508
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,291
Anyway, since this is the first
bulletin board the students see,

509
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,458
it's become a battleground.

510
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,125
Wait, what does that mean?

511
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,416
Oh, right, I get it!

512
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,291
With so many clubs
competing to get noticed,

513
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,500
an unauthorized post
could slip under the radar.

514
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,125
[HOTARO]
That's part of it.

515
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,291
"Part of it"?

516
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,125
Wait, what could some
other reasons be?

517
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,208
You'll see.

518
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,958
Let's just start
looking around, okay?

519
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,291
Right!

520
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,333
[ERU] There's the Environmental
Club, Debate Club,

521
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,333
even a Hundred Poets
Card Game Club.

522
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,833
The Fortune-telling Club!

523
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,166
I have a good friend who just
joined that one this year.

524
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,333
Oh, yeah?

525
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,500
Koto Club. Ping Pong Club.

526
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,083
The Art Club.

527
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,750
It doesn't seem like
there's anything here

528
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,333
for the Joro Spider Society.

529
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,500
I don't know.

530
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,833
You might not be able
to tell what their

531
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,833
secret recruitment note
is just by looking at it.

532
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,916
[ERU]
What? What do you mean by that?

533
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,666
[SATOSHI] Well, they might
have come up with a code

534
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,041
to keep the Executive Committee
from finding them out.

535
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,000
A code. I see.

536
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,166
Uh-huh.

537
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,375
But if it's here,
we're gonna break it.

538
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,125
[HOTARO]
Found something.

539
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,166
[ERU]
Huh?

540
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,291
There it is, all right.

541
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,291
I would imagine they'd
pick a more crowded place

542
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,666
on the board to hide it.

543
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,666
Definitely the work of amateurs.

544
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,375
They're inexperienced first
years trying to be rebels.

545
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,208
If this secret club knew
at all what they were doing,

546
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,750
our job would have
been much harder.

547
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,875
That's a good point.

548
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,375
It's still weird, though.

549
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,791
Their lack of any real skill
is painfully obvious,

550
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,000
now that you mention it.

551
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,833
But I'm not actually
surprised in the least.

552
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,666
No stamp of approval
from the Committee?

553
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,541
Well...

554
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,083
I'd better report this.

555
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,875
[HOTARO]
All right.

556
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm gonna stop by the faculty
room to turn in my essay,

557
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,625
then start to head home.

558
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,791
Yeah, okay.

559
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,208
I guess I'll walk
along with you, then.

560
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,500
It is getting late.

561
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,458
Until the next time
we meet, then, gentlemen.

562
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,916
"Inexperienced first years
trying to be rebels."

563
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,791
I'll never forget that.

564
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,416
Well, your "fight mystery
with mystery" plan

565
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,375
was a real success.
I applaud you.

566
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,875
Yeah, thanks for all your help.

567
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,333
For some reason I had a feeling
she was coming to find us.

568
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,833
[SATOSHI]
Ah!

569
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,041
So that's why you wrote the
note and got the pin ready.

570
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,458
Well, looks like you have
a knack for deception.

571
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,916
I'm curious, though.

572
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,708
Why did you go to
so much trouble to set up

573
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,583
that elaborate ruse
just to distract her

574
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,208
from the music room mystery?

575
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,916
Don't tell me that
silly ghost story

576
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,041
actually freaked you
out or something.

577
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,750
[HOTARO] The music room
was too far away.

578
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,708
Are you kidding?

579
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,291
No, I'm not.

580
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,375
I wanted to find a way to get
us close to the main entrance,

581
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,583
wrap up the mystery so
I could turn in my essay,

582
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,708
and get the heck
out of there fast.

583
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,250
I wish I could
say I'm surprised.

584
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,750
That's typical Hotaro.

585
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,208
Please. I have to know!

586
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,500
If I have to do something,

587
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,375
I'll do it as quickly
as possible. Right?

588
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,375
[SATOSHI]
No way.

589
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,875
You won't get away with that.

590
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,875
If you're gonna
proclaim your motto,

591
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,750
do it with your head held
high and don't paraphrase!

592
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,000
If I didn't know any better,

593
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,541
I'd say you were just
making a sorry excuse.

594
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:38,125
[SATOSHI] Distracting from one
mystery with another mystery?

595
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,458
I approve. Nice curveball.

596
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,875
But you know something, Hotaro?

597
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,791
What you did today
wasn't really your style.

598
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,916
When Chitanda showed up,

599
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,208
why didn't you
just blow her off,

600
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,416
like the lazy bones
we know and love?

601
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,458
That was your fatal
mistake this afternoon.

602
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,208
You'd have been home already.

603
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,958
Sometimes, you don't
know how to best live

604
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,583
by your own motto.

605
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,500
Maybe you're right.

606
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,166
"Inexperienced first years
trying to be rebels."

607
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,125
That's exactly what you were
today, as a matter of fact.

608
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,666
Chitanda is throwing you
off your game, my friend.

609
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,291
I didn't expect that of you.

610
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,666
I wondered why you took
such a meandering detour.

611
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,000
I understand you were trying
to trick Chitanda and all,

612
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,916
but there are
more efficient ways.

613
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,041
Anyway--

614
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,041
I wasn't actually
trying to trick her.

615
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,166
No, of course you weren't.

616
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,666
You were just putting the
situation on hold for later.

617
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,416
On hold?

618
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,500
Oh, yeah. That's right!

619
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,375
[SATOSHI chuckles]

620
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,250
[SATOSHI]
Speaking of the other situation,

621
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,333
what do you make of
the music room thing?

622
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,500
[HOTARO]
Right.

623
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,083
Well, the alleged ghost
had messed-up hair

624
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,125
and bloodshot eyes,
which sounds like someone

625
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,291
who just woke up from a nap.

626
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,458
Oh. You're right.

627
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:46,291
[HOTARO] Some Piano Club
member got sleepy

628
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,791
and decided to have a rest.

629
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,958
She was nervous that
she'd sleep past six o'clock,

630
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,875
when they lock up,
so she set the alarm

631
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,208
on the cd player and
put in "Moonlight Sonata."

632
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,333
It's as simple as that.

633
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:56,708
[SATOSHI]
That makes sense.

634
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:57,916
I'm sure if we'd checked it out,

635
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,875
we'd have known what
happened right away.

636
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,041
The music room was too far away.

637
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,708
Yeah, I hear that.

638
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:05,958
Even so, you know what?

639
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,291
[HOTARO]
Hm?

640
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,291
[SATOSHI] I have a feeling
you wasted a lot of time

641
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,708
by avoiding the trip.

642
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,708
You'd have conserved more
energy by checking it out.

643
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,458
Be careful next time.

644
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:15,708
This might end up costing you
more than you think.

645
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:17,500
[HOTARO]
Hm?

646
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,708
This is me!

647
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:24,833
Don't worry! I don't judge!

648
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,750
And I'm not gonna
hold it over your head!

649
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,833
Bye!

650
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:36,416
[HOTARO]
On hold, huh? Right.

651
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,291
[HOTARO]
Next time:

652
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,833
"The Prestigious Classic
Lit Club's Activities."
