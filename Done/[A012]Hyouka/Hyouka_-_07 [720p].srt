1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,041
[SATOSHI] So, did you watch
the show last night?

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,208
What show?

3
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,541
[SATOSHI]
What do you mean, "what show"?

4
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:13,625
"The News Crew Saw It:

5
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,250
The Startling Truth
Behind 'Hassie,'

6
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:16,833
the Giant Eel of Lake Hamana."

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,750
[MAYAKA]
Oh, yeah. I watched that, too!

8
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,000
Stuff like that always
turns out to be fake.

9
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,583
"Upon seeing the true nature,
he knew it was no ghost,

10
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,958
but a beckoning flower."

11
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,625
You're such a party pooper.

12
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,875
I think legends make
life more exciting!

13
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,375
Chi, you with me?

14
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,375
I am curious as to the veracity
of the monster sightings.

15
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,500
Nobody can say for sure
if the eel exists,

16
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,875
but I hope it does.

17
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,958
It's more fun that way, y'know?

18
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,166
[HOTARO]
There are no ghosts.

19
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,166
Just beckoning flowers.

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,083
[SATOSHI giggles]
Classic Hotaro.

21
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,333
[HOTARO]
The Classic Lit Club consists of

22
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,916
a whopping four members.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,333
All of whom are now being
bounced around on a bus,

24
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,458
headed into the wilderness
for what will surely be

25
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,583
an energy-wasting getaway.
Yippie skippy.

26
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,041
The bus's last stop
is at Zaizen Village,

27
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,666
a place best known
for mountain climbing

28
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,375
and hot springs. The springs
are what we're after.

29
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,666
I've always been of the opinion

30
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,000
that during summer vacation,
one should vacate.

31
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:37,875
But still...

32
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,291
We haven't been together long,

33
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,833
but I feel like the club's
become a tight-knit group.

34
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,500
Since it's summer break,
why don't we all

35
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,458
go to the hot springs?

36
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,291
Huh?

37
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,500
Well, what d'you say?

38
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,458
You wanna go?

39
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,208
[grunts]

40
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,166
[HOTARO]
Yeah... Okay.

41
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,791
[MAYAKA] The shuttle
should be here to get us

42
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,875
any minute now.

43
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,250
Wow. Great view
from up here, huh?

44
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,416
Oreki... You okay?

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,708
You don't look so good.

46
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,041
[HOTARO]
Carsick.

47
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,750
Hotaro wouldn't be
Hotaro if he didn't

48
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,291
find something
to complain about.

49
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,375
The trip was only
an hour and a half.

50
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,625
What a sad sack.

51
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,916
Hey, by the way, thanks
for scoring us rooms.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,083
No problem!

53
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,625
I've got family who
own an inn up here,

54
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,958
and since they're renovating
and can't accept regular guests,

55
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,333
they said we could
stay for free.

56
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,708
[car horn honks]

57
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,291
[ERU]
Come on, Oreki.

58
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,416
--We're here.
--[HOTARO groans]

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,833
[SATOSHI]
Let the vacationing commence!

60
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,958
[MAYAKA] Hop to it, Oreki,
or we'll leave you behind.

61
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,625
[SATOSHI] Let's go! I'm ready
to check out this inn.

62
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,000
[BOTH]
Thank you for coming.

63
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,541
Welcome to Seizanso.

64
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,125
This little darling
is Rie Zenna.

65
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,208
And this is her
younger sister Kayo.

66
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,500
--[ERU] It's a pleasure.
--[SATOSHI] Nice to meetcha.

67
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,625
[MAYAKA]
You girls are in sixth grade

68
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:43,875
and fourth grade, right?

69
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,041
--You've both gotten so tall--
--[RIE] Hug!

70
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,416
Sis! Careful.

71
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,166
[RIE] Your rooms are on the
second floor at the end.

72
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,625
Whoa!

73
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,500
Hotaro, hurry and
check this out!

74
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,750
[HOTARO groans]

75
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:56,833
[SATOSHI]
We got a good room.

76
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,791
Look at this sweet view.

77
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,625
Maybe coming here wasn't
such a terrible idea.

78
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,958
But I still don't know about
the whole "club vacation" thing.

79
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,291
It would be a lot
more relaxing solo.

80
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,250
Except planning a vacation
takes so much energy!

81
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,916
Come on! Cheer up!

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,375
And don't forget that the
only reason this trip happened

83
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,625
was because Chitanda
organized it and Mayaka

84
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,791
hooked us up with
a place to stay.

85
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,916
--[HOTARO growls]
--[knocking]

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,041
[MAYAKA]
Hurry up, you two!

87
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,375
[ERU]
It's time for dinner.

88
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,625
[SATOSHI]
You heard 'em.

89
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,583
Let's get some chow, okay?

90
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,708
[sniffs]

91
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,166
[HOTARO]
I smell cheese.

92
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,416
Quiche? Gratin. Maybe fondue?

93
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,875
[HOTARO]
Or not.

94
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,208
[MAYAKA]
Ready to eat?

95
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,000
[ALL] Thank you
very much for the food!

96
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,000
Be sure to save
room for dessert!

97
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,041
Lemme guess: cheesecake?

98
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,291
How did you know?

99
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,416
I could smell it.

100
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,791
[RIE]
That's amazing!

101
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,000
[HOTARO]
Not really.

102
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,333
[whispers] So that stuff
Maya said was true!

103
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,916
[HOTARO]
What did you tell them?

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,666
[RIE] We're gonna set
off fireworks tomorrow!

105
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,833
[MAYAKA]
That sounds fun.

106
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,291
Yeah, Dad bought some
for us yesterday--

107
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,125
--[KAYO gasps]
--[RIE] Hey!

108
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,041
What are you doin', clumsy?

109
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,083
Oops. I'm really sorry.

110
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,125
[ERU]
Here.

111
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,416
Oh. Thanks, I'll
just clean this up.

112
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,458
Did it burn you?

113
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,541
No, I'm fine.

114
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,208
[RIE]
Geez. Try to be more careful.

115
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,916
Man. I'm really stuffed.

116
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,333
[HOTARO]
No Satoshi.

117
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,375
He must've gone
down to the baths.

118
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,375
I guess the springs
are kinda the point

119
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,916
of this place, huh?

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,500
--[ERU] Oh.
--[HOTARO] Hm?

121
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,416
[ERU] Funny bumping
into you like this.

122
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,666
Where are you headed?

123
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,500
[HOTARO]
Same place as you, I'd guess.

124
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,291
Where's Ibara?

125
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,416
[ERU]
I'm not sure.

126
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,458
She went off with
the girls someplace.

127
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,833
I know this is out of the blue,

128
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,166
but would you mind
telling me a little

129
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,916
about what your sister's like?

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, that's out of
the blue all right.

131
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,250
I guess that you're
curious because

132
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,541
you don't have any siblings.

133
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,291
My sister, huh?

134
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,333
She's a real character for sure.

135
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,291
But she's also pretty brilliant.

136
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,958
I don't think I could outshine
her in any way if I tried.

137
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,000
[ERU]
Wow.

138
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,416
But, of course,
I've never actually

139
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,958
wanted to try, so. Yeah.

140
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,458
[HOTARO] Anyway... What's
with the sudden curiosity?

141
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,000
Seeing the Zenna sisters?

142
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,333
[ERU giggles]
You'll think I'm silly.

143
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,166
But I've always wanted
to have a sibling.

144
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,208
An older sister
or younger brother.

145
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,708
Having somebody around
I could always

146
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,958
feel at home with.

147
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,583
It sounds like a dream to me!

148
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,541
[HOTARO]
A dream, all right.

149
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,041
She's wearing some seriously

150
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,875
rose-colored glasses. Having
a sibling is fine, I guess.

151
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,208
But it's not like
you're guaranteed

152
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,041
to be best friends or anything.

153
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
[ERU] Oh. I guess there's
no mixed bathing here.

154
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,333
[yelps]

155
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,083
[HOTARO]
Of course there's not!

156
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,333
[HOTARO]
Hm?

157
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,875
Satoshi's here.

158
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,750
[door scrapes]

159
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,750
[LITTLE BOY 7A]
Dad, Grandpa, hurry it up!

160
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,833
You're taking forever!

162
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,625
Whoa. It's bigger
than I expected.

Huh?

166
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,458
Well, what d'ya think?
It's nice, huh?

167
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,125
It's like the spring
water is soaking

168
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,833
through my skin all the way
into my bones, y'know?

169
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:28,916
Aren't you worried
that your bones

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,958
are gonna get waterlogged?

171
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,625
I never knew you were
such a funny guy.

172
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,666

jokes and unclenching a bit.

177
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,791
[HOTARO grunts]

178
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,666
[HOTARO pants]

179
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,375
[HOTARO sighs]

180
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,250
[MAYAKA]
Oreki!

181
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,250
Whoa! What happened?

182
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,583
Is he okay?

183
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,583
He overheated.

184
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,833
Huh?

185
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,833
Have you ever heard of
anything so pathetic?

186
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,416
He'd barely even gotten in
before he drooped like a flower

187
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,250
that needs watering.

188
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,916
Yep. That is pretty pathetic.

189
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:31,416
[HOTARO groans]

190
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,958
[SATOSHI sighs]

191
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,375
Sorry I'm being so much trouble.

192
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,375
That's what friends
are for, right?

193
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,500
[sighs] Come on, is it
just physically impossible

194
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,416
for you to enjoy anything?

195
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,583
Apparently so.

196
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,750
It was probably
leftover carsickness.

197
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,833
Must've been.

198
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,291
[knocking]

199
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,791
[door clicks]

200
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:00,666
[footsteps]

201
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,291
[HOTARO]
Is that Chitanda?

202
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,583
[ERU]
Hey, Oreki. Are you all right?

203
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,250
[HOTARO]
Not really.

204
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,041
[grunts]

205
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,875
You still feel really hot.

206
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,416
I can bring you a
cold towel if you want.

207
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,041
[HOTARO]
No! No thanks!

208
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,916
I just wanna sleep.

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,125
I'm sorry for making
such a nuisance of myself.

210
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,500
No, don't worry.

211
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,000
We don't have big
plans for the night,

212
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,916
just telling some ghost stories.

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,916
[HOTARO]
Heh...

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,250
[ERU]
I'm sure it'll be fun.

215
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,291
If you feel better, you
should come join us, okay?

216
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,083
Well. Get some rest.

217
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,458
Thanks.

218
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,958
[sighs]

219
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,208
It's not even eight o'clock yet?

220
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,250
[distant drumming]

221
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,000
[HOTARO]
<i>Taiko</i> drums?

222
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,416
[RIE]
The truth is,

223
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,375
the inn didn't actually
need a second hall.

224
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,708
[HOTARO] I guess they've
got their window open, too.

225
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,166
[RIE]
There's a secret.

226
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,541
[MAYAKA]
A secret?

227
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,666
[RIE]
Long ago.

228
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,166
An old, brooding man
came to stay here.

229
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,666
They put him in Room Seven
of the main hall.

230
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,291
He said he didn't want food.

231
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,041
And he didn't want a futon.

232
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,041
And people should
just leave him alone.

233
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,166
It was strange,
but he paid in advance

234
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,041
and came during the busy season,

235
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,125
so nobody asked any questions.

236
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,833
--However, that night,
--[INNKEEPER 7A screams]

237
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,000
a terrible scream rang out!

238
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,333
--[SATOSHI] Then what?
--[screaming]

239
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,375
[RIE] People looked up
to see the shadowy figure

240
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,541
of a person with a
rope around his neck,

241
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,250
dimly visible, swinging
back and forth.

242
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,375
Rumor had it that the man
had embezzled money

243
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,416
from the company he worked for.

244
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,291
[SATOSHI]
Then what? Then what?

245
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,833
[MAYAKA]
Will you stop that?

246
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,500
[RIE] After it happened,
guests who stayed in Room Seven

247
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,041
said that they could feel
something in there with them.

248
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,208
They could see shadows
mysteriously appearing

249
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,375
during the night.

250
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,458
Finally,

251
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,583
the ninth guest
after the hanged man...

252
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,375
[ERU]
Tell us! What happened?

253
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,750
[RIE] During the night,
he fell suddenly ill...

254
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,958
...and died!

255
00:10:59,041 --> 00:10:59,958
[ERU]
Oh, no!

256
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:00,750
[SATOSHI]
Then what?! Then what?!

257
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,625
[MAYAKA]
I said stop it!

258
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,208
[RIE] Well, first, Grandma
called in an exorcist,

259
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,541
then she had this
second hall built.

260
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,750
So guests could sleep far
away from the haunted room.

261
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,333
[SATOSHI]
Where is Room Seven?

262
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,375
[RIE] There. Look out
the window, straight ahead.

263
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,875
It's that one.

264
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,708
We live down on the
first floor, and we try

265
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,458
not to come up to the
second floor very much.

266
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,333
[MAYAKA]
Hold on!

267
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,000
I thought this was just a story.

268
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,666
[RIE] You can't tell anyone
I told you about this, okay?

269
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,208
[HOTARO]
A local ghost story. How quaint.

270
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,416
Hm?

271
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:49,041
[snoring]

272
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,500
[HOTARO]
Morning.

273
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,250
[RIE]
Oh! Good morning.

274
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,166
[HOTARO]
Good morning. Is anyone else up?

275
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,791
Uh...

276
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,583
[MAYAKA]
I saw it.

277
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,125
[HOTARO]
What d'you mean? Saw what?

278
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,083
I was sleeping so soundly,

279
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,000
then sometime after midnight
a warm breeze woke me up.

280
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,291
And when I rolled over...

281
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,875
I saw the silhouette
of a hanged man

282
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,541
in the room across the way,

283
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,958
slowly swinging back and forth!

284
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,708
[HOTARO] It's pretty rare
to see Ibara so shaken up.

285
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,666
Satoshi's gonna be sad
he missed out on this.

286
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,041
[HOTARO]
Thanks for breakfast.

287
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,500
How were the baths yesterday?

288
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,250
[ERU]
I thought they were fantastic!

289
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,083
Good, I'm glad!

290
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,541
[HOTARO]
Hm?

291
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,625
[RIE] And I hope your futon
was nice and fluffy, too!

292
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,458
[ERU]
Yes, it was perfect, thank you!

293
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,791
[RIE giggles]

294
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,166
[HOTARO] It doesn't look
like there's one for Kayo.

295
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,875
[RIE giggles] Sorry you didn't
sleep so well, Maya,

296
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,041
but I figured you could handle
a little ghost story.

297
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,625
Hey, it's not like I'm scared
of ghosts or anything.

298
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,875
But I know what I saw
through that window.

299
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,750
And it was seriously creepy!

300
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,625
You really saw it? You're sure?

301
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,125
I know what I saw, okay?
Creepy, creepy!

302
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,208
[KAYO] How could you tell
them that story, Rie?

303
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,875
Dad said we were never
supposed to tell anyone!

304
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,541
Who asked you? It's only Maya.

305
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,291
I don't see what
the big deal is.

306
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,750
[gasps]

307
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,916
What's wrong?

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,708
Well... What Mayaka
said she saw...

309
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,125
Do you think it was real?

310
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,916
What--the silhouette
of a hanged man?

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,208
Well, ghost stories are a staple

312
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,125
of these rural areas.
They live on for generations.

313
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,708
So, what are you saying?

314
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,041
Do you really think she saw the
ghost of a man who died here?

315
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,416
No, I don't.

316
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,041
[gasps] In that case, I must
have been mistaken, too.

317
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,041
Mistaken about what?

318
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,875
I saw the same thing she did.

319
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,208
--The shadow of a hanged man.
--[HOTARO gasps]

320
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,708
[ERU] I woke up when Mayaka
started freaking out.

321
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,000
And when I looked
out at the room

322
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,916
across the way, I saw it.

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
[HOTARO]
Oh.

324
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,041
[ERU]
I thought my mind must have been

325
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,291
playing tricks on me.

326
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,625
But if she and I both
saw the same thing...

327
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,875
You both must have
mistook what you saw.

328
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,000
Like in that saying.

329
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,833
The one Satoshi
quoted on the bus.

330
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,583
It was nothing but
a beckoning flower?

331
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,583
[HOTARO]
Mm-hm.

332
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,875
Well, if that's true,

333
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,666
what was it we
were really seeing?

334
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,666
--[grunts]
--[MAYAKA] Yeah!

335
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,291
If you're so smart,
tell us what we were

336
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,291
actually looking at!

337
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,541
--Wait, why should I have to--

338
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,333
--[ERU] Oreki!
--Wait, why should I have to--

339
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,500
Investigate this with us!

340
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,541
Will you? I have to know!

341
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,541
[sighs]

342
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,708
[MAYAKA]
I'm sorry, Chi!

343
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,458
I wanna help,
but I promised Rie

344
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,875
I'd look over her homework.

345
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,250
You can leave it to us.

346
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,666
Oreki and I will get to
the bottom of this mystery!

347
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,291
Isn't that right?

348
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,375
[HOTARO]
As if I had a choice.

349
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,208
We don't have to go far, anyway.

350
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,333
That's some
consolation at least.

351
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,666
[HOTARO]
Okay.

352
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,375
So you saw this shadow-thing
in the room directly

353
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,708
across from yours, right?

354
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,125
Yes, that's where we saw it.

355
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,583
[HOTARO]
How big was it?

356
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,166
It's not like it was huge,
but it wasn't small either.

357
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,250
And the shape?

358
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,666
[ERU]
Well, it's hard to say exactly.

359
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,750
The color?

360
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,541
[ERU]
I don't know. It was in shadow.

361
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,916
Yeah, right.

362
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,791
Whatever it was, it was lit
from behind so it looked

363
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,416
like the silhouette of a person.

364
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,875
[ERU]
That's how it seemed to me.

365
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,541
So then it was backlit.

366
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,166
Around here, the only
source of light

367
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,750
at night would
have been the moon.

368
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,416
That's what I was thinking, too.

369
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,125
And the moon was bright
enough that it could have

370
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,541
lit something up.
Do you think that means--

371
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,375
[ERU gasps]

372
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,916
The shutters.

373
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,458
So what time did you finish
your stories and go to sleep?

374
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,000
[ERU]
About ten, I think.

375
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,333
And the shutters then?

376
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,166
[ERU] I believe they were
closed at that point.

377
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,166
Huh.

378
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,458
If the shutters
were closed then,

379
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,833
there's no way there
could have been a shadow.

380
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,041
Which means we've run
into a little snag.

381
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,958
At this point, our best
bet is to check out

382
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,375
Room Seven in the main hall.

383
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,625
This is so fun, don't you think?

384
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,791
I'm extra-glad we came
to this place now!

385
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,416
[HOTARO]
And I'm extra-wishing we hadn't.

386
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,375
[footsteps]

387
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,500
[HOTARO]
Hey!

388
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,833
Oh. Yes. Hello.

389
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:28,958
You talk.

390
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,250
--[ERU] Huh?
--I really suck with kids.

391
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,000
[ERU]
Oh, okay.

392
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,750
Kayo, can we borrow
you for a sec?

393
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,083
Oreki and I would like
to have a look around

394
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,208
in the main hall.

395
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,708
The main hall? Why? What for?

396
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,416
We're investigating
the creepy shadow

397
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,000
we talked about this morning.

398
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,666
If it's not too much
trouble, maybe you could

399
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,333
show us Room Seven?

400
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,208
I'm really sorry, but I
don't think I should do that.

401
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,458
If I did, my sister
would get mad at me.

402
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,208
Okay, at least
tell us one thing.

403
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,625
Is the supposedly haunted room
still used for guests?

404
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,958
No, it's not.

405
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,416
In the main hall, the baths
and the dining room

406
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,875
are the only areas where
the guests are allowed.

407
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,500
So, the room's vacant then?

408
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,625
[KAYO] The whole second floor
is used for storage now.

409
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,125
Please. May I go?

410
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,250
Of course. You've been
very help... ful.

411
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,250
There, you see? She hates me.

412
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,416
No, I doubt it.

413
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,000
She probably finds
all boys intimidating.

414
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,708
What a sweet girl!

415
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,291
[HOTARO]
Mm...

416
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,083
[ERU] Is it a big problem
that we can't get in

417
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,291
to see the room?

418
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,083
[HOTARO] Not so much
a problem as a hassle.

419
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,458
This would be easier if
we could inspect the scene.

420
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,541
Oh! I remember doing these, too.

421
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,916
[HOTARO]
Hm?

422
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,750
[ERU]
Morning radio calisthenics.

423
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,750
I went to them up until
the year before last.

424
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,958
[HOTARO] Until her second
year of middle school?

425
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,166
Seriously?

426
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,083
[ERU] We should check
around the other side.

427
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,041
[HOTARO grunts]

428
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:54,916
The ground's muddy.

429
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,416
Did it rain last night?

430
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,625
Yeah. A little.

431
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,500
[HOTARO] In order to create
a shadow that you would see

432
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,958
from your room across the way,

433
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,541
both the east and
west side shutters

434
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,958
would have to have been open.

435
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,375
[KAYO]
Excuse me.

436
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,166
If you're hungry,
lunch is ready.

00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,541

Well, back to work!

438
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,375
[KAYO]
Thank you for joining us.

439
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,833
Just look at those two together!

440
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,375
It must be nice.

441
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,375
Having a sister, you mean?
So do you wish that you had one?

442
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,791
Yeah. Kinda.

443
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,208
So, find anything out?

444
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,708
No.

445
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,541
We're just getting started.
I do have a theory, though.

446
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,125
Yeah? Then let's hear.

447
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,000
Huh?

448
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,333
[SATOSHI]
Enough of this.

449
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,000
What are you
three talking about?

450
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,291
It isn't nice to leave
a buddy in the dark.

451
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,000
If you're so anxious
to be kept in the loop,

452
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,750
then quit disappearing
all the time.

453
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,500
We never see you.

454
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,541
I'm being polite, okay.

455
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,166
It's good manners to visit
the hot springs repeatedly.

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,416

Ta-dah!

00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,250
Well. Like my yukata?

00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,875
Wow! It's lovely.

460
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:55,875
Looks great!

I finally got one

462
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,375
at the beginning
of summer vacation.

463
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,875
[MAYAKA]
You've said you wanted one...

464
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,500
[whispering] Can't say
I'm impressed.

465
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,000
What's wrong with it?

466
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,041
You see the sash?

467
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,208
It's not the real deal.

468
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,833
Well, it looks
real enough to me.

469
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,125
You're the last
person I'd come to

470
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,791
for fashion advice.

471
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,041
Check out the bow.

472
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,083
It's a separate piece
clipped onto the sash.

473
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't acknowledge
that as a yukata.

474
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,583
[HOTARO]
I acknowledge you as ridiculous.

Hm?

00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,041
[HOTARO]
That stupid shadow.

480
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,583
It's got me as jumpy
as those other two.

481
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,458
Wanna go back to
the same spring?

482
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,083
Sure!

483
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,708
[HOTARO]
The hanged silhouette.

484
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,458
It's the product of Chitanda's
and Ibara's false impression,

485
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,125
nothing more. Just a
beckoning flower.

486
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,833
We're still missing
a piece of the puzzle.

487
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,166
[ERU]
Let's walk back together.

488
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,166
[HOTARO]
Satoshi's here.

489
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,833
[HOTARO]
All right.

490
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,666
You finished eating at the
inn the same time we did.

491
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,416
So how'd you end up
getting here before us?

492
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,666
Well,

493
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,000
if you slide down the
cliff behind Seizanso,

494
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,625
you end up at a spot
right behind this spring.

495
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,208
[HOTARO] Sliding down
a cliff just to save

496
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,375
a couple of minutes?
That's vintage Satoshi.

497
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,375
[sighs]

498
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,125
[HOTARO]
I don't have an explanation

499
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,208
that will satisfy Chitanda yet.

500
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,541
The source of the
shadow is easy enough.

501
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:32,291
The question is, how did
it wind up in Room Seven?

502
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,833
Hotaro, you're not gonna
faint again, are you?

503
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,291
Hey.

504
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,250
Tell me about last night--
anything interesting happen?

505
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,666
Besides the whole
fainting thing?

506
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,041
Yes, besides that!

507
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,333
[SATOSHI]
Well, we all told ghost stories.

508
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,541
And I was surrounded by more
girls than I could handle.

509
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,916
No, something more official.

510
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,333
Oh, sure. There was
a summer festival.

511
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,208
You heard the
<i>taiko</i> drums, right?

512
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,458
[HOTARO]
<i>Taiko</i> drums.

513
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,291
That's it! A summer festival!

514
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,125
That explains everything!

515
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,250
So? That mean something?

516
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,208
Ah!

517
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,416
[HOTARO] I know what
the shadow really was.

518
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,708
Probably...

519
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,250
I think it was a yukata
hanging on a hanger.

520
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,666
Huh?

521
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,208
[ERU]
But why would there be a yukata

522
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,750
hanging in that room?

523
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,458
And for that matter,
why would someone

524
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,166
leave the shutters
open to display it?

525
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,416
[HOTARO]
Displaying it wasn't the point.

526
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,291
So...?

527
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,250
It was hanging there to dry.

528
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,291
The yukata was wet.

529
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,708
The reason the
shutters were open

530
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,916
was to let the breeze through,

531
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,916
so that it would
dry more quickly.

532
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,458
But, why?

533
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,750
[HOTARO]
It rained last night.

534
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:40,875
That's not what I mean.

535
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,500
Why was it in Room Seven?

536
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,875
Because in a deserted room,

537
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,250
no one would see that it
had been hung up to dry.

538
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,875
Except we saw it.

539
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,166
True.

540
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,333
But it's the family
they were hiding it from.

541
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,166
The family?

542
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,916
[HOTARO]
The person who hung it there...

543
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,125
...was Kayo.

544
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,291
Kayo was envious
of Rie's yukata,

545
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,666
and she wanted to wear it.

546
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,041
But I doubt Rie would
lend it to her.

547
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,291
[ERU]
But why not? They're sisters.

548
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,500
[HOTARO] Didn't you notice?
Rie marks all her stuff.

549
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,125
She makes it clear which cup,

550
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:14,000
which radio calisthenics card,
and which ball is hers.

551
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,791
That kind of person
isn't going to lend out

552
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,791
her most treasured possession.

553
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,625
[ERU]
Oh.

554
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,666
[HOTARO] But Kayo still
wanted to borrow it.

555
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,500
So she snuck it out
of the inn and wore it

556
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,625
to the summer
festival last night.

557
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,125
This would've been
around eight o'clock.

558
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,958
[ERU]
Kayo went to the festival?

559
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,458
[HOTARO]
That's my theory.

560
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,458
I saw someone leaving the
place at eight last night.

561
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,625
[HOTARO] And Kayo wasn't
there when you were

562
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,375
telling ghost stories, right?

563
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,166
[ERU]
Yeah, you're right.

564
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,291
She wasn't there.

565
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,750
Unfortunately for Kayo,

566
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,291
she ran into some bad
luck at the festival.

567
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,666
It started raining.

568
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,166
The rain let up quickly,
but the yukata still got wet.

569
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,375
Kayo remembered that we would

570
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,583
be setting off
fireworks the next day.

571
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,291
And Rie would surely wanna
wear the yukata for that.

572
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,000
If it wasn't dry by tomorrow,

573
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,625
Rie would know what
she'd done for sure.

574
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,625
[HOTARO]
The family would see it

575
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,375
on the main hall's first floor.

576
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,666
And the other hall was
where we were staying.

577
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,958
She couldn't use the dryer
in the middle of the night.

578
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,125
So, she waited for
everyone to go to sleep

579
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,250
and dried the yukata
in the most distant room

580
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,333
on the second floor.

581
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,833
But poor Kayo's
bad luck continued.

582
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,208
Moonlight shone in
through the open window,

583
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,625
illuminating the
yukata's silhouette.

584
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,791
[HOTARO]
And then, to make matters worse,

585
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,541
we started investigating
the mysterious shadow.

586
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,708
Kayo must have been
a nervous wreck.

587
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,000
[HOTARO] That must have
been her shadow I saw.

588
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,208
Sneaking between
the sliding doors.

589
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,291
Kayo...

590
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,083
[HOTARO] She put the yukata
back early in the morning.

591
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,958
Unlike Rie, Kayo went to
radio calisthenics every day.

592
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,083
It would've been easy
enough to return it.

593
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,125
[ERU]
So that's it then.

594
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,458
[HOTARO] I'm not going
to tell Ibara about this.

595
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,750
I think it's kind of
a family matter.

596
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,208
[ERU]
If that's true...

597
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,875
...then it means that
the two of them

598
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,208
don't actually get along.

599
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,416
[ERU]
I mean,

600
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,916
a sister who won't
lend you her yukata...

601
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,750
[ERU sighs]

602
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,291
That's just how
it is with siblings.

603
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,583
--Sometimes you fight.
--[ERU] You know, I...

604
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,250
[ERU]
I wanted a sibling.

605
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,541
An older sister
I could look up to.

606
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,083
Or a younger brother
I could look out for.

607
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,791
[HOTARO] Is Chitanda's idea
of the perfect sibling real,

608
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,000
or is it a beckoning flower?

609
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,541
So hot.

610
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,291
You ready?

611
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,875
Yeah.

612
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,041
[gasps]

613
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,291
Well, maybe it's actually
a little bit of both.

614
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,458
[ERU] Next time:
"Let's Go To the Screening!"
