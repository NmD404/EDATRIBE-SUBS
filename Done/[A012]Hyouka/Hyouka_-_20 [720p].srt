00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,583
[HOTARO shivering]

2
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,000
[HOTARO]
Hey, Chitanda.

3
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,833
Isn't there a superstition
that whatever you do

4
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:24,208
on New Year's Day, you'll
end up doing all year long?

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,000
[ERU]
Well, yeah. Maybe.

6
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,875
But that doesn't make much
sense, if you think about it.

7
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,416
Otherwise, it would
mean that if you took

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,041
New Year's Day off,
then you would be off

9
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,000
for the rest of the year,
which is completely ridiculous.

10
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,125
How could that ever happen?

11
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,333
[HOTARO]
Oh, right.

12
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,750
[ERU]
Anyway, Oreki... Not to be rude,

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,666
but right now I am a
little bit more concerned

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,250
about our current
predicament than I am

15
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,666
about the next 364 days.

16
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:52,166
[HOTARO sighs]
How did we end up in this state?

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,083
[ERU]
That's a good question.

18
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,791
I'd say it's mostly because you
picked an unlucky fortune,

19
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,000
wouldn't you?

20
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:36,208
[phone ringing]

21
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,416
[HOTARO]
Yes?

22
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,333
[ERU] Hello, this is
Eru Chitanda speaking.

23
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,833
Is that you, Oreki?

24
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:41,833
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

25
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,041
[ERU]
I was wondering...

26
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you have any plans
for New Years' Day?

27
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,791
No plans so far.

28
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,250
[ERU]
Great!

29
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,500
Well, do you want to visit
the Arekusu Shrine that day?

30
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,833
[HOTARO]
Visit the shrine?

31
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,166
[ERU]
Yes.

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,916
Mayaka said she got a job
there over the holidays.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,416
She's working as an attendant.

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,208
That's not really up her alley.

35
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,916
[ERU] That's not very
nice of you, Oreki.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,416
Fukube said that
it sounds like fun

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,750
and that he'll be
joining us, as well.

38
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,375
And I was thinking...

39
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,166
[HOTARO] Thinking what?
Is there something else?

40
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,333
[ERU] It's not a big deal or
anything, I just had an idea.

41
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,416
I kind of feel like
wearing my kimono,

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,958
but I'm a little nervous.

43
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,500
[HOTARO]
Oh.

44
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,041
[HOTARO]
It's cold.

45
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,625
[HOTARO]
It's New Year's, all right.

46
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,875
I guess a lot of people like
to get dressed up for it.

47
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,541
Ah! Hello, Oreki!

48
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,541
Happy New Year.

49
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,333
I hope it brings you luck.

50
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh...

51
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,125
Happy New Year and
luck to you, as well.

52
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,250
I'm excited to
continue our friendship.

53
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,000
May it grow throughout the year.

54
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, yes, may it continue
to flourish and prosper.

55
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,250
I wanted to show
off this outfit tonight!

56
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,083
Well, then. Shall we go in now?

57
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,625
Huh? Yeah.

58
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,708
[HOTARO]
Can I carry that?

59
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:35,791
[ERU]
Huh?

60
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,041
Yes, that would
be really helpful.

61
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,791
Thanks for offering.

62
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,625
[HOTARO]
What is it?

63
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,250
[ERU]
A bottle of saké.

64
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,166
My family does business
with the priests here,

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,041
so I wanted to bring them
a New Year's present

66
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,583
from my father.

67
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,458
[HOTARO] Running around bringing
New Year's gifts to priests?

68
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,833
Sounds like a hassle.

69
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,333
The real hassle was
running around all day today.

70
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,791
I spent all morning and
afternoon visiting relatives

71
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,791
and paying respects.

72
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,291
What were you up to today?
Anything interesting?

73
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,708
What did I do?

74
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,625
[HOTARO] I got in some
good practice on my

75
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,125
hermit crab impression.

76
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,875
[TV show music playing]

77
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,000
Hermit crab?

78
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,500
[HOTARO] Never mind,
it was a stupid joke.

79
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,458
Where's Satoshi?

80
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,833
I don't know.

81
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,250
Mayaka's the one who talked
to him about coming here

82
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,458
with us tonight.

83
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,291
Oh, you know what, Oreki?

84
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,458
Hmm?

85
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,666
Why don't we start
by offering our prayers?

86
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,166
[HOTARO]
Okay, I wanna get this right.

87
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,333
May I only expend a
moderate amount of energy

88
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,791
for this entire year.

89
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,750
Excuse us, is anyone here?

90
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,833
May I help you?

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,833
Hello, sir.

92
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,583
A very Happy New Year to you.

93
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,250
On behalf of Tetsugo Chitanda
and the rest of our family,

94
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,708
I've come to pay my respects.

95
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,541
I'm his daughter, Eru Chitanda.

96
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,291
Hotaro Oreki, tagging along.

97
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,458
Oh, so you're
Tetsugo's little girl?

98
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,458
Please, come in.
Make yourself at home.

99
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,166
I'll go and get Kaho.

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,916
Thanks, and pardon
the intrusion.

101
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,708
[HOTARO] So this is a
genuine shrine priestess?

102
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,250
Very distinguished.

103
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,833
Happy New Year.

104
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,583
I hope it brings you luck.

105
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,458
And I look forward to
happy relations with you

106
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,125
in the coming year, too.

107
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,250
Happy New Year.

108
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,833
May it bring you luck, as well.

109
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,708
I have brought a bottle of
saké as a gift from my father.

110
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,541
I do hope you will accept it.

111
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,333
[HOTARO] So this must be
how the other half lives.

112
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,958
Thank you for your generosity.

113
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,208
I accept this gift.

114
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,500
Well, uh...
It's nothing super fancy.

115
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,666
[ERU laughs]

116
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,416
Please, Oreki.
It's not your place to say that.

117
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,583
We don't want it
if it isn't fancy.

118
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:18,458
What?

119
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,708
Oh, don't scare him like that.

120
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,000
Please accept our gift.

121
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,250
Though it really
is nothing special.

122
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,291
[HOTARO]
They're messing with me,

123
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,875
and I freaked out like a dork.

124
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,916
You're in class 1-B,
isn't that right?

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,250
Yeah, I am.

126
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,708
[KAHO] I thought Fukube
was coming with you guys.

127
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,916
[HOTARO]
How does she know that?

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,458
Divine psychic powers?

129
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,958
This is Kaho Jumonji.
She's also in class 1-B.

130
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,541
You mean we're classmates?

131
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,208
[BOTH laugh]

132
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,791
We'd like to see Mayaka Ibara.
Do you know where she is?

133
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,333
Ibara? Oh, that girl.

134
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,375
This will take you right
to the back of the kiosks.

135
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,625
You can go on ahead.

136
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,000
[ERU]
Hey, Mayaka!

137
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,750
Oh. Chi, you made it!

138
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,208
[ERU] That hairstyle looks
really pretty on you!

139
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,333
[MAYAKA] That's 'cause
they did it for me!

140
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,666
Don't stare.

141
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,833
Happy New Year.

142
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,791
I hope that it brings you luck.

143
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,083
Happy New Year!

144
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,833
Look at your kimono!
It's so beautiful!

145
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,541
Thank you for saying so!

146
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,625
Is it long-sleeved?

147
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,208
No, it's the normal pattern.

148
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,083
I'm not allowed to wear
the ones with long sleeves

149
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,625
until I go to college.

150
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,625
I'll be getting out of here
in about an hour or so.

151
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,166
What are you guys gonna do?

152
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,208
I think we'll just stay
in the main hall area

153
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,708
and wait for you to get done.

154
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,958
Where is Fukube?

155
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,666
He was here earlier in the day.

156
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,625
He went home to watch
some drama on TV.

157
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,791
What was it called?
<i>Dark Clouds: Odani Castle</i> ?

158
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,000
I think that's it.

159
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,708
He should be back in
a little while, though.

160
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,000
So Ibara, what do they
have you selling in there?

161
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,333
Just fortunes.

162
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,541
I also give change,
and it's the lost and found

163
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,625
for kids and belongings.

164
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,250
The parishioners who volunteer
are a little overzealous,

165
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,250
so if anything at all gets
found, they bring it right here.

166
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,708
It was way busier earlier today.

167
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,375
Lost children everywhere.

168
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,916
[HOTARO] Don't remember
asking, but great.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,750
A new year's fortune
sounds like fun.

170
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll take one of those.

171
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,708
[MAYAKA]
Okay, pick one out, then!

172
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,916
Sure.

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,458
[MAYAKA]
Whoa, that purse is amazing!

174
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,791
I've never seen one
so fancy in real life!

175
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,541
[ERU]
Thanks, I'm glad you like it!

176
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,333
You're so darn happy.

177
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,041
Yep!

178
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,125
[MAYAKA]
Here you go.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,541
I got number 10!

180
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,791
Here, Oreki, do you wanna play?

181
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:29,916
Uh-huh.

182
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,583
--Here.
--Thanks.

183
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,500
[ERU]
Wow! Great luck!

184
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,166
[MAYAKA]
That's awesome, Chi!

185
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,250
[ERU]
Yeah!

186
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,625
Number 16.

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,125
[ERU] Did you get
a good one too, Oreki?

188
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,500
[HOTARO]
Uh, nah, but it's fine.

189
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,916
I still think it's going
to be a really great year.

190
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,250
If you say so, sir.

191
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,875
I've never known anyone who got

192
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,875
a bad luck fortune
before tonight!

193
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,125
You're really that
excited by my bad luck?

194
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,083
I'm so sorry.

195
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,458
No, I'm not excited,

196
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,250
and I can understand
if it's bothering you.

197
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,291
Fine, gimme my curse.

198
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,375
[ERU]
Kaho!

199
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,416
Oh, I'm sorry, Eru.
I forgot to offer you tea.

200
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,833
[ERU]
No, never mind that.

201
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,541
Did something
happen around here?

202
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,375
One of the part-timers
knocked over some pots

203
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,625
and made a mess.

204
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,416
Now we have to whip up
a ton of dumpling soup

205
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,541
and sweet saké on
the fly for the guests.

206
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,791
Oh, that's terrible.
Was she burned?

207
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,666
[KAHO]
No, it missed her, thankfully.

208
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,708
I want to help you.

209
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,083
[KAHO]
Not so fast!

210
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,333
There's no way I'd let
you cook dressed like that!

211
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,500
Well, is there anything else
I can do to be of assistance?

212
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,333
Yeah, could you
bring in some saké lees

213
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,583
from the storehouse?

214
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,791
They're right to your left
when you walk in,

215
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,000
so you should be able
to recognize them.

216
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,083
So sorry.

217
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,000
It's fine!

218
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,083
I'll tag along and help you.

219
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,791
[HOTARO]
The storehouse...

220
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,583
I think I remember seeing
it by the Inari statue.

221
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,583
Whew, it's freezing.

222
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,625
Let's hurry up and
get this over with.

223
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,041
[HOTARO]
That's not very secure.

224
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,791
I really hope there's
a light in here, at least.

225
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,833
Me, too.

226
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,291
[HOTARO] There's nothing
but a wall to the left,

227
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,625
where she said.

228
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,291
You think that she could
have meant farther inside?

229
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,125
[ERU]
Yeah. That's possible.

230
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,958
[HOTARO] I thought this would
just be a quick errand,

231
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,083
but it's turning out
to be a pain.

232
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,458
[ERU]
Hey, Oreki.

233
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,416
This place...
It is a shed, right?

234
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,791
[HOTARO]
Yeah, I think so.

235
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,625
You could call it a shed
or maybe even a shack.

236
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,083
Is this really the right place?

237
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,750
[ERU]
No, the storehouse.

238
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,583
[HOTARO]
Huh?

239
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,666
[ERU]
This isn't it.

240
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,708
Kaho said to look
in the storehouse.

241
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,416
Oh, my family doesn't
have a storehouse,

242
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,000
so I just got confused!
[giggles]

243
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,333
[HOTARO]
I can't say that.

244
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,541
[HOTARO] When did you
plan on mentioning it?

245
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,333
[ERU] Sorry about that,
Oreki, it just dawned on me.

246
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,083
I remembered that the
<i>mikoshi</i> storage room

247
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,958
is right next to the
shrine office, though.

248
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,458
[HOTARO]
Then let's head over there.

249
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,541
[PARISHIONER 20B] Oh.
Someone left this unlocked.

250
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,708
I'll fix that!

251
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,000
[HOTARO]
Please say he didn't!

252
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,416
--[door rattles]
--[HOTARO grunts]

253
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,791
[ERU]
Hey, what's the matter?

254
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,708
[HOTARO]
We're locked in here.

255
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,083
[HOTARO]
Sorry.

256
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,416
This is all because
I made one stupid mistake.

257
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,333
[ERU] No. It's just as
much my fault as yours.

258
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,750
And anyway, it's not our
fault we got locked in.

259
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,750
[HOTARO sighs]

260
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,166
All right. Well...
I'm gonna yell for help.

261
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm about to scream as loud
as I can, so cover your ears.

262
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,666
[ERU]
Hold on! Wait!

263
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,916
[HOTARO]
Ah... Ah...

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,583
[ERU] Please don't
draw attention to us!

265
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,875
[HOTARO gasps]

266
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,916
[ERU]
Ah! I'm very sorry.

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,083
It's just...
You can't yell for help.

268
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,333
[HOTARO]
'Kay?

269
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,750
[ERU]
Because...

270
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,583
If someone out there hears
and comes to let us out...

271
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,291
What will happen after that?

272
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,041
[HOTARO] Well, I imagine
they'd rush over,

273
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,416
unbar the door, and we'd be
free to finish what we started.

274
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,166
[ERU] But how would it look
when they opened the door

275
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,708
and found us together?

276
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,875
[HOTARO]
What do you mean?

277
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,291
[ERU] All of those
parishioners...

278
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,041
They know my family.

279
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,250
If they came to rescue us,
they would recognize me,

280
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,875
and if they saw us
in here together,

281
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,083
they would misunderstand!

282
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,250
I am only here tonight
to represent my father.

283
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,583
If it were another night,
it might be different,

284
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,333
but tonight would be
the worst possible time

285
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,500
for them to find us.

286
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,458
It would be a major scandal!

287
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,875
[HOTARO sighs]

288
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,708
[HOTARO] I guess I just
don't understand her world.

289
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,791
[HOTARO]
I hear that.

290
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,458
What do you propose we do?

291
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,750
If someone comes in to get
something and finds us alone,

292
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,500
not making a peep,
they're definitely gonna get

293
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,041
the wrong idea.

294
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,458
[ERU] The only people here who
wouldn't jump to conclusions

295
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,250
are Kaho and Mayaka.

296
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,333
[HOTARO]
True.

297
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,250
[ERU gasps]
Oh my gosh!

298
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,000
I just had the greatest idea!

299
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:03,750
[HOTARO]
Yeah?

300
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,125
[ERU]
Our cell phones!

301
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,083
We can just shoot them a
text and they'll let us out!

302
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,166
[HOTARO] I can't believe we
didn't think of that before.

303
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,291
Go ahead, then.

304
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,500
[ERU] I didn't bring
my phone with me.

305
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,916
We'll have to use yours.

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,291
[HOTARO]
I don't have one.

307
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,125
[ERU gasps]
That's terrible!

308
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,916
How are we going
to get out of here?

309
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,166
[HOTARO] Well, we can't
take the door off its hinges

310
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,333
from this side.

311
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,416
[ERU]
You know... Forget this.

312
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,041
I didn't know you didn't
have a cell phone,

313
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,083
and that's why I said
not to shout for help.

314
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,583
I thought we had options.

315
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,666
I just blanked for a few
minutes on who to call,

316
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,291
but when it dawned on me,
it didn't matter anymore.

317
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,750
[HOTARO]
Mm-hmm.

318
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,416
[ERU] But desperate times
call for desperate measures.

319
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,958
So go ahead and yell.

320
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,375
I'd rather risk my reputation
than risk either of us

321
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,708
catching a cold.

322
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,458
[HOTARO] But you wouldn't
be too happy about it

323
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,250
if they were to misunderstand.

324
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,125
Look, we'll only shout
out for help as a last resort.

325
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,833
Until then, let's brainstorm for
anything else we could try.

326
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,625
[ERU]
This is awful.

327
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,250
[HOTARO] We can't move
the bar, call out,

328
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,041
or take the door off its hinges,

329
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,958
but there are still
four avenues of escape

330
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,291
we haven't explored yet,
so don't give up.

331
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,166
[ERU]
What? There are that many?

332
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,041
[HOTARO]
Yeah.

333
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,916
One, we kick the door down.

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,833
Two, we tear down
one of the walls.

335
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,291
Three, we dig a tunnel to the
outside through the floor.

336
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,708
Four, we bust a hole
through the ceiling.

337
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,916
[ERU] No way!
We can't do any of that!

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,291
To you it may
just be an old shed,

339
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,958
but it's still one of
the Arekusu shrine's

340
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,416
sacred buildings!

341
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,291
[HOTARO]
Yeah, you're right. Silly me.

342
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,875
--[ERU gasps]
--[HOTARO] Huh?

343
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,708
[ERU] It looks like
someone's coming this way!

344
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,708
[ERU] It's a parishioner
volunteer making his rounds.

345
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,916
And from what I can tell,

346
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,125
it looks like he found
a cell phone strap.

347
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,375
[HOTARO]
You can see that?

348
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,541
[ERU] Really well.
I have great night vision.

349
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,125
[HOTARO]
What is she, a wild animal?

350
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,083
[ERU]
Oh, good, he's walking away.

351
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,291
He's going to drop it off
at the shrine office.

352
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,416
[HOTARO]
The shrine office.

353
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,958
[HOTARO] Listen, Chitanda,
do you think it'd be okay

354
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,166
to break open the wall
just a little?

355
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,416
[HOTARO] Ibara mentioned
earlier that any time someone

356
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,750
drops something of value,
the parishioners bring it over

357
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,333
to the shrine office.

358
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,583
Well, right now, Ibara is
in charge of lost items.

359
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,958
[ERU]
Right.

360
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,458
[HOTARO] So we can drop
something out there

361
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,416
that obviously
belongs to one of us.

362
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,166
When they bring it to her,
she would recognize it

363
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,458
and pay closer attention
to it than other things.

364
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,625
If we could somehow convey our
current predicament to her,

365
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,625
she would come let us out!

366
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,166
[ERU]
That might work!

367
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,791
[HOTARO] Whether or not she
makes the connection to the shed

368
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,208
is the hard part, so we'll
need all the luck we can get.

369
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,583
Let's just hope she gets it.

370
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,500
[ERU]
We could drop my handkerchief.

371
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,416
I'm pretty sure Mayaka has
seen me use it several times.

372
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,375
[HOTARO]
Perfect.

373
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,666
That's what we'll use, then.

374
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,291
[pounding noise]

375
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,625
[HOTARO] Okay, Chitanda,
drop your handkerchief

376
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,291
through the hole.

377
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,583
[ERU]
Oh. Right!

378
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,583
[HOTARO]
Please let this work.

379
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,166
Ah. Jumonji.

380
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,875
Happy New Year to ya!

381
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,625
Happy New Year to you, as well.

382
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,916
Hey, have you seen Eru,
by any chance?

383
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,291
[SATOSHI]
Chitanda?

384
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,250
I just got here, so I haven't
run into anyone yet.

385
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,833
[KAHO]
Oh.

386
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,625
Sorry I can't show you around,
but you can go in on your own.

387
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,000
The stove is on in the
great hall, if you're cold.

388
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,666
[SATOSHI] I always feel so
awkward around Jumonji.

389
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,541
[SATOSHI]
Mayaka!

390
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,000
Fuku, hey.

391
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,500
[SATOSHI] Is she still
embarrassed about her

392
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,958
attendant outfit?

393
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,083
It must be pretty hard
to work in the cold.

394
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,375
You're a real trooper.

395
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,625
[MAYAKA]
Mm-hmm.

396
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,000
But enough about me,
how was your show?

397
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,583
It was an absolute
masterpiece!

398
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,625
I couldn't have asked for
a better start to the year!

399
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,041
Really?

400
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, that's right.

401
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,750
Look, Fuku, does this
handkerchief look familiar?

402
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,875
Sure doesn't.

403
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,583
It looks a lot like
one that Chi has,

404
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,250
but I'm not really sure.

405
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,583
It's convenient
that you might know

406
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,375
who the owner is,
don't you think?

407
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,000
When you see Chitanda
in a little while,

408
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,541
you can ask her about it.

409
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,416
Oh, yeah.
You're right, I can!

410
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,708
[ERU]
We're done. Help isn't coming.

411
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,208
[HOTARO shivers]

412
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,666
I thought that our handkerchief
plan would work for sure,

413
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,250
but it seems that alone
isn't gonna cut it.

414
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,875
[ERU] I guess my hanky
didn't leave a strong

415
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,375
enough impression.

416
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,791
[HOTARO] All right!
Now it's time to execute plan B.

417
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,458
My wallet should do the trick.

418
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,083
[PARISHIONER 20B]
Here, found this, too.

419
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,208
[MAYAKA]
Thanks.

420
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,833
[MAYAKA]
Hey, Fuku, look at this!

421
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,083
[SATOSHI] That's Hotaro's
wallet, isn't it?

422
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,291
Looks like that moron
must have dropped it.

423
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,791
And to make matters worse,
it's been emptied out, too.

424
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,041
[SATOSHI]
What's that?

425
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,625
[MAYAKA]
That's the fortune he drew.

426
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,958
Whoa!

427
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,625
[SATOSHI] Hotaro drew bad
luck and it came true.

428
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,833
But this is strange.

429
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,833
Except for that fortune,
his wallet's empty.

430
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,166
[SATOSHI]
Mayaka.

431
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,375
I want to draw one
of those fortunes, too.

432
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,166
Seems like yours might
be the real deal.

433
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,791
[HOTARO shivering]

434
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,041
[ERU]
Help isn't coming, is it?

435
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,125
[HOTARO]
No.

436
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,083
[ERU sneezes]

437
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,541
[HOTARO]
Are you feeling okay?

438
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,083
[ERU]
Yeah.

439
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,625
I'm regretting the decision
not to wear my haori, though.

440
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,958
[HOTARO]
Haori?

441
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,458
[ERU] It's a coat that you
wear over your kimono.

442
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,666
[HOTARO]
Right.

443
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,166
I really wish I had worn
a trenchcoat myself

444
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,000
right about now.

445
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,208
[ERU] It feels like it's
getting chillier, too.

446
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,041
[HOTARO shivering]

447
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,833
[HOTARO]
I'm sorry, Chitanda.

448
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,750
We can't hold out much longer.

449
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,083
It has to have
reached Ibara by now,

450
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,416
but she hasn't
skipped out on work

451
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,000
to come investigate or anything.

452
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,250
[ERU]
That's okay.

453
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,791
I appreciate you indulging
my selfish request

454
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,375
for as long as you have.

455
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,875
[HOTARO] It isn't selfish.
It's your responsibility.

456
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,791
[ERU] That doesn't give me
an excuse to make you

457
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,250
suffer for it, too.

458
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,625
Let's call for help.

459
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,250
I can manage whatever
gossip might arise from it.

460
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,208
[ERU] Fukube should have
made it back by now, too.

461
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,125
[HOTARO gasps]

462
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,083
Yes, that's it! Satoshi's here!

463
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,250
[ERU]
Oreki?

464
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,750
[HOTARO] Chitanda, do you happen
to have any kind of string?

465
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,458
[ERU]
Um... Did you say string?

466
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,791
[HOTARO]
Yeah, about this much?

467
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,750
Fifty centimeters
is more than enough.

468
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,583
Once we get that,
I have a sure-fire way

469
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,916
of alerting Satoshi
to our situation.

470
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,416
[ERU]
The strap from my sandals?

471
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,750
[HOTARO]
Too short.

472
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,208
[ERU] Oh, what about the
drawstring from my purse?

473
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,291
[HOTARO] Can't use that.
We need your purse intact.

474
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,416
[ERU] Then why don't we
use one of your shoelaces?

475
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,625
[HOTARO] Sadly, I'm wearing
boots with no laces.

476
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,875
[ERU]
If there's no other choice,

477
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,458
then I might have an idea.

478
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,166
We could use the
<i>obijime</i> from my sash.

479
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,583
[HOTARO]
Is that a string?

480
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,750
[ERU]
Yes.

481
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,583
[HOTARO] Would taking it
off be difficult?

482
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,916
[ERU] It would be kind
of hard, I suppose.

483
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,333
But I think I'd
be able to manage.

484
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,416
[HOTARO] Sorry, Chitanda,
this may be awkward.

485
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,416
I don't know much about
kimonos, so bear with me.

486
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,875
If you took off the <i>obijime</i> ,

487
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,458
would the rest of the
kimono hold up okay?

488
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,250
[ERU]
Um, no, not exactly.

489
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,708
The sash would fall off.

490
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,750
[HOTARO]
What?! That's not an option!

491
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,041
[ERU] No, you're right,
I guess it's not.

492
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,583
[HOTARO groans]
Back to square one.

493
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,250
Well, is there any other
string around here?

494
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,583
[ERU]
If you don't mind my asking,

495
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,291
how are you going to
get help from Fukube

496
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,250
using a little bit of string?

497
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,833
[HOTARO] I think I remember
seeing a flag outside the shed.

498
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,375
[HOTARO]
Sorry 'bout this.

499
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,416
[pounding noise]

500
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,875
[ERU]
Oreki... What are...?

501
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,625
[HOTARO]
Bingo! I was right!

502
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,083
[HOTARO] Chitanda, I need to
borrow your purse for a minute.

503
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,333
[ERU] Okay, but what are
you going to do with it?

504
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,250
[MAYAKA]
What the--?!

505
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,916
This is definitely Chi's
purse, no doubt about it!

506
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,416
She had it before!

507
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,375
So, a handkerchief,
a wallet, and now a purse?

508
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm willing to bet this is
Hotaro's bad luck hard at work.

509
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,125
The parishioners said they
found this by the shed, too!

510
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,333
What in the world is
going on with those guys,

511
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,708
and why's this old string
tied to the purse?

512
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:18,625
String?

513
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:19,875
[MAYAKA]
Yeah, check it out.

514
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,666
[SATOSHI]
This is...!

515
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,375
Whoa. What's the matter, Fuku?

516
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,333
Mayaka, quick!
Where is the shed?

517
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,125
It's over that way, right
next to the Inari statue.

518
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,416
[SATOSHI]
I'll be right back!

519
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:39,083
Hotaro, Chitanda!
Don't worry, here I come!

520
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,875
[HOTARO shivering]

521
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,666
[HOTARO]
Your purse is just a bag, right?

522
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,583
When you tie off the
opening and the bottom,

523
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,708
that closes up all the
contents inside of it.

524
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,625
You know the expression,
"like a rat trapped in a bag?"

525
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,541
[ERU]
"Like a rat trapped in a bag?"

526
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,583
[HOTARO] I'm not making
anything up, I promise.

527
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,333
The phrase was coined at
a famous historical event.

528
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:01,041
You've probably heard of the
Battle of Anegawa, haven't you?

529
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,375
[ERU]
Yes.

530
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,541
[HOTARO] There's a legendary
story that happened

531
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,125
right before that;
have you heard it?

532
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,166
The withdrawal
from Kanegazaki?

533
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,125
When Nobunaga was laying
siege to the Asakura clan,

534
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,250
his brother-in-law,
Azai, betrayed him.

535
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,875
Nobunaga's sister, Oichi,

536
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,625
sent a bean bag tied up at
both ends to him in the field,

537
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:22,083
to send the message that
she was a "rat in a bag."

538
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,625
I don't know how much of
the story is actually true,

539
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,708
but that's beside the point.

540
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,625
[ERU] I don't think I've
heard that story before.

541
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,541
[HOTARO] It just so
happens that Satoshi and I

542
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,833
both saw that episode
play out on a TV show today.

543
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,125
Knowing how his mind works,
he'll get what it means.

544
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,500
[knock on door]

545
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,500
[SATOSHI]
Hotaro! Are you in there?

546
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,625
[HOTARO]
Yeah!

547
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,875
[HOTARO]
You've saved us.

548
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,083
We were on the verge
of freezing to death.

549
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,791
[SATOSHI] They're serving hot
sweet saké at the office.

550
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,166
I'm opening the door now.

551
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,666
Hey.

552
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,458
Mis-Happy New Year, my friends.

553
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,541
[HOTARO chuckles]

554
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,958
Mis-Happy
New Year yourself, buddy.

555
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,166
[ERU sneezes]

556
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,166
[MAYAKA] Next time: "The Case
of the Homemade Chocolates."
