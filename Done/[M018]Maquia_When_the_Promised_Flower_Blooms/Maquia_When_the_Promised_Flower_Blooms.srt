1
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:16,120
The warp of a loom is like the flow of time.

2
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,017
It changes seasons,

3
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,314
dyes the sky anew.

4
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,443
The weft comprises a man's deeds,

5
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,504
their tread upon the earth,

6
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:29,523
the shift of their heart

7
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,124
and the morph weave the days together.

8
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,396
Weaving the story of their world

9
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,475
through the many long centuries of their life.

10
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:56,735
Maquia!

11
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,255
Leilia!

12
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,710
What are you doing down there?

13
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,413
We're never going to finish with you playing around.

14
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,323
Jump in, Maquia!

15
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:13,592
You can do it, just fly!

16
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,464
I... I can't.

17
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:21,460
You're scared.

18
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,443
It's all right. Better not to
get caught up in her mischief.

19
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,857
You're right.

20
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,580
That Leilia,

21
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:32,934
she will never learn.

22
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:45,780
Those that make a life of weaving this cloth,

23
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:49,143
far from the lands of man, have a name...

24
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,090
"the Clan of the Separated".

25
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:59,554
Is something the matter, Lady Racine?

26
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:03,526
Nothing.

27
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,938
Just you wait, next time you're going in, too.

28
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:12,764
Mother!

29
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,153
Welcome home.

30
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:19,866
Leilia you mustn't treat the cloth like that.

31
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:21,326
Sorry, Mama.

32
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:23,462
Now why exactly are you all wet?

33
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:25,734
Did you find any good flowers, Father?

34
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:28,210
Indeed, these will make a rich violet.

35
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:33,214
See you later! Bye, Maquia!

36
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,654
See ya later.

37
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:41,724
See you later.

38
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,632
A tear.

39
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,996
Why are you crying, little one?

40
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:09,416
Because I'm alone.

41
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:10,721
Alone?

42
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:12,576
Even with me beside you?

43
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,172
No, elder, that's not what l...

44
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,121
You always were quick to tears.

45
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:24,698
Maquia, do you know why we call
ourselves "the Clan of the Separated"?

46
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:25,477
Hmm?

47
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:31,133
To outsiders, we are but fairytales,
we are longer lived than any other race,

48
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:35,544
but despite that fact, we
seemingly remain eternally youthful.

49
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:41,952
Only a few centuries past, an existence
such as ours would be commonplace,

50
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:45,740
there was a clan that unfurled wings like a bird's,

51
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,622
there were flowers that would sing at daybreak,

52
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:52,609
leviathans would carry cargo across the seas.

53
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:57,148
But now, all of that magic,

54
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,105
that wonder, has departed the world.

55
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:07,705
That is why the Separated must
always weave the Hibial cloth.

56
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,139
You will never be alone here.

57
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:15,727
Memories dwindle and fade with the passing of years,

58
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,885
the Hibial will always remember.

59
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:23,558
The people who enter and depart our lives,

60
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:27,066
they weep within its fabric with you.

61
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:30,470
They are weeping with me?

62
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:32,843
Maquia...

63
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,044
if ever you must leave the lorph behind...

64
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:36,836
Huh?

65
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,486
...if you should ever meet someone from the outside,

66
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,394
you must never fall in love.

67
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:48,786
For if you fall to love, you'll be truly alone.

68
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:51,489
Oh, but if ll meet someone,

69
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:54,144
then how could I be left alone?

70
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:56,314
Such is our fate,

71
00:05:56,764 --> 00:06:00,696
why we must always remain the Clan of the Separated.

72
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,094
Goodnight, elder.

73
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,220
Sleep well, Maquia.

74
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,194
And be sure not to forget to weave your Hibial for today.

75
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:12,394
Of course.

76
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,411
Oh...

77
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,295
They're blooming.

78
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:58,725
Maquia?

79
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:09,538
The Renato!

80
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,159
Mezarte's attacking?

81
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,555
Maquia, get the elder quickly!

82
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,704
Elder Racine?

83
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:40,017
Elder Racine!

84
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,064
Elder?!

85
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:47,444
Anybody!

86
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,321
The Renato are attacking! Protect the Hibial!

87
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:28,549
It looks like the rumors are true.

88
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,890
They really do look like children.

89
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,265
Yeah, this must look great to a deviant like you.

90
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,452
Silence.

91
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,980
Commander Izol.

92
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,298
Who leads this village?

93
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,079
You're the elder?

94
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,795
It is an honor to meet you.

95
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:06,538
You may look like a young girl, but I know what you are.

96
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:10,527
The stories say you are a monster over 400 years old.

97
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,369
You will find no monsters here, Commander, only weavers,

98
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,609
who bind the cloth of days.

99
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:19,177
Such is our fate and I shall not permit you...

100
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,015
I am afraid you have no choice in the matter.

101
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:28,213
It is by order of the king you shall
accompany me to the palace of Mezarte.

102
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,705
You won't lay a hand on Lady Racine.

103
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:34,874
Take the women!

104
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,473
You have your orders!

105
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:39,675
Kill any that try to resist!

106
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:59,784
Forget the Renato, the lorph are all that matter!

107
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:09,917
Let me out!

108
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,546
Please, let me out!

109
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:43,369
Maquia!

110
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:03,423
No!

111
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:36,185
Jump in, Maquia!

112
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:39,002
You can do it, just fly!

113
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:21,944
A baby?

114
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,638
You know what I love about tear liquor?

115
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,001
It's got that extra salty kick to it.

116
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:30,128
Huh?

117
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,997
You were that girl with the elder.

118
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,592
You're Maquia, right?

119
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,835
I came to buy some Hibial but...

120
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:40,004
...that didn't work out.

121
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,298
This place was a drifter's settlement.

122
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:46,302
Got raided by bandits. This little guy was only hours old.

123
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:54,870
That's pretty amazing. I guess that's what mothers do.

124
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,939
Even in death, she tries to protect her child.

125
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,338
Well, leave the kid here.

126
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,137
They'll meet up again in heaven.

127
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:05,718
The Hibial of this child's life will end here,

128
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,668
little more than a frayed thread that was never woven in.

129
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,580
Better than being alone.

130
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,984
He's... he's really alone?

131
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,909
Oh, she's...

132
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,746
She's so strong.

133
00:15:55,077 --> 00:15:57,327
Come on now, don't do that.

134
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,640
You're really going to take him with you?

135
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:10,741
He's not a toy.

136
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:12,395
I know he's not a toy.

137
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,611
He's my...

138
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:17,968
He's my Hibial.

139
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,838
A lone child meets another lone child,

140
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:27,341
and so they set off into the world.

141
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,362
Are you cold?

142
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,901
You smell funny.

143
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,619
You smell like the sun.

144
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:56,835
Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms

145
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,168
You'll never take me alive!

146
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:02,742
Get back here!

147
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,323
Lang, Deol, that's enough now.

148
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:09,193
You didn't watch your back, Lang!

149
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:09,879
Get back here!

150
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,212
I'm gonna get you!

151
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:12,782
Those boys just never listen.

152
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:13,903
Hm?

153
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,555
What's wrong, Anora?

154
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:26,890
Huh?

155
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,633
I don't understand.

156
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:34,528
What?

157
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:38,445
How do these... I don't know how these work.

158
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:40,838
I can't...

159
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,242
What a mess.

160
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:50,083
A child is not meant to raise another child.

161
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,801
Is that baby even yours?

162
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,970
They say you can't tell how old
lorphs are by how they look. Is he yours?

163
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,548
Hey, off with the both of you.

164
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:13,849
I'm-I'm 15.

165
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:18,022
But the baby, he's... I don't know.

166
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,286
What's his name?

167
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,733
I don't know.

168
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:37,220
Super weird and she's weird And the kid's weird

169
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,427
Leilia!

170
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,388
Leilia.

171
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,821
But that's a girl's name. He should have a boy's name.

172
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,462
Leili, Elli,

173
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,661
Elia...

174
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,023
Erial!

175
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:53,689
Huh?

176
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:54,609
Let go of me!

177
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:57,749
Well, I suppose that'll do.

178
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,248
She's a distant relative.

179
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,250
She knows how to weave.

180
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,651
Mmm...

181
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:18,702
There's a loom that's gone unused in the back of the shop.

182
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,730
She's welcome to that.

183
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:26,881
Take him outside.

184
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,557
She's an lorph, isn't she?

185
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:35,981
I never could trick you, Darel. I'm sorry.

186
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,688
Lorph cloth fetches quite a high price.

187
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,620
She'll end up making me a fair bit of coin.

188
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:46,948
Don't worry, I won't say a word.

189
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:48,979
Thank you, Darel.

190
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:52,327
However, you've taken in an lorph girl,

191
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,902
trouble will be finding you soon enough.

192
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,731
Maybe so, but no one can say
what the future will bring to us,

193
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,991
such is life, with or without her.

194
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:10,751
Here you are, this week's freshest.

195
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,337
Thank you as always, Mido.

196
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,553
Mm! Your cheese has the most wonderful flavor.

197
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,510
Oh, who's the new girl?

198
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,196
I'll be back next week, thanks so much.

199
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,514
Just a good, solid, cheesy taste, you know?

200
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:26,422
And the week after that. Farewell now.

201
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:30,463
You know, raising a child is never easy.

202
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,846
Even I couldn't do it alone.

203
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:34,984
You do understand that?

204
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:36,163
Mm.

205
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,029
My husband passed on some time ago,

206
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:41,475
killed by a Renato with the red eye.

207
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,547
I don't know.

208
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,492
There's nothing wrong with that.

209
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:52,814
I don't know what it means to be a mother.

210
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:54,409
I never...

211
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,859
had one.

212
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:59,496
Well, it's all about guts.

213
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,123
He's doing it!

214
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:17,109
He can walk!

215
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:18,897
Erial.

216
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,833
Erial's walking!

217
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,960
Erial can walk!

218
00:22:26,615 --> 00:22:28,021
Whoo-hoo!

219
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:33,697
It looks like someone's become quite the mama.

220
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,569
Am I really a mother?

221
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:42,695
If you were a mother, I think you would know it.

222
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:46,590
Did you boys clean up the goat
barn or spend all day fooling around?

223
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,718
Lang, Mom's coming!

224
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:49,830
We gotta go. Come on run!

225
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,378
I'm sorry, Mom.

226
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,665
We meant to do it.

227
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:56,573
Oh, you will be sorry.

228
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,069
Ow.

229
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,051
Say "mommy", I know you can.

230
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,150
Sorry, you don't have to.

231
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,330
Mama.

232
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,209
Erial, did you just say...

233
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,237
Say it again.

234
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,463
Say it one more time.

235
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,350
Another Renato has been stricken with the red eye.

236
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:39,376
We shall put it down and
incinerate the body in quarantine,

237
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,714
then bury it deep beneath the earth.

238
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:44,185
Only five remain to us.

239
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:47,009
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

240
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,470
We need a cure and we need it now, my liege.

241
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,085
The strength of the Renato is the symbol of Mezarte,

242
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:54,286
it's the only force we can afford to deploy.

243
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:58,228
When the last of the Renato falls,
the other kingdoms will not hesitate.

244
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:03,035
Hmm... if they cannot be saved, we
will need a power to replace the Renato,

245
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,098
something of equal wonder and
might that will keep them at bay.

246
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:07,529
Yes, of course!

247
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,685
We have been granted the chosen blood.

248
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,348
It will keep us safe.

249
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:14,745
Commander, what of the lorph girl that you captured?

250
00:24:14,923 --> 00:24:18,062
How does she fare as
consort to Prince Hazel?

251
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,818
Tell me, please.

252
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:26,075
If you all have wings...

253
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,802
tell me, why you don't fly away?

254
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:36,381
You're afraid

255
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,142
you will wither and die here.

256
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:44,038
All the emotion you trap inside will burn away,

257
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:48,166
your heart will catch fire and you will burn to cinders.

258
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,652
Lady Leilia, the king has summoned you.

259
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:54,187
One moment more.

260
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:58,455
Lady Leilia, why are you drawn here?

261
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:02,189
It reminds me of the Hibial tower.

262
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,742
So it does.

263
00:25:20,778 --> 00:25:23,167
It's done. Does it say anything?

264
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:26,206
Yeah, it says, "Anora, feel better soon."

265
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:28,101
Perfect!

266
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:30,363
You know, back where Mama was born,

267
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:34,314
we'd use cloth to say how we felt instead of using words.

268
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:36,076
Where were you born, Mom?

269
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,690
Is it the same place I was born?

270
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:44,181
Dida's mom says you're different from
everybody else, but I don't think so.

271
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,899
Where you were born, little Erial,

272
00:25:48,153 --> 00:25:52,593
everybody would talk with their tummies
before the tickling bug would get them.

273
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:54,636
Tickle, tickle, tickle. Tickle, tickle, tickle.

274
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,455
But, Mom.

275
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,161
Then we'd fly away.

276
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,329
Anora!

277
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,729
Be gentle with him, OK?

278
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,215
Aren't you a lucky puppy?

279
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:14,407
Anora's been here ever since Mom and Dad got married.

280
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:18,702
That puppy is almost 90 years old in dog years.

281
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,360
Hey, Erial, why's your mom so weird?

282
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,635
Why's she always sneaking around the village?

283
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,391
She is not weird! My mommy.

284
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,225
I mean, my mom is...

285
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:40,849
She's just...

286
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,352
The baby can't talk.

287
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,604
And then he needs to run home to his mommy.

288
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,606
You're the one who's weird, Erial.

289
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,117
Huh?

290
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:50,776
Boy's aren't supposed to like their moms, stupid.

291
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,927
That's not true. You don't know.

292
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,651
Dita, I hate you!

293
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:58,242
I like my mom.

294
00:26:58,301 --> 00:26:59,328
Oh, shut up, you.

295
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,748
I hate you! I hate you!

296
00:27:05,597 --> 00:27:06,857
Hmm.

297
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,390
Wait, are you crying, Dita?

298
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,139
Hmm, impressive work.

299
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,892
Here, this month's pay.

300
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,561
Thank you so much, Darel.

301
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,505
Actually, I'd like you to take a look at something.

302
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:33,742
A customer of mine brought in some true Hibial, here.

303
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:44,822
Maquia?

304
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:49,960
"Held within the castle. And to be wed to-to the prince.”

305
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:52,052
It's beautiful.

306
00:27:52,352 --> 00:27:53,925
Leilia!

307
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,847
Don't worry, Darel will look into it.

308
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,349
If anyone can get you on a ship, it's him.

309
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,268
Quiet, it's that Maquia girl.

310
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:09,429
Maybe it's for the best. For now at least.

311
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,473
What are you going to do with Erial?

312
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:14,299
Huh?

313
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,810
The journey won't be easy, ever
more so with a young child in tow.

314
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,745
Besides, you have more than a journey ahead.

315
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:26,288
You know I'd gladly watch over him.

316
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,612
Mom! Mommy!

317
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:29,892
Erial!

318
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:45,557
Don't dig too deep, OK?

319
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,790
Just in case Anora wants to come back and...

320
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:53,276
Dummy. You don't want wild animals to dig her up, right?

321
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:54,780
It's time.

322
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,441
I won't be able to see her in the ground.

323
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:13,334
You can see her anytime you come here.

324
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:16,602
But we won't be able to play together.

325
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,991
Tell her she's a good dog.

326
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:22,157
She died in peace without any pain.

327
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,389
And everybody is going to die, eventually.

328
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:30,686
Anora was born into a life where it
happens faster than it does for us.

329
00:29:35,703 --> 00:29:36,759
Maquia!

330
00:29:37,552 --> 00:29:39,227
I'll go after her.

331
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:46,598
Does... does everybody die?

332
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:47,875
Yes.

333
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:49,563
Even moms?

334
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:51,303
Yes.

335
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:59,439
Maquia! Hey, please wait.

336
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,456
Erial.

337
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,911
Everyone, it's not fair.

338
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:11,705
You'll all have to...

339
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:15,391
You'll leave and I'll-I'll still be here.

340
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:17,431
Maquia...

341
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:22,569
I knew it would happen, I knew
it, but it's not fair, it's not.

342
00:30:24,922 --> 00:30:27,701
It doesn't matter that it isn't fair.

343
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:31,289
Stop crying!

344
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:34,011
You'll be gone, too.

345
00:30:34,795 --> 00:30:37,976
Come on, you are Erial's mother, aren't you?

346
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,584
Moms don't cry, you hear me?

347
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,824
My mom wouldn't.

348
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:47,536
So I know for sure that moms don't cry.

349
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,147
OK.

350
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:55,409
Don't cry.

351
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,465
I promise.

352
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,387
Me too.

353
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:06,909
Good night.

354
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:08,303
Sleep well.

355
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,121
Erial!

356
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,732
You tried to wait up for me.

357
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:24,899
Let's get you to bed, OK?

358
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,942
You're getting big now, Erial,

359
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,885
but you still smell like the sun.

360
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,814
I won't cry, OK?

361
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,445
I will always be your mother.

362
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:47,229
We will always be together.

363
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,882
I promise.

364
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:53,975
I'm really sorry, I didn't mean it. I'm really sorry.

365
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,833
I'm sorry about everything. I really didn't mean...

366
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:03,046
I'm really, really sorry and I wanna be friends again.

367
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:06,258
Um, Erial and his mom had to leave.

368
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,040
You're sure you don't wanna say goodbye?

369
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,214
I wanna see the ocean.

370
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,413
Erial, come back! You can't!

371
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,212
You told me you would be a good boy.

372
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:47,273
Come back and stay with Mom.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

373
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:52,440
Maquia, is that you?

374
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,870
Oh, I can hardly believe you're alive.

375
00:32:57,057 --> 00:33:00,145
I never thought I'd see you again.

376
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:08,309
It was our blood.

377
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:12,028
Mezarte attacked to discover the secret of our long life,

378
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,007
that's why they came.

379
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,420
Stole Leilia.

380
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,543
Hey, Mom, who is he talking about?

381
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,176
You have him calling you his mother?

382
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,977
No, it's not like that, I just...

383
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:29,219
I'm not angry, you're not wrong to.

384
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:32,676
It's just hard to forget what the elder used to say.

385
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,912
I know, I haven't forgotten.

386
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:39,788
As long as you know, Maquia.

387
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,160
Items for sale.

388
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,050
There's going to be a parade,

389
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,451
a massive festival to celebrate the prince's wedding.

390
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:18,265
Two different processions, one
with the prince and one with Leilia,

391
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:22,454
will leave from separate palaces,
both of them crossing this bridge.

392
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:25,509
Here, we'll stage an attack on the prince and his Renato,

393
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:30,714
cause all the chaos we can, and when the guard
protecting Leilia weakens to support the prince,

394
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,087
we take Leilia back.

395
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:36,489
I wanna see the parade, too.

396
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:40,271
I'm sorry, sweetheart, maybe next time.

397
00:34:40,437 --> 00:34:44,014
Mom, I wanna go home.

398
00:34:44,434 --> 00:34:46,367
Erial.

399
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,338
You don't act like the mommy I know when we're here.

400
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,197
Erial, the tickle bugs are coming.

401
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:04,704
Tickle, tickle, tickle. Tickle, tickle, tickle.

402
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:44,784
People of Mezarte, today the blood of
the lorph is bonded to the royal family.

403
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:47,228
The Renato and the lorph,

404
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:50,482
these legends that endure unto our era,

405
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:54,277
can join their power with Mezarte!

406
00:35:54,667 --> 00:36:00,116
We are the chosen people. Our dominion shall be infinite!

407
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:08,875
Today will be a day to remember with
the marriage of my son Prince Hazel

408
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:15,439
and the lorph Princess Leilia, a new
legend shall be born unto us, unto Mezarte!

409
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:29,586
That boy.

410
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:36,526
What's happening?

411
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,303
An assassin?

412
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:47,324
They tried to kill the prince.

413
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:57,219
Leilia. Leilia.

414
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:05,352
Hm?

415
00:38:06,728 --> 00:38:07,952
Sorry, sir.

416
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,907
I've missed you.

417
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:22,275
Maquia, what are you doing here?

418
00:38:22,574 --> 00:38:25,113
Not just me, Krim, too.

419
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,763
Krim is here in the city?

420
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:28,528
We came to save you.

421
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,481
Come on, everybody's waiting for...

422
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,821
Leilia?

423
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:35,230
I'm sorry, I can't just leave.

424
00:38:35,735 --> 00:38:37,273
But why not?

425
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:40,212
I can't escape.

426
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:43,551
You can, you were the fastest of anybody.

427
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:47,234
You can just fly over these
castle walls and be gone, Leilia.

428
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:59,768
I can't... I can't see Krim again.

429
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,016
But then you...

430
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:04,505
Leilia, you...

431
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,675
Your Highness!

432
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:09,269
You have to run, Maquia, now!

433
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:11,683
But I... Leilia, no.

434
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:15,728
Go now, I'll be OK. After all, I can fly, right?

435
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:17,443
Hold fast!

436
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,230
My lady.

437
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:32,152
Get them.

438
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:35,566
Hold! If you lay a finger on her...

439
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:47,843
As you wish, my lady.

440
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:59,439
I can fly, I know it.

441
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:08,335
So, how big's the kid now?

442
00:40:09,716 --> 00:40:11,989
He should be about six or seven, yeah?

443
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:15,730
So, how's the world treating ya?

444
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,833
You're one of us. You're an lorph.

445
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:21,961
Only about half.

446
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:29,308
Racine, the elder, there's a reason she made
it taboo for any lorph to leave the village.

447
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:31,201
She knew what would happen.

448
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,065
She knew the fate of those that are different.

449
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:37,477
Humans always play the same part,

450
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:40,021
first they stare, then they taunt.

451
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:44,193
One day, they hate, eventually, they Kill.

452
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:47,673
So, the Clan remains separated,

453
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:51,453
and always just out of step with the rhythms of the world.

454
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,062
Try to live an ordinary life.

455
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:19,241
Krim, you're hurt.

456
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,302
Would you take off the cloak for me?

457
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:35,493
What does it mean to be a child?

458
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,344
What?

459
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,312
What does it mean to be a mother?

460
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,922
I wonder if I even know.

461
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,202
At times, Mido would try to explain it.

462
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:53,094
She'd help me out so much,

463
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,796
sometimes I felt like a little sister,

464
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,946
but that's not quite it.

465
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:02,132
I know that I'm really happy

466
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,940
whenever Erial laughs or smiles

467
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:09,969
and when I look at him, everything
else in the world just falls away

468
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,238
and I just wanna hold him...

469
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,115
That makes no sense.

470
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,249
Erial will die long before you.

471
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:22,177
It's the truth.

472
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,165
Erial is going to leave you alone.

473
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,304
Don't make my mom cry!

474
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:32,884
Erial, no! He's just...

475
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,774
I'll make you cry.

476
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,959
Erial, please stop it.

477
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,925
Can you protect him?

478
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:43,404
Can you? When it really matters?

479
00:42:44,183 --> 00:42:45,057
Huh?

480
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,726
We will stay in Mezarte, we will save Leilia.

481
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:11,889
You and your child will only get in the way.

482
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:17,834
I am sorry, Maquia, this is goodbye.

483
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,762
Are we gonna go home?

484
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,970
No, we're not going home.

485
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:26,911
But why not?

486
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,943
We are going somewhere new, just the two of us.

487
00:43:32,116 --> 00:43:36,761
Somewhere brand new? You mean without
Mido or Lang or anybody from home?

488
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,423
I'm sorry, Erial,

489
00:43:39,778 --> 00:43:42,662
I don't think you'll be able to see them again.

490
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:46,916
Well, as long as I'm with you, I'm OK.

491
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:48,510
Me too.

492
00:43:48,816 --> 00:43:50,958
I'm happy, as long as I'm with you.

493
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:55,210
No chance, girlie. I know trouble when I see it.

494
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,062
Can't have you running off when
whatever trouble it is comes knocking.

495
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:01,766
Ohh!

496
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:02,706
Erial!

497
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,144
I'm so sorry!

498
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,354
You brat! You'd better run!

499
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,014
Don't come back!

500
00:44:10,074 --> 00:44:12,618
Mom's gonna try a few more places, all right?

501
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,259
You wait at the inn for me.

502
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,767
Aww, I don't want to.

503
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,948
Please, Erial, will you wait?

504
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,968
I really can't thank you enough.

505
00:44:26,295 --> 00:44:28,776
The bar does all its best business at night.

506
00:44:28,808 --> 00:44:31,060
You'll probably be working pretty late.

507
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,424
You don't mind?

508
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:35,019
How late do you mean?

509
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,586
Got a problem?

510
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,719
Just, my son is... He's young.

511
00:44:39,884 --> 00:44:42,550
I'd rather not leave him alone if I don't have to

512
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:47,640
We just had another girl take off
with the same problem, you're too young.

513
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,339
You'd better think about this.

514
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,659
But you don't...

515
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:52,146
Don't what?

516
00:44:52,346 --> 00:44:55,967
Tell me, you need to be a better
example than this to your child!

517
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:01,333
Go on then, I don't have any work for someone like you.

518
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:18,911
Welcome home, Mommy!

519
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:21,594
Hello, sweetie.

520
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,711
Mom, come here. Look! look!

521
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,418
I made you some Hibial.

522
00:45:33,116 --> 00:45:35,149
Why'd you give me more to do?

523
00:45:35,174 --> 00:45:35,562
Hm?

524
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:38,503
Why did you take all this out?

525
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:42,823
Because I wanted to show you what I made.

526
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,099
Can't you just listen to me for once, Erial!

527
00:45:45,173 --> 00:45:45,583
Huh?

528
00:45:45,717 --> 00:45:48,704
Always! You're always making problems.

529
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:50,933
If I don't work then we can't eat,

530
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,003
we cannot survive like this.

531
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:54,190
Mommy...

532
00:45:54,257 --> 00:45:56,701
You make everything so hard.

533
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,678
Why, Erial?

534
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,783
The tickle bugs are coming.

535
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,462
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

536
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,166
I bought some dinner, come and eat.

537
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:12,960
Erial, wait!

538
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:25,574
I... I'm not a mother

539
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:28,041
I don't have a right to be.

540
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,219
I don't deserve it.

541
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:34,220
All this time, I've just been pretending.

542
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,928
Mido was always there to catch me.

543
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:43,342
You must never fall in love, for if
you do, then you shall truly be alone.

544
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,178
Truly alone.

545
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,756
Elder.

546
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,989
"My mommy".

547
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,159
My mommy.

548
00:47:21,878 --> 00:47:23,275
Erial!

549
00:47:28,204 --> 00:47:29,451
Erial!

550
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:31,925
Erial, where are you?

551
00:47:32,278 --> 00:47:33,451
Erial!

552
00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:37,695
Erial, please!

553
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,230
Mommy!

554
00:47:40,923 --> 00:47:42,285
Erial!

555
00:47:48,601 --> 00:47:50,347
I tricked you.

556
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:53,261
You thought I shed my skin, right?

557
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,448
You shed your skin.

558
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,129
I made you laugh.

559
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:03,805
Wha... Oh.

560
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,158
I got you!

561
00:48:09,138 --> 00:48:10,282
Silly boy.

562
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,182
Mommy?

563
00:48:12,742 --> 00:48:17,894
I wish... I wish that you could stay like this forever.

564
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,167
Nuh-uh.

565
00:48:22,312 --> 00:48:25,917
If I don't get bigger, how will I protect you?

566
00:48:30,987 --> 00:48:33,523
I didn't want you to cry.

567
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,919
Then I won't cry again.

568
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,176
After all, I'm a mom.

569
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,373
You promise me?

570
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,619
Uh-huh.

571
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,662
You promise, too. OK, Erial?

572
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,808
Yeah, I promise.

573
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:02,263
Mom, I'll always protect you.

574
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:19,940
Keep going, slowly now.

575
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:46,396
All right, order up! Maquia!

576
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:48,207
Coming!

577
00:49:50,462 --> 00:49:54,533
And this one's on you, you're
paying me back for the other day.

578
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:02,536
It takes a lot of experience to get it perfect like this.

579
00:50:06,393 --> 00:50:09,048
And that's why I told you, you had to cut it out.

580
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,675
I kinda thought it was all going to turn out OK.

581
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,075
Welcome, there's a table at the back.

582
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,742
Maquia, three kelbi, yeah?

583
00:50:19,822 --> 00:50:20,460
Sure.

584
00:50:20,505 --> 00:50:21,621
I'll take that, sweetie.

585
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:22,917
Right away.

586
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:24,784
I'll take another one, too.

587
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:29,099
Your sister's got quite a butt on her.

588
00:50:30,012 --> 00:50:31,505
I never noticed.

589
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,604
The two of them hardly look alike at all, right?

590
00:50:36,461 --> 00:50:41,096
Yeah, very suspicious how you just came out of nowhere.

591
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,831
Where'd you say you moved from again?

592
00:50:43,509 --> 00:50:44,162
Huh?

593
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:47,211
Maybe you two ain't brother and sister at all,

594
00:50:47,283 --> 00:50:50,256
just two crazy kids who went and eloped together.

595
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:51,796
Sorry for the wait.

596
00:50:51,821 --> 00:50:53,146
Oh, yes!

597
00:50:54,014 --> 00:50:56,303
Let me know if you need anything else.

598
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:58,813
Welcome.

599
00:51:02,205 --> 00:51:02,751
Hmm...

600
00:51:02,776 --> 00:51:04,687
They keep getting new recruits.

601
00:51:05,036 --> 00:51:07,961
How many guards do they actually need on watch?

602
00:51:08,161 --> 00:51:10,569
Iron's the most important resource we got.

603
00:51:10,636 --> 00:51:13,797
Mezarte keeps making cannons and we keep getting fed,

604
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:15,739
wouldn't call it a terrible deal.

605
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,224
You don't think it's all a bit suspicious?

606
00:51:37,337 --> 00:51:40,055
It's almost like they're just
waiting for another war to break out.

607
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:43,040
Do you think that idiot prince can command our military?

608
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:44,519
Not a chance.

609
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,843
It can get a tad raucous in here, sorry it's so loud.

610
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,650
Here's what we're serving from the kitchen today.

611
00:52:06,884 --> 00:52:07,941
Maquia!

612
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,503
Lang, it's you!

613
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,880
I can't believe it's you!

614
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:15,232
You haven't aged a day, makes sense.

615
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,054
Well, what about you, Lang?

616
00:52:17,148 --> 00:52:19,968
Look how tall you are, like you could touch the sun.

617
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:22,389
Come on, I'm not a stalk of wheat.

618
00:52:24,043 --> 00:52:26,160
Erial! Hey, Erial!

619
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:30,970
Look up here! It's Lang! Lang is here!

620
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:33,018
Hey, Erial!

621
00:52:33,538 --> 00:52:34,312
Huh?

622
00:52:43,388 --> 00:52:45,954
Are you sure it's all right for me to be here?

623
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,736
Of course. Sorry about the mess.

624
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,324
Tell me more.

625
00:52:50,631 --> 00:52:52,586
Are Mido and Deol doing well?

626
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:57,306
Yeah, except cities like Durell
are the only ones with an economy.

627
00:52:57,391 --> 00:52:59,791
All the old rural areas are dying out.

628
00:53:00,252 --> 00:53:03,389
Deol left as well. Ah, thank you.

629
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,264
Deol's looking for work too?

630
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,479
Well, can't live without it.

631
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:10,229
OK, I'm gonna take off.

632
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:14,295
Ha-ha, what's that? Got yourself a date tonight?

633
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:16,983
Sure, deep in the mines.

634
00:53:17,476 --> 00:53:19,822
Be safe, OK? I'll see you later.

635
00:53:19,998 --> 00:53:22,377
I'll make some dinner when you get back.

636
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,994
He got a job when we first arrived here,

637
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,880
and he works incredibly hard.

638
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,973
Of course.

639
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,009
And we can't just keep selling the Hibial.

640
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:46,181
Plus, because of me, it's hard
to stay in one place for too long.

641
00:53:48,474 --> 00:53:50,751
I see. Makes sense.

642
00:53:50,824 --> 00:53:54,114
So he finally realized you weren't bound by blood.

643
00:53:54,348 --> 00:53:55,434
How'd he take it?

644
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,852
Five years ago,

645
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,420
he told me he didn't want me sleeping next to him anymore.

646
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:08,217
Not too long after, he stopped calling me "Mom", too.

647
00:54:08,617 --> 00:54:13,709
"Hey"” or "Come here", that's it. That's all he says.

648
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:16,859
I did the same thing. It's just a phase.

649
00:54:17,194 --> 00:54:22,426
Lang, have you heard anything about Leilia?

650
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,313
Another lost to the red eye.

651
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,675
Burn it to the bones. Bury it deep.

652
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:44,165
Scary.

653
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,675
There's nothing to fear, Princess Medomel.

654
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,368
Um, where's my father?

655
00:54:48,476 --> 00:54:51,115
His Highness Prince Hazel is currently occupied.

656
00:54:53,428 --> 00:54:55,325
And Mother?

657
00:54:56,145 --> 00:54:57,753
What about your mother?

658
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:01,708
Sorry, it's nothing.

659
00:55:02,982 --> 00:55:04,889
Hair the color of a dawning moon,

660
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,762
golden rings within the cornea,

661
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:10,667
and, allegedly, a low body temperature
are the signs of the lorph people.

662
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,639
I regret to say, Princess Medomel shows
almost none of these traits, Your Majesty.

663
00:55:14,664 --> 00:55:21,610
So, if she won't live a long life or bear a
son, then why have I kept that monster in my home?

664
00:55:21,904 --> 00:55:26,533
Hmm. I feel it will be difficult
for Leilia to produce another child.

665
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:30,244
Not to mention, Prince Hazel seems
to have grown tired of her as well.

666
00:55:30,724 --> 00:55:33,676
Oh, my poor, beloved Hazel.

667
00:55:33,856 --> 00:55:38,077
Do something! At least go find my son another woman.

668
00:55:38,137 --> 00:55:41,630
My liege, we are currently seeking survivors of the lorph.

669
00:55:41,787 --> 00:55:44,295
No doubt they will produce a better heir.

670
00:55:44,955 --> 00:55:46,295
Enough!

671
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,643
Princess Leila!

672
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,430
If he has no desire to speak to me

673
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,446
until I'm weighed down with all this filth,

674
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,936
then just be rid of me!

675
00:56:00,653 --> 00:56:01,817
Her Highness is...

676
00:56:01,899 --> 00:56:03,948
I will speak with her alone.

677
00:56:09,925 --> 00:56:11,846
Another Renato has died?

678
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:12,785
Yes.

679
00:56:13,558 --> 00:56:16,623
I have been locked in this tower

680
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,798
since the day I gave birth to Medomel.

681
00:56:20,698 --> 00:56:23,737
And I am never allowed to see either of them.

682
00:56:25,247 --> 00:56:26,258
The same...

683
00:56:26,971 --> 00:56:29,229
the Renato and I are the same.

684
00:56:29,697 --> 00:56:34,391
We're vapors, things only meant
to exist and live in memory.

685
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,437
The clan that flew the skies,

686
00:56:38,504 --> 00:56:40,814
flowers that sung at day break,

687
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:43,016
they were not meant for this world.

688
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:46,528
There must be a way to resist.

689
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:49,343
A way for the legends to survive the night.

690
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,035
To survive?

691
00:56:54,503 --> 00:56:57,216
You dare say those words?

692
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,595
You murdered them.

693
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:19,603
My lady, I beg for your forgiveness.

694
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,063
You can burn!

695
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:24,486
Let me see my daughter!

696
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,532
Why can't I see her?

697
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:29,821
I brought her into this world.

698
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:31,770
I...

699
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,938
I've almost forgotten her scent.

700
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:38,944
How soft she was when I held her.

701
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:45,298
Izol, how much must you take
from me before you are satisfied?

702
00:57:45,557 --> 00:57:50,525
You take everything and I am alone.

703
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:56,805
If you won't let me see Medomel, then bring me Maquia.

704
00:57:58,885 --> 00:58:02,729
Please, bring me Maquia.

705
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:04,185
I...

706
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:08,547
I don't want to be alone anymore.

707
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,124
You never cleaned like this before.

708
00:58:22,286 --> 00:58:24,726
It's been you and me for so long,

709
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:27,610
we've never had any company over before.

710
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,861
Hey, help me?

711
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,715
You've gotten so tall.

712
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:47,397
I guess so.

713
00:58:52,673 --> 00:58:54,865
Maquia, I need to talk to you.

714
00:58:55,434 --> 00:58:57,576
Will you have time when your shift is over?

715
00:58:58,413 --> 00:58:59,411
Yeah, I think so.

716
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,364
I'll be around once you finish then.

717
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,096
Maquia, got an order coming up.

718
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,116
OK.

719
00:59:10,252 --> 00:59:14,015
Man, I thought she was your girl, so I never made a move.

720
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,362
Same here.

721
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:18,532
Come on, lads, there's plenty of fish in the sea.

722
00:59:19,565 --> 00:59:22,184
But why does that jerk get this fish?

723
00:59:22,464 --> 00:59:24,212
She's not like that.

724
00:59:24,556 --> 00:59:25,976
Oh... Yeah?

725
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,541
Hey, when life's got you down, you gotta drink up.

726
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,192
I'm not...

727
00:59:31,253 --> 00:59:33,312
What you're not is a kid anymore.

728
00:59:38,512 --> 00:59:40,285
He kept it down! Nice.

729
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:42,093
Now you gotta try the real stuff.

730
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,595
Down this and you're a real man, Erial.

731
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:50,096
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink it down, drink it down,

732
00:59:50,196 --> 00:59:53,996
burn and pound, burn and pound,
bottoms up and pound it down.

733
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:59,429
Erial, Erial, Erial, Erial!

734
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,014
The trick is keeping it down.

735
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,618
Fill it to the brim, lads! One more!

736
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,545
We'll make you a man yet.

737
01:00:09,688 --> 01:00:11,561
You're sure they're looking for me?

738
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:16,186
We're gonna have to leave the city again.

739
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,768
Wanna come back to the farm with me?

740
01:00:20,689 --> 01:00:21,516
But Lang...

741
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:22,702
It'll be perfect!

742
01:00:22,988 --> 01:00:24,768
The price of goat milk has gone up.

743
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,567
You can bring Erial.

744
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:29,145
We'd just bring you trouble.

745
01:00:29,262 --> 01:00:30,086
Maquia.

746
01:00:30,366 --> 01:00:36,333
Lang, if something were to happen to
your mom or your brother, I just couldn't.

747
01:00:37,046 --> 01:00:41,113
Maquia, I want you to be trouble.

748
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,105
Huh?

749
01:00:42,512 --> 01:00:46,810
Ever since I was little, I
would do anything for you, Maquia.

750
01:00:48,763 --> 01:00:50,323
Just think about it.

751
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,157
A future and...

752
01:00:56,132 --> 01:00:57,619
being with me.

753
01:01:14,566 --> 01:01:17,399
I can't do that. I'm so sorry.

754
01:01:17,537 --> 01:01:18,578
Huh?

755
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:22,637
I spend every moment thinking about my Erial.

756
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,791
Thinking "How can we stay together?",

757
01:01:28,771 --> 01:01:31,911
"How can I become a true mother to him?"

758
01:01:33,143 --> 01:01:37,095
I've never been able to find answers to those questions.

759
01:01:38,598 --> 01:01:42,814
And I don't see myself finding the answers anytime soon.

760
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:48,455
I've never had that kind of wisdom

761
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:50,927
but that's all I want,

762
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,080
forever, to think about my son.

763
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,694
I understand.

764
01:02:03,268 --> 01:02:06,598
Listen, let me at least help you find a new home,

765
01:02:06,749 --> 01:02:09,299
some place you and Erial can be safe.

766
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:11,232
You don't have to do this alone.

767
01:02:39,863 --> 01:02:40,643
Huh? !

768
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:44,160
Erial?

769
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:49,743
Are you all right?

770
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,006
You smell like...

771
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:54,729
I'm home.

772
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:56,314
But you never drink!

773
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,376
Are you all right?

774
01:02:57,401 --> 01:02:59,211
No welcome home kiss?

775
01:03:00,053 --> 01:03:01,548
You always used to...

776
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,656
You used to always kiss me hello.

777
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:10,662
Erial, are you all right? Can you stand?

778
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,980
They thought...

779
01:03:13,907 --> 01:03:16,977
everyone thought we had eloped together.

780
01:03:17,077 --> 01:03:17,737
Huh?

781
01:03:17,882 --> 01:03:21,013
And he thought Lang was gonna take you away.

782
01:03:22,453 --> 01:03:23,902
What are you saying?

783
01:03:24,055 --> 01:03:25,881
Erial, come on.

784
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,809
I'm gonna get you to bed and you can...

785
01:03:37,977 --> 01:03:39,310
Be careful.

786
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:47,959
Don't step on that!

787
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:55,612
You...

788
01:03:57,372 --> 01:03:59,645
you wove this Hibial for me.

789
01:04:05,565 --> 01:04:06,692
I hate this.

790
01:04:08,736 --> 01:04:11,364
Why do you still keep this thing around?

791
01:04:11,623 --> 01:04:14,400
How long are you gonna treat me like a kid?!

792
01:04:42,531 --> 01:04:45,202
You are always going to be my child.

793
01:04:48,183 --> 01:04:50,456
That's something that will never change.

794
01:04:54,052 --> 01:04:55,372
Erial!

795
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:05,847
I spoke to Lang and we have to find a new home.

796
01:05:07,307 --> 01:05:09,952
Is there somewhere you want to go next?

797
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:14,364
I'm happy to go anywhere, as long as I'm with you.

798
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,713
Right.

799
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:20,308
I don't think I can be your son anymore.

800
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:46,957
I have a favor to ask.

801
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,249
Would you consider hiring me as a castle solider?

802
01:05:53,674 --> 01:05:54,967
I need this, Lang.

803
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,885
Your mother's going to be sad.

804
01:05:58,434 --> 01:06:00,549
She's not my mother.

805
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,595
Did you say that?

806
01:06:02,957 --> 01:06:03,930
Huh?

807
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,962
Did you say that to her?

808
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,008
I may have.

809
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,187
How dare you?!

810
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:18,075
Maquia raised you since you were
nothing but an infant! Stop being a brat!

811
01:06:18,248 --> 01:06:22,438
She worked every day, she was
no older than you are right now.

812
01:06:22,824 --> 01:06:24,272
How could you?

813
01:06:24,297 --> 01:06:26,308
You think I don't know that?!

814
01:06:27,729 --> 01:06:31,651
Why does she care about me? Why did she stay with me?

815
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,193
Erial...

816
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:39,326
She's always with me.

817
01:06:40,734 --> 01:06:42,587
She worked so hard for me.

818
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:46,669
I always thought that's what a mother does,

819
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:50,592
that's... that's why I called her my mother.

820
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:55,799
I wanna protect her.

821
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,628
But I can't, not like this.

822
01:07:03,592 --> 01:07:04,552
I'm just...

823
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,280
I'm hurting her.

824
01:07:09,297 --> 01:07:11,484
I need to protect her.

825
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:16,187
I'm just not strong enough.

826
01:07:29,284 --> 01:07:33,972
If you cry like that, you're no
different from when you were a baby.

827
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:40,375
Are you sure you wanna do this?

828
01:08:00,337 --> 01:08:02,538
It's OK, I can do it.

829
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,763
You were gonna leave too, right?

830
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:07,849
Right after I see you off to the castle.

831
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:22,560
I'll miss you. Be safe.

832
01:08:24,588 --> 01:08:25,852
I'll see you soon.

833
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,344
I'll see you soon.

834
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,572
Stop crying.

835
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,485
Moms don't cry.

836
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,515
He promised me.

837
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:20,576
Erial, you promised.

838
01:09:21,514 --> 01:09:23,513
You said you would protect me.

839
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,069
You said...

840
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,163
Please don't go.

841
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:35,596
Please don't go.

842
01:10:45,677 --> 01:10:49,481
Aww, I thought we'd get to see a real Renato.

843
01:10:49,681 --> 01:10:53,195
Sorry, sweetheart, there used
to be a whole flight of Renato,

844
01:10:53,306 --> 01:10:56,002
but now there's only one still alive at the castle.

845
01:10:56,069 --> 01:10:57,160
That's sad.

846
01:10:57,185 --> 01:11:02,957
I really hope they don't expect that us marching behind
this ridiculous Renato doll will actually raise morale.

847
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,140
Hey, did you guys hear about Biaira?

848
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,997
They got themselves an lorph too.

849
01:11:07,724 --> 01:11:10,457
Wait seriously? Like, for real?

850
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,830
Come on, Commander, what did the lice do to deserve that?

851
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,177
Shut it.

852
01:11:18,509 --> 01:11:19,956
Division Commander Lang?

853
01:11:20,682 --> 01:11:21,276
Hmm?

854
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,472
Yup, I heard it too.

855
01:11:25,834 --> 01:11:29,487
Supposedly, it's a girl about
the same age as Princess Leilia.

856
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,299
That doesn't mean it's Maquia.

857
01:11:34,866 --> 01:11:35,952
You worried?

858
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,149
No, she's strong.

859
01:11:41,325 --> 01:11:44,251
Maquia would be so happy to hear that from you.

860
01:11:44,953 --> 01:11:47,619
She was always so afraid she wasn't strong,

861
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:49,836
that she couldn't protect you.

862
01:11:50,569 --> 01:11:53,602
She worked so hard to be a mother to you.

863
01:11:54,294 --> 01:11:56,588
To be a mother you could always depend on.

864
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,066
She's still a child.

865
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:07,136
Yeah, maybe she is a child.

866
01:12:07,553 --> 01:12:08,699
So this time...

867
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:12,030
this time I'll be a father to her.

868
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:15,246
Huh?

869
01:12:20,058 --> 01:12:22,957
Mezarte has become nothing.

870
01:12:23,484 --> 01:12:26,541
They defiled the ancient power they held.

871
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:30,009
Turning myths to nothing but tools for politics.

872
01:12:30,296 --> 01:12:34,212
The nation of Biaira shall commit all we can to your aid.

873
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,281
Maquia, the time has come.

874
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,157
Your hair's gotten so long.

875
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:05,637
Back in the village, we were only permitted
hair past our waist if we had a child.

876
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:11,848
Come, Maquia, we're going to rescue Leilia.

877
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,905
Will there be war?

878
01:13:21,285 --> 01:13:25,364
Only a moment of suffering for people like us.

879
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:29,014
Nothing to the pain you must have known these years.

880
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,899
Abandoning the lorph, wandering the world with nothing.

881
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:37,356
Lost and alone, as if you'd died alive.

882
01:13:37,589 --> 01:13:41,986
So... you know how we feel, don't you?

883
01:13:42,639 --> 01:13:44,487
The Clan of the Separated,

884
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,702
the elder must be long gone and passed into shadow.

885
01:13:48,808 --> 01:13:52,085
Everything we have ever known has faded away.

886
01:13:52,672 --> 01:13:57,306
And you, you left it all behind for your own world.

887
01:13:58,087 --> 01:14:02,457
The lorph work as one, the lorph weave one cloth.

888
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,410
You and me and Leilia,

889
01:14:04,564 --> 01:14:07,212
we cannot weave different histories.

890
01:14:17,765 --> 01:14:20,681
Congratulations, Maquia, you're home,

891
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:23,071
we have severed the final thread.

892
01:14:23,284 --> 01:14:27,959
We begin anew, weaving one future.

893
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:49,470
Dita!

894
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:50,130
Huh?

895
01:14:50,985 --> 01:14:52,878
Erial, welcome home!

896
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,453
You're home pretty early today.

897
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:03,601
I'm sorry I'm so busy right when you need me the most.

898
01:15:04,368 --> 01:15:07,358
Don't you worry, we still have plenty of time.

899
01:15:07,398 --> 01:15:10,279
I know, but I still worry anyway.

900
01:15:10,699 --> 01:15:12,449
I'll get dinner started.

901
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:15,760
No, no. I got it, you should be resting.

902
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:18,681
It's better if I move around a bit.

903
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:22,858
I'm fine. Sit down, sit down.

904
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,484
OK.

905
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:30,347
Do you think it's odd how we came together?

906
01:15:30,587 --> 01:15:32,026
Sometimes.

907
01:15:32,086 --> 01:15:35,381
I was looking for work. Came here to Mezarte.

908
01:15:35,818 --> 01:15:38,813
Who could have imagined I'd meet you again?

909
01:15:39,806 --> 01:15:41,006
And now...

910
01:15:42,977 --> 01:15:47,922
Hey, Erial, was I truly the right one for you?

911
01:15:50,578 --> 01:15:52,755
Hmm? What did you say?

912
01:16:19,045 --> 01:16:20,232
Is it Biaira?

913
01:16:20,907 --> 01:16:25,008
Not just Biaira, Hugh and Endora ships are with them.

914
01:16:31,362 --> 01:16:33,123
Erial, wait!

915
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:36,951
Keep our child safe, I'll be back, I promise.

916
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:55,908
It's about damn time.

917
01:16:55,933 --> 01:16:57,048
Sorry, sir.

918
01:17:03,563 --> 01:17:07,414
Biairan soldiers have crossed the
mountains in an attempt to close off escape.

919
01:17:07,464 --> 01:17:09,111
Split into two...

920
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,426
Was that...

921
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:11,638
Cannon fire?

922
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:15,506
How ironic.

923
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:28,509
Mezarte exploited ancient powers
as a show of unstoppable might

924
01:17:28,976 --> 01:17:34,567
and now the nations that surround us have
forged alliances and furled condemnations,

925
01:17:34,724 --> 01:17:38,677
all to tear down Mezarte's abuse of those ancient powers.

926
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:49,987
Where is my High Minister?

927
01:17:50,174 --> 01:17:51,625
He's already fled the castle,

928
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,779
along with many of your retainers, Your Majesty.

929
01:17:54,032 --> 01:17:56,797
Has he abandoned me in my time of need?

930
01:17:56,883 --> 01:17:59,689
What must I endure?

931
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:03,203
It's all over, the kingdom falls.

932
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:05,534
Majesty, you have to move.

933
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,767
Go. I'll return and find Princess Medomel.

934
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,794
Silence, you fool, I have no daughter.

935
01:18:11,907 --> 01:18:13,674
We don't need that monster!

936
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:06,078
Maquia, come on!

937
01:19:41,617 --> 01:19:42,823
Erial!

938
01:19:44,829 --> 01:19:45,615
Erial!

939
01:20:03,926 --> 01:20:05,065
My Leilia.

940
01:20:06,005 --> 01:20:08,072
I found you.

941
01:20:10,759 --> 01:20:11,832
Krim?

942
01:20:13,114 --> 01:20:14,787
How are you?

943
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,535
You're alive?

944
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:20,423
No, it's not real.

945
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:25,241
You're a ghost.

946
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:32,253
I came to save you.

947
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:34,634
I swear to you,

948
01:20:35,154 --> 01:20:37,445
I am going to make them suffer,

949
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,146
I'm going to make them pay for hurting you.

950
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:43,756
Then I'll wipe it all clean, everything.

951
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:44,302
Wait.

952
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,569
I want to see her first.

953
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:53,349
My daughter, please.

954
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,602
What are you saying?

955
01:20:55,028 --> 01:20:57,227
They forced you to bear them a child.

956
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:58,706
You didn't want her, Leilia.

957
01:20:58,731 --> 01:21:01,252
She, she is still my daughter.

958
01:21:01,277 --> 01:21:02,477
Forget about her!

959
01:21:02,547 --> 01:21:06,455
The name of that child forced upon you
will never be entwined in your Hibial.

960
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,840
That's not true.

961
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,208
I thought you were...

962
01:21:10,661 --> 01:21:13,061
I thought everyone who cared for me...

963
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:15,887
you were dead.

964
01:21:22,389 --> 01:21:23,427
Everything...

965
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:25,857
I thought I had lost everything.

966
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:28,956
She was the only thing that mattered.

967
01:21:29,762 --> 01:21:31,659
My beautiful daughter.

968
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:35,518
All I could think of was holding her...

969
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:38,655
pressing her close to my chest and...

970
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:42,057
those thoughts were what kept me alive.

971
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:44,054
I had nothing else.

972
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:47,642
Leilia.

973
01:21:49,741 --> 01:21:50,774
My angel...

974
01:21:51,567 --> 01:21:52,674
Medomel.

975
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:10,049
I understand, I do.

976
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:12,977
Let's greet the dark.

977
01:22:13,283 --> 01:22:14,971
Let's end it together.

978
01:22:18,655 --> 01:22:19,962
Krim!

979
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,066
I will not...

980
01:22:31,453 --> 01:22:32,784
...allow anyone...

981
01:22:35,514 --> 01:22:37,462
...to harm our Hibial

982
01:22:38,482 --> 01:22:40,149
ever again.

983
01:22:48,008 --> 01:22:48,814
Krim?

984
01:22:52,474 --> 01:22:54,050
Princess Leilia!

985
01:23:26,517 --> 01:23:27,923
It never stops.

986
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:31,371
Leilia and Maquia.

987
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:32,944
But why?

988
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:37,734
Why does time always...

989
01:24:16,877 --> 01:24:20,277
The same fires as that day.

990
01:24:32,035 --> 01:24:32,735
Huh?

991
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:46,991
Erial.

992
01:24:48,204 --> 01:24:49,457
Commander Lang.

993
01:24:50,536 --> 01:24:51,909
Word came down,

994
01:24:52,422 --> 01:24:55,329
there were two lorph aboard one of the Biairan ships.

995
01:24:57,379 --> 01:24:59,258
You came upon them, didn't you?

996
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:02,566
Yes.

997
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,684
Just go, leave this to us.

998
01:25:05,787 --> 01:25:06,514
Find Maquia...

999
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:07,967
I'm willing to fight, Commander!

1000
01:25:09,365 --> 01:25:12,652
You didn't join up out of loyalty to Mezarte, Erial.

1001
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,985
You signed on just so you could get away from your mother.

1002
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:16,018
That's not true!

1003
01:25:18,101 --> 01:25:20,361
Maybe that's why I joined up at first,

1004
01:25:21,207 --> 01:25:25,170
but now... now I have Dita and my friends.

1005
01:25:25,717 --> 01:25:27,564
I have a baby on the way.

1006
01:25:28,543 --> 01:25:31,750
Mezarte is the first home that I made,

1007
01:25:31,817 --> 01:25:34,043
the first home that was mine without my mother.

1008
01:25:34,103 --> 01:25:35,875
I want to protect that.

1009
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:38,166
Hmm.

1010
01:25:56,361 --> 01:25:57,925
Are you all right?

1011
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:04,647
It's you.

1012
01:26:04,771 --> 01:26:05,786
I'll get help.

1013
01:26:06,098 --> 01:26:07,764
Wait, no!

1014
01:26:09,983 --> 01:26:10,911
But I...

1015
01:26:13,213 --> 01:26:14,813
It's Erial's.

1016
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:16,699
It's his child.

1017
01:26:23,032 --> 01:26:24,692
Fire!

1018
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,909
Fire!

1019
01:26:49,761 --> 01:26:50,762
Dita...

1020
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,248
stay strong, almost there.

1021
01:26:55,273 --> 01:26:57,036
Soon you'll hold your baby.

1022
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:18,981
Keep pushing, Dita!

1023
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,394
Keep pushing.

1024
01:27:20,761 --> 01:27:23,436
That's right, Dita. Almost there.

1025
01:27:24,299 --> 01:27:25,846
Just a little further.

1026
01:27:27,266 --> 01:27:28,201
Dita!

1027
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:49,037
Hold on!

1028
01:27:49,062 --> 01:27:49,890
It hurts!

1029
01:27:50,012 --> 01:27:50,912
Dita!

1030
01:27:50,937 --> 01:27:51,850
Please, make it end!

1031
01:27:52,758 --> 01:27:53,765
Dita, it'll be OK...

1032
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:55,065
You have to save the baby.

1033
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:58,231
Please, Maquia, please!

1034
01:27:58,316 --> 01:27:59,609
I will, Dita.

1035
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:01,964
I swear it.

1036
01:28:04,523 --> 01:28:07,449
Someone is coming! Get out!

1037
01:28:22,115 --> 01:28:24,029
Your baby's coming.

1038
01:28:24,629 --> 01:28:26,434
You're so strong, Dita.

1039
01:28:28,742 --> 01:28:30,607
You and my Erial,

1040
01:28:30,723 --> 01:28:32,613
you're going to be parents soon.

1041
01:29:04,481 --> 01:29:08,985
You were wonderful, really... Mommy.

1042
01:29:26,843 --> 01:29:28,713
You're really going to take him with you?

1043
01:29:29,038 --> 01:29:30,211
He's not a toy.

1044
01:29:30,317 --> 01:29:31,730
I know he's not a toy.

1045
01:29:32,317 --> 01:29:33,703
He's my...

1046
01:29:34,336 --> 01:29:36,180
He's my Hibial.

1047
01:29:38,661 --> 01:29:40,168
Beautiful.

1048
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,374
I see now.

1049
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:56,996
Erial, it's time to come inside.

1050
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,067
Mommy, I'm home.

1051
01:30:04,568 --> 01:30:06,987
Look at you, you're covered in snow.

1052
01:30:09,629 --> 01:30:11,992
Welcome home, my Erial.

1053
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,048
Welcome home...

1054
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:24,343
my Erial.

1055
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:29,736
A dream.

1056
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:32,510
No... I'm here.

1057
01:30:32,535 --> 01:30:34,974
But, Mom, the snow.

1058
01:30:35,506 --> 01:30:38,468
It's not snow, it's ash.

1059
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:53,113
Dita gave birth during the invasion.

1060
01:30:56,246 --> 01:30:57,979
You'll hurt yourself.

1061
01:30:58,062 --> 01:31:00,696
It's OK, they're waiting for you.

1062
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:04,159
And they'll keep waiting, you're a father now.

1063
01:31:06,065 --> 01:31:08,186
When your mother gave birth to you,

1064
01:31:08,976 --> 01:31:11,486
she must've gone through the same thing.

1065
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:19,236
I remember her holding you,

1066
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,107
holding you so tight

1067
01:31:21,758 --> 01:31:23,758
and you were so very small.

1068
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,328
Her arms wrapped around you

1069
01:31:27,602 --> 01:31:29,514
as she protected you.

1070
01:31:29,811 --> 01:31:31,747
I could barely get you out,

1071
01:31:31,891 --> 01:31:34,745
I had to pull away one finger at a time.

1072
01:31:34,839 --> 01:31:35,872
That's enough.

1073
01:31:35,897 --> 01:31:36,758
I...

1074
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:40,704
I wasn't able to be a mother to you, I'm sorry...

1075
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:41,602
That's enough!

1076
01:31:44,411 --> 01:31:46,413
You've taught me everything, Mom.

1077
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:48,066
To be kind

1078
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,586
and strong

1079
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:51,827
and brave.

1080
01:31:52,801 --> 01:31:55,724
You taught me what it means to love someone.

1081
01:32:00,752 --> 01:32:03,282
I tried to do all I could for you,

1082
01:32:03,534 --> 01:32:06,701
but you were the one who ended up caring for me.

1083
01:32:08,624 --> 01:32:11,210
When I first laid eyes on you that night,

1084
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,637
I thought you would cry with me,

1085
01:32:13,762 --> 01:32:15,016
share my sorrow.

1086
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:18,904
I thought that you would be my Hibial,

1087
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:23,746
but then, every moment I spent with you,

1088
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:28,145
all the sadness, all the pain,

1089
01:32:29,218 --> 01:32:30,795
it all went away.

1090
01:32:31,764 --> 01:32:33,119
Still, I...

1091
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:36,259
I left, I failed you.

1092
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:40,424
You could never, ever fail me, Erial.

1093
01:32:41,077 --> 01:32:44,707
Despite what you think, you did keep your promise to me.

1094
01:32:45,511 --> 01:32:47,051
You've been here,

1095
01:32:47,444 --> 01:32:50,310
protecting me this entire time.

1096
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:54,415
Even alone, even if we were separated,

1097
01:32:54,529 --> 01:32:57,461
whenever I didn't know what to do with myself,

1098
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:01,326
you were there, I would always think of you...

1099
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,386
and everything was OK.

1100
01:33:05,653 --> 01:33:07,525
So if you call my name,

1101
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,979
even if it isn't "Mom"...

1102
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:13,701
whatever name you choose,

1103
01:33:13,936 --> 01:33:15,865
I swear to you, Erial,

1104
01:33:16,011 --> 01:33:18,011
that name will become mine.

1105
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:21,971
You wove me together, Erial...

1106
01:33:22,774 --> 01:33:24,216
all that I am.

1107
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:35,985
Maquia!

1108
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:41,217
Lang!

1109
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:44,354
Please, I need you to take Erial with you.

1110
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:48,208
His wife and child are waiting for him.

1111
01:33:49,068 --> 01:33:51,756
It's time for him to go back home.

1112
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:04,252
Don't go.

1113
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:13,981
Please, don't go.

1114
01:34:14,139 --> 01:34:15,765
Please, Mom!

1115
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:25,491
It's almost time to head down, Princess Medomel.

1116
01:35:26,077 --> 01:35:27,999
My father and the others?

1117
01:35:31,422 --> 01:35:34,475
Well, don't worry, it's quite all right.

1118
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:37,667
When I reach the city,

1119
01:35:38,042 --> 01:35:40,939
it will be a completely new life that awaits me.

1120
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:45,073
But, even so I...

1121
01:35:45,596 --> 01:35:46,549
Huh?

1122
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:03,210
Who are you?

1123
01:36:05,987 --> 01:36:07,345
Princess Leilia.

1124
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:14,043
Leilia...

1125
01:36:15,056 --> 01:36:17,851
you're my mother.

1126
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:25,930
I am Leilia of the lorph.

1127
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:29,425
I am wild, strong-willed.

1128
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:31,498
I am reckless.

1129
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:34,823
I am free.

1130
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:36,874
I'll always be free.

1131
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:41,786
Fly, Leilia!

1132
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:59,659
I can fly, I can fly.

1133
01:37:02,419 --> 01:37:03,359
Mother!

1134
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:21,732
Maquia?

1135
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:29,260
Yes, you can fly too.

1136
01:37:35,676 --> 01:37:36,763
Goodbye!

1137
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:38,518
Forget me, Medomel!

1138
01:37:39,234 --> 01:37:41,214
I promise I will, too.

1139
01:37:41,514 --> 01:37:46,251
I won't weave these years, my life in
the castle will never be in my Hibial!

1140
01:37:46,717 --> 01:37:47,850
My mother.

1141
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:52,159
The long, long memories will fade away.

1142
01:37:52,847 --> 01:37:55,520
I will forget every moment,

1143
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:59,541
because it will be just a tiny tear.

1144
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:05,184
A tear.

1145
01:38:05,524 --> 01:38:06,464
Yes.

1146
01:38:06,577 --> 01:38:07,886
That's my mother.

1147
01:38:08,286 --> 01:38:10,736
I've never seen anyone so beautiful.

1148
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:16,339
I'm sorry, Medomel.

1149
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:27,124
Princess Leilia.

1150
01:38:28,137 --> 01:38:30,510
We don't need the Renato,

1151
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,225
we don't need the lorph.

1152
01:38:33,751 --> 01:38:36,719
If the legends are so fated to fade away,

1153
01:38:37,313 --> 01:38:42,820
then let them live of their own accord up to the end.

1154
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:49,294
Leilia, don't cry.

1155
01:38:53,951 --> 01:38:58,081
You're afraid, but I promise you will never forget.

1156
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:10,902
That was so hard...

1157
01:39:12,572 --> 01:39:15,192
and it hurt so much.

1158
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,882
But how is the world still beautiful?

1159
01:39:21,028 --> 01:39:23,708
I could never forget.

1160
01:39:55,202 --> 01:39:56,488
I made it home.

1161
01:39:59,524 --> 01:40:00,661
You're really here.

1162
01:40:01,576 --> 01:40:04,002
I promised I'd be back.

1163
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:08,757
That's our baby.

1164
01:40:08,782 --> 01:40:09,458
Yeah.

1165
01:40:17,935 --> 01:40:20,337
She's softer than I could have imagined.

1166
01:40:26,146 --> 01:40:28,596
She's perfect. We need to choose a name.

1167
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:30,016
Mm-hm.

1168
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:31,816
Dita?

1169
01:40:32,216 --> 01:40:33,871
I'm so sorry.

1170
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:37,450
When we were little kids,

1171
01:40:38,176 --> 01:40:40,749
you liked your mom and I said...

1172
01:40:41,222 --> 01:40:42,764
I said you were weird.

1173
01:40:43,364 --> 01:40:45,248
I'm so sorry.

1174
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:48,163
I swear, I didn't mean it.

1175
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:50,931
Your mom was so...

1176
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:54,924
so beautiful and so kind.

1177
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:58,094
She came and...

1178
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:03,641
She was here and she...

1179
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:05,028
I love you, Dita.

1180
01:41:05,921 --> 01:41:07,994
I love you too, Erial.

1181
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:10,027
I was so foolish.

1182
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,571
I used to be so jealous of her.

1183
01:41:12,664 --> 01:41:14,877
I wanted you to love me too.

1184
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:19,327
My mother raised me to be the man I am,

1185
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:21,073
just so I could love you.

1186
01:41:22,577 --> 01:41:23,983
And our daughter...

1187
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,816
she'll love someone, too.

1188
01:41:26,272 --> 01:41:28,975
So we'll raise her, you and I,

1189
01:41:29,279 --> 01:41:30,812
we'll raise her well,

1190
01:41:31,021 --> 01:41:32,061
together,

1191
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:35,435
so one day she'll know how to love,

1192
01:41:35,565 --> 01:41:36,915
just like us.

1193
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:45,104
The Clan of the Separated.

1194
01:41:45,864 --> 01:41:48,687
You are destined to say many goodbyes,

1195
01:41:49,121 --> 01:41:51,733
to see so much that will change.

1196
01:41:52,674 --> 01:41:55,940
Time will march on, never ending.

1197
01:41:56,819 --> 01:42:01,412
You'll meet someone new, an endless stream of new faces.

1198
01:42:02,085 --> 01:42:05,411
You meet someone and you weave.

1199
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:22,732
Hello, little one.

1200
01:42:25,887 --> 01:42:27,762
I'm here to see your grandfather.

1201
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,395
Would you take me to him?

1202
01:42:30,114 --> 01:42:31,587
You know Grandpa?

1203
01:42:31,612 --> 01:42:32,791
Lily.

1204
01:42:33,424 --> 01:42:36,208
What are you doing out here?

1205
01:42:37,806 --> 01:42:39,099
Aren't you...?

1206
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:45,194
Mom passed away a few years ago.

1207
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:48,178
They really were a perfect couple.

1208
01:42:48,596 --> 01:42:50,902
After the fall of Mezarte,

1209
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,701
Lang helped to move them back here.

1210
01:42:54,776 --> 01:42:56,520
It wasn't an easy life,

1211
01:42:56,769 --> 01:43:00,194
but I think they were incredibly happy.

1212
01:43:02,203 --> 01:43:03,549
Come on.

1213
01:43:04,695 --> 01:43:06,777
Just wait, it's coming.

1214
01:43:06,910 --> 01:43:11,864
They spoke of you all the time,
they were so happy together.

1215
01:43:12,231 --> 01:43:14,564
I'm glad you made it in time.

1216
01:43:14,892 --> 01:43:17,732
Father is, well...

1217
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:49,507
I'm home.

1218
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:51,480
Erial.

1219
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:04,485
You did so well, my son.

1220
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:09,716
Such a life.

1221
01:44:12,557 --> 01:44:14,809
You lived with all you had,

1222
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:18,497
a truly wonderful life, my little boy.

1223
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:25,190
But I won't cry.

1224
01:44:25,486 --> 01:44:28,530
I'm a mother and I promised you.

1225
01:44:34,615 --> 01:44:35,762
Huh?

1226
01:44:42,142 --> 01:44:43,242
Mom.

1227
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:47,256
Welcome home.

1228
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:56,785
I am home.

1229
01:45:35,231 --> 01:45:36,191
Hm.

1230
01:45:44,790 --> 01:45:47,398
I'll see you soon, my Erial.

1231
01:45:49,244 --> 01:45:52,937
Make sure you're home for dinner, OK?

1232
01:45:58,964 --> 01:46:00,457
These are for you.

1233
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:01,943
Thank you.

1234
01:46:22,661 --> 01:46:24,901
Mom! Mommy!

1235
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:28,549
Welcome home, Mommy. I know, I know.

1236
01:46:28,574 --> 01:46:31,370
Mommy, I'm home! Good morning, Mom.

1237
01:46:32,234 --> 01:46:33,822
I tricked you!?

1238
01:46:33,916 --> 01:46:35,481
You thought I shed my skin, right?

1239
01:46:35,506 --> 01:46:37,224
Is it the same place I was born?

1240
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:40,278
But, Mom, time to start the party.

1241
01:46:40,973 --> 01:46:45,190
Dita's mom says you're different from
everybody else, but I don't think so.

1242
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:46,358
'Cause I wanted to show you what I made.

1243
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:48,006
Mommy, but why?

1244
01:46:48,031 --> 01:46:51,086
You don't act like the mommy I know when we're here.

1245
01:46:51,111 --> 01:46:53,083
I make you cry.

1246
01:46:53,108 --> 01:46:55,200
As long as I'm with you, I'm OK.

1247
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,661
Mommy, I'll always protect you. Hey, Mom.

1248
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,663
Even moms? Mommy.

1249
01:46:59,663 --> 01:47:02,249
Oh, hey there. See you soon.

1250
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:03,929
It'll be fine, I promise.

1251
01:47:03,954 --> 01:47:07,588
I guess so. Don't worry about it.

1252
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:09,298
I hate this. I'm home!

1253
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:11,175
I don't think I can be your son anymore.

1254
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,829
You think I don't know that?

1255
01:47:12,955 --> 01:47:15,763
I wanna protect her, but I can't, not like this.

1256
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:17,861
I'm just not strong enough.

1257
01:47:17,932 --> 01:47:21,602
Why does she care about me? Why does she stay with me?

1258
01:47:21,706 --> 01:47:23,659
You've taught me everything, Mom.

1259
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:25,947
Please, don't go.

1260
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:27,871
Please, Mom!

1261
01:47:28,371 --> 01:47:30,557
I'm sorry, Erial.

1262
01:47:30,861 --> 01:47:32,323
Mommy?

1263
01:47:33,383 --> 01:47:34,556
I'm sorry.

1264
01:47:35,018 --> 01:47:39,052
Then I won't cry again, after all, I'm a mom.

1265
01:47:39,699 --> 01:47:41,332
You promise me?

1266
01:47:42,561 --> 01:47:44,605
Your mother has to...

1267
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:47,544
...break her promise.

1268
01:47:52,734 --> 01:47:54,760
Mom!

1269
01:47:58,514 --> 01:48:01,517
I love you so much!

1270
01:48:02,823 --> 01:48:04,609
I love you!

1271
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:18,285
Erial.

1272
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,423
My Erial.

1273
01:48:45,402 --> 01:48:47,416
Done already?

1274
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:48,756
No.

1275
01:48:49,476 --> 01:48:51,369
As long as I'm alive,

1276
01:48:51,975 --> 01:48:54,696
Erial's Hibial will still be woven.

1277
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,864
It's not funny.

1278
01:48:59,997 --> 01:49:03,407
It's just the elder would laugh
if she saw your face right now.

1279
01:49:10,359 --> 01:49:11,785
And you know why?

1280
01:49:11,959 --> 01:49:15,524
She'd be happy to have taught you
that leaving someone isn't all sad.

1281
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:22,704
Hop on, let's go.

1282
01:49:22,957 --> 01:49:25,624
Time to meet the next person you'll have to leave.

1283
01:49:34,902 --> 01:49:36,071
Elder...

1284
01:49:37,689 --> 01:49:40,901
I am happy that I met him.

1285
01:49:42,453 --> 01:49:45,115
I'm happy to have been his mother.

1286
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:50,982
I am happy that I loved him.
