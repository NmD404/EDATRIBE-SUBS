1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,120
All right, buddy,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,450
I'm sure you know,

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,010
but you've been way too loud during class lately.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,870
I expect you to shape up.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,000
Uh. Yes, sir.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,910
Sorry about that

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,080
So I'm putting you in charge of
cleaning the science room after school.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,370
Huh?

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,870
Don't forget to wipe the desks down, too.

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,250
Huh?!

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,210
It's not fair that it's just me.

12
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,580
Takagi should be getting punished, too.

13
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,480
She's the one who's always teasing me during class.

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,000
But I guess the problem is
that my reactions are too loud.

15
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,450
Let's just get this over with and head--

16
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,290
What are you doing hiding in the closet?

17
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,160
I was trying to scare you.

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,790
Ahh...

19
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,250
That was so worth having to waste time in there.

20
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,750
Wait. Lemme guess, you have to clean as punishment, too?

21
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,010
Why don't we just get it over with?

22
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,950
Okay?

23
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,750
So, I have a proposal for you.

24
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,120
Before we start,

25
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,580
let's make a game out of cleaning, so it's more fun.

26
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,790
A game?

27
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,830
Yep.

28
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,240
How about we do rock-paper-scissors,
and the loser has to clean a quarter of the room?

29
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,050
You in?

30
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,330
Hold on.

31
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,830
That means if I win all four times,
I won't have to clean anything!

32
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,790
Heh! Sure.

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,140
All right, let's get started.

34
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,500
Round one!

35
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,700
I'll use rock.

36
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,930
Why's she telling me what she's gonna choose?

37
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,500
Rock. So if I go with paper, I'll win?

38
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,540
But she knows that, so--!

39
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,500
I told you I was going with rock.

40
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,120
I hate you!

41
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,920
You need to trust me more.

42
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,620
I won't be tricked twice.

43
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,450
I'll take her word for it next time.

44
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,150
Oh!

45
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,790
And I'm not gonna tell you what I'm picking anymore.

46
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,870
Man.

47
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,080
I knew it.

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,330
She's messing with me again.

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,290
Hmm?

50
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,290
Nishikata!

51
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,120
Uh. Hey, Nakai!

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,830
What's going' on in here?

53
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,830
You two just felt like hanging' out?

54
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,260
No, I was loud in class,
so I have to clean the room as punishment.

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,030
Hm. That's rough, man.

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,540
What about you?

57
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,040
Me? I'm, uh...

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,250
...just hanging' around.

59
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,450
You know.

60
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,810
Oh. Okay.

61
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,660
Hey, Nakai.

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,450
Let's not get in their way, yeah?

63
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,540
Oh. You're right.

64
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Well, we'll be on our way.

65
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,040
Cool. See yah around.

66
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,540
Oh, and Nishikata.

67
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,660
Huh?

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,250
Good luck to yah, dude!

69
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,200
Uh. Oh, right.

70
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,290
With this?

71
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,120
Come on, let's just get out of here.

72
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,250
Sorry, Takagi!

73
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,160
Mm-hm.

74
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,460
See yah!

75
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,040
By the way, bet you didn't know.

76
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,410
They're going out.

77
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,910
Wait, what? They are?

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,700
Seriously? I had no idea.

79
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,100
I mean, I did notice them hanging
out a lot lately, but still...

80
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,080
It's not like they're trying to hide it.

81
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,250
It's just that they're both the kind
of people who wouldn't announce it.

82
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,660
True.

83
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,450
He said he's hanging around, and she was with him.

84
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,100
But if you notice,
they were on their way to the rooftop.

85
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,420
The... The rooftop?

86
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,620
And right about now,

87
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,000
they're probably all alone up there.

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Huh? Just the two of them?

89
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,620
You gonna clean?

90
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,580
Huh? Uh. Yeah!

91
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,750
I am.

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,490
Aww. Enjoying their time.

93
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,330
With each other.

94
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,580
Up there together.

95
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,580
I wonder what--

96
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,870
I wonder what it's like.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,590
Up there.

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,080
Right?

99
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,630
Yeah. I guess so.

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,620
Hey. I finished.

101
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,040
Okay, then.

102
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,200
Rock, paper, scissors.

103
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,830
How did I end up losing every time?

104
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,010
Well, that's finally done!

105
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,580
Let's go. It's getting late.

106
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,020
So casual.

107
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,000
I hope you learned your lesson
and won't tease me in class now.

108
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
I guess.

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,580
I could always just be more discreet.

110
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,790
We're gonna get in trouble no matter what!

111
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,410
Yeah, well, if it happens, it happens.

112
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,290
Not to mention.

113
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,870
I wasn't even told to clean in the first place.

114
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,920
Huh? You've gotta be kidding!

115
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,700
Okay, for real.

116
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,250
Why am I the only one who gets in trouble all the time?

117
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,820
So you're just here to mess with me, like usual?

118
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,580
There's that, but...

119
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,870
...I wanted to enjoy my time, too.

120
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,400
Huh? Enjoy...

121
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,000
...your time?

122
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,740
And on that note,
you're buying me juice on our way home.

123
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,700
What? Why?

124
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,500
The sun's killing me.

125
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,830
Yeah, me too.

126
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,450
I'm really thirsty.

127
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,950
Oh! I know.

128
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,710
How about a competition and the loser buys drinks.

129
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,040
Yeah, why not?

130
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,160
Can I decide what we compete in then?

131
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,730
Think I've got a good idea.

132
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,220
The high bar?

133
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,070
Uh-huh. Whichever one of us can't do a
kickover on the high bar is the loser.

134
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,880
I just happened to try doing a
kickover on the high bar recently.

135
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,660
And bam! I was actually able to
for the first time in my life!

136
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,720
Ever since then, I've been itching' for
my chance to show Takagi up in a duel!

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,610
To be honest, I wouldn't be all that
surprised if she could do one, too.

138
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,910
But!

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,480
Hey, Nishikata.

140
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,670
You realize, I'm wearing a skirt, right?

141
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,790
Exactly!

142
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,500
Can't flip over the bar wearing a skirt!

143
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,080
She's unable to compete!

144
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,040
I win!

145
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,160
Oh, well.

146
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,330
I call dibs on going first, then.

147
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,080
Eh?

148
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,040
Really? You want to?

149
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,410
Yeah, it's fine.

150
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,330
However, I'd like to add one extra rule.

151
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,540
You can't watch me.

152
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,500
Huh?

153
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,750
You're surprised?

154
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,870
I am wearing a skirt.

155
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,970
So if you look at me on my turn, then you're the loser.

156
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,320
Here I go!

157
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,600
Okay.

158
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,410
Your turn, show me what you got.

159
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,540
Did she really do it?

160
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,500
I have no way of knowing.

161
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,660
Whatever, now's not the time.

162
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,450
I've gotta focus on the task at hand!

163
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,450
Whoa.

164
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,580
Well, we both were able to do it.

165
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,000
So what now?

166
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,720
One more time. Do over.

167
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,500
All right.

168
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,860
Then I'll go first again, 'Kay?

169
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,160
No hesitation.

170
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,750
That's not a good sign.

171
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,510
She's either really confident or hiding something.

172
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,830
I bet she's not even doing a kickover.

173
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,450
She said I lose if I look during her turn.

174
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,000
But it's a different story if she's cheating.

175
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Today's the day that I finally beat her!

176
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,370
No way!

177
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,990
She's actually doing it?

178
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,130
Shorts?!

179
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm done.

180
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,750
You can turn around now.

181
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,120
What's wrong?

182
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,670
Sorry, Takagi.

183
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,910
I lose.

184
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,290
Here.

185
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,370
Thanks.

186
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,620
Though, I don't really feel like a winner.

187
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,060
Since you disqualified yourself and all.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah, about that.

189
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,050
If you had shorts on the whole time,
then why didn't you let me watch you do it?

190
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,250
Pervert.

191
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,830
Hey, don't get the wrong idea!

192
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,080
I just wanted to make sure you were
actually swinging over the bar!

193
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,160
Really?

194
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,740
Yes, really!

195
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,580
All right, then.

196
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,200
So you thought I was cheating, is that it?

197
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,750
What?! No, I just... Ugh...

198
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,830
All right, what's the big idea?

199
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,300
Why are you always picking on me, day in and day out?

200
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,000
It's nothing.

201
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,520
Huh? Ba-dump!

202
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,590
Be straight. You like being treated this way, don't you?

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,790
Ahh... Squeal!

204
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,760
I said,

205
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,080
"You like being treated this way, don't you?"

206
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,840
Ahh... Squeal!

207
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,580
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i> is so good!

208
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,200
Pay attention, this part's important.

209
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,700
And you can bet it's gonna be on the test.

210
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,670
So make sure you remember it.

211
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,950
Morning. Sorry I'm late.

212
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,640
Hey, Nishikata.

213
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,990
I wasn't expecting you. I thought you were out sick.

214
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,750
Are you feeling better?

215
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,750
Yeah. I think so.

216
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,460
Morning. You have a cold?

217
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,920
Yeah.

218
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,290
But it's nothing.

219
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,660
I can handle it.

220
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,200
No big deal.

221
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,330
Nailed it!

222
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,040
Huh?

223
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,080
I bet you just stayed up watching <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

224
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
How did she figure that out?

225
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,700
Squeal, squeal!

226
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,620
Don't say that so loud, it's embarrassing!

227
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,540
Funny, I only heard you screaming.

228
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,620
You're right. Sorry, sir!

229
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,290
Come on, that was really low, Takagi.

230
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,040
You okay?

231
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,200
You're coughing.

232
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,290
Yeah. It's not that bad.

233
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,790
Man.

234
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,040
She won't pull any punches even when I'm sick!

235
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,560
Heh...

236
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,480
But luckily, I have the ultimate
plan to defeat her today!

237
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,330
Wait, what's a guy like him doing here?

238
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,700
Him and his perfect hair!

239
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,910
Now I'm really mad!

240
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,290
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind!

241
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,500
Hey!

242
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,540
Oh wow.

243
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,870
You're so cute.

244
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,250
Squeal!

245
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,700
I can do that!

246
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,180
I may have caught a cold, but it was worth
it for the invaluable knowledge I've gained!

247
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,410
Okay, Takagi. Come at me.

248
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,450
Gimme your best shot!

249
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll counter it and make you blush!

250
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,620
Ni--

251
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,820
Come on!

252
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,290
Whenever you're ready!

253
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,290
Uh...

254
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,830
Uh. What?

255
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,330
Don't worry. 'S nothing.

256
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Weird.

257
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,290
She isn't making her move.

258
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,410
I can't stay in this pose forever.

259
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,620
And my right hand's on my chin,
so I can't even take notes.

260
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,450
Wait, what if she figured it out because of the pose?

261
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,570
Is it too obvious I've got a
counter-trap ready to spring on her?

262
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,410
One way to find out.

263
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,330
Sit normally.

264
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,540
What's her deal today?

265
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,040
I don't understand!

266
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,370
Any other day, she'd have teased me three times by now!

267
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,990
Is she sick or something?

268
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,680
Huh?

269
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,750
When she's quiet, she's really...

270
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,250
Uh-oh.

271
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,950
I think I'm starting to second guess my plan here.

272
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,850
Countering with "You're cute," when she
messes with me might be embarrassing.

273
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,540
Duh, of course it is!

274
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,980
How did I ever think I'd be able to say that?

275
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,200
I bet it's because I'm sick,
and didn't get any sleep last night.

276
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,250
Are you okay?

277
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,160
Hey.

278
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,040
Uh. Yeah.

279
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,330
It's all good.

280
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,120
Your face is a little red.

281
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,830
Huh?

282
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,870
And you look tired.

283
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,250
Sure you're good?

284
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,040
Yes, I'm fine.

285
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,580
But you're getting even redder.

286
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,120
Do you have a fever?

287
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,950
Why are you being so nice to me today, Takagi?

288
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,620
How many times do I have to tell you?

289
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,040
I'm totally okay!

290
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,870
Really?

291
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,000
Really!

292
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,580
When I said I was feeling sick,

293
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,660
it was more like an excuse, anyway.

294
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,910
I really just woke up at like,
eight-thirty, so that's why I was late.

295
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,790
I'm fine! Promise!

296
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,500
Okay.

297
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,500
I guess I believe you.

298
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,120
It's about time!

299
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,160
So... I can tease you again.

300
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,950
Huh? What do you mean?

301
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,130
And of course, she ended up making
fun of me more than usual that day.

302
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,650
Young love!

303
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,290
Squeal!

304
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,620
Yukari, Sanae, what's with the snail's pace?

305
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,950
Power walk, let's go!

306
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,660
Why should I exert myself that much for a Popsicle?

307
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,870
'Cus, it's the baked sweet potato flavor!

308
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,580
It's a summer exclusive!

309
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,450
That's a weird flavor for summer.

310
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
They're sold out of it everywhere that I've looked.

311
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,660
But I think this one snack store will have it.

312
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,830
So we gotta check before they sell out too!

313
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,160
What are you doing?

314
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,980
There's no point in taking a shortcut if
you're gonna drag your feet the whole time!

315
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,380
I just noticed Takagi and
Nishikata are inside the store.

316
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,080
Oh hey. You're right.

317
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,620
Could it be that those two are...?

318
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,450
Mina, maybe we shouldn't get in their way--

319
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,500
Hey! Takagi!

320
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,870
Sha-bam!

321
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,790
Got my sweet potato pop!

322
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,120
Uh. I'm happy for you.

323
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,080
See you tomorrow.

324
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,840
They're so lucky.

325
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,370
Lucky how?

326
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,000
Well, look at the two of them.

327
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,000
You know.

328
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,700
A guy and a girl together.

329
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,330
It's just nice.

330
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,620
Huh? Why?

331
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,600
You didn't notice?

332
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,290
Don't blame me, it was your idea.

333
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,580
Hey. Why exactly are we following them?

334
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,410
We live in the opposite direction.

335
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,410
Shhh!

336
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,950
They're gonna notice us. Shut up!

337
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,410
Just tell me what you think.

338
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,750
Don't you feel,

339
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,080
I dunno, like something's going on between them?

340
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,200
Hmm...

341
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,370
Oh! They've got a bike right there!

342
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,750
They should be riding it together, right?

343
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,870
That is so romantic!

344
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,700
Riding home together after school.

345
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,710
Oh, but that's a tough decision, because you can

346
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,750
spend a lot more time together if you walk instead!

347
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,580
Maybe if you trade off every other day?

348
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,080
Can I have a bite of that?

349
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,370
Uh. Yeah, but just one bite, okay?

350
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,700
Hey, Takagi.

351
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,450
You wanna race somewhere?

352
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,000
Are you challenging me?

353
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,040
Uh-huh!

354
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,580
We'll start once we turn that corner.

355
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,450
The first one to make it all the way to the shrine wins.

356
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,790
Hmm. Okay, why not?

357
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,000
Haha. She either has to ride her bike or pull it.

358
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,160
With that flat tire, she'll lose either way.

359
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,450
You have way too wild an imagination!

360
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,080
I guarantee you they're not talking about a race!

361
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,240
They're talking about something more intimate than that.

362
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
I just know it!

363
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,910
Nishikata.

364
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,280
I'm up for us racing to the shrine.

365
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,080
But before that...

366
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,580
Hmm?

367
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,200
They're gone?

368
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,370
Did they make it all the way to the shrine already?

369
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,000
No way!

370
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,370
Maybe they realized we were tailing them.

371
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,740
Ugh, come on, let's go home already.

372
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,160
Uh. Yeah.

373
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,620
I say we buy more popsicles on the way.

374
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,160
Will you let me have a bite?

375
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,250
Just buy your own if you're gonna keep eating mine!

376
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,120
So close.

377
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,540
Hmm?

378
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,620
Ah. Did we lose them?

379
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,500
Any idea why they were following us in the first place?

380
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,080
No.

381
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,410
Hey, uh...

382
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,600
Now that I think about it,
we should have gone around that corner too.

383
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,040
It would have been a lot easier to hide over there.

384
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,410
Huh.

385
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,110
I hadn't thought about that, guess you're right.

386
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,660
But I wonder...

387
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,120
Would you have preferred if we did?

388
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,110
Well, no.

389
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,000
It doesn't really matter.

390
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,950
Good!

391
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm glad.

392
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,750
Oh, I almost forgot!

393
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,570
We're racing to the shrine, yeah?

394
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,870
Ready, set go!

395
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,500
Huh?! Hey, hold on!

396
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,370
I'm calling' you out!

397
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,660
That's a false start, Takagi!

398
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,650
Tailing those two turned out to be kinda fun in the end.

399
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,160
Taking' the long way home.

400
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,950
They probably did notice us following them.

401
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,290
I better apologize to Takagi tomorrow.

402
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,500
They're out of the baked sweet potato flavor!

403
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,500
It's okay!

404
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,500
They got red bean soup!

405
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,500
What is with you wanting these flavors in the summer?

406
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,390
So you gonna let me have a bite?
