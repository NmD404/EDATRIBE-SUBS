1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,000
There's gotta be some way I can
beat Takagi at her own game.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,480
I gotta get that last laugh!

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,230
Or, at the very least, I have to do something
to stop her from teasing me every day.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,170
Sorry, I didn't see you--!

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,370
Hey, Nishikata.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,550
Good morning.

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,050
Oh. Ah. Good morning.

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,190
Uh. Something wrong?

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,950
Oh, no.

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,540
Not at all.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,520
Hmm...

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,750
Well, you want to go to school together?

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,740
Uh...

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,560
Sure.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,410
Did she see that?

16
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,950
Did she see me apologize to a pole?

17
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,910
Hey, Nishikata.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,250
Yeah? What's up?

19
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,000
Want to tandem ride?

20
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,200
You already know my answer.

21
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,660
We'll get in trouble if we're seen.

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,250
You're just too embarrassed.

23
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,620
No, I am not!

24
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,580
Yeah. Right.

25
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,700
Well, she hasn't said anything strange.

26
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,820
Guess she must have just missed seeing me.

27
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,320
Phew.

28
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,450
Took you long enough.

29
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,250
Breaking out the winter uniform?

30
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,660
Yeah. It's been getting colder lately,
so I thought the time was just about right.

31
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,330
Wh-What?

32
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,870
Did you grow?

33
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,580
Huh?

34
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,590
I think that uniform looked a
little bigger on you last spring.

35
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,620
Now that I think about it, she might be right.

36
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,160
This thing feels like it was tailor-made for me.

37
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,500
I didn't even notice.

38
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,050
Could it be?

39
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,880
Am I finally having a growth spurt?

40
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,330
Man.

41
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,750
I'm growing so much lately,
I might need a new uniform soon.

42
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,030
Must be one of those "growth spurts."

43
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,890
But by comparison, you sure haven't
changed much, have you, Takagi?

44
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,250
That's sexual harassment.

45
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,290
"Haven't changed much."

46
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,620
N-No!

47
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,430
That's--

48
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,990
Come on, you know that's not what I was talking about.

49
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,580
Uh. I was talking about your height.

50
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,250
Huh? Well, yeah, I was too.

51
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,840
Why, what did you think I meant?

52
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,750
N-Nothing.

53
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,750
Oh?

54
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,880
Now what?

55
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,200
Hmm...

56
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,540
You know what?

57
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,370
I take it back, maybe you haven't gotten taller.

58
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,660
Huh?!

59
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,620
What do you mean?

60
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,200
I totally grew!

61
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,490
In fact, I'd be willing to bet
I'm taller than you now, Takagi!

62
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,450
Yeah? Do you care to find out for sure?

63
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,290
Why're we doing it here?

64
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,440
So we can take our shoes off to be fair.

65
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,540
We're gonna be late for school.

66
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,540
Nah, this'll be quick.

67
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,080
Here, turn around.

68
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,800
Let's see.

69
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,880
She's kinda... warm.

70
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,500
Uhh...

71
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,040
So, Takagi?

72
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,200
Huh?

73
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,870
Normally, wouldn't you stand against a
wall and make a mark to measure height?

74
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,500
Yeah, but I think it's more accurate
if we stand together like this.

75
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,080
I think we're about the same height.

76
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,540
Huh? Really?

77
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,290
Really.

78
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,410
If you don't believe me, check for yourself.

79
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,000
No way, you're right.

80
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,040
Told yah.

81
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,790
Hey.

82
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,140
You're not like, on your tiptoes are you?

83
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,580
Why? You don't trust me?

84
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,550
All right then.

85
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,790
Is this better?

86
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,120
You'll be able to tell if I'm cheating now.

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,450
Uh. Yeah. I guess.

88
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,160
Wait.

89
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,620
Now it kinda looks like.

90
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,830
I'm taller.

91
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,370
That's because I was on my tiptoes before.

92
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,870
So you were cheating, I called it!

93
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,700
You're a liar!

94
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,910
I never said I wasn't on my tiptoes.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,200
Good for you though.

96
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,040
You're taller after all.

97
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,410
Yeah, walk away.

98
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,440
You're acting all cool on the outside,
but on the inside, I bet you're really bitter!

99
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,290
Oh. By the way,

100
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,240
if you think I'm bitter, you're wrong.

101
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,700
Know why?

102
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,330
When your body grows too fast.

103
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,660
You might run into things.

104
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,700
Like, utility poles.

105
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,460
Huh?

106
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,290
Wait! Does that mean you saw me do that?

107
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,040
Are you ready?

108
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,080
School's a-waiting'!

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,640
Takagi.

110
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,240
Hey.

111
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,410
Takagi?

112
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,940
So cold.

113
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,200
I dunno, I feel fine.

114
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,040
You're so sensitive to the cold, Yukari.

115
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,490
Take that!

116
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,290
Mina, your hand is freezing!

117
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,800
Jeez.

118
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,450
You do that again, and I'll hate you forever.

119
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,160
Forever?

120
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,910
Will you stop it?

121
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,000
Why?

122
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,410
Because I hate it!

123
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,540
Why are your hands so cold anyway?

124
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,930
You know why.

125
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,330
You just don't want to accept it.

126
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,790
People who have cold hands have warm hearts!

127
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,910
I don't think a person with a warm heart
would enjoy torturing their friends for kicks.

128
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,040
Now, now.

129
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,980
There's no need to hold a grudge.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,870
I'm not kidding. If you do it
again, I'm gonna be really mad.

131
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,290
You're already mad.

132
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,290
Gotcha.

133
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,300
So cold!

134
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,180
Stop it!

135
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,950
I said stop, Sanae!

136
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,660
That's the "My heart is so warm" attack.

137
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,700
Help me, Yukari!

138
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,870
Take this!

139
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,580
Now let's see how you like it!

140
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,160
Your hands are so warm. It's scary.

141
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,450
That must mean you've got a cold heart.

142
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,660
That is not what it means and you know it!

143
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,620
Stay away, cold-heart!

144
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,080
Prepare for the "Cold heart frozen soul" attack!

145
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,950
Equally as fearsome!

146
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,790
It's not even close!

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,660
Hey.

148
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,200
So cold!

149
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,250
What'd you do that for?

150
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,410
Get me back if you can.

151
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,660
You get back here!

152
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,750
Stop that!

153
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,500
Quadruple cold hands!

154
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,750
Four times the power!

155
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,700
No way can I do that.

156
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,560
Will you stop it?!

157
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,910
Your hands are cold as ice!

158
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,200
Leave me alone!

159
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,670
Did you know they say that people
with cold hands have warm hearts?

160
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,680
Nope!

161
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,410
It's Takagi and Nishikata, again.

162
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,040
I saw them show up to school together today.

163
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,620
Those two are so close.

164
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,080
Well, maybe they are going out.

165
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,500
I really can't help but wonder.

166
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,260
Do you think they're going out?

167
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,910
Who knows?

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,750
You don't sound very interested.

169
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
They're so close, it makes me want to know.

170
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,950
Why is that?

171
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,540
Are you jealous of them?

172
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,830
Am I jealous?

173
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,080
Well, not exactly, but...

174
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,080
Mina.

175
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,790
Yukari says she wishes she had
a boy she could flirt with.

176
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,790
That's not even close to what I said!

177
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,000
Hey.

178
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,340
You listening?

179
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,330
Mina?

180
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,950
Sanae! I'm on the toilet.
Don't talk to me right now, please!

181
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,790
You're gonna make me lose my concentration!

182
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,830
Huh?

183
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,470
You are too much sometimes, Sanae.

184
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,700
It's good.

185
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,120
You should watch it later.

186
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,750
Really? Cool, I will!

187
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,700
Hey, Takagi?

188
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,830
Hmm?

189
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,540
I just came up with the perfect plan!

190
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,840
It's the ultimate, fail-proof plot to
tease Takagi on our way home from school!

191
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,700
Hmm?

192
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,830
What are you smirking to yourself about over there?

193
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,080
Something pervy?

194
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,600
No.

195
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,810
It's nothing dirty or weird or whatever.

196
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,330
Dirty or weird?

197
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,290
That's what I said!

198
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,910
Your face is turning red.

199
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,610
Whatever.

200
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,370
Just you wait until after school!

201
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,180
By the way, Nishikata.

202
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,780
Later, do you wanna walk home together?

203
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,160
Yeah, sure!

204
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,290
Oh, no!

205
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,580
Was I too eager?

206
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,450
Did she realize I'm up to something?

207
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,950
I mean.

208
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah, sure.

209
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,910
Isn't that what you just said?

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,290
Uh-huh.

211
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,160
That a problem?

212
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,620
Hmm...

213
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,160
No.

214
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,700
But just in case you change
your mind before school's out,

215
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,450
you can give me a definite answer later.

216
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,460
See ya.

217
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,870
Well that was weird.

218
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,520
As long as she isn't on to me, I guess it's fine.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,560
Hey, Nishikata!

220
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,700
We were gonna play "Super-Pro" at my house today.

221
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,200
You want in on that?

222
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,280
Um...

223
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,120
Sorry. I can't today.

224
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,790
You spending time with your girlfriend again?

225
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,000
My "girlfriend"?

226
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,000
Takagi, right?

227
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
I called it.

228
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,410
Huh?! What are you talking about?

229
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,910
We're not like that at all!

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's true, Takagi and Nishikata are not going out.

231
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,660
I know 'cuz we just asked her in the bathroom

232
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,540
Aw, really?

233
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,540
Yeah!

234
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,250
Oh man, I seriously gotta go.

235
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,220
Bathroom, here I come.

236
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,120
Uhh... What was she doing in the
bathroom before if she has to go now?

237
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,160
All right, putting that aside,
if you're not going out with her,

238
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,950
why are you walking home with
her for like the hundredth time?

239
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,250
Well, because she asked me to?

240
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,280
Asked you?

241
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,470
And you're sure that's not because you're going out?

242
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,340
Uh.

243
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,590
I don't think so, at least.

244
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,440
Hmm?

245
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,820
Okay, whatever.

246
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,370
Hey, isn't next period in the lab?

247
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,370
You're right, let's hurry!

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,910
No way.

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,540
I don't buy it.

250
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,570
Takagi just wants to tease me.

251
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,200
Ready to get going?

252
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,200
Yeah. But we're going straight home today, okay?

253
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,200
Huh?!

254
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,950
But I had it all planned out!

255
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,160
I wanted to get a Ponkan Popsicle!

256
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,290
Don't you think it's a little bit cold for that?

257
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,830
Not when you go inside and pump the heat it's not!

258
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,340
You said it.

259
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,160
If she's not gonna say anything about it,

260
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,870
then to give her my "definite" answer,

261
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,830
I've gotta ask her myself.

262
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,450
That's kinda embarrassing now
that I'm face to face with it.

263
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,490
I've never been the one to ask
her to walk home with me before.

264
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,490
Nishikata.

265
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,580
Yeah? What's going' on?

266
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,530
Oh, good!

267
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,660
If she asks me, all I have to do is say yes!

268
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,810
That's easy!

269
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,870
You know what?

270
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,210
Earlier today someone asked me
if I was going out with you.

271
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,830
Huh?!

272
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,830
And...

273
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,410
After I told them we weren't,

274
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,820
they said that they thought I liked you.

275
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,750
I'm always asking you to walk home with me.

276
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,130
Maybe that's why they thought that.

277
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,700
I should have known!

278
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,750
This is what you were after the whole time!

279
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,410
Hmm?

280
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,540
You orchestrated everything, so I have no
choice but to ask you to walk home with me!

281
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,480
Just so you can watch me squirm!

282
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,370
You okay?

283
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,950
Try to sound calm.

284
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,020
Just say something like, "Oh yeah? That's funny."

285
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,240
Oh yeah? Tha-That's funny!

286
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,040
Nice!

287
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,200
Uh.

288
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,330
So, anyway.

289
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,530
About your request from this morning.

290
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,160
Hmm?

291
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,120
Uh.

292
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,370
I don't have any plans, so uh...

293
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,960
Let's...

294
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,500
"Let's" what?

295
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,160
Hang in there, man!

296
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,200
If you can get through this,

297
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,280
then you get your chance to mess with Takagi!

298
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,030
Let's walk home together.

299
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,450
I'll have to think about it.

300
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,080
Huh?!

301
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,540
I'm just kidding.

302
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,040
Let's go.

303
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,580
I can't wait.

304
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,700
Because... it looks like you're scheming something.

305
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,930
She's on to me!

306
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,450
If she's already suspicious of
me, should I hold off on my plan?

307
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,870
But I came up with such a good idea!

308
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,760
Not that I've thought about how to carry
out said idea to begin with, though.

309
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,960
Want to get some juice?

310
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,660
Now that I think about it, my mouth is dry.

311
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,290
Aww.

312
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,860
Most of them are sold out.

313
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,950
I really wanted to get something cold.

314
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,410
But all they have is...

315
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,430
Sweet red bean soup and whatever that is!

316
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,510
What do we do?

317
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,870
I need something,

318
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,910
but I'm in a no-win situation here!

319
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,500
A "no-win situation"?

320
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,700
Should we find another vending machine?

321
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,750
Nah.

322
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,060
I'm thirsty, so I guess...

323
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,750
...I'll just go for this one.

324
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,200
Gross.

325
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,080
With a name like that, duh.

326
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,200
On any other day,

327
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,520
I'd completely regret buying this.

328
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,770
But now I know for sure that my new plan will work!

329
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,290
Hey, Takagi.

330
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,500
Hmm?

331
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,870
Say there's one juice that's
really tasty but gives you a fever.

332
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,090
And another that's just plain disgusting.

333
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,450
Which would you choose?

334
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,450
Hmm...

335
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,750
One juice that's really tasty but gives you a fever

336
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,850
and another that's just plain disgusting?

337
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,910
Hmm...

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,870
How's it feel?

339
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,000
You can't decide, can you?

340
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,120
Feel the unease!

341
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,790
I want to see your face contorted
with conflicting emotions!

342
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,200
'Kay, question.

343
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,580
So if I drank the tasty juice and got a fever.

344
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,160
Would you come and visit me while I'm stuck at home?

345
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,200
What?

346
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,000
What's the point in asking me that?

347
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,620
Does it affect your answer?

348
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,040
Significantly.

349
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,620
You wouldn't visit, then?

350
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,040
Uh.

351
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,950
Hey. I didn't say that. Don't put words in my mouth.

352
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,420
If you were out sick, then I'd visit you.

353
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,660
Then I'd take the tasty one.

354
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,500
Well, this is weird.

355
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,790
What's going on?

356
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,660
I expected her to be conflicted,

357
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,910
but she doesn't have a care in the world.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,040
Hold on.

359
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,000
I feel a little weird now.

360
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,540
Am I the loser here?

361
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,000
Has my "two-choice question" plan failed?

362
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,410
No, it's still too early to give up!

363
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,080
'Kay!

364
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,660
Next question!

365
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,790
Okay.

366
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,750
No more allowance for your whole life,

367
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,790
or no more teasing me ever?!

368
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,450
No allowance for life.

369
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,160
So quick!

370
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,330
I'd be fine.

371
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,790
I've been saving up my New Year's money
and anything else I've gotten for a while.

372
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,330
And once I'm in high school, I'd just get a job.

373
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,040
Clearly, the better choice is to keep teasing you.

374
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,870
I underestimated her!

375
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,660
I'll need a better question than that.

376
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,700
Nishikata.

377
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,120
What?

378
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,620
Well, you've asked me two weird questions in a row.

379
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,290
What's your angle?

380
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,870
Are you just trying to give me a hard time?

381
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,790
Huh?

382
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,950
Not really.

383
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,790
Fine.

384
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,540
Then I'll ask you one, now.

385
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,540
Would you rather that I disappear

386
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,970
or that you'd have to be teased by me forever?

387
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,750
What'll you choose?

388
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,830
Huh?

389
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,080
What do you mean "disappear?"

390
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,000
Poof, I'm gone.

391
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,620
I don't want to be teased for the rest of my life

392
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,330
but for her to disappear?

393
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,540
That feels like a step too far.

394
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,540
I'd, uh, choose to be teased.

395
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,580
Thought so.

396
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,290
You do like being teased.

397
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,290
No, I don't!

398
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,410
Why would anyone like that?

399
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,620
It's just...

400
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,120
I don't exactly want you to disappear either.

401
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,410
That would suck.

402
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,620
You want to be with me?

403
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,620
That it?

404
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,540
That's not...

405
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,290
Made you blush!

406
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,370
Man, why does she always have to do this?

407
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,910
Is it that fun to see me uncomfortable?

408
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,660
I gotta come up with a good question to get back at her.

409
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,790
Question two.

410
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,620
Huh? You're not done?

411
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,160
You get zeroes on all tests for the rest of your life,

412
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,040
or you have kiss me.

413
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,250
Which is it?

414
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,500
A "kiss"?!

415
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,580
Gotta choose one.

416
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,120
I'd get a zero even if I study well?

417
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,000
Yep.

418
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,540
It doesn't matter what you do.

419
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,950
I couldn't live with that!

420
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,370
My parents would take away my allowance immediately,

421
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,200
and there's no way I'd get into high school!

422
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,410
But if choose the kiss,

423
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,080
she's gonna make fun of me like there's no tomorrow!

424
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,910
Hard decision, huh?

425
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,330
Man!

426
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,830
The more I struggle to choose, the happier she gets!

427
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,580
I gotta choose quickly.

428
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,790
All zeroes for life is too much!

429
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,910
But!

430
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,790
I have no choice!

431
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,750
I'll pick not getting zeroes on my tests.

432
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,660
Sorry, which option was that again?

433
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,680
Th-The one with the kiss.

434
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,040
Ho, ho?

435
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,250
Is that so?

436
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,830
Okay, then.

437
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,450
Aww, man.

438
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,700
Looks like you were right.

439
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,040
You are taller than me.

440
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,330
What's with that look?

441
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,500
I was just making sure.

442
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,240
She's messed with me so many times today.

443
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,830
But I have this all figured out now.

444
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,110
One option has to be something she'd never choose,

445
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,040
and the other just has to be something
I can make fun of her for picking!

446
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,200
That way, I win no matter what!

447
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,050
Okay, Takagi. I got one--

448
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,190
All right, next question.

449
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,580
You have to go around the school while
doing a handstand, or you and I--

450
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,780
Whoa, hold on a second! I can't even do a hand
stand, that option doesn't work!

451
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,660
And when can I ask the questions again?

452
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,500
As soon as you're done answering my questions.

453
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,080
What? Why?

454
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,010
<b>"Who's Taller?"</b>

455
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,940
<b>"I Hate the Cold"</b>

456
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,990
<b>"Invitation"</b>

457
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,520
<b>"Two-Choice Question"</b>
