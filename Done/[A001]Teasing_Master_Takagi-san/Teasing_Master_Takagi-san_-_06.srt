1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:02,830
Well...

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,620
As I'm sure you know, summer vacation starts tomorrow.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,910
Try not to get into any trouble.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,450
Summer vacation is gonna be awesome!

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,270
Hey.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,950
We're thinking of going to the beach tomorrow, you in?

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,450
Yeah, you know it, dude.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,290
I suddenly have a huge craving for watermelon!

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,500
I'd eat some watermelon.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,950
Perfect! Let's get one for tomorrow!

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,950
Good idea!

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,080
Summer vacation.

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,500
You excited?

14
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,750
Yeah.

15
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,000
It feels like I've been waiting for it forever.

16
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
Now I can play as much as I want!

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm a free man!

18
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,540
You better not forget about your homework.

19
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,290
Knowing you, you'll put it off.

20
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,830
I bet you're thinking "play first, work later."

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,080
How'd you know?

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,830
Haha! So I was right?

23
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,870
Well yeah.

24
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,700
But the whole point of a break is to relax, right?

25
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,750
I wanna go to the pool, hit the
beach, and go camping and stuff.

26
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,390
Man, I barely have enough time to do all that!

27
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,160
I wish we could just have summer vacation forever.

28
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,660
Yeah?

29
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,960
I like going to school, too, though.

30
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,480
Because...

31
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,150
It's fun.

32
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,500
No more of that for a while, huh?

33
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,550
So hot!

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,500
But the breeze feels great!

35
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,750
Can you go faster? This rocks!

36
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,410
You wouldn't be saying that if you were pedaling!

37
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,220
It's hot out.

38
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,370
Should we do what they were doing?

39
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,160
Huh?!

40
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,000
Of course, you'd have to be in the front.

41
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,700
No. We can't!

42
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,850
Uh. 'Cuz it'd be dangerous
with cars driving by, you know?

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,410
There are no cars around.

44
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,240
It's not even a public road.

45
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,910
Yeah, but.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,950
Hold on.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,540
Are you embarrassed or something?

48
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,330
No! Of course I'm not embarrassed!

49
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,080
Oh.

50
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,750
You can't do it, then?

51
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,000
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,330
Tandem riding is super easy.

53
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,360
I just don't think we should do it, 'cuz it's not safe.

54
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,870
Let's go to the vacant lot, then.

55
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,040
Huh?!

56
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,910
If you can't do it, then you owe me a juice.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,540
I hope you're not too thirsty,

58
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,600
because I got this, no sweat.

59
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,450
Hmm?

60
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,250
That was just the practice run!

61
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,640
I can do this!

62
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,750
I'll take grape.

63
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,160
Could ya gimme a second?!

64
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,800
Is it really this hard to ride with
someone sitting on the back of a bike?

65
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,870
Just checking, but you're not trying to
throw us off balance on purpose, are you?

66
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,250
Of course not.

67
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,290
Are you sure.

68
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,570
I'm just sitting how I usually sit.

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,080
If we can't get it to work,

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,950
then it's gotta be your fault.

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,790
I mean...

72
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,620
...the last time I did this with someone.

73
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,490
They didn't have any trouble peddling.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,910
Oh, really?

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,860
That's cool.

76
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,000
I take it they were a girl?

77
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,040
Nope.

78
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,450
Not a girl.

79
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,690
I see.

80
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,450
One more time.

81
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,500
I think I've almost got it!

82
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,750
This time for sure!

83
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,580
What's going on?

84
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,700
Why do I feel so frustrated?

85
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,750
I'm just riding a bike!

86
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,540
What's up?

87
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,620
You're getting into this.

88
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,790
No, I'm not!

89
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,370
I just don't wanna waste my hard earned money on you!

90
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,620
Yeah, that's it!

91
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,910
I just don't want to buy her a drink! That's all!

92
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,620
Hey!

93
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,950
We're moving!

94
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,870
By the way, Nishikata,

95
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,580
the last time I rode on the back of someone's bike,

96
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,830
it was my dad's.

97
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,790
I think I was four at the time.

98
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,500
Take it.

99
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,540
Why, thank you.

100
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,160
Ahh...

101
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,870
That's good!

102
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,250
Are you not gonna get yourself a drink, too?

103
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,640
Uh. Nope.

104
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,690
I'm, uhh, not thirsty.

105
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,200
I can't tell her I have no money to buy my own.

106
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,040
How would that look?

107
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,620
Want some?

108
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,750
No.

109
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,080
I'm fine, thanks.

110
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,710
She'd just call it an indirect
kiss again to get me to blush.

111
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,080
Come on, I know you're thirsty.

112
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,870
Have some.

113
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,690
I really don't want any.

114
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,610
Endure it.

115
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,410
You can do it.

116
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,760
Endure.

117
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,080
Drink this.

118
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,570
We can't have you getting heatstroke.

119
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,410
I can have it?

120
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah.

121
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,910
Besides.

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,330
I know you.

123
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,750
You don't want mine because it's an indirect kiss.

124
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,620
Huh?!

125
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,120
Tha-That's not it!

126
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,910
I'm just not thirsty!

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,160
Right.

128
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,700
But you'll drink yours?

129
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,750
Well, you already bought it.

130
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,070
It'd be a waste when it's this hot.

131
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,370
Thanks for the drink.

132
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,620
We won't be walking home from school for a while.

133
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,580
Ahhh...

134
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,450
Got that right.

135
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,370
We're on vacation, after all.

136
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,540
I know!

137
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,660
How about starting tomorrow,
we practice tandem riding here until noon?

138
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,160
Okay, I guess.

139
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,200
But not on the road.

140
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,330
That's what I meant.

141
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,040
We'll just ride here.

142
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,660
If we're only ever gonna ride here,
there's no point in practicing.

143
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,910
Yeah, there is.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,040
You know.

145
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,580
Summer vacation.

146
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,830
It starts tomorrow.

147
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,700
What does that mean?

148
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,660
All right!

149
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,080
Well, we should head home.

150
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,370
Summer vacation.

151
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,620
Huh?

152
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,540
I'm excited.

153
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,400
It'll be fun!

154
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,870
Yeah, obviously.

155
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,200
Why'd it have to rain on our first day off?

156
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,330
I know.

157
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,950
Summer vacation's barely even started,
and my plans are already ruined!

158
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,750
It's not like it's supposed to rain tomorrow.

159
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,160
I wanted to go to the pool today.

160
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,700
And I'm never getting that time back!

161
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,490
Please stop crying.

162
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,160
You know we can't do anything about the rain.

163
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's just start our homework.

164
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,250
--Huh? --Huh?

165
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,950
What's with those faces?

166
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,750
Don't tell me you two didn't bring yours.

167
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,580
I told you guys to bring your
homework over since it's raining out!

168
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,450
I figured I must have misheard you.

169
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,660
Unbelievable!

170
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,120
Why do we get assigned homework during
summer vacation in the first place?

171
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,950
It's a violation of human rights.

172
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,870
It's hardly a break with homework.

173
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,250
Right?

174
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,000
Dream all you want, we still have to do it.

175
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,540
Ugh! Do me a personal favor,

176
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,830
Quit doing your homework and relax!

177
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,200
Seeing you do yours reminds me that I have to do
mine, and now I can't enjoy myself!

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,160
Whatever!

179
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,830
Maybe you need the reminder!

180
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,660
It's only the first day still.

181
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,210
Just forget about school.

182
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,040
Typical, from a person who will be crying
with regret on August thirty-first.

183
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,440
You're so stubborn.

184
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,950
Forget you. I'm gonna read manga.

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,910
Yeah?

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,160
Fine.

187
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,700
Hey, Yukari?

188
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,000
Hmm?

189
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,250
I got a great idea.

190
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,370
Can we write our book report on manga?

191
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,330
Yes, please.

192
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,040
Can you two just go home already?

193
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,910
It stopped raining.

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,110
Awesome!

195
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,790
Wait, why exactly am I happy about that again?

196
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,460
Nishikata.

197
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,450
You're here.

198
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,660
Yeah, we made a promise, didn't we?

199
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,120
Guess so.

200
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,200
Something wrong?

201
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,200
Uh.

202
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,330
No.

203
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,160
It's nothing.

204
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,200
Whoa.

205
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,120
There are so many puddles here.

206
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,450
Well, you know what they say.

207
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,200
When it rains, it pours.

208
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't recognize her for a second there.

209
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,910
Come to think of it, I've run into her
a few times on our days off by chance,

210
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,540
but this is our first time meeting up.

211
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,660
No way!

212
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,910
This isn't like, a date, is it?

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,700
No, obviously not!

214
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,370
We're just here to practice tandem
riding, like we agreed to!

215
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,450
Nishikata?

216
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,910
Huh?! What's up?

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,870
You hear me?

218
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,750
Hello?

219
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,790
No. Sorry.

220
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,750
What did you say?

221
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,250
This place is in pretty bad riding condition.

222
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,580
Uh, yeah.

223
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,910
Actually,

224
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,910
I was planning to go out after we practiced today.

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,450
No sense going back home.

226
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,000
Do you wanna hang out with me to kill some time?

227
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,910
Okay.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,040
Is this a date?

229
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,750
No, no, no.

230
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,750
No way!

231
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,790
Uh. Yeah, that's fine.

232
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,620
But let's go someplace where
there aren't too many people.

233
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,830
There's no telling what our
classmates would say if they saw us!

234
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,450
Hmmm...

235
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,040
How about...

236
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,430
That's it!

237
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,790
A test of courage?

238
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,660
Perfect for summer, right?

239
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,950
Wouldn't it be scarier if we did it at night?

240
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,330
Not by much.

241
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,790
I heard it gets pitch black when you're in there.

242
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,410
Some say, there's a presence.

243
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Sorry.

244
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,200
What?

245
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,330
A presence?

246
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,800
Well, that's what I heard.

247
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,660
This tunnel doesn't have any sharp turns.

248
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,910
But for some reason, a lot of cars ended
up crashing straight into the walls.

249
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,500
So they had to make a new road nearby.

250
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,790
And since then, every night, without
fail, a bloodthirsty ghost appears.

251
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,120
Looking for cars to prey upon.

252
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
But there's even more to it.

253
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Rumor has it.

254
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,620
People are spirited away here.

255
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,450
Dozens.

256
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,590
Maybe more have disappeared right in this very tunnel.

257
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,410
Are you going in?

258
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,290
Or are you chicken?

259
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,940
I am so not chicken!

260
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,390
It's the middle of the day!

261
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,500
Why would I be scared of going in some
dusty, stupid, old tunnel?

262
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,330
It's way darker than I thought.

263
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,120
Why is the wind making such a weird noise?

264
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,040
Hey.

265
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,160
Check out what's on the wall.

266
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,750
A talisman?

267
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,750
For spirits.

268
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,160
It keeps them away.

269
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,700
So clearly,

270
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,660
there must be something evil in here.

271
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,110
I'm not surprised you're scared.

272
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,810
I'm not!

273
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,910
I was just shocked, that's all!

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,950
Look!

275
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,410
Uh, great; what is it this time?

276
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,500
Weird.

277
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,750
I wonder what this steel barrel is doing here.

278
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,870
Uh. Yeah.

279
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,660
All right.

280
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,200
I vote you look inside.

281
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,120
Huh?

282
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,290
Are you scared?

283
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,950
Will you stop saying that?

284
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,120
I'll look.

285
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,410
It's not that big of a deal.

286
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,250
Ah!

287
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,040
That's what I was really worried about!

288
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,850
Takagi?

289
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,500
Takagi?

290
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,260
Where'd you run off to?

291
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,500
Quit messing with me.

292
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,620
Didn't she mention something about being spirited away?

293
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,620
But that couldn't...

294
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,950
Takagi!

295
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,830
Answer me!

296
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,580
Takagi!

297
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,410
What are you freaking out for?

298
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,620
It's just me.

299
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,290
Where'd you come from?

300
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,540
Hey.

301
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,250
You were looking for me just now, weren't you?

302
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,950
Huh? Yeah right.

303
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,830
Why would I do that?

304
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,630
So she lured me in here to jump-scare me a ton.

305
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,500
Whoa.

306
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,910
Look at that.

307
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's a big hole.

308
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,270
Why don't you take a peek inside it?

309
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,200
Like I'd fall for the same trick twice.

310
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,680
Don't make me laugh!

311
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,870
Oh no, I'm stuck!

312
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,950
My hand's stuck in the hole!

313
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,370
How do you like my acting?

314
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,450
I've been working on it.

315
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,540
I'm gonna freak you out so bad!

316
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,120
I don't know what,

317
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,080
but it feels like something's
pulling me from the other side!

318
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,250
Help me--!

319
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,200
Nishikata.

320
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,580
Did I scare you?

321
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,250
No.

322
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,250
What is that?

323
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,750
I dunno, I found it on the ground.

324
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,290
Oh!

325
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,120
Glad your hand came loose.

326
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,490
Man.

327
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,870
I gotta find some way to get
her before we leave this tunnel!

328
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,620
As jumpy as usual.

329
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,750
Ahh...

330
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,160
Some fresh air!

331
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,410
This sucks.

332
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,790
I couldn't find anything to get her back with.

333
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,750
Must be another couple on a date in the spooky tunnel.

334
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,330
Don't bother them.

335
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,120
Let's go.

336
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,040
Okay.

337
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,200
She called it a "date."

338
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,410
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

339
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,120
Hmm?

340
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,120
What is it?

341
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,870
You're blushing again.

342
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,870
Did you have fun back there?

343
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,290
Because I did.

344
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,750
I guess.

345
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,450
Yeah, but...

346
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,700
It's almost noon, we should go back home soon.

347
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,540
Yeah, let's.

348
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,120
What way are you going?

349
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,200
You want to go back through there?

350
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,250
Yeah, why not?

351
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,330
Are you scared?

352
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,700
When am I ever?

353
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,150
I met my quota for the day.

354
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,580
Wait.

355
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,120
It's summer vacation.

356
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,410
Why do I still have just as
many push-ups to do as normal?

357
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,950
Yes, the consommé flavor is quite good.

358
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,870
Don't lie.

359
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,080
Your eyes are watering.

360
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,500
No, they're not.

361
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,870
And I know it's better than your kelp flavor.

362
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,330
They both sound awful.

363
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,870
There are so many flavors to choose from.
Why would you pick those?

364
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,410
You wouldn't understand, miss watermelon.

365
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
Take risks while you're still young, right?

366
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,870
That's some philosophy to apply to popsicles.

367
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,080
Hey, did you two decide on
subjects for the science project?

368
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,000
Not yet.

369
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,450
Me neither.

370
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
You?

371
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,500
I'm still thinking, too.

372
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,540
Isn't there something easy I can do?

373
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,500
Like, finish-in-a-day easy?

374
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,450
Just do actual research.

375
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,000
Hmm...

376
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,000
A dog observation diary?

377
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,580
Ah! Awesome idea!

378
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,330
That sounds super easy!

379
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,040
And dogs basically behave the same way every day.

380
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,500
So I can just copy the entries and change the dates!

381
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,000
If you're gonna lie, write it by hand at least.

382
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,160
Besides, dogs barely do anything.

383
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,080
They wake up, bark for a walk, bark to be fed,

384
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,950
and sleep every chance they get.

385
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,910
Maybe they'll wake up and bark for attention,

386
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,250
but then they'll just bark for food again.

387
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,620
Why would anyone want to observe that?

388
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,790
You're such a stick in the mud, Yukari.

389
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,870
Well she is the class president.

390
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,660
It comes with the territory.

391
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,250
Right?

392
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,910
Shut up.

393
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,080
Anyway, have you two started to do your homework yet?

394
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,000
We've still got plenty of time.

395
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,450
Right?

396
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,160
Just so you know.

397
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,040
You're not copying mine.

398
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,440
Not even if I do your science project for you?

399
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,250
On a dog?

400
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,290
No, thank you.

401
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,790
You say this now, but you're gonna end
up sharing your answers with us anyway.

402
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,580
She wants the class to get good grades.

403
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,160
Right?

404
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,110
Maybe I should do an observation
diary on their procrastination habits.

405
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,910
So hot.

406
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,330
This is the worst day of vacation yet.

407
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,660
Are you kidding?

408
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,560
First, I overslept.

409
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,660
And then I had a flat tire.

410
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,290
But at least all this happened on a
day we're not practicing tandem riding.

411
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,950
Takagi said she was going on a family vacation.

412
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,280
When's she coming back from that?

413
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,500
I was gonna stay home for a few hours and do
chores, so I could have the afternoon free,

414
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,140
but of course I was sent on a shopping trip.

415
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,370
Truly this is the darkest of vacations.

416
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,930
That kinda sounded poetic, I should write it down.

417
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,390
That looks like...

418
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,620
Yeah, it's Takagi.

419
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,500
Huh.

420
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,000
I guess she's back.

421
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,660
I might as well use this opportunity to follow her.

422
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,410
Maybe I can find a weakness to exploit in the future.

423
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,250
Uh oh.

424
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,950
Did she see me there?

425
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,120
Maybe it was my imagination.

426
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,120
No, she did see me!

427
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,880
But I can see her hat sticking out around the corner.

428
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
You think you're gonna surprise me, don't you?

429
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,750
Not while I still may breathe!

430
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,620
I should write that down, too.

431
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,160
She... She got me!

432
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,160
Going somewhere?

433
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:02,870
Yeah.

434
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,700
Just grocery shopping.

435
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,370
Hey.

436
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,580
What a coincidence.

437
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,290
I am too.

438
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,620
We could take your bike, ride tandem?

439
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Come on.

440
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,750
We agreed no doing that in the road.

441
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,540
When did she find out I was following her?

442
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,330
Fine.

443
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,330
Let's walk together, then.

444
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,160
Oh no! I gotcha!

445
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,870
Are you okay?

446
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,540
And the curse of today continues.

447
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,370
You're hurt.

448
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,080
Nah. It's nothing. I'll just let it be.

449
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,450
Don't do that.

450
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,030
You should wash it off.

451
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,660
How embarrassing.

452
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,620
Does your knee hurt that much?

453
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,950
No.

454
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,790
It's just that I was already having a bad
day, and now I got a cut, too.

455
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,660
I'm wallowing in how much this vacation sucks.

456
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,560
And it's not like I can write about
my misfortunes for my summer homework.

457
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,410
Here.

458
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,950
Huh?

459
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,370
But it'll stain.

460
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,500
Don't worry, just take it.

461
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,540
Uh.

462
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,910
Thank you.

463
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
That feels nice!

464
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,880
So you tried to catch me before, right?

465
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,950
Thanks for that.

466
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,200
You should come in.

467
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,160
The cold water's really nice.

468
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,580
Uh, No, I...

469
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,300
You know you want to.

470
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,660
Cooling you down?

471
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,290
Uh.

472
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,200
You know what?

473
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,540
I had a good day.

474
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,700
Because I got to see someone.

475
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,290
Huh?

476
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,870
Wh-Who do you mean?

477
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,660
You'll get your souvenir tomorrow.

478
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,240
Hey!

479
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,000
