1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,330
The day has come.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,980
I've waited so long!

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,920
And finally, I got my first cell phone!

4
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,130
And contact added.

5
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,410
Thanks, man.

6
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,650
Sure thing.

7
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,410
You got a cell phone?

8
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,250
Right on cue!

9
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,370
Oh cool, you got the latest model?

10
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,790
I was thinking of upgrading to that one, myself.

11
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,330
Do you mind if I take a look at it?

12
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,410
Not at all.

13
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,160
Wow. It's lighter than mine.

14
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,830
I've been waiting for this!

15
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,370
With a cell phone,
I can tease her in all sorts of new ways!

16
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,660
Of course, I've got one plan in mind already.

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,120
You're going' down, Takagi.

18
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,080
Ooo.

19
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,010
That's a cool feature.

20
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,620
Thanks for letting me check it out.

21
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,820
No prob.

22
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,870
Uhh...

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,870
Huh?

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,670
Ah, it's nothing.

25
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,100
I thought Takagi was gonna ask me for my email for sure.

26
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,540
What now?

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,040
Something wrong?

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,200
Huh? Nope!

29
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,980
Hmm?

30
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,250
Man.

31
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,910
If I can't get in touch with
her, I can't execute my plan!

32
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,500
Wait a second, why don't I just ask her then?

33
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,870
Why didn't I think of that earlier?

34
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,420
It's so obvious!

35
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,330
Hey, Takagi?

36
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,200
What is it?

37
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,610
I, uh...

38
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,620
Uh...

39
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,280
Your email address?

40
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,330
Hmm?

41
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,730
Never mind, wasn't important!

42
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,290
What's going on?

43
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,500
Why am I so nervous all of a sudden?

44
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,950
Get it together!

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,740
I'm just trying to get Takagi's email address!

46
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,950
I didn't really think about it before.

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,440
But if I'm asking a girl for her email.

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,500
Isn't that kinda like...?

49
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,250
Yes, it is!

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,580
Hey, Nishikata.

51
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,160
There isn't something you want to ask me, is there?

52
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,200
No, not at all!

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,060
Nope! Not a thing! Really!

54
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,660
Hmm...

55
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,910
Funny.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,700
I was certain you wanted to ask me for my email.

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,290
She knows!

58
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,830
Wait!

59
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,410
This might be my chance!

60
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,000
All I gotta do is say, "Actually,
you're right," and I'll get exactly what I want!

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,910
You've grown too careless.

62
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,910
Uh.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,370
Actually, yeah, you're right.

64
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,410
I am? Then why'd you lie about it?

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,410
Are you embarrassed?

66
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,370
Or what?

67
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,810
Huh?

68
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,290
She found a way to flip this one on me.

69
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,080
Uh. Who, me?

70
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,450
Embarrassed? No way.

71
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,330
Hmm?

72
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,200
I think you are.

73
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,790
It's just good to have in case something happens.

74
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,250
If what happens?

75
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,660
I dunno something.

76
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,060
So who else did you ask?

77
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,780
I'm not the only one, am I?

78
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,180
Nah.

79
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,640
So far Kimura and Takao.

80
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,290
And Nakai.

81
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,200
That's all?

82
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,790
It's only been a day.

83
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,950
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you've figured it out by now.

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
You're the first girl I've asked, whatever!

85
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,860
Just hurry up and give it already, this is killing me!

86
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,000
So what?

87
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
Do you want to message me?

88
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,540
Of course not!

89
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,080
I just want your stupid contact info,
so I can tease you when we're not at school!

90
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,250
It has nothing to do with wanting to talk to you!

91
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,000
Seriously!

92
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,830
That's all!

93
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,040
It's nothing weird, I swear!

94
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,620
I knew it had to be something like that.

95
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,750
Well, your plan to tease me has been thoroughly crushed.

96
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,480
Do you still want my email?

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,080
Yeah.

98
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,160
To make up for teasing me.

99
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,740
Help me clean up next week when I'm on day duty.

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,870
I didn't tease you, though!

101
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,970
I was going to tease you!

102
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,300
Well, yeah.

103
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,620
But if I hadn't found out, you would have eventually.

104
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,100
Y-Yeah.

105
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,230
Then it's a deal.

106
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,450
I'll talk to you soon.

107
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,550
When I get home.

108
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,050
She'll talk to me when she gets home?

109
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,250
Does that mean she's gonna
tease me when I'm at home too?

110
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,540
I wish I had a cell phone.

111
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,630
But I asked my mom if I could get one yesterday

112
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,940
and she said I was too young to have a phone.

113
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,870
Of course, she'll say no when
you ask her out of the blue.

114
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,830
You do say things out of the blue a lot.

115
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,750
Hey, that's not true!

116
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,620
For your information, I've wanted one forevs.

117
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,120
How long is "forevs"?

118
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,870
Umm...

119
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,360
If I had to put it into words,

120
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,540
a week?

121
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,910
So in not-Mina time, it's been three days, give or take?

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,600
Either way, that's still way too sudden.

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,040
Dude what's up with that picture?

124
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,950
It's ridiculous!

125
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,960
So dumb!

126
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,700
It's Super Ponpoko!

127
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,160
Pon, pon, Po-pon, pon! Pon, pon, Po-pon, pon!

128
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,460
But there's no denying a lot
of kids have them these days.

129
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,450
I guess I kinda want one, too.

130
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,620
I know, right?

131
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,410
I wish we all had 'em!

132
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,540
We should totally all bug our
moms till they buy 'em for us!

133
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,750
You want one too, right, Sanae?

134
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,500
No. Not really.

135
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,250
What?

136
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,450
Why the heck not?

137
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,340
We could message each other and stuff!

138
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
Because, hold on,

139
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,570
I have one.

140
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,080
What? How did that happen?

141
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,950
Sometimes I get home late from my club,
so my parents wanted me to have it.

142
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,950
That makes sense.

143
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,170
Still, you should have told us when you got it.

144
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,900
I know!

145
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,880
If I tell my parents Sanae has
one, maybe they'll buy one for me!

146
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,950
Hey. That's not a bad idea.

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,160
I'll do the same thing.

148
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,250
This time my mom'll agree for sure!

149
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,120
Then I can get a group chat going!

150
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,480
And I can download tons of games
and play them until I fall asleep!

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,830
Group chats are the worst

152
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,620
That childish attitude is why your
parents don't wanna get you one.

153
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,640
I'm not childish!

154
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,830
Hit me with a scary story!

155
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,000
What, you think not getting
scared means you're not childish?

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,250
Mm-hmm.

157
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,500
Yeah. So what? It's true!

158
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,120
Just tell me one, okay?

159
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,830
Late one night.

160
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,120
You get a call from an unknown number on your new phone.

161
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,410
You answer it and hear something soft.

162
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,950
A faint groaning of some sort.

163
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,410
You quickly hit "end call,"

164
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,080
and never hear from that number again.

165
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,910
That's goo--

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,810
But you're just so curious, you have to call back.

167
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,540
Why?

168
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,560
But this time,

169
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,910
you hear nothing on the other end of the line.

170
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,720
What a relief.

171
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,750
At the end of the month.

172
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,680
You look at your phone bill and
find a hundred thousand yen charge.

173
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,660
If that happened my parents would kill me!

174
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,910
You're gonna kill me if you keep screaming like that!

175
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Huh? Good morning, Nishikata.

176
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,620
Hey. Morning.

177
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,200
I see you decided to keep your promise.

178
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,910
I appreciate that.

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,370
Well, yeah.

180
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,410
Let me help.

181
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,200
Sure, thank you.

182
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,120
You're looking tired today.

183
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,290
Really?

184
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,250
Guess so.

185
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,750
Were you up late again?

186
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,580
Watching a recording of <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> ?

187
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,370
Huh? No!

188
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,130
Really?

189
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,670
What was it, then?

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,850
Nothing worth mentioning.

191
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,080
Were you messaging some of your friends?

192
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,500
Uh. Kinda.

193
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,770
What about?

194
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,880
That's weird.

195
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,660
It's unusual for her to pry into something this much.

196
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,490
Wait a second.

197
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,160
Fun, right?

198
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,450
I mean, messaging your friends when
you get your very first cell phone.

199
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,250
Honestly, I was hooked when I got mine, too.

200
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,120
And then before you know it,
you end up getting in trouble for doing it too much.

201
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,130
Takagi messaged someone enough times to get in trouble?

202
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,620
Who does she know that well?

203
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,660
Oh yeah?

204
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,750
With a girl from class I assume?

205
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,610
Nope.

206
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,380
Calm down.

207
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,860
She's tricked you with something like this before.

208
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,980
The last time I rode on the back of someone's bike.

209
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,110
I was riding with my dad.

210
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,910
I know!

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,160
Was it your dad?

212
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,780
Why would I get in trouble for texting my dad?

213
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,180
Touché.

214
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,130
Curious?

215
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,390
Not really.

216
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,750
If you tell me what you chat about with the boys,

217
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,830
I'll tell you who I was talking about.

218
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,220
Sound like a deal?

219
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,480
I don't care that much.

220
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,290
Wait...

221
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,990
I can kill two birds with one stone.

222
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,930
Sorry about this, but your fun stops here, Takagi.

223
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,500
Actually, yesterday we were sharing videos.

224
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,450
Mostly funny ones,
but there were a couple others mixed in.

225
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,660
Hmm?

226
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,800
Like what?

227
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,710
Yes, yes, by all means, keep taking the bait.

228
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,790
I'll send her that link that Kimura sent me.

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,040
It's thanks to this goat

230
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,970
I didn't sleep well last night.

231
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,410
Did you send me something?

232
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,160
Yeah.

233
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,240
It's a video of a cute animal
someone sent me last night.

234
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,160
It's not some pervy site, right?

235
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,700
Of course not!

236
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,790
Huh...

237
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,620
Let's see then.

238
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,030
It's so scary that you'll be at a loss for words!

239
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
Just give it a second.

240
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,290
Nishikata?

241
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,440
Yeah? What's up?

242
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,500
Do you like this stuff?

243
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,330
Like, do you look at it all the time?

244
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,910
Huh? Huh?!

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,120
Whoa, whoa, hold on, why is that on your phone?

246
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,330
What even is that?

247
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,500
It's definitely not what I sent you, is it?

248
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,000
Nope. Just thought I'd ask.

249
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,290
Huh?!

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,580
Now then, let's take a look-see at what you sent.

251
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,530
'Kay?

252
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,980
This is pathetic, she got me again!

253
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,660
Huh? It is an animal video.

254
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,410
Aww.

255
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,750
He's kinda cute.

256
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,080
Is he a goat?

257
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,370
Good, good, she's let her guard down.

258
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,000
Here comes the fun part.

259
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,580
That's it! That's the part!

260
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,040
Cower in fear, Takagi!

261
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,080
Oh. Scary.

262
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,250
Huh?!

263
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,660
Yeah. It is, right?

264
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,950
Crazy scary.

265
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,950
Yeah, then again.

266
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,370
It's not that scary when you watch it in the morning.

267
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,980
I'll give her that.

268
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,160
Huh... So this is what you guys talk about.

269
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,540
Boys are into such weird things.

270
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,750
So I held up my end.

271
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,120
What did you talk about with who exactly?

272
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,500
Mmm...

273
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,370
Just the usual stuff.

274
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,080
That doesn't answer the question, and you know it!

275
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,260
It doesn't?

276
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,060
Well, I talk with someone that starts with "Kuh."

277
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,200
Heh.

278
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,870
That's your clue.

279
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,450
"Kuh"?

280
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,820
Like, Kaede?

281
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,680
Wrong.

282
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,700
After that, is "zih."

283
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,910
Kuh-zih?

284
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,830
Kazi?

285
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,540
Wait, Kazi?

286
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,700
That boy?

287
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,120
No, it's not Kazi, either.

288
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,250
But the last bit is "in."

289
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,290
Kuh-zih-in?

290
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,550
What?

291
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,280
Ninety-seven.

292
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,310
Ninety-eight.

293
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,940
Ninety-nine!

294
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,500
Freakin' Takagi.

295
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,870
I really thought I'd be able to
get back at her for once, today.

296
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,970
But somehow, she outplayed me yet again.

297
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,200
No.

298
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,640
The day's not over yet.

299
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,710
It didn't work in the morning,
but I bet it will at night.

300
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,420
There's an even scarier video Kimura
told me about after school today.

301
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,940
Since it's scary, I haven't watched it myself.

302
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,330
But this will surely freak her ou--

303
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,500
How does she always know?

304
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,250
Why do I get the feeling

305
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,040
I'm gonna have to do more push-ups after this call?

306
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,870
Hello? Nishikata?

307
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,790
Yeah?

308
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,250
I was thinking it's about time.

309
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,070
Uh. About time for what?

310
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,330
For you to send me a scary video.

311
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,220
Huh? I dunno what you're talking about.

312
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,910
Huh?

313
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,330
Get real, Takagi.

314
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,040
You think I'm gonna reveal my plan just like that?

315
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,790
This battle is far from over--

316
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,880
Just you wait until after we get off the phone.

317
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,540
Huh?!

318
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,790
That's what you were thinking.

319
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,580
What? No. Not me, I wasn't.

320
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,750
Really?

321
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,950
Yes, of course, really.

322
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,250
Then, are you going to go to sleep soon?

323
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,100
Uh, yeah. Probably.

324
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,190
I see.

325
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,940
I was just about to do that, too.

326
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,210
Oh. Cool.

327
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,920
This feels kind of weird.

328
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:28,910
Huh?

329
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,720
I don't think we've ever talked
to each other at night before.

330
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,490
Kind of makes my heart flutter.

331
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,790
See you tomorrow, then.

332
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,370
Good night.

333
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,390
Yeah.

334
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,450
G'night to you, too.

335
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,880
Nishikata?

336
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,580
Yeah?

337
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,720
You haven't hung up yet.

338
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,090
Why not?

339
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,250
I dunno, I think you should hang up first.

340
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,830
I called you.

341
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,390
So you're supposed to hang up.

342
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,000
And why's that?

343
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,620
Okay, okay, on the count of three.

344
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,520
We'll both hang up.

345
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,820
One, two...

346
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,040
Liar.

347
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,000
C'mon, you didn't hang up either!

348
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,890
Man. Two nights in a row I can't sleep.

349
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,830
Those cats are fighting.

350
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,250
Give me like two minutes, Takagi!

351
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,750
What are you doing?

352
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,750
Good. Just like that.

353
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,750
Stay put right there for me, kitty-cats.

354
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,570
Yes, that's perfect!

355
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,480
Great. Add that to my collection of blurry photos.

356
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,410
What's with you?

357
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,370
Into photography now?

358
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,540
No, not particularly.

359
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,430
I'm just competing with the guys to
see who can take the best picture.

360
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,290
Has anyone already taken the lead?

361
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,410
Yeah, Kimura's unbeatable with this.

362
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,910
Whoa!

363
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,040
Gotta admire the commitment.

364
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,360
Funny pictures are great.

365
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,410
Mm-hmm.

366
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,950
Wait! I've got an idea!

367
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,080
Let me take a picture of that funny face you do!

368
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Huh?

369
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,950
That can totally beat Super Ponpoko!

370
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Help me out!

371
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,060
Hmmm...

372
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,620
I'll agree on the condition that
you do anything I ask of you.

373
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,910
Huh? What kind of "anything"?

374
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,700
The word pretty much covers it all.

375
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,330
Scary!

376
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,330
She has what it takes for me to win, but...

377
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,430
Oh. By the way...

378
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,800
That's the one!

379
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,910
I did the face.

380
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,250
That was your chance.

381
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,700
Wait! Do it again!

382
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,160
No can do.

383
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,330
No, it's okay.

384
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,160
I know her.

385
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,500
She enjoys this too much.

386
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,280
She'll want to do it again!

387
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,290
I'll just act as though I'm upset to lead her on.

388
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,160
Hey, guess what?

389
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,870
I knew it!

390
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,870
Here's my chance!

391
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,370
Really?

392
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,700
You had a toy snake on you?

393
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,480
That's a great picture.

394
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,160
Huh!? Wait, you took my picture?!

395
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,790
Hey! Delete that!

396
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,870
No way!

397
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,290
It's too good!

398
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,830
If you do anything I ask,

399
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,920
then I'll delete it for you.

400
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,040
Come on, Takagi!

401
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,090
That was a cheap shot, and you know it!

402
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,250
Wow. I got such a great picture.

403
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,160
Do you wanna see it?

404
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,160
No, I definitely don't.

405
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,620
Just look!

406
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,660
You had burst mode on?

407
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,120
Cool, huh?

408
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,230
The way your face changes?

409
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,630
Takagi, you're the worst!

410
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,830
I know!

411
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,500
I'll take a picture of her laughing with
her mouth hanging wide open, just like that!

412
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,250
That'll teach her!

413
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,260
Do I look okay?

414
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,290
Well, we're even now.

415
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,690
We're not even close to even!

416
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,200
If you want me to delete this shot,
then you gotta delete yours, too.

417
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,290
Nuh-uh.

418
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,620
I'll keep it.

419
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,030
So you don't have to delete my picture, either.

420
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,250
Wait.

421
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,670
But that's not the point.

422
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,250
Well, see ya.

423
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,440
Yeah.

424
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,960
She had fun.

425
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,420
But I didn't get a single
funny picture to show the guys.

426
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,030
Hey, Nishikata?

427
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,400
Do me a favor, and don't show my picture to anyone.

428
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,190
It's embarrassing.

429
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,120
Yeah, right.

430
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,120
Like I could show this to anyone!

431
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,450
What would people say about me having a photo like this?

432
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,830
It's not worth keeping!

433
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,970
Better delete it.

434
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,430
She did say it's embarrassing.

435
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,200
So maybe I can use it for some
kind of blackmail one day.

436
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,890
Might as well keep it.

437
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,020
<b>"Cell Phone"</b>

438
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,020
<b>"Horror"</b>

439
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,980
<b>"Picture"</b>
