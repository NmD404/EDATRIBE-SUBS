1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,040
Ugh. Bitter.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,870
What's going' on with your face?

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,160
Ugh.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,910
Huh? Wait. Isn't that coffee?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,830
I thought you hated the stuff, Mina.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,330
Why would you buy it you hate it?

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,370
Well, I'm becoming more of an adult now,
so I thought I should try to get myself used to it.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,620
Huh?

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,910
How exactly are you more of adult now?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,950
Ah! Hey, I may not be tall,
but I'm growing in some ways!

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,450
I'd like to see you drink this, Sanae!

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,290
No problem.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,500
I like it black.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,630
Huh?

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,950
You like it black?

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,150
Do you wanna trade with me, then?

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,820
I do. But I'm an adult, so...

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,870
Three, two, one--

19
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,790
Okay, whatever, let's trade!

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,410
Yes!

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,250
Ahhh... So good.

22
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,950
You sure you're okay with this?

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,680
Yeah.

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,120
There's gotta be some adults who can't drink coffee.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,080
You know you're a kid right?

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,370
Why're you so mean?

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,330
Ahh!

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,950
Ahhh! Ow!

29
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,410
Oh great.

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,250
Adults don't try to tackle their friends, Mina.

31
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,310
As I've come to expect,
Takagi made fun of me a ton today.

32
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,780
But I'll get her tomorrow!

33
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,620
Nishikata.

34
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,500
Takagi!

35
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,040
Oh.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,950
On your own today?

37
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,870
Yeah.

38
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,950
Cool. Let's walk home together.

39
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,500
Uh. Wait, why?

40
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,500
What?

41
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,950
Um, sorry.

42
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,330
I thought I heard something.

43
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,040
But, um, you're on your bike, and all.

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,700
I'll just push.

45
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,950
That's that new drink that just came out, isn't it?

46
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,830
Is it good?

47
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,410
What is this?

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,370
Some kind of trap?

49
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,830
I like it.

50
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,450
You wanna have a sip?

51
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,330
Can I?

52
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,410
Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,250
Great. Thank you.

54
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,580
Not that I really mind,

55
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,160
but won't it be like we're
indirectly kissing or something?

56
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,000
How's that, Takagi?

57
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,420
Super embarrassing, right?

58
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,000
You're so embarrassed!

59
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,620
Wha...? How?

60
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,450
She's not embarrassed in the slightest!

61
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,080
What is with her?

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,330
Ahh...

63
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,750
Boy, that was good.

64
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,450
Thanks again.

65
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,910
Can't drink it?

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,750
No. Of course I can drink it.

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,410
It's nothing.

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,450
No big deal.

69
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,790
It's like an indirect kiss.

70
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,290
Aah!

71
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,330
You're so jumpy.

72
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,330
There's gotta be a trash can around here.

73
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,950
Man!

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,120
Wow!

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,790
That was a pretty good shot, Nishikata.

76
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,580
I just threw it without thinking.

77
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,000
I didn't expect to make it in.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is crazy!

79
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,750
I didn't know I was such a good shot!

80
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,790
All right.

81
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,910
I wanna give this a go.

82
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,830
What are you aiming at?

83
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,000
You weren't even close!

84
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,500
You're terrible at this!

85
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,330
Oh? Care to make it interesting?

86
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,290
Yeah, fine.

87
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,750
I can't say "no" when winning's a sure-thing.

88
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,120
Then, we'll each throw one can at a time.

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,910
The first person to make it in, wins.

90
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,750
Challenging me to a match she can't possibly win.

91
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,540
Takagi's really lost her cool this time.

92
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,200
And it feels awesome!

93
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,620
So if you somehow win,

94
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,290
then I guess I'll do anything you want me to.

95
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,330
I'm gonna hold you to that.

96
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,370
You better not chicken out later.

97
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,700
No way.

98
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,950
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna lose to you.

99
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,000
Glad to hear it.

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,910
If you miss, that means I win.

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,830
Ugh.

102
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,250
She totally tricked me again.

103
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,080
Just stand at the same place and use the same angle.

104
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,910
Okay.

105
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,450
I can do this.

106
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,620
It's a walk in the park!

107
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,950
Oh, yeah.

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,620
So, uh, if you happen to win,

109
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,750
then I'll let you have my first kiss.

110
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,120
Looks like I win!

111
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,620
That wasn't fair.

112
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,450
What wasn't?

113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,910
Whaddya mean "what wasn't"?

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,580
As I threw it, you said--

115
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
Hmm? Said what?

116
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,330
Oh, forget it.

117
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,200
Okay.

118
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,700
Well, a promise is a promise.

119
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,620
Now what should I make you do?

120
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,250
I don't even want to think about what she might say.

121
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,080
Know what?

122
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,620
How about this?

123
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,660
You can do whatever.

124
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,000
Wait, where are you going Takagi?!

125
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,750
Don't pity me!

126
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,200
I need consequences!

127
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,700
Letting me off like this makes me feel like

128
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,870
I'll never beat you at anything.

129
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,870
You never will beat me at anything.

130
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,700
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

131
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,080
Hey!

132
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,290
Ahh!

133
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,950
So fizzy.

134
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,370
What is it this time?

135
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,750
Huh? You're drinking soda?

136
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,580
I thought you didn't like soda, though.

137
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,910
Why do sodas have to be so fizzy? It stings!

138
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,870
Is there a reason you keep buying
drinks you don't even like?

139
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,040
Pretending to be an adult again?

140
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,370
No, not that.

141
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,540
I just love the flavor.

142
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,580
But it stings bad!

143
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,220
My poor tongue is hurting so bad!

144
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,120
You're so annoying.

145
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,290
What?

146
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,370
Don't act like it doesn't hurt your tongue

147
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,700
when you have this stuff!

148
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,750
It doesn't.

149
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,660
Prove it. Have some right now.

150
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,620
All right.

151
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,330
Ahh!

152
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,290
The pain'll bubble up inside you soon.

153
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,200
Yeah, not likely.

154
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,750
Tell the truth.

155
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,250
You're feeling it, aren't you?

156
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,000
No, I'm not.

157
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,290
Hmm...

158
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,000
What pain is she talking about?

159
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,370
I'm fine.

160
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,540
Oh no.

161
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,370
I'm about to burp.

162
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,790
Ha! You feeling' it now?

163
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,120
Nuh-uh.

164
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,870
If I burp right now, she's gonna make fun of me.

165
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,750
But this stupid fizz is still coming up.

166
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,250
I can't hold it much longer!

167
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,410
Agh! It's so tingly, I hate it!

168
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,160
Ahhh...

169
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,660
What's your problem?

170
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,290
Nothing.

171
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,120
Why am I still drinking this?

172
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,950
See you tomorrow!

173
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,080
Just you wait, Takagi.

174
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,020
Including the walk home,
she teased me 15 times in total today.

175
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,000
Each time I make a mistake during a
game, I make a note of it.

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,700
Then I train ten times harder for each one.

177
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,610
I believe that will lead me to my next victory.

178
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,830
That's it!

179
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,200
Today I had 15 losses.

180
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,370
And that times ten is 150!

181
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,700
Uh... That might be too much for my first go.

182
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,700
Okay.

183
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,560
Let's try three times first.

184
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,790
One, two, three.

185
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,040
Eighteen.

186
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,750
Nineteen.

187
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,040
This is a lot harder than I thought!

188
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Maybe I shouldn't do so many.

189
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,450
No, I have to!

190
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,380
This is my punishment for letting
Takagi mess with me so many times!

191
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,480
I'll savor this agony and use it as
motivation to get back at her next time!

192
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,120
I can do this!

193
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,200
What's wrong?

194
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,450
Is your arm hurt?

195
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,500
Pull a muscle?

196
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,290
Huh? Oh, no, it's nothing like that.

197
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,500
It's just extra sore is all.

198
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,870
Huh?

199
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,870
I just said it was sore!

200
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,910
That really hurts!

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,660
Does that count as her first teasing of the day?

202
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,580
I should probably be holding myself accountable.

203
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,410
So I guess that's one.

204
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,910
Hey!

205
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,040
That was way too easy!

206
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,040
You must be really sore if flinching hurts.

207
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,340
Okay, well that was definitely
teasing, no doubt about it.

208
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,790
So... wanna tell me why you're sore all of a sudden?

209
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,790
Uhh. I started to work out yesterday, so you know.

210
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,040
Interesting.

211
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,040
I hope you don't quit after like, three days.

212
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,540
Hah. Go ahead.

213
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,750
Laugh it up now.

214
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,450
Why?

215
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,580
She teased me 23 times today!

216
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,080
Is that a record?

217
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Either way, it's much more than yesterday!

218
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,120
One, two, three.

219
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,200
Hey, whatever happened to working out, Nishikata?

220
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,000
Nothing, I still do it daily.

221
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,290
Oh wow.

222
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,080
So you didn't quit three days in?

223
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,620
Yes, thanks to you.

224
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,450
Oh! But you know what I heard?

225
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,000
Huh? No, what?

226
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,790
They say if you work out too much during your
growth spurt, it'll stop you from getting taller.

227
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,290
Uh, wait?

228
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,580
Huh?! Oh no!

229
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,700
I think I did hear that somewhere before!

230
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,120
That's not good!

231
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
If she ends ups taller than me because I'm stunting

232
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,750
my own growth, I'll never heard the end of it!

233
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,200
She'll make fun of me forever!

234
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,580
What do I do, what do I do?

235
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,160
But that is just a rumor.

236
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,040
Just a rumor?

237
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,200
In fact, I've also heard moderate
exercise actually supports your growth.

238
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,000
So, that being the case, you should keep working out.

239
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,870
Nothing to worry about.

240
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,290
It's a good idea.

241
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,410
And to be honest,

242
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,870
you kinda look a bit more muscular.

243
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,450
You think?

244
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,870
What's wrong?

245
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,580
You're quiet.

246
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,160
Don't tell me that you're blushing.

247
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,870
I'm not blushing.

248
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,950
But your face is red.

249
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,700
Yeah, you're definitely blushing all right.

250
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,450
Why do you always have to tease me every single day?

251
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,370
Because I like seeing your reactions, duh.

252
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,660
By the way,

253
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,700
I wasn't lying when I said you look muscular.

254
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,830
Honestly, you've looked pretty good lately.

255
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,120
You're even redder now!

256
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,830
Whatever! It's just because it's hot outside!

257
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,580
Hey!

258
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,500
Takagi!

259
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,950
Come back!

260
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,330
The count is 54 today.

261
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,250
Oh, 55 including this last one.

262
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,700
But I'm starting to think that I should keep working out

263
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,500
even if Takagi doesn't tease me.

264
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,540
Chester dear, are you eating dinner at home tonight?

265
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,910
Well, I reckon' that depends on work.

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,370
If we go too late,
I'll just eat with Jirou on my way home.

267
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,500
I'm glad you've found a close friend in Jirou,

268
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,200
but you should have dinner at home sometimes.

269
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,290
It's starting to feel lonely without you.

270
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,410
Yeah, but it's mah job, what can yah do?

271
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,580
Can we please just go home?

272
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,620
No way! We're having' fun!

273
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,080
Why are you still talking like that?

274
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
So annoying.

275
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,000
Uh...

276
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,040
You jerk!

277
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,700
Am I really so unimportant to you?

278
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,200
Aww, Pudding', don't be like that.

279
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,330
I'm doing' mah best here.

280
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,500
Why are you crying' mah darling'?

281
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,540
Well, it's as if Jirou and your
work have taken you away from me.

282
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,280
I just...

283
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,660
I don't think I can take it any longer.

284
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,830
Emotions are running high.

285
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,200
Ahh jeez, I'm sick o' this!

286
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,370
How could you say such a thing, Chester? Oh!

287
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,370
Listen here.

288
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,000
If yer gonna act like this.

289
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,410
Then so will I!

290
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Uh... Hold on.

291
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,870
Did you realize those cats are both male?

292
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,790
Hey, whaddya know, it's Chester!

293
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,450
Well, if it ain't Jirou!

294
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,330
Wanna grab a bite to eat?

295
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,910
I really want to go home.

296
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,250
Aww! Of course it starts raining right when school ends.

297
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,000
Huh?! No one told me it was gonna rain today!

298
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,410
If I knew, I would have brought my raincoat!

299
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,660
Dummy.

300
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,330
Hey, don't be so mean to Mina.

301
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,870
You want to take the bus home, then?

302
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,250
I don't have any bus money either.

303
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,040
See what I mean, dumb.

304
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,660
Oh, you be quiet.

305
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,770
I'll lend you some cash, don't worry.

306
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,330
Man.

307
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,120
I got teased a ton today, too.

308
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,620
Huh? Aren't you heading home, Takagi?

309
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,790
Not yet.

310
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,830
I didn't bring a raincoat or an umbrella.

311
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,120
You are such an airhead!

312
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,450
You really didn't know it was gonna rain today?

313
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,790
How ditzy can you be?

314
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,000
No comeback?

315
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,500
Oh.

316
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,450
Come to think of it, your umbrella is pretty big, right?

317
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,790
Huh?

318
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,790
We look like a couple under this umbrella together.

319
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,120
How in the world did this happen?

320
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,700
I feel so weird!

321
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,580
It's super awkward!

322
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,080
What should I do?

323
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,700
Fill the silence, I guess.

324
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,540
So, uh, what about your bike?

325
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,290
It's still at school, but I'll walk tomorrow.

326
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,450
Oh. Okay.

327
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,870
It's even more awkward now that I tried to fill
the silence, and it worked for all of five seconds!

328
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,040
Ugh. I'm so embarrassed that
it's getting hard to breathe.

329
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,750
I need to distract myself somehow.

330
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,410
Hey, Takagi!

331
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,660
How's this?

332
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,660
Are you scared?

333
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,290
Surprised?

334
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,330
Give me something!

335
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,040
Aww. He's so cute!

336
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,830
Excuse me?

337
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,700
Ugh, what was I thinking?

338
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,330
This is Takagi I'm dealing with, of course she's fine!

339
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,000
Wait, what?

340
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,080
Don't freak, it's just a frog.

341
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,950
By the way, Nishikata.

342
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,950
Is your shoulder getting wet over there?

343
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,080
Yeah, sort of.

344
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,660
It's not that bad, though.

345
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,910
Getting wet at all can lead to a cold.

346
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm gonna scoot closer,
so get yourself all the way under the umbrella.

347
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,450
My heart's pounding so fast.

348
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,370
It feels like it's about to burst!

349
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,910
Calm down, calm down, Nishikata!

350
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,750
If she finds out you're nervous,
she's gonna make fun of you again!

351
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,410
Just talk about something.

352
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,790
Anything!

353
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,290
So hey, uh...

354
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,660
Hmm?

355
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,430
It's pretty unusual for you to forget
your umbrella when it's supposed to rain.

356
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,230
Could it be that you really are an
airhead, and I was right all along?

357
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,500
Was that too harsh?

358
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,370
Hmmm...

359
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,750
Yeah, maybe.

360
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,790
I do tend to be sort of forgetful.

361
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,040
Did I hear that right?

362
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,500
Did she just admit she has a fault?

363
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,540
What a rare occasion!

364
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,540
I feel like I've won for once!

365
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,200
I'm having trouble remembering
something right now, actually.

366
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,290
Oh, yeah?

367
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,660
Do you need help?

368
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,370
Mm-hmm.

369
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,120
The two of us, all close, sharing the same umbrella.

370
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,950
We must look like a...

371
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,410
What was the word for it?

372
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,700
I just can't seem to remember it.

373
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,660
Uhh.

374
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,700
Wait, you don't mean...

375
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,290
It's on the tip of my tongue!

376
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,620
Uh... We look like a couple?

377
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,580
Huh? What was that?

378
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,370
I didn't quite hear you.

379
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,750
Oh, I remember!

380
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,250
It was "couple"!

381
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,830
Come on, there's no way you forgot that!

382
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,700
Oh, what about that thing that couples do?

383
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,830
You know.

384
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,910
It's a way they express their love.

385
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,690
When they take their lips and then
press them up against each other?

386
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,700
If I don't answer her, then I lose!

387
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,200
A... A kiss?

388
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,160
Huh? I can't hear you, the rain's too loud.

389
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,160
What do you mean?

390
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,080
It's not raining that hard anymore.

391
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,120
Hmm?

392
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,660
So don't pretend you didn't hear me.

393
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,330
I said it's a kiss.

394
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,250
Ahh. That was it.

395
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,580
So how about that phrase they
always use to show their feelings?

396
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,330
Know that?

397
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,160
You know.

398
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,040
That one.

399
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,790
Not I "like" you, but...

400
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,790
Pretty sure it starts out the same.

401
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,620
"I" something.

402
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,660
Uh, I dunno.

403
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,330
I think the next word starts with "L" too.

404
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,250
I said I don't know!

405
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,450
Nah, you know this one.

406
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,040
"I"...

407
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,700
The next word starts with "L-O."

408
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,160
"I lo"... What's the next letter?

409
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,700
You know it.

410
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,290
Th-That's enough.

411
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,250
Oh! The last word is "you."

412
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,080
You're not gonna let up, are you?

413
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,410
Ugh, man!

414
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,620
Hey, check it out, the rain stopped!

415
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,230
Yeah, you're right.

416
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm saved!

417
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,830
There was no way I could survive that
treatment until we reached her house!

418
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,620
Well, my place is this way.

419
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,500
Now that the skies are clear, I'll be going.

420
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,830
Where are we?

421
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,330
I don't know how to get home from here.

422
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,410
Ugh!

423
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,370
Will you ever give me a break?

424
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,040
<b>"Coffee"</b>

425
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,270
<b>"Empty Can"</b>

426
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,960
<b>"Soda“</b>

427
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,110
<b>"Muscle Training"</b>

428
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,000
<b>“Dubbing”</b>

429
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:59,040
<b>"Umbrella"</b>
