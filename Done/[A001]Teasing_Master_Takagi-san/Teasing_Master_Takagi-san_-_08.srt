1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,250
If you're ready, hold on tight.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,060
Sure.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,290
When we first started practicing

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,750
tandem riding, the hardest part
was Takagi holding on to me.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,580
Don't tickle me; you're gonna make us fall over!

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,130
I wasn't tickling you.

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,060
I just held on a little.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,540
But if you thought I was, your ribs are ticklish.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,040
It's just because of how your hands are touching them.

10
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,830
Change the way you're holding on.

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,250
How's this?

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,700
Don't you think that's a bit too close?

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,660
No.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,450
I'll fall if I'm not close.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,330
Oh, come on.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,660
Don't get self-conscious.

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,920
I'm not! I'm just overheating when you're right

18
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,210
up against me, it's already a thousand degrees.

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,330
Anyway, just do me a favor and don't grab on so tight.

20
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,230
But you literally told me to hold on tight a minute ago.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,530
All right, then.

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,940
Why don't you just show me how
you want me to hold onto you?

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,610
Hurry it up.

24
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,820
We're gonna run out of time to practice.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,980
Uh. I guess something like this works?

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,910
But now we've overcome our hurdles!

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,120
And finally...

28
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,390
...we've mastered tandem riding.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,670
Yeah.

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,390
Looks like we're done.

31
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,620
I mean, we wanted to learn to ride together, and we did.

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,660
So there's no need to practice anymore.

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,500
Uh. Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,450
Are you, by any chance, like, kinda bummed?

35
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,790
Huh?! I dunno.

36
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,500
Relieved, then?

37
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,200
It'd be rude to say I'm relieved we're done,

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,430
but if I say I'm bummed out,
she's just gonna tease me even more.

39
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,250
A little bit of both options.

40
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey. No fair.

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,160
Well, what about you, huh?

42
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,040
What about me?

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,040
Well, I'd say I'm not that bummed out.

44
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,430
Oh, cool.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,870
Tomorrow, let's finish up our homework at the library.

46
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,830
Huh?

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,620
We can check each other's work.

48
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,210
Uh. Okay.

49
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,890
Vacation's ending. Real soon.

50
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,820
On the other hand, our next term is starting.

51
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,290
Yeah.

52
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,220
I wonder when we're actually getting that typhoon.

53
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Oh man, it's so windy!

54
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,850
Whoa, that's really high!

55
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,910
This typhoon is crazy!

56
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,160
I don't know why, but I feel really excited!

57
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,250
Now wind, blow harder and harder!

58
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,790
Perfect timing!

59
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,160
I feel like I'm controlling this huge gust!

60
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,760
So awesome!

61
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,160
Now, gale.

62
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,910
I command thee...!

63
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,950
Morning, Nishikata.

64
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,620
Good morning, Takagi.

65
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,690
This wind is really something, huh?

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,290
I probably should have tied my hair back.

67
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,000
Uh. Yeah, I bet that would have helped.

68
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,650
I was just checking the direction of the wind.

69
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,550
You realize I didn't ask what you were doing.

70
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,850
Come on!

71
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,230
Why does she always have to see
me at the worst possible times?

72
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,450
So what were you doing?

73
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,540
I just said, I was checking the direction of the wind.

74
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,450
Weird.

75
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,910
That's not what it looked like to me.

76
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,860
"Now wind, blow harder and harder!"

77
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,410
I could have sworn I heard that.

78
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,410
Me? No way, that would just be ridiculous.

79
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,960
Watching someone else do it makes
me realize how embarrassing it is.

80
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,630
So, why were you checking the
direction of the wind, then?

81
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,500
I just thought it'd be good to know.

82
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,200
Given that the wind's so strong.

83
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,500
So I won't fall over!

84
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,480
Yeah?

85
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,500
But you had both hands raised up so high.

86
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,500
Like, "Wow!

87
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,250
I feel like I'm controlling this huge gust of wind!

88
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,250
So awesome!"

89
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,080
I'd bet that's what you were thinking.

90
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,080
That's even more embarrassing.

91
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,200
By the way, do you notice anything different?

92
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,540
You're not riding your bike?

93
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,160
That it?

94
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,530
Uh-huh.

95
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,250
Question is:

96
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,330
Why do you think I'm not riding it today?

97
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,950
Because there's a typh--

98
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,250
If you guess right,

99
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,660
I'll keep quiet about your little performance earlier.

100
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,000
I won't tell a soul.

101
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,040
We've been over this,
I was checking the wind's direction.

102
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,120
You have until that plastic bag gets here.

103
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,910
Are you serious?

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,580
I have a time limit?

105
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,620
I have no choice but to get this right.

106
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,210
She wouldn't be asking such a simple
question if there wasn't a twist.

107
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,660
So I can rule out anything obvious like,
"It's dangerous to ride a bike in a typhoon."

108
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,580
Think. Think!

109
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,700
Some other problem that a strong wind would cause.

110
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,950
Bike.

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,250
Wind.

112
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,870
Could it be her skirt?

113
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,660
Your... Your...

114
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,540
I can't bring myself to say that out loud!

115
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,040
It's too awkward!

116
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,290
And... you are out of time.

117
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,910
The correct answer is that it's
dangerous to ride a bike in a typhoon.

118
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,830
Sorry!

119
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,790
Huh?

120
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,750
What?

121
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,040
Seriously?

122
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,280
You read into things too much.

123
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,620
Okay.

124
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,880
Let's get going.

125
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,370
This wind is so strong.

126
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,370
Yeah.

127
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,030
Kinda gets you excited, doesn't it?

128
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,540
Yeah. I mean, I don't really
know what you're talking about.

129
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,910
Hmm?

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,080
Come on.

131
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,910
Doesn't it make you want to shout?

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,750
Raise your hands to the sky!

133
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,290
"Now wind, blow harder and harder!"

134
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,540
This sensation!

135
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,040
It's like I'm controlling the storm!

136
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,950
I am the great Wind King, ruler of this world!

137
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,620
I shall blow the school away
to the far ends of the earth!

138
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,700
Hey, I never went that far!

139
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,080
So you weren't just checking the wind's direction.

140
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,290
Uh...

141
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,410
Well, whatever.

142
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,450
Let's race to school!

143
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,510
Hurry up!

144
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,790
So strong!

145
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,160
Huh? Wait up, Takagi!

146
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,500
You always try to get a head start!

147
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,580
For some reason,
Takagi was really energetic this morning.

148
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,040
All right!

149
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,250
Let's do this!

150
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,160
How are you so full of energy?

151
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,040
I thought you hated marathons.

152
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,830
Nah.

153
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,330
I'm looking forward to it!

154
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,250
In fact, let's race, Sanae!

155
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,420
Okay.

156
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,910
How about if I win, you don't get to eat any lunch?

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,950
Yeah.

158
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,570
Bring it on!

159
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,580
Wait. You sure?

160
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,290
You know Sanae is really fast, don't you?

161
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,910
Yeah, but I'm in the zone!

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,160
Uh-huh...

163
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,620
What's the point of running a marathon?

164
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,790
It's not like we're ever gonna run this
much after we're finished with school.

165
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,330
It doesn't make any sense.

166
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,660
So lame.

167
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,450
You said it, dude.

168
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,950
You look enthusiastic, Nishikata.

169
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,660
Nishikata.

170
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,450
You sure you're up to this?

171
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,540
Ha! 'Course I am.

172
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,660
It was my idea to begin with.

173
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,910
'Kay.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,660
See ya later!

175
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,250
You and Takagi sure are close.

176
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,870
Huh?!

177
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,500
Are you going out with her?

178
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,900
What are you talking about?

179
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,620
Don't get the wrong idea, Kimura!

180
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,900
I'm only competing with her because the
winner gets to order the loser around!

181
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,920
Wait. You're racing each other in the marathon? But...

182
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,600
It's none of your business.

183
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,370
Judging by that reaction,
I wouldn't put money on the two of them going out.

184
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah, I mean, if they were going out...

185
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,000
Nakai! How are you feeling?

186
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,120
Pretty darn good!

187
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,520
And it's all thanks to you
training with me every single day!

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's destroy this marathon!

189
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,440
Yeah!

190
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,650
They'd be acting something like that.

191
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,470
All right, gather 'round!

192
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,200
I'll never understand why we have to do this.

193
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,620
Just accept it already, Kimura.

194
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,920
Empty your mind.

195
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,210
Run with an empty mind.

196
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,230
Calm yourself and avoid wasting unnecessary energy.

197
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,620
I've got you this time, Takagi.

198
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,460
I've jogged every evening for
over two weeks just for this day!

199
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,500
Come rain.

200
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,050
Come wind!

201
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,870
There's no way I'm gonna lose after all that prep.

202
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh! Empty your mind.

203
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,790
Empty your mind.

204
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,250
Hey, Nishikata!

205
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,120
I figured you would have sprinted way ahead of the pack.

206
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,320
Oh yeah?

207
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,450
Sorry, but pacing yourself is the key.

208
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,220
But clearly you don't get it.

209
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,410
You look unfazed, but you sped up because you

210
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,890
couldn't see me ahead of you and panicked, right?

211
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,910
Hmm?

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,040
I was running slow until now because
I wanted to give you a handicap.

213
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,950
Handicap?

214
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,860
Wait, did she just read my mind?

215
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,200
Well, I'm going on ahead.

216
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,790
Huh?

217
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,580
I can't have lunch.

218
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,480
And I'm already so hungry.

219
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,240
I started out too fast.

220
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,910
That's right.

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,040
You'll see, Takagi.

222
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,420
If you keep running that fast,
you're gonna lose your pace just like her!

223
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,240
And all I have to do is keep up my pace.

224
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,960
Wait.

225
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,420
But what if Takagi is actually
good at running marathons?

226
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,670
If she is, I'm screwed!

227
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,250
I don't have the time to empty my mind!

228
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,830
Is she already running back?

229
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,050
She's that much faster than the boys?

230
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
I lost my pace, but I caught up.

231
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,080
If you manage to touch me,

232
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,400
then you can be the winner.

233
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,080
I can't touch her in front of all these people!

234
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
Who knows what they'd think was going on?

235
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,220
Takagi, you sneaky little...

236
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,770
You deliberately made me lose my pace!

237
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,420
Ugh...

238
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,200
Takagi.

239
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,700
I'll give you a different win condition, too.

240
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,290
If you can run 50 meters ahead of
me, the crown is yours!

241
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,700
You mean that?

242
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,750
Hook, line, and sinker!

243
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,830
I hope you're ready!

244
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,620
Because I'm gonna destroy your pace this time!

245
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,870
You're finished!

246
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,660
Cool!

247
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,750
I win, then.

248
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,220
All the girls are supposed to turn back here.

249
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,330
Good luck!

250
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,980
You boys still need to run two more kilometers.

251
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,290
Oh, that is so not fair, Takagi!

252
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,540
That's why I asked if you were sure!

253
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,650
We're recording your time Nishikata; don't stop running!

254
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,700
What'd I say?

255
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,280
Your sides start to hurt and you get hungry.

256
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,230
As far as I'm concerned, absolutely nothing
positive comes from running a marathon.

257
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,980
If you used all that energy to run instead of

258
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,830
complaining, you might be able to go a little faster.

259
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,200
Why would I do something so pointless?

260
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,160
You really think running is
more pointless than complaining?

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,250
I just wanna eat lunch.

262
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,580
I'm hungry too.

263
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm starving.

264
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,160
Takagi messed with me a ton today.

265
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,440
Again.

266
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,790
Man.

267
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,540
You'll get yours.

268
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,830
What's up?

269
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,260
Stop staring.

270
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,580
I can't get over that.

271
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,370
You have such ticklish ribs!

272
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,790
She does this every time there's an opportunity.

273
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,830
Yeah, sure, my ribs are ticklish.

274
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,950
But aren't everybody's?

275
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,250
I'm not special.

276
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,040
Hey, Takagi.

277
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,730
Hmm?

278
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,310
Wanna make a bet?

279
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,540
I'm thinking whichever one of
us laughs first is the loser.

280
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,410
Yeah, why not?

281
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,410
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to start right now.

282
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,460
Okay.

283
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,620
I've got you now!

284
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,660
You have no idea what I've got in store, do you?

285
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,160
Looks like both your hands are
occupied holding your bike.

286
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:00,950
Too bad.

287
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,340
You're at a disadvantage.

288
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,340
If you think you can protect your ribs with only

289
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,700
your elbows you've got another thing coming!

290
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,200
Oh. By the way,

291
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,580
so you know, my ribs happen to not be ticklish.

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,580
Made you look!

293
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,370
Wow. No laugh?

294
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,660
That was too close for comfort.

295
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,790
And did she say she's not ticklish?

296
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,200
That's a bluff if I've ever heard one.

297
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,950
She's wide open!

298
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,450
Then could she be telling the truth?

299
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,370
No.

300
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,230
My best option remaining is to just
go for it and find out that way.

301
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,410
Is something wrong?

302
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,490
Huh?

303
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,290
All good. It's, uh, nothing.

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,620
This is kinda embarrassing.

305
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,070
Should I really touch her like that?

306
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,450
Wouldn't it be sexual harassment?

307
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,310
Hmm?

308
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,870
Better hurry up, or I'll get you again.

309
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,850
Huh?!

310
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,080
What the heck?

311
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,410
I thought I had the perfect plan all worked out.

312
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,890
How did I not realize it had such a pitfall!

313
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,000
It's too risky to go through with.

314
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,560
I'll keep my distance and maybe this can end in a draw.

315
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,160
Hey.

316
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,160
That face isn't fair!

317
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,540
I win.

318
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm really dropping the ball today.

319
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,900
I can't believe I forgot that
Takagi makes such good funny faces.

320
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,040
Well then, what should I make you do this time?

321
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,790
Huh? There's a penalty for the loser?

322
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,450
You said, "Wanna make a bet."

323
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,160
Of course there is!

324
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,240
Now, let's see...

325
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,200
You can't eat rice for the rest of your life.

326
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,200
Huh?

327
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,440
That's brutal!

328
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,040
Don't worry, I'm just kidding.

329
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,660
You can't read <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

330
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,030
Huh?

331
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,450
That's pretty cruel, too.

332
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,330
Well how about this, then?

333
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,280
You have to poke my ribs.

334
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,800
Uh?

335
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,870
Uhh. Wait, that's my punishment?

336
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,940
Mm-hmm.

337
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,930
Okay, then.

338
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,280
Hmm?

339
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
That's it!

340
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,120
I see what's going' on here!

341
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,610
She wants to enjoy me getting
embarrassed and struggling to touch her.

342
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,830
Not on my watch!

343
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,890
Come to think of it.

344
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,200
This might actually be the first
time I've ever touched her.

345
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,400
Anywhere but her shoulder, I mean.

346
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,580
No, don't think about it.

347
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,660
You're just poking her!

348
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,570
It's not a big deal!

349
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,270
You okay?

350
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,500
See?

351
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,660
Told you.

352
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,290
My ribs aren't ticklish in the slightest.

353
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,620
Yeah.

354
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,000
My armpits are pretty ticklish, though.

355
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,330
I definitely can't touch her there!

356
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,290
I totally forgot!

357
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,120
About?

358
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,040
This is absolutely terrible!

359
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,450
What's terrible?

360
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,540
We didn't do our test of courage over the summer--ah...

361
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,200
Oh yeah, I guess we didn't.

362
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,750
Let's do it today after school!

363
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,830
We just gotta!

364
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,410
Uh, I guess that's okay.

365
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,250
You feel that? It's so haunted!

366
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,330
Ooooh...

367
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,450
Are we really going in there?

368
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,870
Yes!

369
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,000
They're too excited for this to be a test of courage.

370
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,790
It's so dark!

371
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,620
Uh-huh.

372
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,580
Oh!

373
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,250
A hole!

374
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,660
Oooh.

375
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,000
Huh? A paper talisman!

376
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,370
For the spirits!

377
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,950
Yeah.

378
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Look at that!

379
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
What's a steel barrel doing in here?

380
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,370
Uhh?

381
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,330
This isn't scary at all.

382
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,370
What? No.

383
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,950
It's super scary!

384
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,450
Yeah, no.

385
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,330
Whoa, look!

386
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,000
I found a Frisbee!

387
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,000
Lucky!

388
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,790
That's weird to find this deep in.

389
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,290
It's kinda chilly in here!

390
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,870
You think it's a ghost?

391
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,160
No, we're just out of the sun
and the wind is blowing through.

392
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,580
This is so fun!

393
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,370
Oooo!

394
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,500
Whaddya doing; don't chase me!

395
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,410
Are you happy we did it?

396
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,000
Mm-hmm.

397
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,870
It was such a classic summer vacation adventure!

398
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,290
Sure, whatever that means.

399
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,950
But it sucks.

400
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,490
Summer vacation isn't coming back any time soon.

401
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,260
Yeah.

402
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,620
I'm not used to you being so bummed out Mina.

403
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Talk about a downer.

405
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,970
