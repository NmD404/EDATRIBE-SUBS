1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,410
Forget the test!

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,160
I'm gonna die if I have to study any longer!

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,540
I'm hitting' the arcade.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,330
Well, we can't let you go alone!

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,500
Hey, Nishikata, are you coming'?

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,910
I don't know about you,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,700
but when I study for too long, it just doesn't stick.

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,580
Uhh.

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,080
Sorry, I think I'm gonna stay.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,700
You've made your choice!

11
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,080
Later!

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,450
What are you guys gonna play?

13
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,660
Whichever gets me one of those cute figures.

14
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,620
Man.

15
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,620
I'm jealous.

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,700
But I can't think about them.

17
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,040
I have to get a good grade on my next test!

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Or else!

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,700
Hey.

20
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,950
Can I sit here?

21
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,080
Studying for the test?

22
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,540
Yeah. I am.

23
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,830
I just saw your friends leaving as I came in.

24
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,040
Yeah.

25
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,450
We were all studying together for a while.

26
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,910
Ahh...

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,290
Well I heard them talking,

28
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,750
and I figured they were on their way to the arcade.

29
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,910
Are you not going with them?

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,650
I don't have time to play around like they do.

31
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,450
If I don't score within the top
fifty of my grade on this test.

32
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,250
My parents are taking away my video games.

33
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,200
Huuuh.

34
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,950
I see.

35
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
Oh, no!

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,870
Why am I telling her everything?

37
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,770
Now that she knows, she's totally
gonna distract me from studying!

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,450
Nice going, me.

39
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,950
I.. was just kidding?

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,620
About what?

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,650
Ugh. Forget it.

42
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,300
Anyway, don't interrupt me this time.

43
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,080
That's mean.

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,250
You say that like I'm always getting in your way.

45
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,370
That's because you are!

46
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,500
Well, yeah. It's 'cuz it's so
fun to tease you, Nishikata!

47
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,410
Should I study somewhere else?

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,120
No, if I did that, I'd basically be letting her win.

49
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,040
I just realized.

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,280
You're not studying?

51
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,510
Nope.

52
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,700
I like to limit myself to two hours of studying a day.

53
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,870
Oh.

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,830
I shouldn't be surprised.

55
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,540
She easily scores in the top
ten of our grade all the time.

56
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,370
But, what does she have up her sleeve?

57
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,200
This is Takagi we're talking about.

58
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,350
She's definitely gonna try to mess with me.

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,330
I mean, how could she not?

60
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,750
It's practically in her blood!

61
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,830
Hmm? What's up?

62
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,250
Huh? Oh, nothing, just thinking.

63
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,200
It's not like I was looking at you.

64
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,940
I just kinda spaced out--

65
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,590
By the way, you got that one wrong.

66
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,450
Problem six, where it says, "Solve for x
over negative two plus three y." That one.

67
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,750
You mean it's not 15?

68
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,870
Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,080
What? Really?

70
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,040
Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,410
Substitute the numbers.

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,580
Was that wrong?

73
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,790
No. So then...

74
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,330
Here we go.

75
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,080
Uh... What are you...?

76
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,260
It's easier to teach you this way.

77
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,120
So, x equals negative 16...

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,290
"Easier to."

79
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,370
She's teaching me?

80
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,500
What is she planning?

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,450
Write it out. Go ahead.

82
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,450
There's a negative times a negative
and don't forget order of operations.

83
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,000
It's "PEMDAS" remember?

84
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,120
Oh yeah!

85
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,250
Then let's see.

86
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,580
It's five!

87
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,200
Yep. That's right!

88
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh! And for these next ones, you should be able...

89
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,370
She's amazing.

90
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,000
She can figure it out with just a glance.

91
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,790
Hey. I appreciate this.

92
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,410
I was really struggling with this page before.

93
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,290
Why don't I teach you from the beginning?

94
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,950
She's gonna teach me the whole thing?

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,330
I'm saved!

96
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,620
No, something's fishy here!

97
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,870
Why is she being so nice?

98
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,730
She's never this nice unless she's teasing me!

99
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,870
Hey, Takagi.

100
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,790
Why are you being so nice to me today?

101
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,540
Hmm?

102
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,120
What do you mean?

103
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,750
Well, you're just being kinder than usual.

104
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,950
So...

105
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,370
Oh... Right.

106
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,700
I am always teasing you in the middle of class.

107
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,080
I would feel really bad if your
grades went down because of me.

108
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,620
Nishikata.

109
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,160
I'm sorry for teasing you every single day.

110
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,830
Let me help you get a better grade.

111
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,500
Takagi.

112
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't believe it.

113
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,200
You've finally seen the error in your ways!

114
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,120
All right, let's go for it!

115
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,540
Thanks for the juice.

116
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,120
No, thank you.

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,010
I made huge progress on my math
today, because I had your help.

118
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,020
Now I'm less likely to have my games taken away.

119
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,300
Maybe Takagi is actually a good person, after all.

120
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,160
Really.

121
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,700
Thank you so much for today.

122
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,700
Oh, no.

123
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,040
You shouldn't thank me.

124
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,080
Since what I taught you, won't be on the test.

125
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,790
Wha... Hey! Hold on!

126
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,870
You're good at substitution now, right?

127
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,370
Yeah, and a lot of good that'll do!

128
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,160
Gimme back that juice right now!

129
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,370
Oops, I already opened it.

130
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,080
You literally just opened it!

131
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,790
Pass your answer sheets forward.

132
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,040
I think I did pretty well.

133
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,540
I should've gotten a 90 at least.

134
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,160
Hey, Yukari?

135
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,120
Can you teach me this?

136
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,450
I just can't seem to do well in English.

137
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,800
Huh? You make it sound like
you're good at everything else.

138
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
No, I'm just extra bad at English!

139
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,620
Anyway!

140
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,580
Help me out here!

141
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,040
In this part--

142
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,790
Sorry, no can do.

143
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,830
I want to review before the next test, too.

144
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,910
Huh?! But you always help me study between tests!

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,410
This time is different.

146
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,990
If I can get a 90 or above on everything,
my parents are buying me any game I want.

147
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,290
Cool. So this part's been really tripping me up.

148
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,870
Were you listening?

149
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,750
I don't have the time to teach
you guys this stuff last minute.

150
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,250
Meanie!

151
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,500
Buzz off. Shoo.

152
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,540
What's more important?

153
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,540
Our friendship or some stupid game?

154
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,700
Yeah, what she said.

155
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,290
Sure you can play video games,

156
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,500
but you can't teach them like you can your best friends!

157
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,080
Yeah, what she said.

158
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,310
Now that those two academic train wrecks
will leave me alone, I should review.

159
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,790
All right, I'm handing out the next test.

160
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,580
Take one and pass it back.

161
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,370
Okay, I've thoroughly reviewed the
material right before the test.

162
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,770
Now that I've got English fresh in the
brain, this'll be a--

163
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,040
Math?

164
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,580
Here.

165
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,140
Did you study at all this time?

166
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,290
Next.

167
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,830
Saitou.

168
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,950
You're looking nervous over there.

169
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,870
No, I'm not.

170
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,200
Takagi.

171
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,950
Yes!

172
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,600
You did very well, as usual.

173
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,290
She's so smart.

174
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,120
Sounds like you did fine Takagi.

175
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,700
Can we compare answers later?

176
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,830
Sure.

177
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,540
So.

178
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,950
You get a good grade?

179
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,790
Yeah, but not a hundred percent.

180
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,450
That sounds about right.

181
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,520
But I got this one in the bag, too.

182
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,950
Next up, Nishikata!

183
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,450
Right!

184
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,450
You can do a little better next time.

185
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,700
Was it that bad?

186
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,330
As if you care at all!

187
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,540
You're the one who taught me
stuff that wasn't on the test!

188
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,580
All up on your high horse because you got a good score!

189
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,450
Whatever!

190
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,680
Hey. Hey!

191
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,540
Guess my score.

192
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,250
And I'll guess yours.

193
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,290
Whoever gets closer will win.

194
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,080
You're always proposing this stuff out of nowhere.

195
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,790
But okay.

196
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,870
Uh... Is it around 50?

197
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,620
Hmph!

198
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,800
You underestimate me too much, Takagi.

199
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,260
You think so?

200
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,260
Okay, then did you get above 60 percent?

201
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,120
I'll take that as a no.

202
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,700
How did she know?

203
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,250
Give her your poker face.

204
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,330
Confuse her with your world
class, unwavering poker face!

205
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,830
Did you get above 55?

206
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,620
That's a yes.

207
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,160
Why?

208
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,580
That leaves everything between 55 and 59.

209
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,630
I have to keep her from guessing the exact score!

210
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,410
Okay, then.

211
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,080
Fifty-six?

212
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,620
Or...

213
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,120
Fifty-seven?

214
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,810
Fifty-eight?

215
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,120
Fifty-nine?

216
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,750
Yup.

217
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,830
I got it.

218
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,750
You got a 56.

219
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,500
Uhh. Is that the answer you're going with?

220
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,160
Mm-hmm.

221
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,200
Ready to know the truth?

222
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,700
I got a 59!

223
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,910
Sucks to be you!

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,040
I guess you were sorta close, though.

225
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,870
Hey, quiet down.

226
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,000
The only thing that sucks is your grade.

227
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,660
You're right; I'm sorry.

228
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,290
Fifty-nine, huh?

229
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,200
Looks like I was off by three.

230
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,290
All right.

231
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,540
Now it's your turn to try and guess my score okay?

232
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,160
If it's within two percent.

233
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,830
Then you're the winner.

234
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,080
Bring it on!

235
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm gonna figure it out based on her reactions.

236
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,160
The teacher praised her a second ago,

237
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,870
so I bet that means she got above a 90.

238
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,450
Is it... like, a 92?

239
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,830
Uh...

240
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,830
Huh?

241
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,660
What kinda reaction was that?

242
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,410
How about a 95?

243
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,080
Ninety?

244
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,540
Or was it 92?

245
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,250
Uh...

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,580
She is so faking it!

247
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,020
I'm not gonna fall for that!

248
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,580
She'd never make her reaction so obvious!

249
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,950
She's mocking me.

250
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,020
I'm gonna do everything within my power to win this!

251
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,520
Maybe if I focus more on her expression.

252
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,930
What? What's wrong?

253
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,000
Hmm? Oh, nothing.

254
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,010
I was just thinking about something.

255
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,730
We've been staring at each other for a long time.

256
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,540
Why are you turning away?

257
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,580
Aww come on, that was a cheap shot!

258
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,830
I can't look at you after you say that!

259
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,200
Think. Just think.

260
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,290
Anything that could clue you in.

261
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,580
That reaction she gave me
before was so fake it's painful,

262
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,870
which means she probably wants me to think she got a 92.

263
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,660
That also means it won't be between 90 and 94

264
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,360
because they're all within a two point difference of 92!

265
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,380
And like I thought before, the teacher
praised her so it must be above 90 percent.

266
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,040
And she said it wasn't 100,

267
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,700
so that means it's gotta be between 95 and 99!

268
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,910
Perfect.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,750
Flawless victory!

270
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,140
Takagi.

271
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,750
I know what grade you got on the test.

272
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,160
You scored a 97 percent!

273
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,840
Wrong. I got a 92.

274
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,110
Wha?! Come on!

275
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,920
You really don't trust me enough.

276
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,380
I guess I gave you that three-point
handicap for nothing, huh?

277
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,370
Coast is clear.

278
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,700
Find everything okay?

279
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,830
Four hundred and twenty yen is your total.

280
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,200
You're quick with that exact change.

281
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,080
Want a cov--?

282
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,750
No, thank you.

283
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,450
A bag--?

284
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,410
No, thank you.

285
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,000
A rece--? -- No, thank you.

286
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,830
Operation successful.

287
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,490
Now to begin phase two: Get home and read it!

288
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,450
Oh hey.

289
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,640
Good morning.

290
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,200
Takagi?

291
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,620
What is she doing here?

292
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,750
I'm taking a walk.

293
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,160
Did she just read my mind?

294
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,090
What are you doing here all by yourself?

295
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,450
This is bad!

296
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,330
I can't let her see what I just bought.

297
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,410
I'll have to deny it all the way to my grave.

298
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,770
Oh, nothing.

299
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,620
It's just that I wanted to buy a
book, but they were sold out--

300
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,080
Wait, wait!

301
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,620
What if she saw me at the register?

302
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,520
Reel it in!

303
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:14,040
So I decided to buy <i>Fierce!!
Ultimate Soccer!!</i> volume eleven instead!

304
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,330
The perfect answer!

305
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,750
Boys love that series, but I've never
met a girl who'd give it the time of day.

306
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,580
You won't care to ask more about it.

307
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm on a roll today.

308
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,230
<i>Fierce-Soccer</i> ? Cool, let me see!

309
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,370
Huh?!

310
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,210
Uh, but I haven't read it yet.

311
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,250
Can I at least see the front cover?

312
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,320
No!

313
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,410
'Cuz I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, either.

314
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
And it's my manga.

315
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,830
Then, let's look at it together.

316
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,120
I happen to like looking at it alone.

317
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
Awww...

318
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,830
I wouldn't have thought she'd be this interested.

319
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,500
At this rate, she's gonna blow my cover.

320
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,510
Better get away from her and quick.

321
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,470
I'll see you around, Takagi.

322
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,980
Huh?

323
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,020
Hello?

324
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,370
Hey, we ran into each other.

325
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,840
Let's walk together.

326
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,290
Okay, fine.

327
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,920
It's pretty unusual to run into someone at the

328
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,500
bookstore so far from home this early in the morning.

329
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,370
I can't let Takagi see this manga and yet here it
is, three feet from her in my backpack!

330
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,410
I feel like my heart's in my throat.

331
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,580
I wish I were home already.

332
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,790
Hey.

333
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,060
Nishikata.

334
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,740
Are you lying to me about anything?

335
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,540
Are you lying?

336
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,490
Uh, um...

337
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,200
You didn't buy <i>Fierce-Soccer,</i> did you?

338
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,830
I bet you bought something that you're so
embarrassed to have, you had to lie about it.

339
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,620
Shut up.

340
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,160
That's not...

341
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,450
It's just some manga for girls, right?

342
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,920
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i> ?

343
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,590
Okay. There's no point in denying it now, but...

344
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,380
...how in the world did you figure it out?

345
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,450
Just luck.

346
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,950
I happened to be passing by when I
saw you at the register checking out.

347
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,790
And I could see what you got.

348
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,370
She knew the whole time and was playing me.

349
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,830
Is it because you like the anime?

350
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,950
I didn't know you read that kind of stuff.

351
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,620
Uh, wait up!

352
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,950
Please keep it a secret,
I really don't want anyone to know.

353
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,420
Catching it on TV is one thing, but if people found

354
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,630
out I'm actually buying and reading the manga,

355
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,790
I'll be a laughingstock.

356
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,580
Hmm...

357
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,080
What should I do?

358
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,040
I mean, you did lie to me.

359
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,660
And that's extra bad,
considering I've never lied to you before.

360
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,370
But I won't tell.

361
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,330
Huh? You're messing with me.

362
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,250
What do you mean?

363
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,040
I'm serious.

364
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,620
Please don't tell anyone!

365
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,790
Yes, sir!

366
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,450
Why are you so enthusiastic?

367
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,620
It feels fake!

368
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,470
You're so persistent.

369
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,410
Uh... Then how about this?

370
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,700
I know your secret,

371
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,540
so it's only fair that I tell you mine, too.

372
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,700
That'll make you feel better, right?

373
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,660
Since you'll have collateral.

374
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,750
Huh?

375
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,700
I guess.

376
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,580
All right.

377
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,870
Come closer.

378
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,040
Okay.

379
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,500
Truth is I've always kind of liked you.

380
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,330
Huh?

381
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,160
Huh?! What did she--?

382
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,040
What?

383
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,040
You're bright red!

384
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,620
You blush so quickly.

385
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,330
It's classic.

386
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,660
Since you lied to me at the bookstore.

387
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,390
I figured I'd lie to you as payback.

388
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,580
Oh, a lie.

389
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,450
You shocked me for a second.

390
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,870
That was a lie.

391
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,980
Of course it was. Duh, right?

392
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,620
See yah!

393
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,450
I'm turning this way now.

394
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,830
"Duh," right.

395
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,680
I'll see you later, bye.

396
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,900
A lie, huh?

397
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,520
Oh, and Nishikata?

398
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,020
I want to read <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> too,

399
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,780
so let me know when you're done and I'll borrow it!

400
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,050
Ahh! Don't say it so loud, Takagi!

401
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,260
This downpour came out of nowhere.

402
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,440
I wonder if it'll stop soon.

403
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,330
Hmm...

404
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,920
Well, I hope so.

405
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,790
Aww. Even my socks got wet.

406
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,290
How about you? Are you dry?

407
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,760
Oh man, I can kinda see through her shirt.

408
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
You hear me?

409
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,830
Uh. Yeah, I heard you.

410
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,370
Yeah.

411
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,120
Calm down, just calm down!

412
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
If she realizes I'm panicking,
I'll be branded a pervert!

413
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,710
Boy, I sure hope this rain will stop soon.

414
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,250
I wanna be home before five,
so I can catch an anime that's on then.

415
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,120
It's <i>Fierce-Soccer</i> , by the way.

416
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,350
Oh yeah?

417
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,580
That's the one you bought at the bookstore, right?

418
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,040
Or no, I'm mistaken. That's <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

419
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,870
You promised me you were never
going to bring that up again!

420
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,200
What, I can't talk about it?

421
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,910
You know your own secret.

422
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,290
I hope this clears up fast.

423
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,000
Uhh. Yeah.

424
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,040
Aw man.

425
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
This got a little wet, too.

426
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,250
Hey, do you have your P.E. shirt on you?

427
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,000
Uh. Yeah, why?

428
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,700
Do you mind if I borrow it?

429
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,910
I'll give it back.

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,290
I want to change out of this.

431
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,790
Huh? Wait, what?

432
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,620
You want to change into my P.E. shirt?

433
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,660
Like, right here?

434
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,660
Yup. My shirt's wet; I feel all gross.

435
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,660
But aren't you--?

436
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,120
And besides, I know you're having
trouble deciding where to look.

437
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,620
Busted.

438
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,790
Can you turn the other way?

439
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,080
Y-Yeah.

440
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,750
You managed to stay pretty dry, huh?

441
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,580
How? Oh.

442
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,700
Did you use your bag as an umbrella?

443
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,370
Mm-hmm.

444
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,620
Good thinking.

445
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,250
I had to hold my bike, so I couldn't do that.

446
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,250
Yeah, that makes sense.

447
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,540
You know, you can look if you want.

448
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,620
Huh? I can look?

449
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,450
What are you trying to say?

450
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,200
Because I'm done changing.

451
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,790
Why are you so flustered?

452
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,500
She's screwing with me.

453
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,500
Hey.

454
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,920
Wanna make a bet?

455
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,410
We can bet on whether or not the rain will
stop by the time the town clock strikes five.

456
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,830
The loser has to do anything the winner wants.

457
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,580
Why not?

458
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,200
Okay, what's your bet?

459
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,950
That it won't stop in time.

460
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,660
Cool.

461
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,170
Then I bet it will.

462
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,950
If the rain stops,
I can go home and watch <i>Fierce-Soccer.</i>

463
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,250
If it doesn't, I get to order Takagi around.

464
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,160
It's win-win!

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,290
There we go.

466
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,200
I feel much better now that I've changed my shirt.

467
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,910
Thanks a bunch, Nishikata.

468
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,790
Yeah, don't mention it.

469
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,750
It does smell kinda sweaty, though.

470
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,660
Of course it does, it's been super-hot out!

471
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,370
Whoa.

472
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,700
That shirt touched my skin and now it's touching hers.

473
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,830
Agh! Stop it! What am I thinking?

474
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,400
--A cat. -- Oh. Hey.

475
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,200
Are you trying to get out of the rain?

476
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,750
Come here.

477
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,620
He's cute, but be careful.

478
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,080
He scratches.

479
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,250
Do you want me to give you your shirt back?

480
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,830
No. I'm fine.

481
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,910
Why don't you wear my P.E. shirt?

482
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,530
Huh?

483
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,840
It did get a little wet,
but it's better than what you've got on.

484
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,080
And now,

485
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,060
The shirt that touched Takagi's
skin will be touching mine.

486
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,450
Are you done yet?

487
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,580
Come on, you're not supposed to look!

488
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,970
For some reason this feels naughty.

489
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,980
It smells good.

490
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,840
I guess I win.

491
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,100
What should I make you do?

492
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,540
Oh, well.

493
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,370
At least, <i>Fierce-Soccer</i> 'll be on when I get home.

494
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,620
I'll do what she wants and hurry back.

495
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,750
Oh, I know!

496
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,000
Huh?

497
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,000
Now that it's stopped raining,

498
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,790
let's go somewhere before we head home.

499
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,330
Wait, I wanted to--

500
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,790
The bet was, the loser does what the winner wants!

501
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,700
Let's go.

502
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,330
Why?!

503
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,010
<b>"Studying for the Test"</b>

504
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,950

505
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,960
