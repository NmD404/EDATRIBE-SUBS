1
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,720
Sanae!

2
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,010
Here! For you.

3
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,120
Uh... A love letter?

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,500
Of course not! It's just a regular letter!

5
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,330
Everyone's writing them to their friends these days!

6
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,750
Haven't you noticed?

7
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,790
No.

8
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,750
Don't you worry, Yukari,
I'm gonna write one for you too.

9
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,290
That's nice of you, just don't do it in class.

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,790
You need to focus on the lesson.

11
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,470
Friendship is way more important than any lesson.

12
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,910
What, are the girls all suddenly
into writing letters now?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,450
That's what it looks like.

14
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,950
I wonder if some of them are writing love letters, too.

15
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,700
Maybe. They do seem really into it.

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,910
I'll say.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,430
Love letters, huh?

18
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,160
I don't get the appeal.

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,910
They could just say what they want out loud.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,790
Why bother to write it all down?

21
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,620
Must have a lotta time on their hands.

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,160
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,700
Sanae, you're going a little overboard.

24
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,500
One kick was enough.

25
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,500
So kicking him at all's okay?

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,700
All right, let's start class.

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,330
Open up your textbooks to page seventy-six.

28
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,950
Takagi's writing letters, too?

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,700
Sometimes I forget that she's just your ordinary girl.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,660
What?

31
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,950
Is there something wrong, Nishikata?

32
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,330
No, nothing, everything's great!

33
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,580
A letter? Who's it from?

34
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,080
And why me?

35
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,910
I wonder if some of them are writing love letters, too.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,290
No, no, no, that's obviously not it!

37
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,160
Someone's playing a prank on me.

38
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,250
Oh, yeah!

39
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,910
This could be Takagi's doing.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,620
No, it's gotta be her!

41
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,620
Takagi--

42
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Wait a second.

43
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,080
Reign it in, Nishikata!

44
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,500
What if it's somebody else? What if it isn't Takagi?

45
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,860
If she finds out I got a letter,
she'll just use that to tease me again!

46
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,160
Yeah? What is it?

47
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,580
Uh...

48
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,870
Oh, uh...

49
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,580
I was just thinking.

50
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,040
It's nice out.

51
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,450
Are you hiding something?

52
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,760
Why would I be hiding something?

53
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,660
Hmm...

54
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,160
Dunno. But you're suspicious.

55
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
And blushing, too.

56
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,370
You're just imagining things.

57
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,040
Well, maybe.

58
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,290
But why is your textbook closed?

59
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,160
Well. You see, I uh...

60
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,750
I bet it's why your face is red.

61
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,160
No, it's not! And my face is not red!

62
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,830
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

63
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,370
Yes, that's why I said so!

64
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,080
I guess I was imagining things.

65
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,980
By the way, that letter in your textbook.

66
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,830
I put that there.

67
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,950
I knew it!

68
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,790
Yeah. I knew that.

69
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,160
I mean, duh. It was obvious.

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,580
You liar.

71
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,370
What are you talking about? I'm not lying.

72
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,000
I was just having fun making you squirm.

73
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,370
So. You gonna read what's inside?

74
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,200
You wrote something?

75
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,540
Well, it is a letter.

76
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,950
You're just messing with me like always, aren't you?

77
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,610
Why aren't you saying something?

78
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,620
Okay.

79
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,910
I'll read it at home later.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,490
Read it now.

81
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,620
What? Why now?

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Because. School's over after this period.

83
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,160
And I wanted an answer by then.

84
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,660
An answer?

85
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,160
If it's a letter that needs an answer,
then it's a letter asking a question.

86
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,900
Does that mean it's not just meant to mess with me?

87
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,710
I wonder if some of them are writing love letters, too.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,500
What if Takao's right?

89
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,950
What if it's a love letter?

90
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,620
Is that even possible?

91
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,150
By any chance, would this happen
to be a love letter, or...?

92
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,930
What's with the silence?!

93
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,750
Why don't you just read it?

94
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,130
Uh, I will, just gimme a minute.

95
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,280
I gotta open it up first.

96
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,160
Based on that reaction,

97
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,330
I'd wager anything that this
is designed just to tease me.

98
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,290
Whatever it ends up saying, I have to be firm

99
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,330
and confident so that she doesn't get the chance.

100
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,160
Be bold! Be brave!

101
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,360
But what if...

102
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,000
No, it can't be.

103
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,660
Why would it be?

104
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,530
There's no way!

105
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,330
But if it is a love letter, then... I...

106
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,370
You could have just asked me to my face.

107
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,940
But everyone's writing letters now. It's cool.

108
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,540
However, I was also curious how you'd react.

109
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,140
So I was right! You were messing with me!

110
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,000
Shut it, Nishikata!

111
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,830
Thanks a lot.

112
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,660
I appreciate it, young man.

113
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,580
Welcome. I gotta go now.

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,410
Oh, one second!

115
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,580
What's your name, new kid?

116
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Did I forget to say?

117
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,890
I'm Nishikata.

118
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,330
Nishikata. Congrats on getting in!

119
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,080
Mm-hmm.

120
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Thanks.

121
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,000
You'll all be learning alongside each
other over the course of the next year.

122
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,620
I'm not gonna force you to get along with everybody.

123
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,040
But I hope you realize you're only gonna
make the experience worse if you don't.

124
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh, no, did I lose it somewhere?

125
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,330
Well, I don't want to bore you right
off the bat with a long speech, so...

126
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,330
Slept in on the first day?

127
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,120
No, I was, uh...

128
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,370
If nothing else, I admire your audacity.

129
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,950
But... Sir, I--

130
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,120
What's your name?

131
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,970
It's Nishikata.

132
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,620
All right, then. Sit down.

133
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,130
Uh... Yes, sir.

134
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,790
Oh, great, Everyone's staring.

135
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,910
I have to make friends with people and clear things up

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,750
before I become known as "that
guy who was late on day one."

137
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,120
Mr. Tanabe, a moment of your time?

138
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,250
They called and said they're running a little bit late.

139
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,410
Really?

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,950
Are we pushing the entrance ceremony back?

141
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,700
Yes, I'll keep you posted.

142
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,000
I just got word that the entrance
ceremony is running behind schedule.

143
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,540
Sounds like it's gonna take a
while before they're all set up.

144
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,120
So in the meantime...

145
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,620
...we're figuring out seating.

146
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,770
At least I'm not in the front. Sucks to be you.

147
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,930
Oh, come on.

148
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,370
I'm literally as far in the corner as I possibly can be.

149
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,410
Normally I'd be happy about being
this far away from the teacher.

150
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,250
It's the best spot to goof off.

151
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,050
But I don't know anyone as it is!

152
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,770
There's no one behind me or to my left.

153
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,200
Worse, I'm sitting next to a girl.

154
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,290
Did you actually sleep in?

155
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,870
She's talking to me.

156
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,790
It looked like you were about
to say something to the teacher.

157
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,830
Uh... Yeah.

158
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,000
No. I didn't actually sleep in.

159
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,290
If only I'd made it here earlier.

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,290
I was at the school on time, but...

161
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,910
It's Takagi's fault.

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,330
Whoever that is.

163
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,330
Huh?

164
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,850
All right everyone, head to the gym.

165
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,080
Let's keep quiet.

166
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,040
And no running

167
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,750
Okay.

168
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,580
Hey!

169
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,370
You want to walk there together?

170
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,500
Sure.

171
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,330
Wait a second.

172
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,290
You will soon be given a great gift, the right to vote.

173
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,870
With it, you will choose students
for positions of responsibility.

174
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,450
It's important you select politicians who
are worthy of your trust and confidence.

175
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,660
Similarly, your mothers and fathers
choose their representatives by voting...

176
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,200
Wasn't that speech crazy long?

177
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,330
That dude was talking so long I almost fell asleep!

178
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,370
I know, it was like when we started elementary school.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,580
You're pretty cool for coming' in late on the first day.

180
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,950
I didn't mean to.

181
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,330
Everybody quit yapping' and take your seats.

182
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,870
I'm sorry for getting back late, sir.

183
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,040
Just go sit down.

184
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,090
That's it for today, but remember,
real classes start tomorrow.

185
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,790
Don't mess around because I'm letting you out early.

186
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,080
Go straight home.

187
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,620
Hey, Nishikata.

188
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,920
How 'bout I try to guess why you were late today?

189
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,670
I bet I can.

190
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,120
If I get it right on my first try, I win.

191
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,540
Sure, I guess.

192
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,450
Wait, how is she gonna figure it out on her first try?

193
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,040
You were delivering a lost item.

194
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,330
What? How'd you know?

195
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,370
Hey. Quiet down, Nishikata.

196
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,620
I'm sorry, sir.

197
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,820
How did you know?

198
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,450
How indeed.

199
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Uh... Wait.

200
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,160
You're Takagi?

201
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,120
You weren't here yet when
everyone introduced themselves.

202
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,540
What's with that reaction?

203
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,890
Hey! I just said to be quiet!

204
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,860
Sorry!

205
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,910
Thanks a lot. For picking it up.

206
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,410
It's nice to meet you.

207
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,330
It's nice to meet you, too.

208
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,480
Seventy-two! Seventy-three!

209
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,580
Seventy-four! Seventy-five!

210
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,250
All this work's finally starting' to pay off!

211
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,250
Oh, man.

212
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,370
She's not here yet.

213
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,790
Morning, Nishikata.

214
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,830
Oh, good morning yourself, Takagi!

215
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,230
So, hey. Have you heard?

216
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,290
They're going to be changing where everyone sits today.

217
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,700
Really? When?

218
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,200
During homeroom.

219
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,370
Homeroom? That's first period!

220
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,120
--Taka-- --Are you okay?

221
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,200
First period, huh?

222
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,410
That'll be kinda fun.

223
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,450
Yeah?

224
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,580
Well, I mean, we haven't had a
seating change in a while, so...

225
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,410
Yeah, sure.

226
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,640
I guess there are always positives.

227
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,870
But if I'm being honest.

228
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,250
I wanted to be next to you for a while longer.

229
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,820
She's just messing with me again.

230
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,540
I almost fell for it.

231
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,630
Does anyone still need a number? No?

232
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,830
Then move your desks according
to the layout on the board.

233
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,370
What number did you draw?

234
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,660
Twenty-nine.

235
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,450
Oh. The far back again, then.

236
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,000
What about you?

237
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,020
This time I'm front and center.

238
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,450
Oh.

239
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,600
We're going to be pretty far.

240
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,290
Yeah.

241
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,290
Later.

242
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,500
All right! Now you can sneak
me answers on all our tests!

243
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,910
What? That's cheating.

244
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm not doing that.

245
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,330
It's called mutual aid.

246
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,370
Oh, yeah?

247
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,700
Well what do I get out of it?

248
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,290
Words of encouragement from your friend!

249
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,870
Yay...

250
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,200
Yo, Nishikata.

251
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,830
Are you sitting' here?

252
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,080
Nah, over there.

253
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,290
Oh, yeah?

254
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,580
That's too bad. I was hoping we'd be closer.

255
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,790
Yeah, me too.

256
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,950
My vision's been getting really bad lately.

257
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,700
I hope I can see what's on the board.

258
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,120
Oh. So that's it.

259
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,290
I'm next to Nishikata, huh?

260
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,870
You okay, Mano?

261
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,410
Yeah. I'm just great.

262
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,100
What's up? Are you not happy?

263
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,810
It's nothing. Feel free to just ignore me.

264
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,330
I'm just depressed because I'm not sitting near Nakai.

265
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,040
I was really hoping we'd be next to each other.

266
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,040
How far away is he?

267
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,830
Hey.

268
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,790
Someone!

269
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,580
Anyone! Please switch seats with me!

270
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,160
How am I supposed to sneak an early lunch
if I'm right in front of the teacher?

271
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,160
You aren't switching seats unless
you have a legitimate reason.

272
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,580
Also, Kimura.

273
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,700
Please, do see me after class.

274
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,700
Right in front of the teacher?

275
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,290
But if I'm being honest.

276
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,620
I wanted to be next to you for a while longer.

277
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,540
Hey, Kimura, listen!

278
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,540
I can't see the board from here; let's switch!

279
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,750
Oh. Thanks!

280
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,540
But I already found someone.

281
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,950
It's not like I care.

282
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,790
Nishikata. Hey.

283
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,410
What the--?

284
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Guess what? I'm sitting here now.

285
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,580
Wha--? But how?

286
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,370
Well, first Nakai and Kimura switched.

287
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,680
Because Nakai couldn't see the board well enough.

288
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,040
So Nakai was all the way up front.

289
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,330
When she saw that, Mano wanted to switch with
me, since I was right next to him.

290
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,870
Mano's short, so she prefers the front anyway.

291
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,790
Oh. I see.

292
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,660
Nishikata.

293
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,160
You tried to sit next to me up there, didn't you?

294
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,200
No, I...

295
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,360
I couldn't see the board well from here.

296
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,140
Hmm?

297
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,040
Oh, yeah?

298
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,540
Mmm?

299
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,950
What? It's true!

300
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,750
All right, we're starting class.

301
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,040
Get your textbooks out.

302
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,620
Oh. That reminds me.

303
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,410
What was it that you wanted to say earlier today?

304
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,200
What, did I read you wrong?

305
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,160
I thought you were looking for an opportunity.

306
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,000
Sorry.

307
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,130
It took me a while to return this.

308
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,650
Thank you.

309
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,330
From over summer break?

310
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,910
Uh... Yeah.

311
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,660
From then, and...

312
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,890
The first day of school?

313
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,480
You remembered that?

314
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,790
Of course I did. You did too.

315
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,910
Heh! Thank you.

316
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,540
I made sure to wash it for you.

317
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,520
Oh, nothing.

318
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,870
I'm just kinda glad.

319
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,000
--Why? --Oh. Y'know...

320
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,020
For a lot.

321
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,540
That I got to return your handkerchief.

322
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,450
And that we ended up next to each other again, oh!

323
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,620
And also...

324
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, yeah.

325
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,790
I'm looking forward to this.

326
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,290
So here, we'd say, "I do not agree."

327
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,460
Or you could contract it to, "I don't agree."

328
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,160
That part's pretty easy.

329
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,750
But on the next page,
things get a little more complicated.
