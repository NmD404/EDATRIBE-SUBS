1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,370
Here, we say,

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,900
"I am Hanako."

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,350
As opposed to here, where we say, "He is a teacher."

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,100
Hey, Nishikata.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,780
Huh?

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,690
What are you doing?

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,010
Stop accusing me, Takagi.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,650
I'm learning.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,060
I swear.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,800
Right.

11
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,770
This'll work well as a spring.

12
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,050
Now I have all the pieces I need
to make my desktop jack-in-the-box!

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,750
Just you wait, Takagi.

14
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,980
Huh?

15
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,100
Hey. What's going' on?

16
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,410
I'm not sure.

17
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,770
My pencil case just won't open.

18
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,240
Maybe it got dented when I dropped it earlier.

19
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,400
Do you think you could try opening it, Nishikata?

20
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,230
Uh.

21
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,980
Yeah, sure.

22
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,440
You must have loosened it or something--

23
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,560
What is it, Nishikata?

24
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,770
Huh? Oh, it was nothing.

25
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,980
I'm sorry for shouting.

26
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:30,060
Seriously, Nishikata, you should see your face.

27
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,850
Ugh.

28
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,400
Just shut up.

29
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,060
You suck.

30
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,100
She totally got me.

31
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,100
And worse, she got me with what
I was about to get her with!

32
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,020
Now that I think about it,

33
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,270
it's unusual for Takagi to ask me for help.

34
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,100
Why didn't that raise any red flags in my mind?

35
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,020
I have to plan my next move.

36
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,480
But how am I supposed to embarrass her of all people?

37
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,350
Hey.

38
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,900
Uh.

39
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,440
What's up?

40
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,400
Can I borrow your eraser?

41
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,310
I forgot mine.

42
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,100
How did you forgot your eraser?

43
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,270
Takagi, you're such an airhead sometimes

44
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,230
Guess so.

45
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,060
Thank you very much.

46
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,870
That reminds me.

47
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,310
Hmm?

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,480
Know what I heard?

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,270
If you take your eraser,

50
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,140
write the name of your crush on it, and use it all up,

51
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,150
they'll like you back.

52
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,850
Yeah, I've heard that before too.

53
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,560
Only a little kid would actually believe it, though.

54
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,050
Hmm?

55
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,480
A kid, huh?

56
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,190
Huuh...?

57
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,100
Hmm?

58
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,520
Ahh.

59
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,690
Huh?!

60
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,190
What do you see?

61
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,060
Huuuh?

62
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,400
Huh? Ohh...

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
Wha...

64
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,930
What are you doing?

65
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,560
Nothing's written on there, right?

66
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,370
C'mon.

67
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm not some dumb little kid who'd believe that works.

68
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,980
Oho? You sure about that?

69
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,270
There's no way.

70
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,900
You're just making fun of me again, aren't you?

71
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,150
Yeah?

72
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,510
You think so?

73
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,440
Did I actually?

74
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,900
Did I actually write something on there?

75
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,730
And then just forget that I did?

76
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,230
You're done with it, so can you give it back now?

77
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,560
Sure.

78
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,150
It wasn't me, I swear!

79
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,980
Someone else must have gotten a hold of it and then...

80
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,770
I knew there was nothing written on that thing!

81
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,260
Hey!

82
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,520
You didn't forget your eraser, it's right there!

83
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,020
No yelling in class.

84
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,370
I'm sorry, sir.

85
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,600
Not only did you freak out, but you got in trouble!

86
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,630
I think that's enough messing around for one class.

87
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,350
I should be the one saying that!

88
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,850
Mr. Tanabe?

89
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,770
May I go to the bathroom?

90
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,930
Fine.

91
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,810
There's gotta be something.

92
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,190
Something I can do to embarrass her.

93
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,650
Anything!

94
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,940
Huh?

95
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,810
That's it!

96
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,020
I'll write someone's name on Takagi's eraser and make
fun of her for it when she comes back from the bathroom!

97
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,810
Genius!

98
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,270
Just one question:

99
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,020
Whose name should I write?

100
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,190
Huh?

101
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,350
There's a name on it already?

102
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,270
Should I not look, then?

103
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,490
Maybe just a tiny peak.

104
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,190
"Lo"? "Lo"?

105
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,230
Then that means...

106
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,600
...it's not my name.

107
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,350
Not that I'm, like, upset or anything.

108
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,560
Come on!

109
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,400
I'm gonna look at it!

110
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,730
I have to know!

111
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,440
I can't believe it!

112
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,690
She got me again!

113
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,850
Nishikata, that face was priceless.

114
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,770
And man, you acted exactly how I thought.

115
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,540
I just have to tease you.

116
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,650
I can't help it.

117
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,940
Oh yeah?

118
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,480
Well just you wait, Takagi!

119
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,060
Mark my words, one of these days I'm gonna
get back at you and embarrass you so bad!

120
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,920
Like that'll ever happen.

121
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,020
You don't think I can do it, huh?

122
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,010
Well, yeah.

123
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,560
I'm serious!

124
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,560
You better be on your guard.

125
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,600
I think it's impossible.

126
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,020
But keep dreaming.

127
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,770
You can't even win fifty-percent odds.

128
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,350
"Fifty-percent odds"?

129
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,270
Whaddya mean?

130
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,190
Not telling.

131
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,020
Man, day duty is such a pain in the butt.

132
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,910
Why do I have to go to school early to
clean the blackboard and write a lesson log?

133
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,900
I take it back, day duty's awesome!

134
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,290
I guess what they say is true.

135
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,230
The early bird gets the worm!

136
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,480
I thought this was money, not some stupid arcade token.

137
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,730
I just got a great idea!

138
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,210
I should use this opportunity to rig
Takagi's desk with some kinda prank.

139
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,850
Just thinking about it woke me up a little.

140
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,190
Ta...

141
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,960
My plan is ruined, she's already here.

142
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,750
Wait, why?

143
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,670
I don't see anyone here.

144
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,490
That's weird.

145
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,230
Did I just imagine it or something?

146
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,980
No, she's definitely here!

147
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,060
My Takagi-sense is tingling!

148
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,480
But where is she hiding?

149
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,850
And that was a close one.

150
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,920
I was about to let my guard down and start humming.

151
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,060
But not today!

152
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,230
Where are you?

153
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,850
Show yourself.

154
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,100
You're making this too easy, Takagi.

155
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,760
I can see the name on your shoes under the desk.

156
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,150
You're probably planning to surprise me
when I go up to clean the blackboard.

157
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,330
But I won't give you the chance.

158
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,980
Ahh...

159
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,810
Day duty is such a pain,
I don't feel like doing anything!

160
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,010
Not like anyone will notice if
I don't clean the board anyway.

161
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,560
Ooo, stings, doesn't it?

162
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,410
You must be mortified that this
silly plan of yours didn't work.

163
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,150
I can hardly contain myself!

164
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,730
I wanna see the look on her face so bad.

165
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,310
But wait...

166
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,980
Would Takagi really make such an amateur mistake?

167
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,250
This is hide-and-seek 101!

168
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,100
No!

169
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,270
She wouldn't!

170
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,940
Which means that's a trap!

171
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,100
That was close.

172
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,850
She's devilish, that one.

173
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,900
Gotta stay on my toes.

174
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,690
So if she's not there,

175
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,400
where is she?

176
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,940
She's gotta be nearby.

177
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:28,900
She wouldn't miss the opportunity.

178
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I don't see her in the hallway,

179
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,480
so there's only one place left.

180
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,520
Welp!

181
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,700
I guess I'll go to the bathroom!

182
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,730
Now pretend I'm not here.

183
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,387
I got you!

184
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,190
What?

185
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,270
She's not there!

186
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,400
Huh?

187
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,690
Well that was a waste of time.

188
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,230
What the heck was I doing?

189
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,810
Hey!

190
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,020
Are you okay?

191
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Come on!

192
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,020
I didn't look behind the curtain?

193
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,900
Totally fooled you, didn't I?

194
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,810
If you're up real close,

195
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,190
you can see through the curtain,

196
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,230
so I saw you the whole time.

197
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,100
Not fair!

198
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,640
She looks so happy!

199
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,940
This sucks!

200
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,480
Ahh, that was fun.

201
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,690
Just thinking about the look
on your face makes me wanna...

202
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,400
This was worth waking up early for.

203
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,810
Just to mess with me?

204
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,310
Yup!

205
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,900
I can't believe she got me again.

206
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,230
Hey, Nishikata.

207
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,650
Huh?

208
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,350
Know what?

209
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,100
It's just the two of us in this quiet classroom.

210
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,350
Doesn't it feel like we're the only ones in the world?

211
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,480
I think it does, and I hope it stays this way.

212
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,600
Then, uhh, Takagi?

213
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:46,270
Does that mean that you, maybe, like, like...

214
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Good morning everyone!

215
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,480
How about this weather am I right?

216
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,810
Jeez.

217
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,270
I'll never understand how you feel
so energetic in the morning, Mina.

218
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,770
Huh? And how else am I supposed to feel, smarty-pants?

219
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,310
Tired?

220
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,770
You too, Sanae?

221
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,600
Saying you're tired makes your happiness go away!

222
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,230
I saw it on TV!

223
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,440
Not everything on TV is true.

224
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,150
You can't actually believe that.

225
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,650
Well, I do!

226
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,440
It's better to be cheerful anywa--

227
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,730
Stop it.

228
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,600
Ow, ow, ow.

229
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,270
That hurts, can you like, not?

230
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,190
Just leave her alone.

231
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,940
You two would feel better if you smiled!

232
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,810
See?

233
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,310
Ignore them. You were saying?

234
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,770
Huh?

235
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,810
It was nothing.

236
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,350
Forget it.

237
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,770
Huuuuh?

238
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,940
Speaking of forgetting things.

239
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,600
Did you clean the board?

240
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,190
Ahh! I forgot!

241
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,520
How am I gonna pull one over on Takagi?

242
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,270
What am I gonna do?

243
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,020
Think!

244
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,230
Hey, Nishikata.

245
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,730
What are you staring at the mirror for?

246
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,900
Oh, hey, Nakai.

247
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,440
You practicing' putting on a cool face or something'?

248
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,350
No, that's lame.

249
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,810
A funny face, then?

250
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,150
Of course. That's it!

251
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,770
So like this?

252
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,150
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you something.

253
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,400
You're pretty close with Takagi, aren't you?

254
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,020
So I was wondering', like, you into her?

255
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,440
Well, he's clearly ignoring me,
which means I must be on the right track.

256
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,350
Yo, dude.

257
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,730
You totally like Takagi, don't you?

258
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,150
That face was so weird, man!

259
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,350
I had no idea I had such talent lying dormant within me.

260
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,350
Okay, everyone settle down, let's get to work.

261
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,480
Open your books to page 36.

262
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,770
This is perfect!

263
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,000
We just so happen to have the scariest teacher,

264
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,520
Mr. Tanabe, right now!

265
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,650
I'll use my funny face to make you laugh so
hard, you'll get in deep trouble, Takagi!

266
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,980
Oh man, I wanna make Takagi laugh now.

267
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,270
No. I have to be patient.

268
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,390
I have to wait until she starts a
conversation to mess with me, like I planned.

269
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,230
The best moment to mess with someone is when

270
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,310
they're about to mess with someone, themselves.

271
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,350
They'll never expect it then!

272
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,400
And that's when I strike!

273
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,600
All right, girl, come at me.

274
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,440
I'm wide open!

275
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,100
Hey, uhh, Nishikata?

276
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,100
Here it is!

277
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,400
Whatever do you need, Takagi?

278
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Take this!

279
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,730
Huh?

280
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,270
Hmmm...

281
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,650
Huh?

282
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,060
Hey.

283
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,900
How many times do I have to tell you to be quiet?

284
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

285
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,980
He's so scary.

286
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,900
This sucks!

287
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,230
I wasn't sure what you were trying
to do at first, but now, I get it.

288
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,190
You're not very creative.

289
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,060
Wha?

290
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,730
If you really wanna be funny.

291
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,190
You should push your eyebrows up, like this.

292
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,290
Oh, and do this with your cheeks, too.

293
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,350
So like this?

294
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,600
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,350
Okay, you're getting there.

296
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,690
Honestly, it's looking better than before already.

297
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,100
What is happening?

298
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,230
Now stick your lips out like a duck bill.

299
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,770
That'll be super funny.

300
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,270
I wanted to make a silly face to make her laugh.

301
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,810
And now I'm getting pointers
on how to do it from my target.

302
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,190
It's kind of humiliating.

303
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,560
Whatever!

304
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,600
All I want is for Takagi to laugh and get in trouble!

305
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,400
I couldn't care less who helps me make that happen!

306
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,850
Like this?

307
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,850
Yeah, that's perfect!

308
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,940
It looks way better now!

309
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,940
Okay.

310
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,900
Then why aren't you laughing yet?

311
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,230
I'll laugh really hard if you
turn to your left right now.

312
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,020
All right.

313
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,060
This is the moment.

314
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,480
Here we go!

315
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,600
What are you doing, Nishikata?

316
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,310
Sorry!

317
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,810
I'm really sorry, sir!

318
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,230
Always with the antics.

319
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,400
Take my class seriously, will you?

320
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
I will.

321
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,810
And sorry again.

322
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,310
My stomach hurts from laughing!

323
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,560
I guess I technically got her to laugh, like I wanted.

324
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,150
But she won that round.

325
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,060
Hey. Hey, Nishikata.

326
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Okay, that's enough playing around.

327
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,440
If I make Mr. Tanabe angry again, he'll kill me!

328
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,460
I gotta make sure I don't get involved
with Takagi for the rest of this class.

329
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,630
You finally decided to look at me.

330
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,810
We should totally have a staring contest.

331
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,760
One. Two. Three.

332
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,690
That face is so weird!

333
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,730
Nishikata!

334
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,690
What did I say?

335
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:45,270
Whenever Takagi gets my heart racing,
things don't play out the way I want them to.

336
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Ugh.

337
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,900
I'm exhausted, yet again.

338
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,150
What did I say?

339
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,940
Don't say you're tired, it'll make things worse!

340
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,770
It takes your happiness away!

341
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,560
Yeah, whatever.

342
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,940
What's up?

343
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,310
Are you doing okay?

344
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,310
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

345
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,940
You two go on ahead.

346
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,020
Why?

347
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm just feeling a little tired, is all.

348
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,310
By your rules, there goes your happiness.

349
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,810
Huh?

350
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
Yeah, guess you're right.

351
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,270
Mina.

352
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,270
Care to tell us what you're hiding under your foot?

353
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,690
Whatever do you mean?

354
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,150
I always stand like this.

355
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,560
Wait, no fair!

356
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,120
I found that hundred yen!

357
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,730
What happened to finders keepers?

358
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,980
You are so greedy.

359
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,560
Mina.

360
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,440
Come on.

361
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,810
It's a token.

362
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,430
It must have turned into that when I said I was tired.

363
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,330
I told you it was real.

364
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,290
You know that's not how the world works.
