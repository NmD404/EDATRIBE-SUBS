1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,580
How to approach a cat.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,870
Step one: Don't make eye contact.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,120
Step two: Assume a crouching posture.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,450
That do anything for ya?

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,290
You can tell by my body language
that I'm not a threat, right?

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,370
Step three: Approach ever so slowly.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,580
This is incredible!

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,870
I guess that guy on TV wasn't kidding!

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,700
His advice is just what I needed.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,290
Oh, hey! Nishikata!

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,910
What were you doing?

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,620
Nothing.

13
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,370
Curse you, Takagi!

14
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,910
I was this close to petting
that cat when you came along!

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,200
But...

16
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,120
On the other hand, I'm glad she
didn't actually see me petting it.

17
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,500
Because if she did...

18
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,540
Ooh, Nishikata's petting a cat!

19
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,700
I thought boys weren't supposed to like cute things.

20
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,620
She'd never let me live it down!

21
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,250
And there's no way I'm gonna give
her more ammo to tease me with!

22
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,700
Look, a cat.

23
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,750
Really?

24
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,870
Oh, wow. You like cats?

25
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,620
Not especially.

26
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,580
Crap! That was close.

27
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,410
Here, kitty, kitty.

28
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,500
Over here.

29
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,870
So naive, Takagi.

30
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,080
Cats are very wary creatures.

31
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,370
There's no way one would just waltz right--

32
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,050
Come here.

33
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,620
--Wh-What?!

34
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,450
Why? That wasn't even a proper call!

35
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,620
Unless...

36
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,040
What is she, some sort of cat whisperer?

37
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,370
That's a good boy.

38
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,370
You're looking cuter than usual, Meeta.

39
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,040
Wait, you know this cat?

40
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,830
Yep. He belongs to the old lady who
lives around the corner from us.

41
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,660
No wonder! That explains it.

42
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,620
Aww. So soft.

43
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,200
He's great. And he really likes people.

44
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,420
He'll let you pet him all you want.

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,330
Could it really be?

46
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,580
The coveted all-you-can-pet cat?

47
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,450
I need him!

48
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,620
Why don't you play with him a little?

49
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,250
What? Why would I?

50
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,050
Come on.

51
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,080
You were trying to pet the other cat.

52
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,540
You used that trick that was on TV yesterday.

53
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,620
I think you wanna.

54
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,410
She already knows!

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,190
I just thought that guy on TV didn't
know what he was talking about, so...

56
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,790
So... You don't particularly like cats or anything?

57
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,500
No. Not really.

58
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,540
And I've definitely never
wanted to pet a cat or anything.

59
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,250
Really? That's surprising.

60
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,200
They're just so cute.

61
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,040
Their coats are all fluffy.

62
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
And their paws are so squishy.

63
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,330
Are you kidding me?

64
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,620
This cat even lets people touch his paws?

65
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,580
I wanna touch!

66
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,620
But I can't!

67
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,450
I've dug myself too deep for that!

68
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,200
I know!

69
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,200
I really don't get why people are always
going on and on about petting cats.

70
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,700
It's not like they're really that cute.

71
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,330
And even if they were, I wouldn't want to touch them.

72
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,540
When it comes down to it, they're animals.

73
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,450
You can never be sure what they'll do.

74
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
You're taking a risk every time you approach one.

75
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,250
I see what's going on.

76
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,830
You're saying that because you're
afraid of getting scratched.

77
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,250
She took the bait!

78
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,120
Of course I'm not afraid!

79
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,620
But... If you don't believe me,

80
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,290
I'll just have to prove it
right now by petting this cat!

81
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,290
That's okay.

82
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,020
I actually believe you now.

83
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,700
Sorry I doubted you.

84
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,290
Your face is like an open book, Nishikata!

85
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,390
You really want to pet this cat, huh?

86
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,950
Takagi!

87
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,290
What'll it be?

88
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,830
You gonna pet him? Or leave him hanging?

89
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,660
I want to pet him.

90
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,870
Is that okay?

91
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,250
Mm-hmm.

92
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,080
Though I think Meeta has different plans.

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,750
What do you mean?! He disappeared?!

94
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,660
Yeah. Do you want to go look for a different cat to pet?

95
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,250
We're gonna be late for school.

96
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,040
So I asked, and Satou said
she likes Tanaka from Class 3.

97
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,330
Oh, I called it.

98
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,580
Didn't I call it?

99
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,830
I can't take it anymore!

100
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,540
I want to talk about love!

101
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,410
So I've been doing some thinking.

102
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,000
And I was wondering, what's like your type?

103
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,750
Was that too abrupt?

104
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,160
I never expected you to ask.

105
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,830
I happen to like the dependent type.

106
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,580
As for me, I prefer a well-built physique and long hair.

107
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,620
Oh, yeah?

108
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,040
I never would have guessed.

109
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,410
It's happening!

110
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,330
They're ready to talk about love too!

111
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,750
It's funny.

112
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,330
You just caught us in the middle of discussing that.

113
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,580
Did I really? What a coincidence.

114
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,200
They've both grown so much!

115
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,290
All right. I'm gonna dig deeper here.

116
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,000
What's your type, Yukari?

117
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,450
I'm so glad you asked!

118
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,660
Well, if I had to choose,
I'd say long legs and handsome features are nice.

119
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,080
What about hair?

120
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,080
She's really particular about a guy's hair.

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,790
I tend to like longer hair too, like you do.

122
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,500
Ah! This is fun!

123
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,580
I've wanted to have a conversation
like this with friends forever!

124
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,160
So then a borzoi, yeah?

125
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,370
Uh-huh. A borzo--Eh?

126
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,250
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

127
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,250
Dogs, duh. What are you talking about?

128
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,250
Which breed is your favorite?

129
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,160
I don't know, Chihuahuas?

130
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,250
What? But they don't fit into your description at all!

131
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,040
Well, there are some long-haired Chihuahuas out there.

132
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,750
You gonna draw?

133
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,620
Hm?

134
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,080
You're going to run out of time.

135
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,120
Yeah.

136
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,000
Why does it have to be a portrait?

137
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,750
Can't we just draw whatever we want?

138
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm your reference. You have to actually look at me.

139
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,370
I am looking.

140
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,830
Everyone?

141
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,620
Remember to observe your subject.

142
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,040
Don't get too focused on drawing or
this'll take longer than necessary.

143
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,620
You need to strike a balance.

144
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,690
Take twice as much time studying your
reference as you do drawing them.

145
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,540
You heard her.

146
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Yeah, I did.

147
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,290
Why are you laughing?

148
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,500
Oh... Oh, sorry. It's nothing.

149
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,870
Yeah, right.

150
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,660
What was that all about?

151
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,370
Is there something on my face?

152
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,510
No, there wasn't anything there when I checked
in the bathroom mirror during the break.

153
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,370
What, then? Bed head?

154
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,620
No, I checked my hair, too.

155
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,820
Is she just laughing at my face itself?

156
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,150
I can't do anything about that!

157
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,430
Calm down, calm down!

158
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,660
I know.

159
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,340
It's just her usual game.

160
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,830
There's nothing wrong-- she's just making
me worry so she can enjoy my reaction.

161
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,050
Well two can play at that game.

162
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,330
Are you laughing at how bad your drawing is?

163
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,410
I am not!

164
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,420
Then is there something on my
face that's making you laugh?

165
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,530
Ugh!

166
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,950
I didn't expect her to just ask me flat out.

167
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,410
No, there isn't.

168
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,600
Hm?

169
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,140
Oh, good, she backed down.

170
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,770
Mina, I told you a hundred times!

171
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,580
My eyes don't slant that much, you're exaggerating.

172
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,160
But that's how I envision you, so that's how I drew it.

173
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,330
Don't draw what you see in your mind, draw me!

174
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,240
That's it!

175
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,870
This is supposed to be me?

176
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,870
Well, yeah, that's how I envision you.

177
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,370
I can't help it.

178
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,660
That'll teach her.

179
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,750
Okay. Only ten minutes left.

180
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,790
Oh, this is gonna be good.

181
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,160
Hey, Nishikata.

182
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,580
Mind if I take a look?

183
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,330
Nope. Go ahead.

184
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,290
How do you like that?

185
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,700
Oh, no.

186
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,880
Did I take it too far?

187
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,410
I just drew that based on how I envision you, so...

188
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,700
Nishikata.

189
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,950
That face is too much, Takagi!

190
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,580
My stomach hurts already!

191
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,430
If you're gonna draw me weird,
you should draw that face.

192
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,180
Try again. You can do it. Here.

193
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,620
Okay.

194
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,200
If you can't see me well, I can get closer.

195
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,520
Uh, no, no, that's fine, you're good.

196
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,080
'Kay.

197
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,600
When I get a good look at her, Takagi is kinda...

198
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,160
Pre-- Pret--

199
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,080
Pretty--

200
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,870
There. Finished. You see?

201
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,700
So?

202
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,410
Was I really looking sideways that much?

203
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh! Forgot something.

204
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,370
Now it's done.

205
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,410
Why'd you add red? It's not like I'm blushing!

206
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,830
Uh, you have been this whole time.

207
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,870
No, I haven't!

208
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,200
It just looks like that. I swear!

209
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,450
Look closely, I'm not!

210
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,200
Oh, not bad.

211
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,750
This card means your wish will more or less come true.

212
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,290
Really? Is that so?

213
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,160
You should totally get your love fortune told too, Mina.

214
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,410
She's good at this.

215
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,660
See? Go for it!

216
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,140
Huh? You say you want me to get my fortune told,

217
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,620
but I know you really just want to get yours done.

218
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,080
What do you mean? You don't know that!

219
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,250
It's obvious.

220
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,160
No, I just wanted Mina to do it!

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,370
This really sucks.

222
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,230
I just wanted to go home today.

223
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,500
Nishikata.

224
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,660
What do you want?

225
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,750
Rock-paper-scissors. You up for a match?

226
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,160
What? Why now?

227
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,700
The loser has to buy the winner juice on the way home.

228
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,250
Sound good?

229
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,270
Sorry, but I just found out I have to clean the

230
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,160
classroom after school, so go home without me.

231
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,330
No problem, I'll just wait here for you.

232
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,200
But I don't want to make you sit around.

233
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,870
Okay.

234
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,620
How about if you win, I have to help you clean up?

235
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,580
Why do you wanna play rock-paper-scissors so bad?

236
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,160
I'm just in the mood for it.

237
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,080
All right, I guess it's okay.

238
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,580
Under one condition!

239
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,700
Which is...?

240
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,620
No psychological attacks like telling
me what you're about to choose, okay?

241
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,520
Sure. Fine with me.

242
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,220
That was close.

243
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,830
I don't need a repeat of that day I lost to her

244
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,040
four times in a row because of those tricks.

245
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,250
Now let's do it.

246
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,000
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

247
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,540
I-I won?

248
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,500
This is my first ever victory over Takagi!

249
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,080
Yes! I finally did it! I bet she's super mad!

250
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,660
Well... Guess I'm helping.

251
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,910
She doesn't seem to mind.

252
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,200
Whatever, I don't care. I still won!

253
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,790
I gotta celebrate while I have the chance.

254
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,120
Nishikata?

255
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,610
What is it, Takagi?

256
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,540
Do you believe in fortune telling?

257
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,290
Uh, fortunes? Not really.

258
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,540
Why do you ask?

259
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,450
The girls and I had ours told today.

260
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,700
Oh.

261
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,080
Is that what that deck of cards was earlier?

262
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,450
They're called tarot cards.

263
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,680
Actually, today my tarot reading was about love.

264
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh.

265
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,540
Love?

266
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,160
Turned out good.

267
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,830
It said I'll do well with my current crush.

268
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,060
Your current crush?

269
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,980
Good for you, then.

270
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,270
What about you?

271
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,540
Do you have a crush?

272
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,230
Huh? What was that?

273
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,330
I said, "Do you have a crush?"

274
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,870
Nope! I don't! Definitely not!

275
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,580
I see.

276
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,890
Why did she ask me that just now?

277
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,700
Could it be?

278
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,620
Does Takagi... like me?

279
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,290
What's wrong?

280
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,080
It's nothing! Don't worry about it, everything's cool!

281
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,790
Why do I feel so nervous?

282
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,080
Unless... I...

283
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,450
Do I like Takagi?

284
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,700
No, that's just ridiculous.

285
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,290
Oh, by the way, Nishikata.

286
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,460
Yeah? What's up?

287
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,090
The reason I asked if you had a crush

288
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,630
was because I had your tarot reading done, too.

289
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,620
So that's why you asked me that.

290
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,790
Makes sense I guess.

291
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,000
Should have known.

292
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,470
Wait. Am I disappointed?

293
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,370
Yeah. And guess what?

294
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,160
You'll do well with your crush, too.

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,330
That'd be great. If you had a crush.

296
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,950
You're blushing.

297
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,000
That's because I'm hard at work cleaning.

298
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,500
Just change the subject.

299
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,790
So what other readings did you have done?

300
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,790
I asked what you'd pick if we
played rock-paper-scissors.

301
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,830
Huh? As in the match I won earlier?

302
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,680
Mm-hmm.

303
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,900
Clearly that didn't work out.

304
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,950
It's just a fortune, not destiny.

305
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,720
I feel stupid for worrying.

306
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,570
Maybe if you didn't believe in
something as silly as fortune

307
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,040
telling, you wouldn't be stuck here, doing half my work!

308
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,950
It came true, though.

309
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,500
Huh? What do you mean? I won that match, didn't I?

310
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,410
Yup. You sure did.

311
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,290
Come on.

312
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,790
Let's get back to cleaning this place up.

313
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,910
Yeah.

314
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,250
Wait, what?

315
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,370
"Critical."

316
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,410
Today's the day.

317
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,080
I'm gonna beat Takagi.

318
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Count on it!

319
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,280
Oh. Hey, Nishikata. Good morning.

320
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,730
Back atcha. Morning.

321
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,660
Somebody's in a good mood today.

322
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,540
Really? You think so?

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,410
I'm in a great mood.

324
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,000
You have no idea what's coming your way.

325
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,000
It just so happens that I'm invincible today.

326
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,340
Because according to my horoscope this morning,

327
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,950
I am number--!

328
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,910
Is it your horoscope? Cancer was number one today.

329
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,250
Huh?!

330
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,410
Hold on a second, how do you know I'm a cancer?

331
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,790
I mean, I said happy birthday to you this year, so...

332
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,160
Oh. I forgot. I guess that makes sense.

333
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,910
What, does she read everyone's horoscope every day?

334
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,460
She's crafty.

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,910
But she underestimates me.

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,040
I bet she doesn't know that in today's
blood-type fortune, I'm also--!

337
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,660
Also, blood type O's number one, too.

338
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,910
Huh?!

339
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,870
Okay, how do you know that I'm blood type O?

340
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,580
I had a feeling that you were.

341
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,750
Just a guess.

342
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,330
She's just too good.

343
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,620
I was the one underestimating her.

344
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,780
You just can't mess with this girl.

345
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,080
But just you wait.

346
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,700
Today I'm invinc--!

347
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,790
Feeling invincible today, aren't you?

348
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,290
Because of what you heard about both of your fortunes?

349
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,540
Ah.

350
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,950
Are you freaking' kidding me?

351
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,250
Well then. I hope something good happens.

352
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,700
Yeah, that'd be cool.

353
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,330
I don't care if you basically read my mind!

354
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm lucky as can be today! I'll get you!

355
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,790
Teased fifty times.

356
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,620
Which means I have to do a hundred and fifty push-ups.

357
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,910
Why? This sucks!

358
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,660
Was it stupid of me to get excited just
because I'm supposed to have good fortune?

359
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,200
Ugh...

360
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,540
What's wrong?

361
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,200
Are you upset because nothing special happened?

362
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,910
It's just a silly fortune.

363
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,880
You seemed to believe that tarot
reading you had the other day!

364
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,480
Man, I've spent all day trying to
think of a plan to beat Takagi,

365
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,830
but I couldn't come up with anything worthwhile.

366
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,040
Maybe I should just call it quits for now.

367
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,900
Either my fortune's wrong, or my luck is
that I only got teased fifty times today.

368
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,330
Hey, Nishikata.

369
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,370
Let's walk home together.

370
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,060
Oh. Yeah, sure, why not?

371
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,040
No, I can't let it end like this!

372
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,410
By the way, what exactly did
your fortune say this morning?

373
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,000
Say what? You mean...

374
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,160
That short description they write with your rank?

375
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,950
Mm-hmm.

376
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,160
Uh, let's see.

377
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,490
Something like...

378
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,330
Cancer is in first place.

379
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,500
You'll land a critical hit! Get 'em!

380
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,000
That's right! A critical hit!

381
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,870
Which means I can turn the tables with a single blow!

382
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,450
It all makes sense now!

383
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,830
No matter how many times she teases me today,
if I can get back at her just once, I win!

384
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,480
Never give up hope!

385
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,950
So? "Something like" what?

386
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,100
Uh... I can't seem to remember what it was.

387
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,910
Hey, Nishikata!

388
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,100
That game Fierce Soccer's on sale today!

389
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,040
We're playing' at his house. You in?

390
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,880
Fierce Soccer, huh?

391
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,780
I did want to play that.

392
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,050
But I can't go home without scoring my critical hit!

393
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,260
Then again, I haven't exactly
come up with any sort of plan yet.

394
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,750
No, I should still be able to do it.

395
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,450
I'm the luckiest man on earth today!

396
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,120
I can do anything!

397
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,000
You regret it?

398
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,330
Turning 'em down?

399
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,950
Oh, that. Nah.

400
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,750
I wanted to walk home with you, anyway.

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,580
Hmm. There's gotta be something.

402
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,120
Hold on!

403
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,080
I didn't just say something super awkward, did I?

404
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,580
Uh... I remembered my fortune which said
I'd land a critical hit today, so...

405
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,620
I thought today was gonna be my best
chance to beat you at something!

406
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,750
So what I just said wasn't what it sounded like!

407
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,450
This is the worst!

408
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,410
I didn't land a critical hit!

409
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,330
I scored on my own goal!

410
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,750
So uh... Do me a solid.

411
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,450
Could'ya pretend you didn't hear that?

412
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,410
I guess I can do that.

413
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,320
I'll pretend I heard nothing.

414
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,160
If you say it one more time.

415
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,220
I am not gonna say it again!

416
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,040
Forget you, I'm going this way!

417
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,500
I'll see you around!

418
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,910
A critical hit.

419
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,950
How terrifying.
