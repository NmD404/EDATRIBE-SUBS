1
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,790
All right.

2
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,200
Now, we're practicing calligraphy,
so write down your favorite thing.

3
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,040
Due by the end of the day.

4
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,410
Well, I know what I'm writing.

5
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
Grilled meat.

6
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,410
My favorite.

7
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,330
Having trouble deciding?

8
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,500
Sorta.

9
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,160
Did you figure out what you're gonna write?

10
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,830
Hmmm... Not just yet.

11
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,660
I know.

12
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,740
How about we both write down something
that we want from each other?

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,000
What we want from each other?

14
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,250
Uh-huh.

15
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,120
Hmm...

16
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,450
Okay.

17
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,410
What I want from Takagi?

18
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,040
Hmm...

19
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,700
Duh!

20
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,330
For her to stop teasing me!

21
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,160
This'll be a good way to tell her off!

22
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,480
Wait.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,980
Now that I think about it, that might actually backfire.

24
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,540
She'd probably call me a wuss and make fun of me more.

25
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,250
I need to find a way to make her
sorry without provoking her further.

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,290
This is harder than it should be.

27
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,660
You done? Because I am.

28
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,540
Cool.

29
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,040
Let's show each other.

30
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,000
Howdya like this?

31
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,410
"Restraint"?

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,540
Uh, yeah.

33
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,790
With what?

34
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,250
I can't really help if you don't specify.

35
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,410
Uh... Well, it's, uh, a few different things.

36
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,660
She clearly doesn't get it.

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,460
But then again, at this point if she did get
it, she'd probably get upset.

38
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,540
This is tricky.

39
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,160
So what about you?

40
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,290
What do you mean by "status quo"?

41
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,910
Oh, you don't get it?

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,480
Well, it means you're easy to tease,
and I want you to stay that way, 'Kay?

43
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,910
Red alert! She's going on the offensive!

44
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,370
It's an ambush!

45
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,660
If that's how she wants this to go, fine.

46
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,210
Two can play at that game.

47
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,950
I'm ready for it now.

48
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,580
Are you okay with a do-over?

49
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,330
Yeah, sure.

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,370
Get set to get wrecked, Takagi!

51
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,950
I'm about to fight fire with fire!

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,370
So, did you finish?

53
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,870
Almost.

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,580
This should make Takagi realize
that she isn't exactly kind to me.

55
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,000
Can't misinterpret this!

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,270
Forget what I said before, now I want to upset you!

57
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,500
Huh... What should I write?

58
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,250
Ho-ho what's this?

59
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,000
Having trouble coming up with something?

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,580
Perhaps if you were a bit kinder,

61
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,540
it'd be easy to come up with a
nice, wholesome request from me.

62
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,040
Oh. I wanted to tell you earlier,

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,200
you have really nice handwriting.

64
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,870
It has an interesting flare.

65
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,750
Have you been taught calligraphy?

66
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,950
Uh, no, not really.

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,660
Hmm?

68
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,700
Well, either way,

69
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,660
I like it a lot.

70
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,620
Here.

71
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,830
Uh...

72
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,450
Thanks.

73
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,660
That's weird.

74
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,410
She's being so nice all of a sudden.

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,080
What's going on?

76
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,790
Could it be?

77
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,950
Is Takagi actually nice,

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,410
and I just haven't noticed it until now?

79
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,500
No way.

80
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,330
I'd have picked up on that.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,040
Nishikata, stay still for a second.

82
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,290
Huh?!

83
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,330
Huh?

84
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,200
Got it.

85
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,160
Something was on your face.

86
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,370
Okay!

87
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,870
I think I have something to write now.

88
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,450
Do you like my beautiful artwork?

89
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,660
You're a weird guy, you know that?

90
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,080
What?

91
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,410
Okay.

92
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,140
I'm done.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,750
How about you show me yours first?

94
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,120
Uh... Why not at the same time?

95
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,330
Just show me already.

96
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,620
Ahhh...

97
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,080
I was a little more obvious this time, at least.

98
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,200
You really do have interesting handwriting.

99
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,950
That's all you have to say? Come on.

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,610
I'm trying to spell it out for you.

101
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,540
Stop teasing me.

102
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,040
What? I can't!

103
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,580
You didn't even give it some thought.

104
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,040
All right, I'm sorry.

105
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,040
I'll hold back from now on.

106
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,830
Thank you.

107
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,500
So what's yours say?

108
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,620
Curious?

109
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,330
Then let's see.

110
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,620
Here.

111
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,570
When she touched my face.

112
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,700
Didn't you just say that you'd hold back from now on?

113
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,500
Yeah, but I said that after I already set this up.

114
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,160
So hot.

115
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,330
Yeah, I guess so.

116
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,540
We should start wearing our short-sleeve uniform soon.

117
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,580
Yeah. I guess so.

118
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,180
Let's just tell Sanae that we're gonna
start wearing them tomorrow, sound good?

119
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,310
Yeah, I guess so.

120
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,490
You guess what?

121
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,790
Huh?

122
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,750
Hey.

123
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,660
Long sleeves?

124
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,580
Aren't you hot?

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,540
What?

126
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,540
We said that we'd all change
our uniforms at the same time!

127
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,690
Come on!

128
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,750
Wait, we did?

129
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,870
Yes, we did!

130
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,870
You forgot?

131
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,580
Hmm?

132
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,910
Yeah.

133
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,910
Ahhhh! It's a lot cooler
wearing short sleeves, isn't it?

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,250
Yeah, I guess so.

135
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,120
Hey.

136
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,830
You guess what?

137
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,450
Hey, Sanae.

138
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,410
Good mor... ning.

139
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,120
I thought you said

140
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,580
we were all gonna change our uniforms together?

141
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,910
Uhh...

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
Uh...

143
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,540
I guess I forgot to tell you.

144
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,080
I wanna ask you to let me go,
but I know I deserve this, so...

145
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,910
"English Translation."

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,410
Junko says,

147
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,120
"That's right. Walk down this street to
the post office and turn left there."

148
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,000
You will see the station.

149
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,830
It takes five minutes from here.

150
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,580
Somehow I have to get back at Takagi today.

151
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,790
But the ever-present question is: How?

152
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,950
I haven't made a jack-in-the-box in a while.

153
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,290
No, I don't have enough materials.

154
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,160
At this point, I wouldn't finish in time, anyway.

155
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,330
Uhh.

156
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,660
Let's see, who should I put on the spot?

157
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,870
Nishikata.

158
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,790
Huh?

159
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,540
Uhh.

160
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,500
Yes, sir!

161
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,290
Don't "Huh? Yes, sir!" me.

162
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,910
Hurry up.

163
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,750
Don't worry, it's 16.

164
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,500
Huh?

165
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,700
Sixteen!

166
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,410
You don't even know what class you're in, kid?

167
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,040
It's English, not Math!

168
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,540
I told you to read aloud!

169
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,450
Uh... I'm sorry, sir.

170
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,540
Forget it. Sit down.

171
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,540
I told you we were on line 16.

172
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,450
Way to drop the ball there.

173
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,620
Yeah, right, you were intentionally
vague, so I'd mess it up.

174
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,750
Really.

175
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,540
I didn't think you'd actually mess that up.

176
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,580
Called it.

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,120
What's wrong?

178
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,660
Are you preoccupied with something?

179
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,700
You could say that.

180
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,910
Mind if I ask what it is?

181
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,500
Ehh.

182
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,500
It's really not worth mentioning.

183
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,750
Huuuuh...

184
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,120
Then...

185
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,160
Were you thinking about something naughty?

186
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,200
Wha...?!

187
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,080
No way! Of course not!

188
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,950
Really?

189
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,660
I would never!

190
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,870
Not in a million years!

191
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,000
What kinda guy do ya' think I am?!

192
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,160
I know. I know.

193
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,370
You were just trying to think of new way to

194
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,670
get back at me for all the teasing I do, right?

195
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,040
Nuh-uh.

196
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,790
No idea what you mean.

197
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,500
I know I'm right.

198
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,540
You were looking at me earlier, so...

199
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,620
...it wasn't that hard to figure out.

200
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,580
If you already knew, then why'd you ask?

201
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,710
'Cus it's fun to see how you react when I mess with you.

202
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,370
So what?

203
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,410
Did you come up with a good idea?

204
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,910
Hmph!

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,250
Yup, sure did.

206
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,790
You see, I came up with the perfect plan.

207
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,410
Oh and this time it's absolutely foolproof.

208
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,700
So...

209
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,830
Hmm...

210
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,580
I'll believe it when I see it.

211
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,160
She's not worried at all.

212
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,580
It's like she can read my mind,
so she knows I don't have a plan!

213
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,540
Spill it.

214
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,160
What's this plan of yours?

215
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,410
What idiot would tell you that?

216
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh fine, how about just a hint?

217
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,250
I'm not telling you!

218
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,000
Just pay attention.

219
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,160
Wait, today's the eighteenth.

220
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,290
The teachers always call on the kid
whose student number matches the date.

221
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,040
And today that's Takagi!

222
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,560
If I can get her attention away from
class, she might get

223
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,950
in trouble for not knowing where we are in the textbook!

224
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,550
Hey, Takagi?

225
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,700
D'you eat breakfast today?

226
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,160
Whadja have?

227
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,330
Yeah, mountain yam over rice.

228
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,700
Why ask?

229
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,870
Ehh.

230
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,580
Just curious.

231
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,330
So you like mountain yams?

232
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,910
Yeah, I like 'em.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,040
I usually have energy all day
when I eat them in the morning.

234
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,830
Huh.

235
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,950
Yeah, I kinda getcha.

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,250
What'd you eat?

237
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,250
Me?

238
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,580
Uh, I had...

239
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,910
Bet you can't guess.

240
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,620
Hmm, I wonder.

241
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,120
Rice?

242
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,040
Rice? Why's that?

243
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,200
Well, I didn't peg you as a toast kinda guy.

244
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,160
Am I wrong?

245
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,330
No. You're right, I had rice.

246
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,500
It's working!

247
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,830
Just keep her attention off of the lesson!

248
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,410
So uhh... you on team rice?

249
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,910
I want someone to read the next page aloud.

250
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,830
Today's the eighteenth, so how about Takagi.

251
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,080
Here we go! Heh heh heh.

252
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,200
You don't know where we are, do you?

253
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,910
Do you?

254
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,450
"I will not do such a thing."

255
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,120
Thank you. Very nice.

256
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,330
What?

257
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,660
Hmph.

258
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,080
Nice try.

259
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,750
Wh-What are you talking about?

260
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,410
Man, she's good!

261
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
I can never seem to get her!

262
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,910
Gotta come up with another plan.

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,350
Maybe I can take it back to basics and
hit her with the old jack-in-the-box?

264
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,540
No, I don't have the materials!

265
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,330
Been over this!

266
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,330
Okay.

267
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,700
What is it this time?

268
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,750
Uh? It's, uhh...

269
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,910
Nothing, forget it.

270
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,410
By any chance, were you thinking about me again?

271
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,830
No, not really.

272
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,700
Not in so many words.

273
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,910
Plus, why would I think about you?

274
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
That'd be weird, wouldn't it?

275
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,700
Oooh, then you were thinking something naughty.

276
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,200
No! I swear!

277
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,040
I know.

278
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,080
I'm always thinking about you, though.

279
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,790
Hey, you're blushing!

280
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,700
No I'm not.

281
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,250
And gimme a break.

282
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,830
You're just always thinking about
different ways to tease me, aren't you?

283
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,540
Eh...

284
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,450
Why did she take so long to answer?

285
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,910
Today's June eighteenth.

286
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,790
If I add the month and date together, it's 24.

287
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,870
Number 24!

288
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,660
Nishikata!

289
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,140
It's the first day we get to go in the
pool, but all I can do is watch.

290
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,370
Why'd I have to hurt my hand?

291
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,370
It's just not fair.

292
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,500
They're all having fun without me.

293
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,950
Right?

294
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,550
And of course this happens on the
first day that they let us swim.

295
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,500
It sucks!

296
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,870
So you're sitting out too, I take it?

297
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,750
Mm-hmm.

298
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,290
For you it's because of your hand, yeah?

299
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,750
How'd you hurt it?

300
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,040
Yeah.

301
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,700
Well, you know, things happen.

302
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,810
I bet you tried to pet a cat, but then it bit you.

303
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,120
Huh?! Wait, how did you know that?

304
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,160
I made an effort not to tell anyone!

305
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,910
I'm actually right?

306
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,040
I just took a shot in the dark!

307
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,410
You are something else!

308
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,540
So what's your excuse?

309
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,950
Why are you just watching everyone swim... today?

310
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,620
That reminds me.

311
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,580
Any girl who sits out during
swimming is usually on her period.

312
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,540
According to the textbook,
it causes abdominal pain and discomfort.

313
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,450
So says Takao, the King of Health Class.

314
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,620
Oh, uh, it's nothing, forget it.

315
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,830
I shouldn't ask.

316
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,450
It's not really any of my business anyway.

317
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,410
You wanted to ask why I'm not
swimming today, didn't you?

318
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,870
Of course she heard me.

319
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,920
Oh. Hey. How about because I figured out your reason

320
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,870
is your hand, you take a shot at guessing my reason?

321
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,410
You're not feeling good?

322
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,000
You have to be more specific than that.

323
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,450
No. Forget it.

324
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,700
I wasn't actually gonna ask you.

325
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,580
Oh?

326
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,580
Then are you admitting defeat?

327
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,450
All right, fine.

328
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,120
I might as well take a guess.

329
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,580
Only one, though.

330
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,410
Well, not that you'd get it with more tries.

331
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,250
She's got me cornered now.

332
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,370
Is she this confident because
she thinks I can't say "period"?

333
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,830
Because if that's it, I'll show her!

334
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,080
I'll say it ten times!

335
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,830
But wait, this is Takagi we're talking about.

336
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,330
It could be a trap!

337
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,660
Even if I gathered my courage and answered, "Period"!

338
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,540
I know what'll happen!

339
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,790
No, and that's very rude of you!

340
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,120
So that's out of the question.

341
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,950
But knowing her, she probably already has
an idea of what's going through my head.

342
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm hesitating, that's enough for her to figure it out.

343
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,750
But if I don't answer at all,

344
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,450
well, I think I know how that'll go, too.

345
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,400
You don't even know the reason why a girl
is sitting out when she could be swimming?

346
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,080
Ha! That means I win, then.

347
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,620
Is this a trap or not?

348
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,000
Is she making it seem genuine so I'll fall into a trap?

349
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,580
Or is she making it seem like a
trap, so I'll worry and mess up?

350
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,240
Agh. I'm just going around in circles here!

351
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,120
This sucks.

352
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,580
What was with that face before?

353
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,080
And was she gripping her stomach or what?

354
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,500
Okay, what else could it be?

355
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,540
Maybe an injury?

356
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,500
I don't know; it doesn't seem like it.

357
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,990
It doesn't really look like she's
feeling too sick to be exercising either.

358
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,410
Then that leaves.

359
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,790
What's left?

360
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,790
No.

361
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,910
They don't know how good they have it.

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,580
They get to goof around and cool off in the pool.

363
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,370
Meanwhile I'm here in the heat using
all my brain power to battle Takagi.

364
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,950
Come on, Nishikata, we don't have all day.

365
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,500
You're not just checking out all the
girls in their swimsuits, are you?

366
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,120
What? Of course I'm not!

367
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,370
Are you sure about that?

368
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,750
Because you know what I heard?

369
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,250
Boys are usually looking at girls' chests.

370
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,330
Whatever, then I'm the exception!

371
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,330
I could never say this out loud.

372
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,200
But Takagi doesn't have a very big chest.

373
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,120
I heard that small-chested girls are...

374
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,370
...sensitive about it.

375
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,500
So you probs shouldn't bring it up.

376
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,660
So says Kimura, the King of Early Lunch.

377
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,830
Could it be that she's not swimming because
she has some sort of complex about her body?

378
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,910
Like, she's self-conscious?

379
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,200
I had a feeling you wouldn't figure it out.

380
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,540
That means I win today, too.

381
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,040
Oh, Takagi.

382
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,250
I do know why.

383
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,040
It's obvious that you're just
self-conscious about your chest!

384
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,830
Ugh! Yeah, right!

385
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,340
Like I could ever say that!

386
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,120
It's beyond rude! It's super rude!

387
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,540
The only answer I have left is that she's on her period!

388
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,950
But that's plenty rude, too.

389
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,500
What do I do?

390
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,290
You're still thinking it over?

391
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,040
We have to go back inside soon.

392
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,650
No!

393
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,190
They even say in the textbook that it's
nothing to be embarrassed about! It'll be fine!

394
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,330
You got this.

395
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,870
Just say it with your head held high!

396
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,660
It's now or never!

397
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,780
The reason you're sitting out in swim class is...

398
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,380
...you're on your period.

399
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,620
Incorrect.

400
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,250
And that's pretty rude to say to a girl.

401
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,370
Uh! I just thought that since it was
mentioned in our health textbook, it might--

402
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,630
Man Nishikata, your face is bright red!

403
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,200
Then is it actually

404
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,290
because she's self-conscious about her chest?

405
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,540
That's all I got!

406
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,870
Ahhh... Too funny.

407
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,040
Upsy-daisy.

408
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,040
And for the record.

409
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,290
Being too self-conscious about my chest...

410
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,700
...is also incorrect.

411
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,500
Wha...?!

412
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,250
Excuse me!

413
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,910
I changed my mind, is it okay if I swim?

414
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,540
That's fine!

415
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,080
Uh... I don't get it.

416
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,330
Then why was she sitting out?

417
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,540
Okay.

418
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,200
Now that I've gotten my fill of funny faces.

419
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,250
It's time for a quick swim.

420
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,190
Oh, don't tell me you were sitting out that
whole time just so you could tease me more!

421
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,370
Hey. When your hand heals...

422
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,850
...then we can swim together.

423
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,620
It's cold!

424
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,290
I won't fall for it.

425
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,750
When we do swim together,

426
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,000
I'd bet anything she's gonna mess with me again.

427
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,830
After all, that's the kind of person she is.
