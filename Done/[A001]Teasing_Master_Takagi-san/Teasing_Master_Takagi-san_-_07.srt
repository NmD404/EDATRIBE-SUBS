1
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,650
A brand new issue.

2
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,620
Day-one purchase.

3
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,440
Here you go.

4
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,260
Thanks, Mom.

5
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,420
I have a few stores I want to browse,
so let's meet back here when you're done.

6
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,770
Gotcha.

7
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,310
And don't get anything too showy, okay?

8
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,990
I won't.

9
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,970
Thank you, come again.

10
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,210
Volume five of <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> !

11
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,910
I wonder what type I should try on first.

12
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,660
Hmm...

13
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,910
Actually, what type does he like?

14
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,330
Hmm...

15
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,790
I can't wait to get home and read this cover to cover!

16
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,020
Nishikata!

17
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,620
What are you doing here?

18
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,500
Uh, shopping?

19
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,620
Same as you.

20
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,800
Again?

21
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,910
Why does she always have to show
up at the worst possible time?

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,950
I swear, she's gotta be following me or something!

23
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,080
No.

24
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,290
Now's not the time to think about that.

25
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,420
I need to focus my energy into making
sure she doesn't find out what I bought.

26
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,330
Anyway, I saw you leaving the bookstore.

27
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,250
Here it comes!

28
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,040
Gotta think quick!

29
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,130
Did you buy something--?

30
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,040
So you're shopping? That's cool! Whatcha getting?

31
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,840
That was too close a call.

32
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,140
I hope changing the subject is
enough to get out of this alive.

33
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,950
Mainly, a bathing suit.

34
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,460
A bathing suit?

35
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,520
Are you blushing?

36
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,340
No, it's just hot in here!

37
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,850
Hey.

38
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,540
What kind of girl's bathing
suit do you think looks best?

39
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,330
Uh, what kind of...? Why you asking me?

40
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,560
I-I don't know, they're all probably fine.

41
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,830
You've seen 'em all?

42
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,290
You're quite the connoisseur.

43
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,540
No, you don't get it!

44
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,040
I mean that I couldn't care less!

45
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm not some expert!

46
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,950
Hot in here?

47
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,160
Yes, it's hot in here.

48
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,200
Typical. Of course, she messes with
me the second we bump into each other.

49
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,290
All right, I'm gonna go home now.

50
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,830
'Kay.

51
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,700
At least, I was able to hide the manga from her.

52
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,330
You just bought the new volume
of <i>Unrequited Love,</i> right?

53
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,580
Could I borrow it?

54
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,250
I was so close!

55
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,120
Was she watching me?

56
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

57
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,410
You don't? Was I wrong?

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,550
Hey, wait.

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,000
There's no way she could have seen from
outside with the register where it is.

60
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,380
She's bluffing.

61
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,030
Dodged a bullet there.

62
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,200
Yeah, totally wrong.

63
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,830
You couldn't be more off.

64
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,790
Oh yeah?

65
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,460
Then what did you buy?

66
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,410
Uh, <i>Robot Zombie</i> ?

67
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,120
Yeah, sure, whatever, that!

68
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,620
It's like, the last thing a girl would be interested in!

69
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,830
It's way too ridiculous!

70
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,700
Yeah, right.

71
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,660
You bought <i>Unrequited Love,</i> didn't you?

72
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,330
Yup! Sure did!

73
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,910
Gah!

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,450
N-No.

75
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,200
Let me see it, then.

76
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Man. She backed me into a corner again.

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,410
This is what always happens.

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,160
No matter what I do,
I can never beat Takagi at her own game.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,590
Wait, I take that back.

80
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,750
Okay, but first, shall we make a bet?

81
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,000
Hmm?

82
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,470
We can bet on whether or not the book
I bought is <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

83
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,000
I say our usual condition applies.

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,290
If you're wrong, you have to do whatever I tell you to.

85
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,650
Fine with me.

86
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,580
And if I get it right, then you do whatever I want.

87
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,950
Yeah, okay.

88
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,330
So, then what is it you think I purchased?

89
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,500
Heh.

90
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,540
It's all in the presentation.

91
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,780
It's your move, Takagi.

92
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,790
I'm sure my level of confidence will
have you second guessing yourself.

93
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,540
Huh?

94
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,840
Nishikata sounds so much more confident than normal.

95
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,540
Maybe it's actually not <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> !

96
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,260
Oh yeah. If she's gonna find out anyway,

97
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,960
I might as well teach her a lesson in the process.

98
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,410
Think you can just get me like that again?

99
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,410
Nuh-uh. I've learned.

100
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,540
Know what?

101
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,580
I'm gonna bet that it's <i>Unrequited Love.</i>

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,870
Huh?

103
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,500
Y-You sure about that?

104
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,510
Mm-hmm.

105
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,860
Let's see it.

106
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,540
Awesome!

107
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,810
I got it right!

108
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,160
I don't know how she saw through me that time.

109
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,080
I should just go home and read this.

110
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,870
That'll make me feel better.

111
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,750
Ugh. I'll see yah around.

112
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,620
Where do you think you're going?

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,950
Help me out.

114
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,120
I need a bathing suit.

115
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,540
We said if I won.

116
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,420
I'd get to tell you what to do, didn't we?

117
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,060
I have to help her pick one?

118
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,160
Hot in here?

119
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,670
Yes, it's still hot!

120
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,450
Which one do you like most?

121
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,410
Uh. They all look nice to me.

122
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,830
Will you actually look and pick one?

123
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,620
You did lose our bet.

124
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,910
I don't think she realizes what she's asking of me.

125
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,450
It's embarrassing just being here!

126
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,950
I can't look directly at the bathing suits!

127
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,200
Oh. Check it out.

128
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,620
What do you think of this one?

129
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,300
I guess I just have to pick one
if I want to get this over with.

130
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,370
I-I think that one's nice.

131
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,870
Oh?

132
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,040
In that case, I might as well try it on.

133
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,280
Huh?

134
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,080
Stay right there.

135
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,040
I'll only be a minute.

136
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,950
What am I doing?

137
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,360
How did I end up in this situation?

138
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,950
Right now, just beyond that curtain.

139
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,540
Takagi is taking off her...

140
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,040
How's it look?

141
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,750
I dunno, fine?

142
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,600
That's all?

143
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,840
I'll try on another, then.

144
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,100
You mean you're not done?

145
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,330
Until you tell me I look good in one.

146
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,560
No, I'm not.

147
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,520
Huh? Tell her she looks good?

148
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,960
That's way too embarrassing for me to say!

149
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,700
Hey, Nishikata.

150
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,000
Sorry, can you hand me that bathing suit?

151
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,690
Huh?!

152
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,830
The yellow one I was looking at.

153
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,910
She's covering herself, does that mean?

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,820
It's to the left of that one.

155
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,430
Uh-huh, that's it.

156
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,450
Just a few feet to my right.

157
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,480
She's totally naked.

158
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,770
Sorry again.

159
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,660
Thanks a bunch.

160
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Oh, gimme a break!

161
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,860
That was totally on purpose!

162
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,130
But forget that, I need to get out
of this store as soon as possible.

163
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,660
If someone from school sees me here with Takagi,

164
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,330
I'll never hear the end of it.

165
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,950
Wow, there are so many!

166
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,720
All right! How's this one?

167
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,650
Uh.

168
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,170
Oh. Hi, Takagi!

169
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,000
Hey, Mano!

170
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,690
Hey, Nakai.

171
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,440
Uh, hey, what's going' on?

172
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,120
You're here to get a bathing suit?

173
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,450
Yeah, I assume that's why you're here, too?

174
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,690
Ow...

175
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,640
Hey, Mano, it's embarrassing being here.

176
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,020
Can we hurry it up already?

177
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,490
Wha?! We've barely been here five minutes!

178
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,700
If I rush, I might miss something I'd really like!

179
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,480
Hmm?

180
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,970
How 'bout we come back later?

181
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,620
What? But you said--

182
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,200
It doesn't matter.

183
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,930
See you later, Takagi!

184
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,100
'Kay!

185
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,830
Don't worry, the coast is clear.

186
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,250
They're gone.

187
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,500
Oh. Is that so?

188
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,120
You get so shy sometimes

189
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,870
What do you mean?

190
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,120
No I don't.

191
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,080
Well then.

192
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,440
Back to trying on more, I assume.

193
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,700
We should probably hurry up and pick one of these out.

194
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,910
Otherwise, you'll die of embarrassment.

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,930
Oh, shut up. I'm fine.

196
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,210
So...

197
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,750
...which of these do you like better?

198
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,790
Uh. I dunno, whichever you like, I guess?

199
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,750
Then how about this one here?

200
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,010
Think this one's good?

201
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,850
Uh-huh.

202
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,200
I keep coming back to this pink one.

203
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,620
Do you think it's good too?

204
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,740
Uh-huh.

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,410
And this one-piece?

206
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,080
Mm-hm.

207
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,120
Wanna go swimming together sometime?

208
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,500
Uh-huh.

209
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,090
It's a date.

210
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,910
Okay.

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,080
I'll buy you something to drink later.

212
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,370
You're burning up again.

213
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,500
Yeah, I mean, it is super-hot in here!

214
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,950
They should really fix the air conditioning!

215
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,370
The ocean!

216
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,530
We swimming' or what?

217
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,410
Of course we are, come on!

218
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,540
Water.

219
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,370
We got the waves!

220
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,620
We got the sun!

221
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,380
We got the seaweed.

222
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,870
Stop Sanae. It's all gross and slimy!

223
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,370
What are you doing, Yukari?

224
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,370
What does it look like I'm doing?

225
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,330
I'm pumping air into this.

226
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,540
But we're at the beach.

227
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,540
You should at least go for a swim, first.

228
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,620
I wouldn't be doing this if I
could just jump in the water.

229
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,580
Ah! What, you can't swim?

230
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,450
You do sit out during swim lessons.

231
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,370
Though you'd probably learn if you didn't.

232
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,500
Whatever.

233
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,500
Just go have fun, I'll be there soon.

234
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,580
Shoo. Shoo.

235
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,870
Ah! That was fun, but I'm wiped!

236
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,290
Yeah, let's take a break for now.

237
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,790
Huh?

238
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,580
What happened?

239
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,500
You okay, Yukari?

240
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,700
Yeah, I'm okay.

241
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,620
But I managed to break the pump somehow.

242
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,160
So I was blowing it up on my own, and I got winded.

243
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,280
Man, Yukari, do you ever have
fun, or do you just suffer?

244
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,570
You don't know my life!

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,330
And just for that, I'm not gonna
help you with your homework anymore!

246
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,160
Hope you can do it on your own!

247
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,120
You what?

248
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,160
But I can't!

249
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,080
Please have mercy!

250
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,450
I won't make fun of you anymore!

251
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,500
Crying won't get you anywhere.

252
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,040
Nishikata, are you making
progress on your summer homework?

253
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Uh...

254
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,160
Yeah.

255
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,880
I guess you could say that.

256
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,830
Oh?

257
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,500
Hey, wanna do our homework together?

258
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,700
Uh. Yeah, sure, that's cool.

259
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,290
But I have plans in the afternoon.

260
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,290
That's fine.

261
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,950
Let's just work on it until noon.

262
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,000
You can copy my answers.

263
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,410
Huh?

264
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,250
Okay, then where should we do it?

265
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,290
At the library?

266
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,770
Or, wait. We wouldn't have very
much time to get our stuff, then.

267
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,360
You're over-thinking this.

268
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,180
We could just go over to your house.

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
What is my life?

270
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,110
Out of nowhere, Takagi,

271
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,040
a girl is coming to my room!

272
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,060
Are we going in?

273
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,870
Sorry. Spaced out for a sec.

274
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,160
This place is nice.

275
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,200
You don't have to be polite.

276
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,870
My parents aren't here anyway.

277
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,200
This feels like a dream.

278
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,460
Is this a dream?

279
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,450
Takagi is actually in my room.

280
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,780
It feels so surreal.

281
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,650
What's wrong?

282
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,450
You spaced out again.

283
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,040
Oh.

284
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,020
It's nothing!

285
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,700
Hey!

286
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,620
It's your favorite girl's manga!

287
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,910
Aww, you found me! Squeal!

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,870
You have every volume!

289
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,500
Huh?!

290
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,860
Don't touch that!

291
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,690
S-Sorry.

292
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,370
Why are you apologizing?

293
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,730
Well, you know, because we were just so--

294
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,630
You like this, right?

295
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,010
If you like something, you should just admit it.

296
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,750
What does she mean?

297
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,540
"This" as in her being in my room?

298
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,770
How am I supposed to respond to that?

299
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,790
Maybe this is a dream after all!

300
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,670
<i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

301
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,750
You do like it, right?

302
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,620
There's really no need to hide it.

303
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,970
That's what she was talking about?

304
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,370
Now that I've had a chance to look around,

305
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,340
this room just screams "you."

306
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,160
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

307
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,980
Hmm...

308
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,580
No, not exactly.

309
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,740
But either way, I like it.

310
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,020
W-Want to start our homework?

311
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,660
Read my mind!

312
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,250
Oh right.

313
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,250
But I only have one desk.

314
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,000
Do you have a folding table or something?

315
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,240
Yeah, but they're all being used in different rooms.

316
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,040
Too bad.

317
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,340
Then should we sit in the same chair?

318
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,490
Uh...

319
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,080
Huh?!

320
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,060
I'm just messing around.

321
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,860
Oh, I know.

322
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,050
We could use your bed.

323
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,080
Uh. Um.

324
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,250
Move this.

325
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,970
And we've basically got one big desk right here!

326
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,120
You okay?

327
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,490
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

328
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,050
Good idea.

329
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,660
Ohh?

330
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,680
What's the problem?

331
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,410
Lay off.

332
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,870
No problem.

333
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,910
Come on.

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,170
Let's start.

335
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,080
Wait, I'm sitting there, too?

336
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,080
So, hey, uh...

337
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,080
Remember what you said about your answers?

338
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,940
Of course, they are right here.

339
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,260
Awesome, thanks a ton!

340
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,580
Though, I only grabbed these.

341
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,150
Kanji writing drills.

342
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,250
That's so not fair; you tricked me!

343
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,700
No, I didn't.

344
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,950
That's enough.

345
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,860
Let's work.

346
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,430
Wait.

347
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,540
If we're just practicing kanji,

348
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,400
was there ever any reason to do our homework together?

349
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,220
Oh no! I saw this exact thing on <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> !

350
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,320
Jeez. I don't know why I have to make
curry with this jerk of all people!

351
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,200
He makes me so mad!

352
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,700
Um. You can let go of my hand now.

353
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,530
Why would I want to do something like that?

354
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,660
C'mere.

355
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,950
Let me see that face.

356
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,160
Squeal!

357
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,720
I can't do that!

358
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,450
You can use it.

359
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,590
It is your eraser, after all.

360
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,480
That's my bad.

361
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,280
Uh. Okay.

362
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,070
Your hand.

363
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,660
Sorry!

364
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,860
You want something' to drink?

365
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:12,950
Like tea?

366
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,870
You want tea?

367
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,610
Mm-hmm.
