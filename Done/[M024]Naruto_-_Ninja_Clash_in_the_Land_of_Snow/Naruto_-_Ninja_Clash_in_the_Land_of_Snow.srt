1
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,493
It's over.

2
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:24,995
We have nowhere left to go.

3
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,075
This is it.

4
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,578
Our road ends here.

5
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:34,397
It was a foolish decision, doomed from the start.

6
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:36,786
This is the end.

7
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,518
We must turn back.

8
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:43,862
There is a way.

9
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:45,461
Have faith.

10
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,804
I know that we will find it.

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,647
But, Princess...

12
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:51,782
You mustn't give up!

13
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,006
Princess.

14
00:00:57,242 --> 00:01:01,821
Princess Gale, this is as far as you go!

15
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:03,374
Now, halt.

16
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:06,060
Don't tell us, this storm is your doing!

17
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:11,356
Behind you, Princess! Look out!

18
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:14,147
Hah!

19
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,563
Give up, Princess!

20
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:30,995
Fall to your knees and bow before me.

21
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:33,180
I will never give up.

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,013
As long as I live, I will gather my
strength and forge a path for others to follow!

23
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:43,331
The princess!

24
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,650
Her Rainbow Chakra is ablaze!

25
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:48,646
My brothers, we must light the flames of our chakra, too!

26
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:49,264
Right!

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Aaah!

28
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:07,112
Now!

29
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,501
Aaah!

30
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,100
All right!

31
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:35,438
Princess Gale, you rule!

32
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:37,766
Good sticks it to evil once again!

33
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,947
Hey!

34
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,507
What the heck do you think you're doing up there?

35
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,643
Hup, yike!

36
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:46,108
What's the big idea?

37
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:48,183
Don't play stupid with me.

38
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:51,240
You snuck in here without
paying, you lousy little freeloader!

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,039
Wait, you've got it all wrong! ere just getting
a little training in while we watch the movie!

40
00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:57,952
Training for what?

41
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:00,138
We have tickets.

42
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,721
Are you ninja from the Leaf Village?

43
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,056
You bet we are!

44
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:08,742
You're looking at the next Hokage. A super ninja, pal.

45
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:12,643
Oh, yeah, Naruto Uzumaki, live and in the flesh!

46
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:22,787
Come, let's push on. Our fate lies beyond the rainbow!

47
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,738
Kakashi Sensei is late.

48
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:55,243
So what else is new?

49
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:59,254
Aw, man, that movie was so cool.

50
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,385
I don't think I've ever been so blown away in my life.

51
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,410
I don't want to hear it!

52
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:07,073
You made such a racket in there,
we didn't get to see the whole thing!

53
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,276
I wish we could've stayed a little longer.

54
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:15,733
I could have watched that handsome
Omiji who played Tsukekuro all day long.

55
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:20,365
Oh, of course, he doesn't compare to you, Sasuke.

56
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:24,139
Man, I don't know where you got your
taste in men, Sakura. But it stinks.

57
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,499
Come again!

58
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,382
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,565
What was the question?

60
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:28,564
Humph!

61
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:40,196
I wonder if there's anyone like her out there.

62
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:42,882
I mean, where's my Princess Gale, you know?

63
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:49,072
If I could fight for a girl
like that, I'd be on cloud nine.

64
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:50,556
Whatever.

65
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,199
It was just a movie.

66
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:56,171
It's funny.

67
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,185
I wonder why Kakashi Sensei told us we had to
go see this movie before he'd give us our mission.

68
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:17,972
No way!

69
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,340
Was that the princess?

70
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,643
Ugh!

71
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,524
Agh!

72
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:30,383
Why, you!

73
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,365
Ugh!

74
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:07,740
Huh?

75
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,576
Rrrarh!

76
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,421
Heyah!

77
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,209
Don't let her get away!

78
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:21,945
Not to worry, Princess Gale! I could protect you!

79
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,076
Aah!

80
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,487
Get her!

81
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:39,649
Aah!

82
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:40,829
Ugh!

83
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:43,485
Stay on her! Don't move!

84
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:44,809
We got you now.

85
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,723
We've finally captured her.

86
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:48,514
Feisty one.

87
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,379
Ow!

88
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:52,703
Huh?

89
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:55,188
Who are you?

90
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,758
Huh?

91
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:58,103
Ugh!

92
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:00,668
Where did the princess go?

93
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:01,052
Oh!

94
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,568
Oh, captain?

95
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:14,270
Aarh!

96
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:19,818
Oh, dear.

97
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:20,270
Huh?

98
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,114
Kakashi Sensei!

99
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:25,434
What are you guys doing?

100
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:27,283
Killing time.

101
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:36,296
Gee, huh, I'm really sorry about this.

102
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:37,367
Huh?

103
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,768
This is the gentleman who hired us for our mission today.

104
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,692
Are you hurt, Princess?

105
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,972
This is crazy!

106
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:11,419
So, like, you are the real Princess
Gale, aren't you? I don't believe this!

107
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:15,764
I just saw your movie, and it
totally blew me out of the water!

108
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,567
"I'll never give up."

109
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:21,572
It was so awesome. First, you
had me cheering. Then I was crying.

110
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:22,111
Aakk!

111
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:23,063
Ugh!

112
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:38,424
I mean, after seeing the movie, the
feeling just started to well up inside of me!

113
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:44,815
I'll never give up either!

114
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:48,299
I'm going to work my butt off.
And one day, I'll be the next Hokage.

115
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,793
Oh, right, you probably don't know.
The Hokage is the highest ranking ninja

116
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:53,709
in the Hidden Leaf Village where I come from.

117
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:56,816
Hey, lady, you really know how to handle a horse.

118
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:59,319
No wonder you're the Land of Fire's number 1 actress.

119
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,686
Ha!

120
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:01,827
And I know talent when I see it!

121
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,037
Ngeeh.

122
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:16,051
Hey, lady, aren't we going a little fast?

123
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:21,523
Look out!

124
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:23,271
Ugh!

125
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:25,305
Huh?

126
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:26,957
Huh?

127
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:28,546
It's Princess Gale!

128
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:31,534
Oh, wow! It is her.

129
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:32,592
Princess Gale!

130
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:33,592
Princess Gale!

131
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,349
Oh, look, my name isn't Princess Gale, OK?

132
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,469
Yeah, that's right!

133
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:41,101
You're the actress Yukie Fujikaze. I'm your biggest fan!

134
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:43,922
Can I have your autograph?

135
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:44,510
Yeah, me, too!

136
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:45,583
Here, please!

137
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,467
Forget it, guys. I don't do autographs.

138
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,316
Please.

139
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,323
Come on.

140
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:53,837
Hey, what about me? Can I get one?

141
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:54,673
Please!

142
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:55,448
You're a movie star!

143
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:56,149
Aw, come on!

144
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:57,331
Sign autograph!

145
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:58,690
Enough, already!

146
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:00,503
I mean, come on!

147
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:03,665
What's so special about getting my autograph, huh?

148
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,850
You're just going to shove it in
some drawer and forget about it.

149
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,202
I it's good for is collecting dust.

150
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,737
They're just a waste of time!

151
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,110
They're useless!

152
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:14,962
What a joke!

153
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,704
Ugh, that was so rude.

154
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:21,141
Not like she is in the movies, is she?

155
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:24,338
Her success went right to her head.

156
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:31,821
Our mission is to guard Yukie Fujikaze, the
actress best known for her role as Princess Gale.

157
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:33,711
Guard?

158
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:37,660
Well, maybe not guard her so much as escort her.

159
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,100
The next Princess Gale movie is the
first one that we're shooting abroad.

160
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:46,564
And, uh, I don't need to tell you
our leading lady is a bit of a diva.

161
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,735
Sorry, uh, I do apologize.

162
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:52,524
I'll tell you, these Leaf Ninja are impressive.

163
00:10:52,794 --> 00:10:57,944
Uh, they took care of those stuntmen
turned bodyguards we hired was child's play.

164
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,136
And those are some big fellows.

165
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,772
Oh, well, uh, thank you.

166
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:11,355
Oh, wow!

167
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,587
Look at those cliffs.

168
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:16,194
Uh, that's the Rainbow Glacier in the Land of Snow.

169
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,864
Hey, you played the part of Buriken!

170
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:24,178
That's where we're all going to shoot the
scenes for the film's big climactic ending.

171
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:25,234
You're Hidero!

172
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:26,458
You play Shishimaru!

173
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,215
Land of Snow?

174
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,693
Long way to go to shoot some scene for a movie.

175
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:34,887
Yukie Fujikaze's manager,
Sandayu, over here recommended it.

176
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:40,442
Apparently, he tells us this Rainbow Glacier
turns seven different colors during the springtime.

177
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,953
No, that's just an old legend.

178
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,814
The truth is, there isn't any spring in the Land of Snow.

179
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:47,414
What?

180
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:48,107
Not ever?

181
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:50,492
Does that mean it's winter all year long?

182
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:51,309
Mm hm.

183
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:52,366
You got it.

184
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,423
Kakashi, wasn't it?

185
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:59,125
From what I hear, this won't be your
first time in the Land of Snow. Is that true?

186
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,836
That was a long time ago.

187
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:05,573
They say that it's a very poor nation, too.

188
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,103
Huh!

189
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:13,965
You you, Tsukekuro, Omiji, you were great!

190
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,836
Actually, the story is their
former lord had a thing for gadgets.

191
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:22,524
The guy squandered everything the clan had
on mountains of useless doodads and gizmos.

192
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:25,703
Yeah, well, I just hope they've got central heating.

193
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:28,102
I'm not really all that cut out for the cold.

194
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,192
Maybe you should run for the hills, too.

195
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:31,504
Just like Yukie.

196
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:34,957
Oh, hey, come on, you guys. That's not even funny.

197
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,829
So does that mean, Yukie I mean, she not always like this,

198
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:41,687
is she?

199
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:42,982
Hm.

200
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:45,534
Kind of, yeah.

201
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:52,200
Poor Yukie, huh, she wouldn't even know the
meaning of words like "dreams" or "aspirations."

202
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:55,474
But she's never been one to neglect her work.

203
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,598
I don't know anything about her
personal life, and I don't need to.

204
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:02,912
As long as she's giving her all when the camera's rolling,

205
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:04,683
I won't have any complaints.

206
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:08,298
Say what you will, that woman is a born actress.

207
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:09,767
He's right.

208
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:15,398
And anyway, she only started running from the set
after she heard we were going to the Land of Snow.

209
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:04,904
Aah!

210
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:06,448
Ugh!

211
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:16,273
Oh, all right, already.

212
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,013
Awesome!

213
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:23,264
What's your name?

214
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,107
Naruto Uzumaki!

215
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,222
"Naruto Uzumaki," right?

216
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:27,873
Uh huh.

217
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:32,783
Gosh, lady, you sure do smell nice.

218
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,911
Ow!

219
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,626
What the heck was that?

220
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,051
Pepper spray for stalkers.

221
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:46,731
Ugh!

222
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,385
You freak.

223
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,749
I mean, you've got to be kidding.

224
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:26,372
Who would want to go to the Land of Snow?

225
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:54,727
Ugh!

226
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:58,159
I finally found you, Princess Gale!

227
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:00,741
I told you, kid.

228
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:03,512
I'm not the princess of anything, OK?

229
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:04,338
What?

230
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,698
You think I don't know that!

231
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:09,894
Do you really think you could trample
all over a kid's dreams like this?

232
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:12,811
I don't care how high and mighty an actress you are!

233
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:15,113
I'll never forgive you!

234
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,196
An actress?

235
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,015
High and mighty?

236
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,208
That's a riot.

237
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,921
I can't think of a worse job than being an actor.

238
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:40,013
Only the lowest of the low
would want in on this profession.

239
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:42,261
Huh?

240
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:49,585
We're handed lies put down on
paper and breathe life into them.

241
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,769
It's ridiculous.

242
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,073
Um, are you drunk?

243
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:55,177
Shut up!

244
00:16:55,532 --> 00:16:57,258
Go bug someone else!

245
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:04,729
Ms. Yukie!

246
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:08,161
Our boat to the Land of Snow is about to sail.

247
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,821
Please, we don't have much time.

248
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,298
No, thank you.

249
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,118
Huh?

250
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:15,526
I'm bowing out as a princess.

251
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:16,208
Huh!

252
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:17,531
You, but

253
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:19,401
What on earth are you talking about?

254
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:21,189
Ah, don't worry.

255
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:23,885
It happens all the time, OK?

256
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,990
I mean, lead actresses change from sequel to sequel.

257
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,612
Come on, directors change every five minutes.

258
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:29,493
That's enough!

259
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:31,161
You listen to me!

260
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:36,316
There is nobody on this whole planet who
can play Princess Gale other than you nobody!

261
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:45,765
Besides, if you pull out this late in the
game, you'll never work in this business again.

262
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:47,180
Do you understand me?

263
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:48,832
So?

264
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,387
Who cares?

265
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:51,802
Ms. Yukie?

266
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:56,125
Well, guess there's no other choice.

267
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:56,744
Huh?

268
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,823
So she has the hex crystal.

269
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,198
Splendid.

270
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,887
This film actress Yukie, there's no
question she's really Koyuki Kazahana.

271
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:31,023
I can hardly wait.

272
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,146
It was worth the 10 years it took to find her.

273
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,541
Hah, taking care of one little
girl ought to be a piece of cake.

274
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:41,543
She's not alone.

275
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:44,913
She has Kakashi Hatake as a bodyguard.

276
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:46,612
Kakashi Hatake?

277
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,401
Well, this should be interesting.

278
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:52,554
In the end, it will be a clash of fate.

279
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:12,346
Father?

280
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:14,110
Where are you?

281
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:16,437
Father?

282
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:21,213
Father?

283
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:26,396
Koyuki, come here.

284
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:30,445
Good.

285
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:32,375
Now, stand there.

286
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:34,068
What do you see?

287
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,579
I see you and me.

288
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,583
If you look closely, you'll see the future.

289
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,102
Uh.

290
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,995
Ms. Yukie, are you awake?

291
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:16,643
Sandayu, could you get me some water?

292
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,208
My head won't stop spinning.

293
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:23,114
This is going to sound crazy, but
it feels like the room is swaying.

294
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,708
Actually, it's, uh, not all that crazy.

295
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,176
Huh?

296
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:30,045
Huh!

297
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:34,105
You have got to be kidding me!

298
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,019
I don't know. I don't think I can deal with this lady.

299
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:52,475
What are you talking about,
Naruto? You have to deal with it.

300
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:57,315
You've just sworn to protect her.
Come on, this is an important mission.

301
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:58,345
Mission?

302
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:00,881
Yes, an A rank one.

303
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,787
This is an A rank mission?

304
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:07,823
I don't really think our babysitting a little
pampered actress will be all that difficult.

305
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:09,768
That's not true, Sasuke.

306
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:12,504
Big celebrities are targeted all the time.

307
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:15,729
Besides, it's hard to predict who's after them.

308
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:17,612
Just be on your guard.

309
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:22,221
Light is set.

310
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:23,864
OK, we have speed!

311
00:21:23,911 --> 00:21:25,128
Camera is rolling.

312
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:27,449
All right, folks!

313
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:29,798
I want to get this on the first take!

314
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:30,641
Right!

315
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,987
OK, scene 23, cut 6, take 1.

316
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:35,440
And action!

317
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:38,937
Oh.

318
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:40,412
Huh?

319
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:41,563
Shishimaru!

320
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:42,749
Stay with me!

321
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,830
Uhh, I'm sorry.

322
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,165
I failed you, Princess.

323
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:49,692
Forgive me, I beg you.

324
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,576
How can you say that?

325
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:56,606
Without you at our side, we never would have
found the courage we needed to make it this far.

326
00:21:57,243 --> 00:22:04,231
I only wish I'd seen beyond
the rainbow with you, Princess.

327
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,132
Uhh.

328
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,036
Shishimaru!

329
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:08,616
Whoa.

330
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:09,682
She's amazing!

331
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:13,297
I don't even feel like I'm
looking at the same person anymore.

332
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:14,529
Oh, yes.

333
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,823
That's Yukie for you.

334
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:16,370
Huh?

335
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:19,907
When the camera starts to roll, she comes alive.

336
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,246
There isn't another actress on
earth who can match her brilliance.

337
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,664
Hold on a second, guys.

338
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:32,358
What's wrong?

339
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:35,037
Sandayu, bring me my drops so I can cry.

340
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:35,726
Right, right.

341
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:36,695
Oh, coming, coming.

342
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,064
I have the drops, the drops.

343
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,056
OK.

344
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,032
Now, let's see.

345
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,033
Uh, one there and

346
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:43,813
and now, the other one.

347
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:44,648
Ready?

348
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:46,483
Ugh, they're spilling over.

349
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,962
Come on, let's do this.

350
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:49,231
Ahh, for Pete's sake!

351
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:50,607
Start with the close up.

352
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:51,513
Right.

353
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:52,935
OK.

354
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,358
Scene 23, cut 6, take 2.

355
00:22:55,494 --> 00:22:56,336
Action!

356
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:58,383
Shishimaru!

357
00:23:07,975 --> 00:23:11,096
Mr. Makino, we've got a problem!

358
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:22,673
What is that?

359
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:25,072
When I woke up this morning, I found this waiting for me.

360
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,208
We can't get through!

361
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,662
What are we going to do?

362
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:30,601
This is it!

363
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:33,430
We're changing everything!

364
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:34,329
Ha aah?

365
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:35,497
You moron!

366
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:38,307
Look, we're standing on the perfect spot to shoot!

367
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:40,795
It's practically begging us to film here!

368
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:41,844
Uh, ha aah?

369
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:43,226
Cherish this moment.

370
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:45,752
The movie gods are smiling down on us!

371
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,913
Everyone, prepare to embark!

372
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:48,809
All right, yeah.

373
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:49,308
Clear this up.

374
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,143
Clear the area.

375
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:52,179
Let's try and get some last looks in, people.

376
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,622
All right, people, we're going to roll.

377
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,027
Stand by!

378
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:02,055
OK, scene 36, cut 22.

379
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:03,104
Action!

380
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:07,686
So, Princess, you've arrived!

381
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:08,806
Well done!

382
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:11,222
It's you, Mao!

383
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:13,074
Princess, please, stay back!

384
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:14,759
We'll take care of him for you.

385
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:20,319
Did you honestly believe these meager
fools would be a match for me, Princess?

386
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,612
Huh?

387
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,771
Is this in the scene?

388
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:28,377
Hey!

389
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:30,062
What do you think you're doing?

390
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:31,379
Everyone, get back!

391
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,297
Welcome, friends, to the Land of Snow.

392
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:43,400
You!

393
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:48,844
Greetings, Princess Koyuki.

394
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:52,236
I do hope you're still carrying around the hex crystal.

395
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,960
Princess Koyuki?

396
00:24:59,097 --> 00:24:59,933
Huh!

397
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:04,780
You're as good as they say, Kakashi.

398
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,919
Unfortunately, it's not good enough.

399
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:08,489
Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura.

400
00:25:08,514 --> 00:25:08,918
Huh?

401
00:25:09,284 --> 00:25:11,014
You three protect Yukie.

402
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:13,250
Everyone, get back to the ship!

403
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:14,370
Wha

404
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:15,013
Huh?

405
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:19,420
Fubuki, Mizore, I'll leave the princess to you.

406
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:20,808
Very well, then.

407
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:27,015
It's been a long time, Kakashi.

408
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,217
I hope you're not planning to run like the last time.

409
00:25:31,954 --> 00:25:34,108
Nadare Roga.

410
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,260
I don't know what's in the script, but
I've always wanted to be in the movies!

411
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,965
Don't you worry, Princess.

412
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,795
Naruto Uzumaki's here to save you!

413
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:14,872
Ice Style, Tsubame Blizzard!

414
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:20,299
Fire Style, Fireball Jutsu!

415
00:26:22,718 --> 00:26:23,358
Huh!

416
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:24,094
Hurry!

417
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,632
Back to the ship, everyone!

418
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:27,807
Yukie!

419
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:29,380
Princess!

420
00:26:31,698 --> 00:26:34,085
Sandayu, what are you

421
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:35,332
Ice Prison!

422
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,604
Aaah!

423
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:56,269
Naruto!

424
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:58,578
Water Style, Water Dragon Jutsu!

425
00:27:05,848 --> 00:27:10,821
Keep that camera rolling even if it kills
you! Show the resolve of the cinematographer!

426
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:12,702
Sensei!

427
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,692
There's something strange about their armor!

428
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:15,906
Yeah, I know.

429
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:20,389
Just be careful. It's Chakra Armor
created by the ninja here in the Land of Snow.

430
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:21,953
Chakra Armor?

431
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:25,584
But it's definitely a lot stronger than it used to be.

432
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,636
So you remember.

433
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:31,214
The armor increases the chakra within the body,

434
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:34,363
strengthening a handful of the more useful juts...

435
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:38,106
A chakra barrier gathers around us as well,

436
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:41,696
able to deflect the chakra of our adversaries.

437
00:27:41,805 --> 00:27:46,749
As a result, ninjutsu and genjutsu are rendered useless.

438
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:54,337
Ice Style, Dragon versus Tiger!

439
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:56,410
Water Style, Water Dragon!

440
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:10,759
Out of the way, little girl!

441
00:28:10,828 --> 00:28:11,248
Ugh!

442
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,265
You little brat!

443
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:26,283
What is this chakra?

444
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,340
Ugh!

445
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,395
Yukie, hurry! Get to the ship already!

446
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:00,881
Princess!

447
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:07,699
Father!

448
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:11,560
What are you doing? Get out of here!

449
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,104
Princess, please, we must get to the ship.

450
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:14,725
No.

451
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:17,688
You've got to go now! Your life is...

452
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,420
I don't care if I die!

453
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,915
I won't I won't come back to the Land of Snow!

454
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,021
We don't have time for this, OK?

455
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:26,370
Ugh!

456
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:27,213
Aagh!

457
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:37,907
Sakura!

458
00:29:41,116 --> 00:29:42,205
Princess!

459
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:43,305
Huh?

460
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:46,518
Don't be in such a hurry. We're not finished yet.

461
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:50,073
Ice Style, White Whale Jutsu!

462
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:02,207
OK, that was impressive.

463
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:06,824
Now, it's my turn. Naruto, get everyone out of here!

464
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:10,314
Ice Style, White Whale Jutsu!

465
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:14,285
Still copying my moves, huh?

466
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,700
You're not going to settle this by doing that.

467
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:18,344
Settle the fight?

468
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:21,450
That's not really what I was aiming for at the moment.

469
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:22,500
What?

470
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,296
And cut!

471
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,757
Man, I hope we got all of that.

472
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:06,084
10 years.

473
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:08,238
It's been a long time.

474
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:14,411
The ship pulled into dock a moment ago.

475
00:31:25,491 --> 00:31:28,752
You've known all along, Sandayu, haven't you?

476
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:30,308
Yes.

477
00:31:30,744 --> 00:31:36,107
Didn't you ever consider the risks of what
might happen if she came back to the Land of Snow?

478
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,729
You're right, of course.

479
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:43,384
But this was the only way I could
think to get the princess to return home.

480
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,151
Come on, Sandayu.

481
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,457
You don't have to keep calling her that. I
mean, she's only royalty on the big screen, right?

482
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,722
It's not like she's really a princess.

483
00:31:53,793 --> 00:31:56,111
Actually, she is.

484
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:56,874
Huh?

485
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:00,094
Yukie Fujikaze is only an alias.

486
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:05,376
We're guarding Princess Koyuki Kazahana,
the rightful heir to the Land of Snow's throne.

487
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:09,427
I first met her a long time ago.

488
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:12,784
I was her aide when she was still just a little girl.

489
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:15,224
I don't blame her for not remembering.

490
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:16,682
It was years ago.

491
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:20,139
So does that mean you are also
from the Land of Snow, Sandayu?

492
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:21,815
That's right.

493
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:27,725
I served the princess's father, the former
leader of the clan, Lord Sosetsu Kazahana.

494
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:35,981
The Land of Snow is not a large nation,
but but served as a haven of peace.

495
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:41,701
Lord Sosetsu, he absolutely adored the princess.

496
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:44,949
Ahh, those were idyllic times.

497
00:32:48,963 --> 00:32:53,627
But 10 years ago, on that
cursed day, Lord Sosetsu's younger

498
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:58,100
brother Doto hired a group of
Snow ninja and instigated a revolt.

499
00:32:58,863 --> 00:33:00,514
It was a coup d'etat.

500
00:33:04,757 --> 00:33:08,246
The magnificent Kazahana Castle burned to the ground.

501
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:11,851
And I feared the princess had perished as well.

502
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,278
Keep your face hidden.

503
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:17,915
They could still find us!

504
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,303
There was no way we could defeat them.

505
00:33:25,113 --> 00:33:26,933
We had to keep running.

506
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,720
We had to get away.

507
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:33,292
Father!

508
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:39,792
The day that I discovered our beloved princess was
still alive, I was practically beside myself with joy.

509
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:45,078
She was she was alive after all those years.

510
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:49,178
I should have died back then.

511
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:50,735
Huh?

512
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:57,170
You mustn't say such things, Princess.

513
00:33:57,718 --> 00:33:58,925
We feared the worst.

514
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:01,388
You can't imagine how frantic we all were.

515
00:34:01,448 --> 00:34:03,223
We never stopped praying for your life.

516
00:34:03,787 --> 00:34:07,173
I'm alive, but my heart is dead.

517
00:34:09,332 --> 00:34:13,464
After that day, any tears I had left all dried up.

518
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:22,245
And that's how I came to be
the manager for Yukie Fujikaze.

519
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:27,201
I have bided my time waiting for the day
when I could escort her back to Land of Snow.

520
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:28,185
Uh!

521
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:32,229
So what are you saying then? That all
of this time you've just been using us?

522
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:34,709
Uh, I apologize for deceiving you.

523
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,791
But it was for the sake of the Land of Snow's people.

524
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:47,524
Princess Koyuki, confront Doto and assume
your rightful place as the leader of our land!

525
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:53,904
I will sacrifice my life without
hesitation in order to protect you.

526
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:55,163
I beg you!

527
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:57,780
Take up arms and lead your people!

528
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,558
I don't think so.

529
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:05,860
Huh?

530
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,625
You've got to be kidding.

531
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,390
But what about what your people?

532
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:12,654
I couldn't care less about them.

533
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:13,783
Just forget it!

534
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:15,855
But, Princess.

535
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:18,200
Will you give it up already?

536
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:19,533
Don't be dumb!

537
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,593
It doesn't matter what you do.
You will never get rid of Doto, OK?

538
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:30,696
So what? He should just give up? Quit being so heartless!

539
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:35,812
Can't you see this poor man has given his
entire life to the realization of this dream?

540
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,921
You keep insulting him like that,
and you'll be dealing with me, lady!

541
00:35:40,397 --> 00:35:41,836
Naruto, I

542
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:43,368
Humph.

543
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:47,127
As long as there is hope, one may dream.

544
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:50,630
And with those dreams, the future comes.

545
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:52,560
I like it.

546
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:55,819
It's the perfect theme for our new Princess Gale movie.

547
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:56,436
Uh!

548
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:01,555
But, Mr. Makino, you're not really going to continue
filming with everything that's happened, are you?

549
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:02,779
I told you.

550
00:36:02,946 --> 00:36:04,574
The movie is evolving.

551
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,196
Just think about it.

552
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,669
How often do you get the chance to
make a movie with a real princess?

553
00:36:11,772 --> 00:36:14,227
We're looking at the chance of a lifetime here.

554
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:15,895
You're right.

555
00:36:16,323 --> 00:36:17,420
Think of the buzz.

556
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:19,589
Even the "Making of" will be a hit!

557
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:22,722
We're sitting on a surefire blockbuster!

558
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:23,793
Hey!

559
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,931
Unfortunately, there's only one course of action.

560
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:31,665
Now that Doto is on her trail, running isn't an option.

561
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:33,500
We have to fight.

562
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:36,377
It's our only chance of getting through this.

563
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:39,924
Kakashi Sensei.

564
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,135
OK!

565
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:42,749
Time to continue the mission!

566
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:45,198
The princess returns to the Land of Snow

567
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:47,230
and shows that creep who is boss!

568
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:48,574
Stop joking around!

569
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,361
The movies aren't like real life.

570
00:36:51,678 --> 00:36:54,722
There is no such thing as a happy ending in this world!

571
00:36:54,953 --> 00:36:57,558
Of course, there is! If you're willing to fight for it!

572
00:36:57,644 --> 00:36:58,074
Uh!

573
00:36:59,126 --> 00:37:03,964
Normally, under these circumstances, I'd head
back to the village for a little bit of help.

574
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:04,711
But

575
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,208
It's a waste of time.

576
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:09,184
We're as fine as we can be. It's nothing we can't handle.

577
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:11,790
Oh, thank you all.

578
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:13,511
That's it then.

579
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:15,548
We're going ahead with this picture!

580
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:18,258
And you can bet this one will have a happy ending!

581
00:37:18,317 --> 00:37:19,283
That's right!

582
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:45,915
Hm?

583
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:49,934
Our hideout is not far from here.

584
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,151
It's just beyond this cave.

585
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,123
Once we've finished our shooting here,

586
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,109
we'll pass through to the other side.

587
00:37:58,364 --> 00:38:03,169
Then my people can rest easier.
They'll finally have their princess back.

588
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:15,214
Boy, I can't see the exit at all.

589
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:18,693
Once upon a time, a railroad ran through here.

590
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:20,198
Railroad?

591
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,032
It's covered over with pillars of ice by now.

592
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,623
But dig far enough down, and you'll
find the tracks laying there still.

593
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:27,930
Ahh.

594
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:39,916
All right, people, let's get this show on the road.

595
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:43,521
Ugh, Mr. Makino, we've got a bit of a problem.

596
00:38:43,546 --> 00:38:44,484
What is it now?

597
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,556
Yukie has up and vanished again!

598
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:47,430
What?

599
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:48,861
Huh?

600
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:55,459
Forget it.

601
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:57,539
Absolutely not.

602
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:00,406
Fan out and look for her.

603
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:02,157
Radio in if she turns up.

604
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:03,462
Got it!

605
00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:19,560
Ugh!

606
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,052
Aah!

607
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:20,802
Ugh!

608
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:44,881
If you look closely, you'll see the future.

609
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:50,631
I can't see anything.

610
00:39:51,194 --> 00:39:52,671
Of course, you can.

611
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,035
When the spring comes, you will.

612
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:57,344
The spring?

613
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:01,835
You're a liar, Father.

614
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,767
There is no spring in this land.

615
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:21,521
Jeez, how many times are you
going to run away from your fate?

616
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,624
Come on, everyone's waiting.

617
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,274
Why?

618
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,184
Why do you always come looking for me?

619
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,800
Because it's my mission.

620
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:43,049
It doesn't matter how much you hate it,

621
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,092
I'll keep coming after you.

622
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:50,386
Just try to hide.

623
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,211
I'm going to find you.

624
00:40:56,916 --> 00:41:02,541
You can drag me back if you like, but
all I'm going to do is act for the camera.

625
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,709
And that's it, you got me?

626
00:41:05,237 --> 00:41:06,116
Hah!

627
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:11,750
Huh?

628
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:23,301
What is that?

629
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:24,634
Huh?

630
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:28,052
It's chakra.

631
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,756
There's chakra running through the rails, melting the ice.

632
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:36,587
It must be him.

633
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,038
Everyone hurry!

634
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,582
You must get out of here!

635
00:41:41,607 --> 00:41:43,721
You can't let them find you! 's not safe!

636
00:41:43,832 --> 00:41:44,658
Sandayu?

637
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:46,000
Where are you going?

638
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,860
It's a train.

639
00:41:56,043 --> 00:41:56,842
Train?

640
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:58,822
What do you mean a train?

641
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:07,245
Oh, that train!

642
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:16,603
It's gaining on us!

643
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:17,840
Not, if I can help it!

644
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:18,988
We'll never make it!

645
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:20,760
I'm not giving up, lady!

646
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:22,596
There's no way you can do this!

647
00:42:22,628 --> 00:42:24,582
Will you just shut up already?

648
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:30,531
Ah!

649
00:42:30,556 --> 00:42:33,212
Uh, this is going to be pointless! Just give up!

650
00:42:33,237 --> 00:42:34,321
This isn't over!

651
00:42:35,316 --> 00:42:40,893
I'll be dead before I'm going to give up, even if
you're ready to call it quits, I'm not giving up ever!

652
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,281
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

653
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:49,911
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!!!

654
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:07,606
Ugh!

655
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:08,098
Ugh!

656
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:36,651
It's been a long time, Koyuki.

657
00:43:38,786 --> 00:43:39,806
I knew it.

658
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:41,331
It's Doto.

659
00:43:42,428 --> 00:43:44,398
It's been 10 years.

660
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,584
Come now, don't be shy.

661
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:48,616
Let's get a look at that face.

662
00:43:54,813 --> 00:43:55,577
Hm.

663
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:13,709
There you have it, men!

664
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,482
Our beloved Princess Koyuki is here to watch over us!

665
00:44:17,815 --> 00:44:21,366
With her at our side, victory is ours!

666
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:24,663
What the

667
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:25,924
Sandayu?

668
00:44:28,397 --> 00:44:29,781
Hear me, Doto.

669
00:44:29,858 --> 00:44:33,070
We've waited a long time for
this day of reckoning to come.

670
00:44:33,528 --> 00:44:41,053
Sandayu Asama and 50 loyal warriors stand before
you to avenge our great fallen leader, Lord Sosetsu.

671
00:44:41,355 --> 00:44:44,343
On this day, you will breathe no more!

672
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:54,395
Hm, I thought you destroyed the last of the insurgents.

673
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:55,880
My apologies.

674
00:44:55,968 --> 00:44:58,088
We'll get rid of them immediately.

675
00:44:58,893 --> 00:44:59,891
No.

676
00:45:00,383 --> 00:45:06,724
With men such as these, there is little that
they can understand other than total annihilation.

677
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:09,647
Sandayu.

678
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,810
Huh?

679
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,337
Hold it, Sasuke!

680
00:46:59,406 --> 00:47:00,576
Don't be hasty.

681
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:16,050
Awful.

682
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:20,634
That's what comes of never giving up.

683
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:26,044
If they hadn't stood up to Doto, then
none of this bloodshed would have happened.

684
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:44,366
My Princess, please forgive me, I I never
should have gotten you involved in all of this.

685
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:50,347
It's just that every single one of us here,

686
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:58,041
we are able to keep believing in spite of
everything because we knew you are alive.

687
00:47:59,303 --> 00:48:02,616
When you were little, uhh, and even now,

688
00:48:03,236 --> 00:48:04,883
you have always been

689
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:10,222
just as I, your loyal Sandayu, believed,

690
00:48:12,564 --> 00:48:15,421
so, too, must you believe in yourself.

691
00:48:15,712 --> 00:48:19,541
You have always been our purest hope, Princess.

692
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:26,115
Please do not waste your tears on me.

693
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:28,188
Ahh.

694
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:38,072
You are such a fool, Sandayu.

695
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:40,177
I can't cry.

696
00:48:40,415 --> 00:48:42,274
You have my eye drops.

697
00:48:45,652 --> 00:48:47,565
Are you all satisfied?

698
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:50,028
Let's go back.

699
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:54,247
If you stay here, your lives will be in jeopardy.

700
00:48:55,874 --> 00:48:57,449
Let's go home already.

701
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:00,468
Go home to where?

702
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:04,816
I thought this was your home, wasn't it?

703
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,220
What the heck do you need to
go back to? Your place is here!

704
00:49:08,402 --> 00:49:10,946
Now, face Doto and put your house in order!

705
00:49:12,057 --> 00:49:14,162
You know absolutely nothing.

706
00:49:15,344 --> 00:49:17,667
Spring doesn't come to this country.

707
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:23,172
Our tears have frozen over and
our hearts hardened with the cold.

708
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:27,017
But aren't you the only one with the power to change that?

709
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:34,454
I mean, at least at least, that's
what Sandayu believed anyway, wasn't it?

710
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,712
I've had enough of this nonsense.

711
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:41,803
Hey, hold on a minute!

712
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:45,366
Leave me alone already!

713
00:49:47,131 --> 00:49:47,941
Huh?

714
00:49:59,578 --> 00:50:00,275
Careful!

715
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:09,301
Sakura, where's Naruto?

716
00:50:09,362 --> 00:50:09,999
Huh?

717
00:50:10,692 --> 00:50:12,383
Oh, you're kidding me, he didn't!

718
00:50:18,129 --> 00:50:21,918
Ugh, come on! You didn't think
I'd let you get away that easy?

719
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:25,006
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

720
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,277
You've grown quite beautiful, Koyuki.

721
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:36,076
Tell me, little princess, do
you have the hex crystal with you?

722
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:37,351
Yes.

723
00:50:37,713 --> 00:50:38,888
Good.

724
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:42,368
It is the sole remaining link to the Kazahana Clan

725
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:46,245
and the key to opening its treasure.

726
00:50:47,866 --> 00:50:49,780
The key to what?

727
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:54,372
When I wrested this land from your father's hands,

728
00:50:54,737 --> 00:50:58,520
the Kazahana Clan's resources were all but gone.

729
00:50:58,901 --> 00:51:02,603
I knew Sosetsu must have hidden his riches somewhere.

730
00:51:03,316 --> 00:51:08,411
I searched for a long time, and finally, I found it.

731
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:12,050
It is hidden deep within the Rainbow Glacier.

732
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:16,689
There's a keyhole there which can
only be opened by the hex crystal.

733
00:51:18,683 --> 00:51:21,973
Once I have possession over the Kazahana fortune,

734
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:28,010
our country can attain military
superiority over the five great nations!

735
00:51:28,257 --> 00:51:29,978
Not going to happen!

736
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:33,508
You!

737
00:51:33,994 --> 00:51:36,009
How on earth did you get in here?

738
00:51:36,184 --> 00:51:39,205
Heh, never underestimate a ninja!

739
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:45,401
Ugh!

740
00:51:51,216 --> 00:51:52,640
My apologies.

741
00:51:53,098 --> 00:51:56,358
As you can see, the little runt was kind of a handful.

742
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,639
Well, he knows the Multi Shadow Clone juts...

743
00:52:00,308 --> 00:52:05,915
I'll tell you, I don't know who this brat is,
but his level of chakra is nothing to sniff at.

744
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:07,418
What do you think?

745
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,315
Maybe we should try that contraption out on him?

746
00:52:10,412 --> 00:52:10,991
Hm.

747
00:52:11,405 --> 00:52:14,741
He would make for an interesting test subject.

748
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:26,920
Ugh!

749
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,632
Aargh!

750
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:32,768
Agh!

751
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:33,556
What is that?

752
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:36,012
We're cleansing him of his chakra.

753
00:52:36,242 --> 00:52:41,669
That device will absorb any that's stored in
his body and bind it within a powerful barrier.

754
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:45,403
Once it's been activated, it
cannot be broken or destroyed,

755
00:52:45,865 --> 00:52:47,141
no matter what.

756
00:52:50,256 --> 00:52:53,148
My strength, it's starting to slip away.

757
00:52:56,235 --> 00:52:59,552
Not looking like much of a ninja anymore, are you?

758
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,752
Just a little kid.

759
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,051
You dirty ugh.

760
00:53:10,072 --> 00:53:15,116
Now then, I'll take the hex crystal, if you don't mind.

761
00:53:27,653 --> 00:53:29,082
Oh.

762
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:33,223
Hm?

763
00:53:33,892 --> 00:53:35,386
What is this?

764
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:37,451
Ugh!

765
00:53:37,573 --> 00:53:38,826
This isn't a game!

766
00:53:38,907 --> 00:53:41,273
Do you think I don't know this is a fake?

767
00:53:41,788 --> 00:53:43,544
No, that's impossible!

768
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:49,887
Kakashi Hatake.

769
00:53:50,315 --> 00:53:51,260
What?

770
00:53:51,785 --> 00:53:52,922
Makes sense.

771
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:57,156
Kakashi's a shrewd one. I wouldn't put
it past him to pull a bait and switch.

772
00:53:57,204 --> 00:54:00,517
Don't even worry about it. We'll
have him rounded up in no time.

773
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:02,427
That won't be necessary.

774
00:54:02,514 --> 00:54:03,019
Huh?

775
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:04,281
Ugh!

776
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:10,478
Why even bother. The man will
show up on his own soon enough.

777
00:54:11,035 --> 00:54:14,395
Until then, we just have to wait.

778
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:35,281
Ugh!

779
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:40,683
Ugh!

780
00:54:41,284 --> 00:54:41,786
Uh!

781
00:54:44,556 --> 00:54:45,123
Terrific.

782
00:54:45,641 --> 00:54:46,920
I don't have any power.

783
00:54:47,372 --> 00:54:51,028
Guess I should have spent a little
more time working on the Escape Jutsu.

784
00:55:10,756 --> 00:55:15,529
These guys don't know who they're dealing with. A
real ninja finds a way, with or without his chakra.

785
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:16,749
Hm?

786
00:55:49,795 --> 00:55:51,296
Serves you right.

787
00:55:51,623 --> 00:55:52,320
Yeah?

788
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,433
You, too.

789
00:55:54,554 --> 00:55:55,459
I know.

790
00:55:57,612 --> 00:55:58,938
"No spring."

791
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:02,730
You said there was no spring.

792
00:56:03,038 --> 00:56:04,147
What did you mean?

793
00:56:09,009 --> 00:56:11,344
"You'll see when spring comes, Koyuki,"

794
00:56:11,884 --> 00:56:13,600
my father used to say that.

795
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:17,437
Father, what is spring?

796
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,360
Oh, that's right.

797
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:22,063
You've never felt spring, have you, Koyuki?

798
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:23,198
Mm mm.

799
00:56:23,821 --> 00:56:26,733
Koyuki, close your eyes.

800
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:32,404
Try to imagine yourself surround with flowers.

801
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:38,539
There now, isn't it beautiful?

802
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:41,816
Now, run through it as fast as you can.

803
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:48,932
Well?

804
00:56:49,465 --> 00:56:52,493
It makes you feel all warm and happy, doesn't it?

805
00:56:52,888 --> 00:56:54,256
Mm hm.

806
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:55,869
That is spring.

807
00:56:57,315 --> 00:57:04,401
And if you never give up, if you believe
in the future, then spring is sure to come.

808
00:57:07,461 --> 00:57:09,470
But this land has no spring.

809
00:57:10,702 --> 00:57:11,980
My father died.

810
00:57:12,902 --> 00:57:15,095
I fled from the Land of Snow.

811
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:16,920
And I stopped believing.

812
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:20,609
I was always running, always lying to people.

813
00:57:20,807 --> 00:57:23,325
But mostly, I was just lying to myself.

814
00:57:23,897 --> 00:57:26,208
My life has been one big charade.

815
00:57:27,052 --> 00:57:31,588
Becoming an actress was about the only
thing I was cut out for in this world.

816
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:53,207
That's not going to change anything, you know?

817
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:12,956
Aah!

818
00:58:16,476 --> 00:58:17,346
Told you.

819
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:20,268
In the end, all you can do is give up.

820
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:29,674
I bet it's a lot easier once you've given up.

821
00:58:33,132 --> 00:58:35,322
No one ever cared about me before.

822
00:58:36,108 --> 00:58:38,380
And I just try to blow it off, you know.

823
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:40,906
But it was still pretty rough.

824
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:45,395
I used to think there was no place in this world for me.

825
00:58:46,464 --> 00:58:50,566
But aagh!

826
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:58,546
But I still found friends.

827
00:59:01,176 --> 00:59:03,059
I kept at it and didn't give up.

828
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:05,270
And good things happened.

829
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,635
Aagh!

830
00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:15,214
When you give up your dreams
and everything else, they're gone!

831
00:59:15,576 --> 00:59:16,480
Rrrh!

832
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,592
Stop!

833
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:27,490
Your father and

834
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:29,482
Sandayu.

835
00:59:31,012 --> 00:59:35,244
I'm going to show you that they weren't

836
00:59:36,347 --> 00:59:37,261
wrong!

837
00:59:37,515 --> 00:59:38,385
Rrrh!

838
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:39,207
Ugh!

839
00:59:39,604 --> 00:59:41,169
Huh?

840
00:59:41,763 --> 00:59:42,938
Naruto.

841
00:59:45,912 --> 00:59:47,057
Aagh!

842
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:52,974
Uh!

843
00:59:59,816 --> 01:00:02,699
Now, I'm just going to get you out.

844
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:04,137
Ugh.

845
01:00:30,222 --> 01:00:31,595
We're under attack!

846
01:00:32,486 --> 01:00:34,228
Hm, Kakashi.

847
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:38,867
So you're here at last and right on time.

848
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:48,024
Huh?

849
01:00:48,049 --> 01:00:49,991
Hey, when did he

850
01:00:57,794 --> 01:00:58,206
Uh!

851
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:06,021
Heh, told them not to underestimate a ninja.

852
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:09,628
Hm.

853
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:27,291
Rrh!

854
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:29,454
Hold it!

855
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:30,486
Hold it, Naruto!

856
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:31,590
It's me.

857
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:34,908
Kakashi Sensei!

858
01:01:35,115 --> 01:01:36,666
Sorry to keep you waiting.

859
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,112
You look all right, Princess.

860
01:01:39,287 --> 01:01:39,885
Yeah.

861
01:01:40,923 --> 01:01:44,761
You switched my hex crystal for a
fake without telling me, didn't you?

862
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:45,937
Yeah.

863
01:01:45,992 --> 01:01:47,852
I apologize for that.

864
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:50,592
But I figured this was what he was after.

865
01:01:55,182 --> 01:01:56,888
All for this thing, huh?

866
01:01:58,922 --> 01:02:01,051
This place is crawling with guards!

867
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:01,988
Sakura!

868
01:02:02,082 --> 01:02:02,948
Sasuke!

869
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:03,932
This way.

870
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:28,737
Doto!

871
01:02:28,873 --> 01:02:31,573
Well done, Koyuki.

872
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,410
Wha

873
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:37,079
Wait!

874
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:40,455
It can't be.

875
01:02:45,126 --> 01:02:47,240
This shouldn't be a surprise to any of you.

876
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:50,124
I mean, really, I'm an actress, aren't I?

877
01:02:50,164 --> 01:02:51,594
There you have it.

878
01:02:51,657 --> 01:02:56,965
Another brilliant performance by the great Yukie Fujikaze.

879
01:03:03,429 --> 01:03:06,339
Yes, it was all an act.

880
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,927
Ugh!

881
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,090
I told you, didn't I?

882
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,219
I'm an actress!

883
01:03:13,702 --> 01:03:14,164
Uh!

884
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:15,871
You wretched

885
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:16,096
Aagh!

886
01:03:16,295 --> 01:03:17,200
Princess!

887
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:26,671
Uhh, I always knew, Naruto, that if I ever
return to this country, I was going to die here.

888
01:03:27,383 --> 01:03:29,315
At least, I could

889
01:03:32,533 --> 01:03:33,711
Don't you do it!

890
01:03:33,785 --> 01:03:35,176
Don't you stop fighting!

891
01:03:35,756 --> 01:03:44,237
Naruto, it's only thanks to you that I
could stop running away here at the end.

892
01:03:44,499 --> 01:03:45,110
No!

893
01:03:45,304 --> 01:03:47,514
Because all you're doing is running away!

894
01:03:47,836 --> 01:03:50,130
Don't throw away your life like this!

895
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:54,879
I'm sorry, Father, Sandayu.

896
01:04:05,853 --> 01:04:07,076
Koyuki!

897
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,287
Aagh!

898
01:04:16,897 --> 01:04:21,116
You really thought you could kill
me, did you with this little toy?

899
01:04:22,131 --> 01:04:22,572
Humph.

900
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:31,741
That's right.

901
01:04:31,795 --> 01:04:35,083
It's Chakra Armor, our latest prototype.

902
01:04:35,658 --> 01:04:36,538
Uhh.

903
01:04:40,296 --> 01:04:43,302
Don't you touch her with those filthy hands of yours!

904
01:04:44,286 --> 01:04:45,420
Ugh!

905
01:04:47,658 --> 01:04:48,711
Naruto!

906
01:04:48,766 --> 01:04:50,308
You're wasting your time.

907
01:04:50,727 --> 01:04:54,090
Every ounce of your chakra
has been completely sealed away.

908
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,376
Come, let us go, Koyuki, beyond the rainbow.

909
01:05:04,932 --> 01:05:05,380
No!

910
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:33,990
Naruto!

911
01:05:40,332 --> 01:05:40,705
Hm.

912
01:05:53,481 --> 01:05:55,070
This ain't over.

913
01:05:56,968 --> 01:05:58,778
I'm not going to go!

914
01:05:59,534 --> 01:06:00,555
Do you hear me?

915
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:05,567
You could run, but you can't hide.

916
01:06:05,848 --> 01:06:08,001
I'll follow you as long as I have to.

917
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,432
Rrrharrh!

918
01:06:13,624 --> 01:06:14,093
Huh?

919
01:06:19,045 --> 01:06:19,855
Hop on!

920
01:06:21,348 --> 01:06:21,897
Huh.

921
01:06:33,482 --> 01:06:34,474
This is it.

922
01:06:34,809 --> 01:06:36,943
We've come here after all, I guess.

923
01:07:08,002 --> 01:07:09,575
Sakura, how close are they?

924
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,481
Hold on a sec.

925
01:07:17,155 --> 01:07:20,714
I've got it! 20 degrees left in 5 seconds, 30 meters out.

926
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,773
You want to aim for that branch!

927
01:07:22,886 --> 01:07:23,463
Right!

928
01:07:25,576 --> 01:07:27,538
Give it up. It's useless.

929
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:36,858
Come on, don't make me laugh.

930
01:07:48,117 --> 01:07:49,848
Sakura Blizzard Jutsu!

931
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,332
Enjoy!

932
01:08:01,049 --> 01:08:03,331
You're dealing with a ninja of the snow here.

933
01:08:03,418 --> 01:08:05,514
It will take more than that to bring us down.

934
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:06,507
You're probably right.

935
01:08:06,532 --> 01:08:06,937
Uh!

936
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:09,329
Lions Barrage!

937
01:08:18,848 --> 01:08:19,276
Aagh!

938
01:08:19,301 --> 01:08:20,348
Aargh!

939
01:08:28,112 --> 01:08:29,212
What just happened?

940
01:08:29,366 --> 01:08:30,916
Gosh, I'm not really sure.

941
01:08:31,249 --> 01:08:33,195
Wait, you don't think that they

942
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:42,524
You really think you've got a shot?

943
01:08:42,707 --> 01:08:45,789
Maybe you ought to turn tail and run, like the last time.

944
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:47,941
I don't have a choice, do I?

945
01:08:48,004 --> 01:08:50,866
At least, I could show you one of my original techniques.

946
01:08:53,098 --> 01:08:54,289
Lightning Blade!

947
01:08:55,584 --> 01:08:58,254
Ice Style, Wolf Fang Avalanche!

948
01:09:03,656 --> 01:09:04,722
How did you

949
01:09:12,506 --> 01:09:14,079
Almost had me there.

950
01:09:17,131 --> 01:09:18,378
What?

951
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:23,661
Even without ninjutsu and
genjutsu, a ninja always has taijutsu!

952
01:09:23,803 --> 01:09:25,892
You rely too much on this armor!

953
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:48,607
I don't see it.

954
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,474
The treasure, where is it?

955
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:04,902
It's so warm.

956
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:06,594
What is this?

957
01:10:07,874 --> 01:10:09,350
A heat generator?

958
01:10:09,874 --> 01:10:12,634
This is the hidden treasure of the Kazahana Clan?

959
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:13,975
Koyuki!

960
01:10:24,203 --> 01:10:25,098
Naruto!

961
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,197
Rrrh!

962
01:10:28,555 --> 01:10:31,383
Ice Style Black Dragon Blizzard!

963
01:10:38,008 --> 01:10:38,888
Huh!

964
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:40,853
Naruto!

965
01:10:51,254 --> 01:10:56,667
What's the matter I hardly felt a thing there?

966
01:10:58,549 --> 01:10:59,639
Naruto, that's enough!

967
01:10:59,883 --> 01:11:03,401
If you don't stop, he's going to kill you!

968
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,141
Trust me.

969
01:11:06,549 --> 01:11:12,752
If you just have a little faith in me, I promise you,

970
01:11:13,759 --> 01:11:15,619
I won't lose!

971
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,765
How the... is it is it possible
that the chakra is leaking out somehow?

972
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:28,061
Hrrrh.

973
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:31,287
Rrrh!

974
01:11:31,946 --> 01:11:32,963
Die!

975
01:11:58,005 --> 01:11:58,652
Rrrh!

976
01:11:58,677 --> 01:12:00,128
Chidori!

977
01:12:04,595 --> 01:12:05,911
Agh!

978
01:12:06,332 --> 01:12:07,244
Hah!

979
01:12:07,668 --> 01:12:11,832
Did you really think your pitiful
little jutsu would have an effect on me?

980
01:12:13,349 --> 01:12:17,147
Naruto, his armor has been fractured.

981
01:12:17,615 --> 01:12:21,787
The rest is up to you.

982
01:12:22,478 --> 01:12:25,153
Naruto!

983
01:12:33,545 --> 01:12:35,816
Come on, Nine Tailed Fox.

984
01:12:36,655 --> 01:12:39,446
Where the heck are you when I really need you!

985
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:44,127
Show some guts, will you?

986
01:12:59,431 --> 01:13:00,565
What is that?

987
01:13:03,971 --> 01:13:04,693
Huh!

988
01:13:06,428 --> 01:13:08,128
It's payback time!

989
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,210
With interest, pal!

990
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:17,294
Come on, you little halfwit, quit! Dragon Blizzard!

991
01:13:36,628 --> 01:13:37,768
It's over.

992
01:13:38,693 --> 01:13:42,165
This ridiculous little farce is over!

993
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:54,035
Huh?

994
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,782
Not yet, it's not!

995
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,736
I told you already!

996
01:14:01,495 --> 01:14:04,926
It ain't over till justice prevails and evil is wiped out!

997
01:14:04,992 --> 01:14:08,295
Every good story's got to have a happy ending.

998
01:14:10,432 --> 01:14:11,751
Naruto!

999
01:14:12,587 --> 01:14:14,229
I believe in you!

1000
01:14:15,009 --> 01:14:20,411
You are by far the strongest ninja I've ever known!

1001
01:14:20,814 --> 01:14:21,951
Yeah, I know.

1002
01:14:22,126 --> 01:14:23,731
I could have told you that!

1003
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:41,076
Look, Rainbow Chakra!

1004
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,831
It's just like in the movie!

1005
01:14:49,592 --> 01:14:50,594
Take this!

1006
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:53,383
Rasengan!

1007
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,693
Aaah!

1008
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,268
Huh?

1009
01:15:22,325 --> 01:15:23,237
What the

1010
01:15:23,516 --> 01:15:28,821
Wait a minute. Could this be we're making this movie 3D!

1011
01:15:32,135 --> 01:15:33,954
Believe in the future.

1012
01:15:34,264 --> 01:15:37,905
If you do, the spring will surely come.

1013
01:15:39,533 --> 01:15:42,527
What will you do when it comes, Koyuki?

1014
01:15:43,878 --> 01:15:47,254
I'm going to become a princess.

1015
01:15:47,984 --> 01:15:48,766
Oh?

1016
01:15:48,988 --> 01:15:50,766
What sort of princess?

1017
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,345
Um, let's see.

1018
01:15:53,363 --> 01:15:57,407
One who is strong and who is kind,

1019
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:01,110
and most of all, one who fights for justice.

1020
01:16:03,453 --> 01:16:04,891
That's some dream.

1021
01:16:05,502 --> 01:16:08,761
Did I did I actually say those things?

1022
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:17,213
Well, so long as you believe in your dream and
never give up, one day, you'll be that princess.

1023
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,376
You can see it, can't you?

1024
01:16:28,796 --> 01:16:32,627
There's a beautiful princess
standing right there in front of you.

1025
01:16:45,316 --> 01:16:48,389
But I have sort of a problem.

1026
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,750
There's something else I want to be.

1027
01:16:51,012 --> 01:16:51,456
Really?

1028
01:16:51,798 --> 01:16:52,394
What's that?

1029
01:16:53,515 --> 01:16:54,984
An actress.

1030
01:16:55,378 --> 01:16:56,073
What?

1031
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,603
Oh, yeah.

1032
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:11,469
Now, that's a happy ending.

1033
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:45,692
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1034
01:17:47,382 --> 01:17:51,325
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1035
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:58,243
Force of nature, unrelenting, can never fall!

1036
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:00,341
And it's supersonic!

1037
01:18:00,373 --> 01:18:01,716
It will charge!

1038
01:18:01,962 --> 01:18:03,574
Invincible!

1039
01:18:03,654 --> 01:18:05,600
Here we go!

1040
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:10,518
There's always something steering the path I lead.

1041
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:16,676
There's always someone ticking and kicking inside of me.

1042
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:20,504
I I will never give up!

1043
01:18:21,878 --> 01:18:26,335
I I will never give up!

1044
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:32,281
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1045
01:18:33,957 --> 01:18:38,048
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1046
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:44,928
Ever changing and evolving, life renewed.

1047
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:50,106
From a fire, flies a phoenix born into.

1048
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:52,214
Here we go!

1049
01:18:52,299 --> 01:18:56,989
The days of darkness, trawling the battlefields.

1050
01:18:57,862 --> 01:19:02,853
Remember your true friend,
call on and put your trust in me.

1051
01:19:02,956 --> 01:19:07,260
I I will never give up.

1052
01:19:08,722 --> 01:19:14,450
I I will never give up, will never give up, yeah.

1053
01:19:14,644 --> 01:19:17,215
Like a hurricane, like a hurricane.

1054
01:19:18,509 --> 01:19:20,035
Like jerks.

1055
01:19:20,067 --> 01:19:23,053
Hurricane, like a hurricane.

1056
01:19:24,071 --> 01:19:25,596
Lightning strikes.

1057
01:19:25,621 --> 01:19:27,807
In like a hurricane.

1058
01:19:31,143 --> 01:19:33,415
In like a hurricane.

1059
01:19:42,576 --> 01:19:44,663
In like a hurricane.

1060
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:28,028
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1061
01:20:29,681 --> 01:20:33,804
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1062
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:37,530
Oh, whoa, oh

1063
01:20:37,697 --> 01:20:41,708
That generator wasn't even fully developed in the end.

1064
01:20:42,231 --> 01:20:44,623
I guess it will be back to winter soon, huh?

1065
01:20:44,864 --> 01:20:45,734
Not really.

1066
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:48,913
If we take what we know and continue researching,

1067
01:20:49,509 --> 01:20:53,799
before you know it, the Land of
Snow will be called the Land of Spring.

1068
01:20:53,893 --> 01:20:56,460
Yeah, but it's kind of a shame.

1069
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,265
You're such a big star. Are you
really going to retire from acting?

1070
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,433
Who said I was retiring?

1071
01:21:02,616 --> 01:21:03,324
Huh?

1072
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:06,574
Ruling over the Land of Snow and acting?

1073
01:21:06,693 --> 01:21:08,409
I think I can handle both.

1074
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:12,001
I mean, I'd have to be out of my mind to give it up now.

1075
01:21:12,197 --> 01:21:13,899
Uh, that's great.

1076
01:21:14,185 --> 01:21:15,830
Well, I'll be seeing you.

1077
01:21:19,816 --> 01:21:20,454
That's her!

1078
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:21,522
There she is!

1079
01:21:21,547 --> 01:21:23,951
Princess, sign here!

1080
01:21:24,057 --> 01:21:24,597
Sure!

1081
01:21:24,657 --> 01:21:25,573
Can I have your autograph?

1082
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:26,319
Would you please sign

1083
01:21:26,344 --> 01:21:27,961
That is great.

1084
01:21:28,512 --> 01:21:30,776
She's perfect.

1085
01:21:32,341 --> 01:21:33,436
Aaagh!

1086
01:21:33,746 --> 01:21:37,092
I'm so stupid. I should have gotten an autograph!

1087
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:38,800
Don't worry, I took care of it.

1088
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:40,347
Huh?

1089
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:43,670
Whoa.

1090
01:21:50,192 --> 01:21:51,208
Aagh!

1091
01:21:52,179 --> 01:21:54,705
Oh, man, look at me.

1092
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,582
Couldn't you, at least, have
used a better picture or something?

1093
01:21:59,064 --> 01:21:59,878
Haay.

1094
01:22:06,106 --> 01:22:07,678
And cut!

1095
01:22:07,942 --> 01:22:08,855
That's a wrap.

1096
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,452
Good stuff people! Thanks a million.

1097
01:22:11,477 --> 01:22:13,923
Hey, let's do lunch, seriously.

1098
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:15,633
Nice working with you, buddy.

1099
01:22:15,658 --> 01:22:16,777
Isn't that wonderful?
