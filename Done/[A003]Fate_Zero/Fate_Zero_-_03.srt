1
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,303
Well, everything went smoothly.

2
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:13,840
These games of yours are tiresome and tedious
and squander my precious time, Tokiomi.

3
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,793
I am very grateful, Your Highness.

4
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:23,468
King of all Kings, Gilgamesh.

5
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:28,115
Your deeds tonight will establish your prowess as king

6
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:32,067
and they will reveal which of our
foes we must hunt and eliminate.

7
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:37,190
I ask only that you stay your hand
for just a little while longer.

8
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,132
Very well.

9
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:44,928
For the time being, I shall amuse myself
with simple reconnaissance.

10
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:49,245
This age truly fascinates me.

11
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:52,597
I take that to mean the modern
world is to your liking?

12
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:58,449
It's unspeakably ugly, but that is fine
in its own way.

13
00:00:58,753 --> 00:01:04,496
The important thing is whether any of the
treasures available here are truly worthy of me.

14
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:10,432
Of course, if I find there is nothing in
this world that deserves my adoration,

15
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,085
you will pay dearly for summoning me.

16
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:16,372
Of that, you can be certain, Tokiomi.

17
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:22,573
Worry not; the Holy Grail is surely an
item fit to please the King of Heroes.

18
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:25,756
That will be for me to ultimately determine
and me alone.

19
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:30,383
No matter, I'll play along with
your little schemes for the moment.

20
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:33,767
Everything of value in this world belongs to me,

21
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:38,574
so I can assure you, no matter how
precious this grail of yours may be,

22
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:42,875
I will never let a lowly mongrel
even touch it without my consent.

23
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:46,259
Tokiomi, I'll leave the details to you.

24
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:58,286
My, my, honestly,

25
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:02,395
I'm amazed Gilgamesh materialized
within the archer class

26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,503
considering their reputation for solo combat skills.

27
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,188
Well, I can let Kirei handle things from here.

28
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:16,297
For now, everything is
proceeding according to plan.

29
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:53,930
Assassin was killed?

30
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:57,327
Hey, Rider, this is big news!

31
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:59,327
One of the seven is already out!

32
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:04,257
Hey.

33
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:12,460
Come on, don't you get it?

34
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,264
Assassin was killed!

35
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:15,630
Mm‐hmm.

36
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:18,755
Rider, the Holy Grail War has started!

37
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,795
I've been out gathering information day after
day after day after day, every single damn day!

38
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,965
You sit around eating cookies watching stuff on the VCR!

39
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,737
You're worse than a
familiar, worse than a rat!

40
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:34,355
And I told you that I always want you to
take spirit form when I don't need you.

41
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,924
I'm giving you all the manna while you're
doing nothing but eating and watching!

42
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,283
Quit your whining.

43
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:42,096
Nobody cares if Assassin is dead or alive.

44
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:45,410
The only thing he's good at is
skulking around in the shadows.

45
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,610
He could never pose a threat to me.

46
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:51,585
Anyway, boy, here, this is what matters!

47
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:54,972
This, the big black thing they call a B‐2!

48
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,452
It's wonderful!

49
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,476
I'm thinking about buying 10 or so.

50
00:04:58,705 --> 00:04:59,776
What do you think?

51
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:05,096
For that much money, it'd be faster to
just buy the whole country outright.

52
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:07,690
Oh, I see.

53
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:10,803
So, the question is where to procure the money.

54
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:17,403
Were there some major city nearby, such as Persepolis,
we could simply plunder it and get what we need.

55
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:23,160
For the moment, I think that the biggest
obstacle for us will be this Clinton guy.

56
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:26,490
He will prove a more formidable
opponent than Darius III.

57
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,950
Well, regardless of all that, I think it's a pretty good
thing that Assassin was eliminated right off the bat.

58
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:36,906
I mean, aren't you the type who
prefers to face his enemy head‐on?

59
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:43,351
So, it's good news for us that the guy who uses sneak
attacks and devious tricks to fight his battles is out.

60
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,688
We could get some good use from
these Tomahawk things, too.

61
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:49,996
Saber, Lancer, Archer, the three great knight classes,

62
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,737
not to mention the Berserker,
whose sole skill is to break things,

63
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:56,200
are gonna be toast when you use
that noble phantasm of yours.

64
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:58,078
That just leaves Caster to worry about.

65
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:00,579
If we could only find out what
his true identity is, we could...

66
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:02,538
How was Assassin taken down?

67
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:03,418
Huh?

68
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:04,572
Tell me.

69
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:06,666
Who was it that defeated him?

70
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:08,888
You saw it, right?

71
00:06:09,195 --> 00:06:12,114
I, uh, I think it was Tohsaka's servant.

72
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:13,249
It was brutal:

73
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:18,510
his brilliant appearance, his quick attacks,
everything was golden, bright, and flashy.

74
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:20,955
It all happened so fast, I couldn't tell what...

75
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:22,017
You fool!

76
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:28,571
If I am to fight someone, it will be the victor
of all the other battles between the servants.

77
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:31,510
Why weren't you paying attention to how he won?

78
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:33,729
Well, it matters not.

79
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,088
Did anything else strike you about the flashy
gold man or the way he fought the battle?

80
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:44,215
But...but it was the middle of the
night and it was all over in a second.

81
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:49,738
Hey, Rider, normally a servant
only has one noble phantasm, right?

82
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:51,835
Yes, of course, that's the rule.

83
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:56,531
But how many isn't the correct way
to conceptualize a noble phantasm.

84
00:06:56,835 --> 00:07:02,798
As I'm sure you already know, a noble phantasm is the
physical manifestation of a hero's most indelible legend

85
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:04,380
or most famous tale.

86
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:09,534
Sometimes, it may be a specific
ability or a special method of attack.

87
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:15,015
So, then, is there a noble phantasm that consists
of throwing dozens of swords at an opponent?

88
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:18,303
A sword that makes copies of itself, really?

89
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,895
Huh, yes, it's possible.

90
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:24,274
That could still qualify as a single noble phantasm.

91
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:29,105
But, wait, those swords weren't copies.

92
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,607
Each one of them had a completely different shape.

93
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:38,206
Ah, forget it, we'll just have to discover each
of our enemies' identities as we encounter them.

94
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,177
Do you really think that would be wise?

95
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,038
Yes, actually it'll be more fun!

96
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:51,046
Food, sex, sleep, and war!

97
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:55,065
Whatever you do,
you should always enjoy it to the fullest;

98
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:57,055
that is the secret of life.

99
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:04,629
All right now, let's go see if we can find
ourselves some invigorating entertainment outside.

100
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:06,148
We ride forth, boy!

101
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:07,168
Prepare yourself!

102
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:10,082
Uh, we ride forth? To where?

103
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:11,369
Well, to somewhere.

104
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,728
We can go anywhere!

105
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,075
Oh, come on, now!

106
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,887
Let's face it, you can't have been
the only one who was watching Tohsaka,

107
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,668
which means that news of Assassin's
death is making the rounds.

108
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,422
The others are probably going to
spring into action all at once,

109
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,425
but we shall crush each of them as we come across them.

110
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:32,318
Go find and crush them all?

111
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:34,131
It won't be that easy.

112
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:35,757
I am Rider

113
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,756
and my speed far exceeds that of any
other servant I will face in this war.

114
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,315
Wait, wait, wait, not here!

115
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:48,344
You'll blow up the whole house!

116
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,521
My servant has been lost.

117
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:54,236
I have forfeited my rights as a master

118
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,015
and cannot continue the Holy Grail War.

119
00:08:57,285 --> 00:09:03,063
In accordance with the treaty, I, Kirei
Kotomine, ask that the church grant me sanctuary.

120
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:04,818
Request granted.

121
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:07,626
In my role as overseer of this war,

122
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:11,009
I, Risei Kotomine,
guarantee your safety here.

123
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:13,088
Enter in peace.

124
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:18,291
Father, isn't this church being watched?

125
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:22,930
No, this holy place has been
declared a neutral sanctuary.

126
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:27,718
The Holy Church will censure any
master who dares defy the decree.

127
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,783
Then, you're sure it's safe here?

128
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:32,178
Mmm.

129
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:36,135
But still, you should keep watch just in case.

130
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:39,168
Post a guard here at all times just to be sure.

131
00:09:39,655 --> 00:09:42,136
Yes, understood.

132
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:45,888
Tell me, who was observing the battle?

133
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,913
Before the battle, I detected the presence
of familiars from four separate masters.

134
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:55,434
Two days ago, I was able to confirm the
summoning of the final servant, Caster.

135
00:09:55,744 --> 00:10:00,832
All of the Holy Grail War servants should have
now arrived and the fighting will begin shortly.

136
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:03,713
One unaccounted for.

137
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:08,936
I had hoped that all the masters would be
watching and taking note of the encounter.

138
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:16,183
At this point in the war, observing the three families'
estates would be a master's obvious course of action.

139
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:20,575
That's right, and if they can't even think to do that,

140
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:25,874
it would never even begin to occur to them
to worry about the existence of us assassins.

141
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:33,376
We spirits of the shadows shall sneak up behind
those masters who believe Assassin to be dead.

142
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:35,275
We shall sneak up behind them,

143
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:40,129
and this time, we shall become
true shadows in the darkness.

144
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:43,493
The battle for the grail is now at hand.

145
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:47,974
At last, it's time for the
fourth Holy Grail War to begin.

146
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:53,923
These tired old eyes of mine will finally
see a wondrous miracle be performed.

147
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:11,151
Oh, my!

148
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,471
So, this is where Kiritsugu was born?

149
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:17,872
Well, Saber, how did you enjoy
your journey through the sky?

150
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,341
It was really nothing to speak of.

151
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:23,602
It was far simpler than I had actually anticipated.

152
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:28,263
Yes, well, I suppose that flying must be
nothing special to a real hero, right?

153
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:30,185
No, that's not it.

154
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,578
Upon materialization, all servants
receive knowledge of the modern world.

155
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:40,108
If required, I could even pilot
this aircraft with relative ease.

156
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:41,435
You could?

157
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:43,041
Are you serious?

158
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:47,329
My riding skill allows me to
command any beast or vehicle,

159
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:51,307
with the only exception being
phantasmal or divine beasts.

160
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:56,132
Once I put the saddle between my legs
and take the reins, I'm in control.

161
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:58,907
The saddle between your legs and take the reins?

162
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:00,831
What is it?

163
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:03,486
Did I say something amusing to you?

164
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:04,783
Uh‐uh.

165
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:10,783
Still, you must be the only servant who
has flown in an airplane in physical form.

166
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:12,749
I apologize for that.

167
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:14,913
If only I could take spirit form.

168
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,812
No, I didn't mean it like that, really.

169
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:20,533
I never get tired of watching you.

170
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:23,939
Irisviel, is there something odd about me?

171
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:26,503
No, no, not at all.

172
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:31,133
When you laugh like that,
there seems to be some hidden meaning behind it.

173
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,303
What is it?

174
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:34,189
I want you to be frank with me.

175
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:38,785
It means that your being stuck in
physical form isn't without its merits.

176
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:42,915
It's given me many enjoyable
hours of choosing outfits for you.

177
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:48,696
Irisviel, is this manner of dress
truly common for women of this era?

178
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,575
I choose it for you to balance out my own outfit.

179
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:52,828
You don't care for it?

180
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:54,068
No, it is fine.

181
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:58,793
It is rather easy to move in, and
besides, I'm used to dressing as a man.

182
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:05,751
This place is so very alive!

183
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,677
Kiritsugu was supposed to have arrived
here in Japan already, wasn't he?

184
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:12,185
That's right, 12 hours before us.

185
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:15,717
But, don't worry, he'll find us as
soon as he's certain the time is right.

186
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,891
For the moment, we'll just have to keep an eye
on things so that we can act when the time comes.

187
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:26,120
We've come all this way, I'd like to
enjoy the city before the fighting starts.

188
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:27,540
That's dangerous.

189
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:32,890
We should first concentrate on securing a base
of operations and discuss plans with Kiritsugu.

190
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,789
Well, yes, I suppose you're right about that.

191
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,532
But it's such a waste; we've come all
this way to such an exciting place!

192
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:42,491
That, and...

193
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:46,392
it's my very first time travelling.

194
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:47,550
Oh?

195
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:52,862
This is the first time I've ever ventured out
into the world outside the confines of my home.

196
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,816
Are you telling me that you spent
your entire life inside that castle?

197
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:03,608
You see, I was a puppet created
specifically for the Holy Grail War.

198
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:06,889
Of course, it isn't as though I'm wholly ignorant;

199
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,383
Kiritsugu brought me movies and videos and pictures,

200
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:14,698
and he's tried in every way to teach me
everything he could about the outside world.

201
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,120
But this is the first time that I've actually
been able to see it with my own eyes,

202
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:24,357
and so, please, forgive me!
I got overly excited.

203
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:29,496
Please stop the car.

204
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,324
Walking through the city will be a
brand new experience for me as well.

205
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,825
It is a knight's duty to serve as escort;

206
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:52,108
I shall do my very best.

207
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:54,693
Come with me.

208
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:19,387
The equipment you requested arrived a little while ago.

209
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:24,046
Madam Irisviel and Saber have just
arrived here in Fuyuki as well.

210
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:29,105
All the other masters will likely assume that
she is Saber's master and act accordingly.

211
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:30,590
Understood.

212
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,860
There was an incident last night at the Tohsaka Estate.

213
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:35,667
I recorded this footage.

214
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:42,307
What's your analysis of this?

215
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,850
It seems too good to be true.

216
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:49,021
There seem to be insufficient time
between Assassin's infiltration

217
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,165
and the Tohsaka servants' attack.

218
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:56,668
Assassin has a skill that masks his presence,
making it improbable he was detected in advance.

219
00:15:56,911 --> 00:16:00,529
It is my opinion that Tohsaka was expecting an intruder.

220
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:05,476
In a battle amongst servants,
learning their identities is quite critical.

221
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:10,150
Why would Tohsaka expose his servant like he did?

222
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:12,476
He must have had a very good reason.

223
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,463
I suppose he had to.

224
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:18,646
Tell me, what became of Assassin's master?

225
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,114
He took refuge in a church last night.

226
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:24,182
The overseer declared him to be under his protection.

227
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:28,098
Assassin's master is Kirei Kotomine.

228
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,836
Maiya, send a familiar to watch the Fuyuki church.

229
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:34,824
Are you certain of that?

230
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:37,953
Masters are forbidding to take
action inside the neutral zone.

231
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:40,133
That's been established around the church.

232
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:42,434
Place it just far enough away

233
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:45,300
that the priest won't be able to spot it.

234
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:48,074
Very well, understood.

235
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:07,618
The item I left you, where is it?

236
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:08,758
Right here.

237
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:26,821
Approximately two seconds.

238
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:28,427
I'm surprised.

239
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:29,578
Indeed.

240
00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:41,401
I was just thinking,
Illya weighs a lot less than that Walther.

241
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:45,827
She's...eight years old already.

242
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:56,208
Focus on the matter at
hand, just empty your mind.

243
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:05,013
Think of nothing else except your plan.

244
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:21,371
It's wonderful!

245
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:24,446
Almost like a mirror that reflects the night sky.

246
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:42,976
It's fun to walk around a strange and wondrous
new town accompanied by a gallant gentleman.

247
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,248
Did I really make an acceptable gentleman escort?

248
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:48,730
You were absolutely perfect, Saber.

249
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:52,271
You really were the most wonderful
knight a girl could ever hope for.

250
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,117
You honor me, Your Highness.

251
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,566
Saber, do you like the sea?

252
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:05,363
I suppose; I don't really know.

253
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:08,565
In my country, and way back in my time,

254
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:12,918
the sea was a source of attacks
by barbarians from the mainland.

255
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:16,737
I never felt any affection
for it and often hated it.

256
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,474
I feel kind of bad.

257
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:22,149
You're a girl, just as I am,

258
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:28,154
but when you were King Arthur, you never had the
luxury of enjoying simple things like this, did you?

259
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,787
So, what about your desires?

260
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:36,682
Surely, you would have much preferred to have
Kiritsugu escort you around town today, right?

261
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,190
Of course I would, but he couldn't.

262
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:43,027
It would only cause him pain and suffering.

263
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:48,026
Does Kiritsugu not enjoy the time he spends with you?

264
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:52,218
When he's happy, for some reason,

265
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,504
it seems to cause him pain.

266
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:07,250
An enemy servant?

267
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:12,927
Yes, making its presence known from the
shadows, 100 meters ahead.

268
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:16,510
It appears to be inviting us over to go and see it.

269
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:21,089
How thoughtful; it wishes
to decide on a battlefield.

270
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:23,528
Shall we take it up on its invitation?

271
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:26,496
I'd like nothing better.

272
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:39,130
Come on, Rider,
let's get down from here right now!

273
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,288
Take me down!

274
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:42,754
But why?

275
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:46,247
This is a nearly perfect vantage
point to survey the whole land.

276
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:47,710
I'm leaving!

277
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:48,516
No, wait!

278
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:51,003
Take me back down, I can't handle this!

279
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,495
Oh, calm yourself.

280
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:55,337
Waiting is a large part of war.

281
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:59,190
I wanna go... I wanna go back to England.

282
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:02,040
I told you not to be in such a damn hurry.

283
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,679
You see, things have finally begun to unfold out there.

284
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:10,454
This is going to be a lot of fun!

285
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:17,313
Welcome.

286
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:21,934
I have spent the entire day
searching the city for a worthy foe.

287
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:26,668
Everyone just slinks away, hiding in their little holes.

288
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:30,643
You, alone, have accepted my offer.

289
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:34,573
That pure energy surrounding you;

290
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:38,094
you are the servant called Saber, I presume?

291
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:42,744
Indeed, I am, and I presume that you
are the one that's called Lancer?

292
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:50,316
Being unable to honorably name myself to my opponent
in combat troubles me more than I can describe.

293
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,320
I harbor an enormous dislike of these rules.

294
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:13,058
Saber, please...be careful.

295
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,837
I can use my healing magic to
act as combat support for you.

296
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,959
But, more than that, Saber...

297
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,825
Just leave Lancer to me.

298
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,404
It troubles me that his master is in
hiding and has not yet shown himself.

299
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:27,554
Perhaps they plot something.

300
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,245
Watch yourself.

301
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:35,243
And, Irisviel, from this point on,
I entrust you to watch my back.

302
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:37,358
Very well, I will, Saber.

303
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,317
Grant me victory in this fight.

304
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,023
I will, without fail.
