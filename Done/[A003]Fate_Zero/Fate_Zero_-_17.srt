1
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,307
Murdered?

2
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,150
I can't...believe it.

3
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:18,620
Why would anyone kill him?

4
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:20,093
It's unthinkable!

5
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:22,619
This cannot be allowed!

6
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:30,761
It must also be regrettable for you

7
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:32,907
to lose your father in this way.

8
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:33,927
It is.

9
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:36,662
Father Risei was very dear.

10
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,295
He was just like a second father to me.

11
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:43,288
It's been one unexpected
disaster after another.

12
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:48,229
I think it might prove necessary
to formulate a new plan right away.

13
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,269
Why did you not tell Tokiomi?

14
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,089
Tell him what?

15
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:06,117
I pity your father.

16
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:10,227
He died believing his son
to be a pious man of God.

17
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,814
Or...

18
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:14,906
perhaps that was his salvation.

19
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:19,589
Does your father's death arouse no feeling in you?

20
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,921
He was killed, after all.

21
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:26,445
You could at least attempt to appear a little upset.

22
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:27,744
I am.

23
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,081
I'm furious to no end.

24
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,170
Furious, you say?

25
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:34,599
Are you...

26
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:37,857
furious because you were unable to kill him yourself?

27
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,274
Saber?

28
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,792
Irisviel, how are you feeling?

29
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,978
It appears I've made you worry about me again.

30
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:58,420
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:58,928 --> 00:03:59,581
No.

32
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:01,621
As long as you are truly fine.

33
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:04,011
That is all that really matters to me.

34
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:05,640
But then...

35
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:11,482
It's okay.

36
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,895
It's Maiya's presence you are sensing.

37
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,857
Tohsaka?

38
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:17,078
Yes.

39
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,838
He requests that we present a united front.

40
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:21,624
Wait, an alliance?

41
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:22,831
At this stage?

42
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:25,563
The thought of dealing with Rider and Berserker

43
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:28,235
must have Tohsaka feeling father uneasy.

44
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,212
And so, assuming that we would be the most amenable,

45
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:33,829
he has invited us to meet.

46
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,048
Meaning that he considers us the
weakest of the remaining teams.

47
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:42,787
Tohsaka said that he wishes to meet with
you tonight over at the Fuyuki church.

48
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:47,839
You should know that from the very start
Tokiomi Tohsaka has made elaborate preparations

49
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,492
to try and ensure his victory in this Grail War.

50
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,727
And it's also likely

51
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:54,349
that in total secret

52
00:04:54,735 --> 00:04:57,919
he controlled Assassin's
master, Kirei Kotomine.

53
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:04,737
If that's true, and Tohsaka exerts
some influence over Kotomine,

54
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,796
then I believe it would be a mistake
if we choose to ignore this offer.

55
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:10,658
Yes, you're right.

56
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,923
Kirei Kotomine?

57
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,704
Remember this, Saber,

58
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:23,121
if there is anyone in this war who can defeat
Kiritsugu and claim the Holy Grail for himself,

59
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,959
it is the man named Kirei Kotomine.

60
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:31,789
Go and tell them.

61
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:33,308
We accept.

62
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:44,849
Father?

63
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:51,136
Hi, Father!

64
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:08,915
Rin, your father says that he
would like to speak with you.

65
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:28,914
Rin...

66
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:32,681
keep the Mage's Association
in your debt till you grow up.

67
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,352
After that, I leave the rest to your judgment.

68
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,895
I'm certain you'll be fine on your own.

69
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:42,912
The Holy Grail will appear one day,

70
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:46,080
it is the Tohsaka
family's duty to claim it.

71
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:49,579
Above all, if you wish to be a mage, Rin,

72
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:51,632
it's a path you cannot avoid.

73
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:54,973
Here, take this.

74
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:56,359
Oh!

75
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:02,688
I have to go now.

76
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,359
You know what to do, right?

77
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,132
Yes.

78
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,616
I'll see you soon.

79
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:12,763
Take care, Father.

80
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,263
First, allow me to thank you
for coming here at my behest.

81
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:36,580
I very much appreciate it.

82
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,277
Let me introduce Kirei Kotomine,

83
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,270
my long‐time apprentice.

84
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,377
While we were once honorable competitors
in this battle for the Holy Grail,

85
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,930
all that is now in the past.

86
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,775
He has lost his servant, and as a result,
has yielded his rights as a master.

87
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:59,849
This Grail War is rapidly heading toward its conclusion.

88
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,901
The one's remaining are, as anticipated,

89
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:07,585
the masters of the three great
houses along with one outsider.

90
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,961
Now, what is your appraisal
of the state of the war?

91
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:13,374
I have no opinion.

92
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:16,156
We control the most powerful servant, Saber,

93
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:18,615
and don't need to wait for the best time to strike.

94
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:21,079
We shall simply continue to win each battle.

95
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,303
Hm.

96
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,382
Unfortunately for the Matous,

97
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,550
it is my opinion that they
erred in their strategy.

98
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,244
They have imposed a draining servant upon a frail
master, thereby hastening his self‐destruction.

99
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,767
Rider is likely to be the victor between them.

100
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,968
The Grail must not be allowed
to fall into outside hands.

101
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:46,422
The two of us should be able to agree on that much.

102
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,335
Any alliance is out of the question.

103
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,056
However, if you wish to discuss the
order in which we approach our enemies,

104
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:55,651
we may be able to
come to some equitable agreement.

105
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,425
Go on.

106
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,491
We can settle things with the Tohsaka team

107
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:03,890
after defeating the other masters.

108
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:06,654
We are prepared to agree to such a proposal.

109
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,124
So a temporary conditional ceasefire?

110
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,592
That is a fair compromise.

111
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:15,540
We have two conditions.

112
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:21,046
The first is that you agree to share with us
any and all information you may have gathered

113
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,285

concerning Rider and his master.

114
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,217
Agreed.

115
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,273
Our second condition is

116
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:31,400
that Kirei Kotomine be removed
from the Holy Grail War.

117
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:36,301
Kirei?

118
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:39,276
I am not suggesting in any way he be killed,

119
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,149
but I insist that until this battle is over,

120
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:46,444
he be expelled from Fuyuki,
or better yet, from Japan entirely.

121
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,964
Immediately, before morning.

122
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,645
Would you explain why?

123
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:55,001
Because of the bad blood

124
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:58,811
between the Einzberns and the so‐called Inquisitor.

125
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:02,180
If the Tohsaka team continues to protect him,

126
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,937
we will find ourselves unable to
trust you under any circumstances.

127
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,044
What does she mean?

128
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:12,385
Kirei.

129
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,583
Well, Saber,how do you
like Kiritsugu's present?

130
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:20,916
Very much so.

131
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:23,266
It is more like a horse than a car is.

132
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:25,246
It seems to suit me much better.

133
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:27,232
I shall go ahead then

134
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:29,831
and scout out the route ahead for us.

135
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:37,320
We should go now as well.

136
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:44,986
Ma... madam, what's the matter?

137
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,255
Please drive, Maiya.

138
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:48,561
You sure?

139
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:51,849
Tohsaka will suspect something's wrong.

140
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,457
What's happening to me really isn't unexpected.

141
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:04,852
It was actually inevitable.

142
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:13,271
Honestly, the fact that I've been able to function as
a human for this long... is really quite a miracle.

143
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:16,993
Does Kiritsugu know about this?

144
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,265
Yes, but don't tell Saber.

145
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,484
She has a crucial battle
to fight ahead of her.

146
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,634
I don't want to distract
her with all of this.

147
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:29,760
But listen, Maiya,
there's something I need to tell you.

148
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:34,880
I am a homunculus created
specifically for the Holy Grail War.

149
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,273
You know about that, right?

150
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,446
Yes.

151
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:43,835
Grandfather Acht ingrained in the
vessel an instinct for self‐preservation

152
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:48,856
so that it would avoid all danger and
safeguard the Grail to its completion.

153
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:53,955
He disguised the vessel so he could hide
it in plain sight and called it Irisviel.

154
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,390
That is who I am.

155
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,278
But how?

156
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,253
Then that means that you are...

157
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:01,493
Very soon now.

158
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:04,363
I will revert back to what I originally was.

159
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:10,866
When that happens, I won't even be able to
talk to you or anyone else like this anymore.

160
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:15,505
That's the reason why Kiritsugu
gave me Saber's scabbard to keep.

161
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:20,254
Avalon, are you familiar with its effects?

162
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,774
It halts aging and provides an infinite healing ability.

163
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:25,549
Or so I'm told.

164
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:29,319
Its effects are what have prevented
the hollow shell that is me

165
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:31,399
from collapsing in on itself.

166
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:35,581
Of course, they stop working
as soon as Saber is away.

167
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,051
And I start to deteriorate.

168
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:41,154
Madam, why are you telling me all this?

169
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:47,216
Because, Maiya Hisau,
under no circumstances would you ever pity me.

170
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,298
You would accept me for what I am.

171
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:52,324
That's why I tell you.

172
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:56,179
Madam, Irisviel, I'm afraid I've always

173
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:58,443
thought that you were beyond my reach.

174
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:00,282
No, I'm not really.

175
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,359
Do you understand?

176
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:03,386
Yes.

177
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:07,398
Even if it costs me my life, Irisviel,

178
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:10,592
I will see you through to the very end.

179
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:12,547
And so please...

180
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:16,335
please die now for Kiritsugu Emiya

181
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:19,321
to make his dream a reality.

182
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:25,110
Thank you.

183
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,439
I really wish you had told me of your
troubled history with the Einzberns.

184
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:36,179
Unfortunately, I have no choice.

185
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,764
You must withdraw from the Holy Grail War

186
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,385
immediately.

187
00:13:56,683 --> 00:14:00,926
Kiritsugu Emiya, who are you really?

188
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:05,043
Will I leave this place

189
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:06,953
never even learning that?

190
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:11,808
Still thinking about what to do even now?

191
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:15,324
Could you truly be so slow, Kirei?

192
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,527
The Holy Grail beckons to you still.

193
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:25,593
And even you yourself still long to
jump into the fight and claim it.

194
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:28,726
For as long as I remember,

195
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:32,057
I've spent my life in search of a single thing.

196
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:34,579
I've devoted every moment

197
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:36,580
and endured great pain for it,

198
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:39,048
but all of that has come to naught.

199
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:43,222
Yet I sense that the answer to my question

200
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,373
is closer to me now than it has ever been before.

201
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,788
After all of that self‐reflection,

202
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,136
why in the world do you still hesitate?

203
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:52,871
Because I fear

204
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:55,772
that when I've learned all the answers,

205
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,774
it will result in my utter destruction.

206
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,968
Understood, well done.

207
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:12,358
Ah, you've just received an
exciting bit of news, I take it.

208
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:17,579
We've finally learned the exact location of the
stronghold where the Einzberns have been hiding.

209
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,753
As I live and breathe!

210
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:22,666
You honestly amaze me.

211
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:26,340
You were planning to continue all
along, weren't you?

212
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,194
I did hesitate.

213
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,449
I was even prepared to give up.

214
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:35,464
But in the end,
it is just as you say, Archer...

215
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:41,205
I know no other way than to keep asking
the question until I find an answer.

216
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:43,399
What is that?

217
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,719
A gift from my father.

218
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:52,139
JN424.

219
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,785
The gospel of John.

220
00:15:56,859 --> 00:16:00,784
"God is spirit, and those who worship Him

221
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:04,223
must worship in spirit and in truth."

222
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:10,472
However, Kirei,

223
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:14,056
there remains for you a rather grave problem.

224
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:21,687
Were you to participate in the Holy Grail War on
your own behalf, Tokiomi Tohsaka becomes your enemy.

225
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,971
In other words, you are in the
same room as an enemy's servant

226
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:29,429
with no real plan to actually
defend yourself from him.

227
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,434
A dire situation, would you not agree?

228
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:34,001
No, not at all.

229
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:37,147
I came with something to trade for my life.

230
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:38,244
Really?

231
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:39,770
Gilgamesh.

232
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,262
Let me reveal to you the truth behind the
Holy Grail War that has been kept from you.

233
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:46,539
And that is?

234
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,281
The magical ritual held here in Fuyuki

235
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:53,751
is an attempt by the winning mage to
open up a passage directly to the root

236
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:57,465
by the sacrifice of the souls
of seven heroic spirits.

237
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:03,686
The activation of the Holy Grail can only be
achieved by the killing of all seven servants.

238
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,029
That's correct, all seven.

239
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,229
You understand?

240
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:13,008
That's the reason my master has worked
so hard to avoid using his command seals,

241
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:19,845
because when all the battles are finally over, he will
require them to force his own servant to commit suicide.

242
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:23,318
So then the loyalty Tokiomi has shown me

243
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,277
has all been nothing but a lie from the very beginning?

244
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,070
To put it yet another way,

245
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:31,958
my master is first and foremost
a mage down to his very core.

246
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:35,210
He may worship a heroic spirit,

247
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,306
but he harbors no illusions about his idols.

248
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,191
Well, Tokiomi, at last you have
shown some hint of promise.

249
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:49,381
That dull excuse for a man will finally be able
to provide me with a measure of entertainment.

250
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:52,376
Now then, what will you do, Gilgamesh?

251
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:56,142
Will you now choose to remain loyal to Tokiomi

252
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,999
and then punish me for rebelling against him?

253
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:01,340
Ah, a fair question, indeed.

254
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,462
Regardless of his treachery,

255
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:06,923
Tokiomi still supplies me with the mana I require.

256
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:12,127
Were I to abandon my master,it would
hamper my ability to remain materialized.

257
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:15,084
Oh, come to think of it,

258
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:17,443
there is a partnerless master I know of.

259
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:22,248
One who is actively searching for a servant
that is free and unbound by a contract.

260
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:23,099
Hmph.

261
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,298
Now that you mention it, you're right.

262
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,051
But of course, there is a question

263
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:32,476
of whether that man is a worthy master
in the eyes of the King of Heroes?

264
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:34,362
He will suffice.

265
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:37,666
He is a bit stiff and humorless, perhaps,

266
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:39,905
but he has great potential for growth.

267
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:44,499
He may yet prove himself a fine
source of entertainment for me.

268
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:46,448
Hm.

269
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:51,577
I've been waiting for you, Kirei.

270
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:55,609
I came to say goodbye and thank
you before I departed Fuyuki.

271
00:18:58,593 --> 00:19:01,177
First, I'd like to say that I'm still very proud

272
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,298
to have had you as my student.

273
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:07,917
I hope you will maintain good
relations with the Tohsaka family,

274
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:10,696
as throughout the years
your late father always did.

275
00:19:11,663 --> 00:19:12,469
All right?

276
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,188
Your words honor me.

277
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:18,421
Once this Grail War has finally come to an end,

278
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,161
Kirei, I'd like for you to help train
my young daughter, Rin, to be a mage.

279
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:29,450
It's rather simple, but in essence,
this is a will I've prepared.

280
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:34,136
I thought it prudent to be ready in the event
the worst happened and I did not survive.

281
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,657
It leaves the entire wealth
of the Tohsaka family to Rin.

282
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:41,465
And names you as her legal guardian

283
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:43,567
until she comes of age.

284
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:46,523
Leave it to me.

285
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:48,406
I shall do all I can

286
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,653
to look after your daughter and
keep her safe from any harm.

287
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:53,448
Thank you.

288
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:55,228
Kirei.

289
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:56,765
What is this?

290
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:58,875
A little something for you.

291
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:00,717
A gift from me.

292
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:02,101
Open it.

293
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:07,755
An Azoth dagger.

294
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:11,052
It symbolizes your mastery of magic,

295
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:14,165
and marks the completion of your apprenticeship to me.

296
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,479
I am without words.

297
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:18,332
You are far too kind to me.

298
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,647
I am filled with gratitude,

299
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:22,324
my master.

300
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,546
It is I who thanks you,

301
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,036
Kirei Kotomine.

302
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:30,595
Now I can finish preparing for
the final battle of this war.

303
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:34,609
Oh my, look at the time.

304
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:38,403
I'm sorry to have kept
you here for so long.

305
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:42,612
I hope I haven't made you miss your flight.

306
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,637
No.

307
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:57,089
You needn't worry about it, my master.

308
00:21:05,193 --> 00:21:08,977
You see, I never got around to buying myself a ticket.

309
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:25,571
Master.

310
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:28,499
How like my father you were.

311
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:34,120
Even at the very end, you never really
understood me or my inner motivations, did you?

312
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:40,425
Hah.

313
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:42,318
Such a boring end.

314
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,967
Look at that.

315
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:46,135
Such an idiotic expression.

316
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,549
He did have a dematerialized
servant at hand that he depended on.

317
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,608
It was natural for him to lower his guard.

318
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:56,247
So, you have learned to adjust already, have you?

319
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:59,433
I praise you for your studious aptitude.

320
00:22:00,522 --> 00:22:01,546
Well, Kirei?

321
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:05,660
Do you feel a little better about not
having had the chance to kill your father?

322
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:09,339
So you have no qualms about this,

323
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,911
Gilgamesh, King of Heroes?

324
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:15,673
No, not so long as you continue to amuse me.

325
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:17,934
Otherwise, Kirei...

326
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:22,804
Well, you are the one who ought
to question your own resolve.

327
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:27,349
My will creates your body,

328
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,655
and your sword creates my destiny.

329
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:31,926
If you heed the Grail's call

330
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:34,867
and also obey my will and my reason.

331
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:39,012
Yes, I swear your offering will be my flesh,

332
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:42,503
Kirei Kotomine, my new master.

333
00:22:46,193 --> 00:22:47,227
Now, Kirei,

334
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:48,889
let us begin.

335
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:51,833
Put an end to this farce,

336
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:54,361
and as a reward for your loyalty,

337
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,865
I shall give you the Holy Grail.

338
00:22:57,323 --> 00:23:00,066
Very well then, King of Heroes.

339
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:02,823
May you have your fill of amusement from me.

340
00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:05,840
Until such time I find the answer I seek,

341
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,181
I shall gladly play the fool for you.
