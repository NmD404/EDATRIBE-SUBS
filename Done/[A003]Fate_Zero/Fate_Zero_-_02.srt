1
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:22,458
Rider?

2
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:26,601
What the hell?

3
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:29,663
What do you think you're doing
breaking the shutter open like that?

4
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:32,453
Why didn't you go through in
spirit form like when you entered?

5
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:37,141
I cannot carry these things
while I am in my spirit form.

6
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:39,769
And don't whine so much.

7
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:42,779
You sound like you're some kind
of common thief or street urchin.

8
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:45,785
Well, if you aren't a thief, then what the hell are you?

9
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,285
Something entirely different.

10
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:52,052
A cowardly thief sneaks away in the night full of fear.

11
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:55,765
If you stride away bursting with song proudly,

12
00:00:55,842 --> 00:00:58,115
then what you are is a conquering king!

13
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:01,308
Just what I needed...  now get out of here!

14
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:03,553
Get lost... get lost now!

15
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,598
Very well... then I shall leave you to carry the spoils.

16
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:08,239
Try not to drop them.

17
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:15,271
Oh, man, why is this happening to me?

18
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,633
I... I don't get it.

19
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:58,364
The summoning worked,
so why do I have to do all of this?

20
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:01,792
What's so important about these books, anyway?

21
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:05,249
It's important because we are preparing for war.

22
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:09,259
And one cannot wage war without having proper maps.

23
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:13,184
Hey, boy, where are Macedonia and Persia?

24
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,706
You can't talk to me like that!

25
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:17,703
I'm your master...

26
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:25,122
I am well aware of my status as
servant and yours as my master.

27
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,952
After all, we forged a pact, did we not?

28
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:29,534
Mhm.

29
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:34,984
But I'm interested in learning where
all my old territories are located.

30
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:39,989
I think they're here.

31
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:41,276
Hmm.

32
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:49,766
I spent my life conquering that
land, and look how puny it is!

33
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:50,686
Very well.

34
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,981
I can't wait to get started!

35
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:54,515
All right, then.

36
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,300
Where exactly on this map are we sitting right now, boy?

37
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:00,499
Here.

38
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:03,554
So, the other side of the round land.

39
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:04,534
Hmm.

40
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:06,396
Good news indeed.

41
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:09,332
This will guide us well in the coming battles.

42
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,067
Guide us well?

43
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:13,287
First, to the other side of the world,

44
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:16,122
due west, and we go as fast as we can.

45
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:19,219
And we shall conquer every land that we pass through!

46
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:22,187
I shall return to Macedonia in triumph,

47
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:26,021
and my people will hold a festival
in honor of my great revival!

48
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:29,429
Now how splendid will that be?

49
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:32,172
Why do you think you're here, anyway?

50
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:34,743
You didn't forget the Grail War, did you?

51
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:36,984
Hmm, that's right.

52
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:38,334
Speaking of the Grail,

53
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,545
I have neglected to ask one small thing.

54
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:43,642
What will you do with the Grail once you possess it?

55
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:46,373
Why... what's it to you what I do?

56
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:48,421
I mean, what do you care?

57
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:51,650
If you are also intent on world conquest,

58
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,737
then that would make you my enemy,

59
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:57,261
because the world cannot serve two lords.

60
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,102
Wha...

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,357
No, I don't want that!

62
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:04,182
Look, I'll tell you what I really want, okay?

63
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:07,929
I just want people to treat me fairly.

64
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:13,234
I wanna make all those idiots back at the clock
tower who never even bothered to give me a chance

65
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,834
to admit to me that they were wrong!

66
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:15,914
Small!

67
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,991
Small.

68
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,448
And narrow‐minded and stupid!

69
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:26,214
You mean to tell me that in this battle,
your only concern is for your ridiculous reputation?

70
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,560
And you dare call yourself my master?

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,950
What a terrible disappointment you are.

72
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:37,201
If you wish so desperately for
others to fear and respect you...

73
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:41,476
...perhaps you should try using the Holy Grail's power

74
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:44,713
to grow another 30 centimeters
and add a little bit of muscle.

75
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:52,294
He's supposed to be my servant!

76
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:54,274
He can't talk to me that way!

77
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:56,282
I'll show him!

78
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:59,541
I address the command seal.

79
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:02,398
In accordance with the Grail's laws,

80
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,664
I order this man, Iskander the Conqueror...

81
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:10,513
Calm down, Waver.

82
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:15,284
A master can only use his command seal to
compel his servant's obedience three times

83
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:16,370
and that's all.

84
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:21,031
If I use all my command seals,
I won't be able to control him when I really need to.

85
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:29,055
As long as I get the Holy Grail, it doesn't matter.

86
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,921
I really don't give a damn what you do after that, so...

87
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,188
Enough, boy!

88
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:35,902
I shall acquire the Grail for you as you wish.

89
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:39,454
Yeah, well, you seem awfully confident about that.

90
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:41,583
Do you have any idea how you're gonna do it?

91
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:46,461
So you wish to see my power...  is
that what you're trying to tell me?

92
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:49,041
Well, of course I do!

93
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:52,832
You need to prove to me that I can rely
on you no matter what the situation!

94
00:06:56,684 --> 00:07:02,394
I am Iskander, King of Conquerors!
With the swing of my sword, I declare my supremacy!

95
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:41,297
This is the ox chariot that King
Gordius once offered up to Zeus.

96
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:46,929
Its renowned reputation must be the source
of my designation as a rider class servant.

97
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,973
If you want the Grail,
then find me another hero or two...

98
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:53,099
someone worthy for me to fight!

99
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:58,217
Until then, I shall entertain myself by
sitting here and looking at these maps.

100
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:00,856
That will not pose a problem, will it?

101
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,892
All right!

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,164
I'm not gonna lose today... you just watch!

103
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,002
Ah, I found one.

104
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,500
No way...  where is it?

105
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:24,664
Oh, gee, I'm sure I didn't overlook it!

106
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,439
That's the very first chestnut bud today!

107
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,405
First point to me.

108
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,527
I'm not gonna lose!

109
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,434
Oh, there's one!

110
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,651
Right here!

111
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:42,927
Ahhh.

112
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,766
You see...  I found one too!

113
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,003
I found my second over here.

114
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:49,283
Huh?

115
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,795
Hey, that isn't a chestnut branch.

116
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,328
It's kind of, Ilya.

117
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:58,012
That branch is actually from a tree called a wingnut.

118
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,858
It's almost like a chestnut,

119
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:02,759
so as far as I'm concerned, it's a chestnut bud.

120
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,565
‐Huh? ‐That's no fair!

121
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:08,622
No fair, no fair, no fair!

122
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,890
The whole time we've been
playing, you've been cheating!

123
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:16,235
Yes, but your daddy can't win
this game against you otherwise!

124
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:20,854
If you keep on cheating like you've been doing,
I won't play this game with you ever again!

125
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,484
I don't want that!

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,912
I'm sorry, Ilya, I apologize.

127
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,876
Do you promise not to cheat like that anymore?

128
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,709
Yes, I do.

129
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,122
Okay then.

130
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,336
I challenge you to one more round.

131
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,360
A true champion accepts all challengers!

132
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:40,256
Indeed, I'm very honored, your highness.

133
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,838
Wow, I'm so high up!

134
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,819
What's got your attention out there, Saber?

135
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,454
It's interesting.

136
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,443
Your daughter and Kiritsugu are playing outside.

137
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:01,505
Are you surprised?

138
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,619
I was under the impression that my master
had a colder heart than he's showing now.

139
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,032
Well, I can see why you might think that.

140
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,239
If that really is Kiritsugu's true self,

141
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:21,328
then I am afraid I must've gravely
offended him when we first met.

142
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,045
Irisviel, you really don't have to laugh at me.

143
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,713
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,743
I was wondering if you're still concerned
with our reaction when you were summoned?

145
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,994
Yes, somewhat.

146
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,597
True, I did pretend to be a man during my original life.

147
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,441
But surely there was no need for you two
to be so shocked when you saw me.

148
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,755
I'm so sorry, but we just couldn't help it!

149
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:49,740
Your legend... I mean, King Arthur's legend

150
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,762
is extremely famous.

151
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,030
Well, if that's the case,

152
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,174
do you think he might underestimate my ability

153
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,989
simply because I am a woman?

154
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,393
No, never.

155
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,648
Not at all.

156
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,863
Then again, if he's upset as you think he is,

157
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,046
I'm certain that there's another reason.

158
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,154
Such as?

159
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:14,180
He's probably upset at all the people
who were around you at the time.

160
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:19,498
The selfish ones,
the ones cruel enough and uncaring enough

161
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:22,942
to force the role of King upon an innocent little girl.

162
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,203
It was inevitable that would happen.

163
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,238
I had resigned myself to that fate

164
00:11:27,324 --> 00:11:29,764
when I drew forth the sword from the stone.

165
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:34,454
I believe that that upsets him
even more than anything else,

166
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,474
your resignation to your fate.

167
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,223
Well, then he forgets his place.

168
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,724
He hasn't the right to question
decisions made by those of my time,

169
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,492
including those decisions I made myself.

170
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,549
That's why he says nothing about it to you.

171
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,897
I'm afraid that Kiritsugu Emiya,

172
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:57,754
and the hero Arturia will never
get along with each other.

173
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,929
He must've resigned himself to that fact.

174
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,488
He wants to use the Holy
Grail's power to save the world.

175
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,831
That is his ambition and yours, correct?

176
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,134
Yes, but you must understand that
I get my beliefs directly from him.

177
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:24,637
My own desire for the Grail is exactly the same.

178
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,509
It is my fervent wish to save Britain
since I could not protect it in life.

179
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,404
I think what you and Kiritsugu seek is right and
just, something to be proud of.

180
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,061
Our next match won't happen until you come back
from your trip to Japan, will it?

181
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,354
That's right.

182
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,891
How long do you think your work
will keep you and Mommy away from home?

183
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,490
When will you come back?

184
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,106
I should be back here in two weeks or so.

185
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,615
Your mom won't be back for quite a while, though.

186
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,949
Yeah, Mommy told me about that already.

187
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:10,811
She said we'd be apart for a long time.

188
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:16,050
She also told me that even if we don't
see each other for a long, long time,

189
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,210
she'll always be right here by my side,

190
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,105
so I shouldn't ever feel lonely.

191
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:22,378
She told me that before I went to sleep.

192
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,404
I'm gonna be together with Mommy,

193
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,090
well, forever and ever and ever!

194
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,385
I see.

195
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,326
Listen, Ilya.

196
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,903
Daddy?

197
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,528
Can you wait for me, Ilya?

198
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,216
Even if you're lonely, can you last till I come home?

199
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,671
Mhm!

200
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,465
Good, then I promise you I'll be home

201
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,673
before you know it.

202
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:09,853
Fill, fill.

203
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:13,290
Fill her up, fill.

204
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:16,111
Repeat four times.

205
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,897
Or was it five times?

206
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:22,145
Um, and then I have to destroy it each time it's filled.

207
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:23,827
Wait, is that right?

208
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:30,214
All right, now,
fill and fill and fill and fill and fill.

209
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,115
Okay, that's five times.

210
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:33,446
Right!

211
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:38,998
At all three murder scenes,
officials tell us a mysterious pentagram

212
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:42,657
was found drawn in the victim's blood.
Police speculate...

213
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:46,150
Do you think that maybe I
went a little bit too far?

214
00:14:56,976 --> 00:15:00,765
Hey, do you believe in terrible demons, kiddo?

215
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,428
All the newspapers and magazines right now
are saying I'm some kind of terrible demon.

216
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:10,216
But suppose demons like that
really did exist in the world.

217
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:12,875
I mean, wouldn't that be awfully rude to them?

218
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:15,432
You've gotta be pretty clear about these things.

219
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:18,837
Yo, I am Ryunosuke Uryu, and I am a demon!

220
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:22,039
Ah‐ha, I don't know if that's
the right way to go about it.

221
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:25,345
But look, I found this little baby!

222
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,657
It's some dusty old book from
deep inside our big storehouse.

223
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:34,386
Looks like some of my ancestors were doing a bunch
of research on how to go about summoning demons!

224
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:37,923
So, like, I've just gotta find
out if there really are demons!

225
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:39,045
Understand?

226
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:41,840
But you know, if a demon really did appear,

227
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:44,963
it would be pretty stupid of me
to just chat with it for a while

228
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:47,962
and then just send it back to
whatever pit of Hell it came from.

229
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:52,505
So, kid, if a demon does show up around here,

230
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,780
would you mind letting it kill ya?

231
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:04,313
I wonder what it's like being killed by a demon!

232
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:06,288
How many people get to find out?

233
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:11,036
Wait a minute, what's that?

234
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:39,327
I'll ask you, you who calls to me,

235
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:44,317
oh, summoner who manifests me
within the vessel of a caster,

236
00:16:44,892 --> 00:16:46,976
I ask you your name.

237
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:48,149
Who?

238
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,004
Who art thou?

239
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:59,072
Um, uh, well, I'm Ryunosuke Uryu,
and I'm currently working odd jobs.

240
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,005
My hobby is murder of all varieties.

241
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:03,633
I really like kids and sometimes young women.

242
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:07,412
Very well, the pact is now officially sealed.

243
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:12,430
It's my irresistible desire to possess
the Holy Grail exactly as you do.

244
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:17,920
The sacred vessel of paradise,
the cup of awesome and terrible power will be ours!

245
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:20,033
The Holy... what?

246
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:24,511
Anyway, how would you like a little
snack just to kick things off right?

247
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:26,972
Here, wanna eat this kid?

248
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:37,744
Wow, that's human skin, isn't it?

249
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,668
Don't be frightened, little boy.

250
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:13,115
You'll be fine.

251
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:24,321
Can you stand?

252
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:27,773
All right, now, little boy.

253
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:30,895
You can leave the room through
that door right over there.

254
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:32,832
You think you can manage that?

255
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:41,252
Hey, what are you doing?

256
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,014
Shh.

257
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:15,951
Terror has its degrees of freshness.

258
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,768
The more intense the fear,

259
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:20,838
the more all of the other emotions die.

260
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:26,694
Terror, in its truest sense,
is not a static state, but rather a dynamic one.

261
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:31,684
It is the sublime moment when
shining hope turns to utter despair.

262
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,506
Did you enjoy that?

263
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:38,804
The tantalizing flavor of fresh terror and bloody death?

264
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:42,923
Cool!

265
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:44,377
You are awesome!

266
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:46,337
You are the coolest thing ever!

267
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:52,082
Okay, look, I don't know anything about this Grail
crap, but from this moment on, I am with you.

268
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:53,280
Let's go kill!

269
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,756
I want you to take me out and show me
even cooler ways to torture and kill!

270
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,706
Ah... the name is Ryunosuke, correct?

271
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:06,118
What a magnificent omen to be blessed with
such an understanding master like yourself.

272
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:10,197
I feel my darkest dream is nearly within my grasp.

273
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:13,065
Oh, hey, I didn't get your name.

274
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:14,234
What is it?

275
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,275
You wish to know my name.

276
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:22,116
Let me see now, in this era,
the most common name for me would be, uh...

277
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,702
perhaps for now I'll just call myself Bluebeard.

278
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,334
The church contacted me.

279
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:39,920
They said that the seventh servant,
a caster has finally appeared.

280
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:42,942
The final servant has been summoned?

281
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:44,475
Then it's time.

282
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:45,988
Indeed.

283
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:50,756
You are to leave here now,
and head immediately to Tohsaka Manor.

284
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:53,704
And once I arrive?

285
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:58,205
The Manor is surrounded by a number
of powerful magical barriers,

286
00:20:58,352 --> 00:21:00,913
but they should be child's play for you.

287
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:04,640
Are you sure about this?

288
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:09,079
I was under the impression that you
were allies with Tokiomi Tohsaka.

289
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,085
Don't you worry about that.

290
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:16,495
Even if it means you have to engage Archer in
battle, there's no need to fear.

291
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:22,832
No need to fear Archer, one of the three
great Knight classes of the Grail Wars?

292
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:27,355
I leave the rest to you.

293
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:31,732
Eliminate Tokiomi Tohsaka at once.

294
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,426
This will be easy.

295
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:46,240
You are nothing but a slimy worm.
Who gave you permission to look up at me?

296
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:53,787
No need...to fear that, he says?

297
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:07,094
You are not worthy to gaze upon me.

298
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:13,450
A filthy worm like you should face the
ground, crawl on your stomach, and die.
