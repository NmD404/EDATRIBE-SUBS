1
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:24,052
Ah, Okeanos.

2
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,236
I have to ask, what brought on this sudden outing?

3
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,176
Why are we going into town?

4
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:50,246
No reason, change of scenery, that's all.

5
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:55,091
You've been whining all the time about wanting
to see the amusement district, haven't you?

6
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:59,135
The joy of window‐shopping in
a foreign land is every bit

7
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:02,285
as wonderful as the thrilling joy of battle.

8
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,708
I feel really bad for the countries that got
themselves invaded for a stupid reason like that.

9
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:09,098
What is it, boy?

10
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:11,978
You sound like you actually
saw something like that happen.

11
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:14,105
Never mind.

12
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:15,768
I was just thinking out loud.

13
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:57,790
No way.

14
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:00,573
This is horrible.

15
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,853
We worked so hard to create this artwork!

16
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:07,192
How could they?

17
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:12,997
What kind of... What kind of inhuman
monster would so something like this?!

18
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:19,320
Dear Ryuunosuke,

19
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:25,518
only a very select few can fully comprehend the
immense importance of true beauty and harmony.

20
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:29,126
To the vast majority of common ignorant philistines,

21
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,911
beauty is but something to be
loathed and feared and destroyed.

22
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,874
It is for that very reason that we mustn't
become excessively attached to our creations.

23
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:43,858
All things given form and substance are
destined to one day break and fade away.

24
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:50,487
It is therefore absolutely essential that we find joy in
the process of creation instead of the creation itself.

25
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:53,617
So, whatever they break, we should just make another?

26
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:54,446
Is that it?

27
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:56,147
Precisely so!

28
00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:02,250
As always, my dear Ryuunosuke, your understanding
of important matters is your best virtue.

29
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:12,835
Maybe we were just having way too much fun and so God

30
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:15,087
decided to punish us?

31
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:19,682
Listen carefully to what I say to you now, Ryuunosuke!

32
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:22,743
God does not punish humans ever!

33
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:25,025
He simply toys with them, cruelly.

34
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:26,672
B... big guy?

35
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:33,594
Once, long ago, I committed spectacular atrocities
the likes of which this Earth had never imagined.

36
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,494
Day after day, I murdered and defiled,
yet no divine punishment rained down on me.

37
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:46,334
Before I knew it, eight years had passed and my
exploration into the depths of evil had been ignored.

38
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:47,927
In the end,

39
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:51,192
it was not God that destroyed
me and took away my life,

40
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:54,413
but rather the selfishness of my fellow Man.

41
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:58,919
The church and the state executed me,
not for anything wrong that I had done,

42
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:04,200
but because they coveted my wealth and my land and
wanted to take them from me and make them their own!

43
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,001
What brought an end to my evil
deeds was far from judgment;

44
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:10,689
it was simple theft by a pack of criminals!

45
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,542
Uh, yeah, but, big guy.

46
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,814
There's... there's still a God, right?

47
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:26,733
Why ever would you think that? You, who are without
faith and have never in your life known a miracle.

48
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:29,793
Because the world seems like it's so boring.

49
00:05:30,353 --> 00:05:34,911
But then, the more you look, the more you find
all kinds of neat and crazy stuff around you!

50
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:36,953
I've always thought that way.

51
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:42,840
A world filled with so many wondrous and amazing things
like this could never have happened simply by chance.

52
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:48,716
If you set your mind to enjoying it, there's no
better entertainment than this unbelievable world!

53
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:55,119
I'm sure there's a master entertainer somewhere writing
the story of all five billion people in this world.

54
00:05:55,642 --> 00:06:01,975
If you wanted to describe somebody like that, what
other name could you possibly call Him but God Himself?

55
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:08,113
Then, Ryuunosuke, do you believe that
it's possible God loves humanity?

56
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,530
What do you mean?
He's head over heels.

57
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:14,951
I mean, if He's spending every minute
of every day writing our story,

58
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:17,693
well,
He could never do it if He didn't love us.

59
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:21,111
In fact, I'll bet you He's totally into it,

60
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:24,650
along with totally enjoying the results of His own work.

61
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:29,863
He also loves all the things that make humans look
good, like honor, courage, and hope,

62
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:33,341
and at the very same time, He loves screams and blood

63
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,253
and utter despair just as much.

64
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:40,554
If He didn't, there's just no way in Hell the guts of
living things would be as cool and colorful as they are.

65
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:45,353
So, I'm positive the whole world is filled
to the brim with God's love, big guy.

66
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:51,660
In this era of faithlessness when the state
has completely abandoned the true will of God,

67
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:57,903
I had no idea that such a vivacious new faith had
taken root and was beginning to bear amazing fruit.

68
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:02,839
You have my admiration, Ryuunosuke, my dear master.

69
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,151
Cut it out, I'm starting to blush.

70
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:12,543
But wait, according to your bold view of religion,
were not my blasphemies nothing more than a silly farce?

71
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,501
Not at all.

72
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,199
You know, the best entertainers

73
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:19,698
will sometimes get the most acclaim of their careers
when they play a really dark and disturbed villain.

74
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,398
I think when you get right down to it,

75
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:26,243
God probably loves playing against your
cruel and demented villain routine.

76
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:34,074
So both blasphemy and worship

77
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:38,557
are, in your eyes,
actually valid forms of Godly devotion?

78
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:41,789
Oh, that's marvelous!

79
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:46,433
Truly, you are the insightful bearer of
a brilliant and important new philosophy!

80
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:50,027
A God who makes me a puppet of man for His own sport,

81
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,597
and, at the same time, is Himself but another clown!

82
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:58,336
I see; His vicious ways finally make sense to me now!

83
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,299
Very well, then.

84
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:04,478
Let us go and paint the gardens
of the puppet master God

85
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:08,205
with even more brilliant despair
and terror and depravity.

86
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:16,003
We will show the author of this wicked world who
hides up in Heaven that God is not the only one here

87
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,682
who knows what entertainment is.

88
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:21,317
We're gonna do something awesome
again, aren't we, big guy?

89
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,936
Cool, cool!

90
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,110
All right, now.

91
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:31,963
I'll be in this bookstore for a while.

92
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:35,850
As for you, you can go do whatever you want,

93
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,425
but you're not to set foot outside this arcade.

94
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,588
If I'm attacked and kicked while I'm here,
it's curtains for you, too, understand?

95
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:45,854
Of course.

96
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:49,402
No conquering, Rider, means no plundering either.

97
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:50,435
Huh?

98
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:51,690
Huh?

99
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,618
Pay attention to me, dammit!

100
00:08:57,177 --> 00:09:00,039
There's to be no shoplifting
and no eating without paying!

101
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,095
If you want something, then pay for it with this money,

102
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,839
or am I gonna have to use a Command
Seal in order to make you behave?

103
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,085
Now, don't be rude.

104
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:16,950
Back in my day, Macedonian etiquette was the
mark of a man of culture in palaces everywhere.

105
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:18,350
I'm off.

106
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:19,638
Until later.

107
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:47,780
"The king gave control over
the lands he had conquered

108
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:51,273
and the rights to the taxes from
those lands to the local nobles.

109
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:55,373
He then mustered his armies and marched
off, taking them further east."

110
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,828
Just like in my dream.

111
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:00,888
"He continued on his campaign...

112
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,979
...because he wanted to reach Okeanos,

113
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,661
the furthest ocean."

114
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:16,992
Hey, boy, where are you?

115
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,708
Ah, yes, here you are.

116
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:27,071
You know, you're so tiny,
you're impossible to see between these bookshelves.

117
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,350
It was difficult to find you.

118
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:32,556
Normal people are smaller than bookshelves, idiot.

119
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:33,369
Man!

120
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:36,111
So, what is it you bought?

121
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,313
Feast your eyes!

122
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:42,082
It just so happens that the new Admirable
Grand Strategy videogame came out today.

123
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:44,053
First‐run, limited edition!

124
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:48,927
I suppose my luck must be pretty good today.

125
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,898
You know, there's no point is buying software

126
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,118
when you don't even have a game console.

127
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:57,351
Yes, I took care of that.

128
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:01,750
Come on, boy, let's go play in two player mode!

129
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,543
I bought us each a controller.

130
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:07,979
I'm not interested in low‐class entertainment like that.

131
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,163
It's stupid.

132
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,226
What's wrong with you?

133
00:11:11,724 --> 00:11:14,871
Why are you constantly trying to
narrow your own horizons instead of

134
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,798
broadening them
to the fullest you can?

135
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:20,204
Don't you ever get the desire to seek out something fun?

136
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,624
Shut up.

137
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,229
If I had spare time to waste on that,

138
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:26,191
I'd spend it all on a search for truth rather than...

139
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:30,256
So, what was it you found so
interesting on this shelf over here?

140
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,324
Was it this one?

141
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:37,754
Well, I'll be, this is a book about me!

142
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:40,211
You are a strange boy,

143
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:43,646
I am right here in front of you every day.

144
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:46,058
If you wanna know something, just ask me.

145
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:50,504
All right, fine then, I'll ask you!

146
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,497
According to the description of this history book,

147
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:56,928
you were really short back when you were first alive.

148
00:11:57,181 --> 00:12:00,759
So, how come you materialized
here in such an enormous body?

149
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,565
Huh, it says that I was tiny?

150
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:09,655
I've always believed that you should never
completely trust what's written in a book

151
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,382
when you don't know the person who wrote it.

152
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:18,044
Wait a minute, you mean to tell me
you're not mad they got it all wrong?

153
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:21,291
Huh, no, it doesn't really bother me.

154
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:23,207
That's strange.

155
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:26,247
Throughout history, the people in charge

156
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:30,338
have always tried their hardest to make
sure future generations remember them.

157
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:37,072
I suppose having your name recorded in the
history books is a kind of noble immortality.

158
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:42,663
But if that means my name and nothing
else gets passed down for two millennia,

159
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:48,568
I would have preferred to have...even
a hundredth of that added to my life.

160
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:53,709
So, then...it's true that
you died in your early 30s?

161
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,421
Hmm, yes, that one's true.

162
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,450
Oh.

163
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:04,478
Hey, big guy!

164
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:12,744
Get going out there and show us some cool
gig that's gonna shock even God, okay?!

165
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:16,359
You may look forward to it, Ryuunosuke!

166
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:20,018
It will be the greatest "cool!"
you have ever seen in your life!

167
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:21,548
Seriously?

168
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:25,172
All right, I can't wait to see it!

169
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:26,867
Uh.

170
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,687
Oh, yeah, something really awesome
is gonna happen here, I just know it!

171
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:57,351
Hey, why are you being so quiet, boy?

172
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:58,158
Hmm?

173
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:04,424
It's nothing, I was just thinking
about how boring you are.

174
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,144
What, you were?

175
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:08,928
See, you are bored, just as I thought.

176
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,445
Just quit whining and play this game with me.

177
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:12,755
That's not it!

178
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:17,936
You see, with a servant like you
who's practically guaranteed to win,

179
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,922
I couldn't take pride in winning the grail.

180
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:27,698
It would have been a lot better for both of us
if my pact had been with Assassin instead of you!

181
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:31,461
Mmm, I don't think that would
have worked out for you at all.

182
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:34,538
I think by now, you'd be deceased.

183
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:35,809
Well, that's fine!

184
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:39,394
If I'm going to die fighting in my own
battle, I'm not going to complain!

185
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,840
That's the reason why I decided to join the Grail War,

186
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:44,229
and now...

187
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,294
I really don't know what to tell you, boy.

188
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:52,812
If the wish you have for the Holy Grail was
something that impressed me in some form or manner,

189
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:58,337
I would be far more inclined to enthusiastically
obey your every whim and desire.

190
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:04,069
But if all you want it for is to add a few
centimeters to your diminutive stature...

191
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:06,479
You have no idea what you're talking about!

192
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,703
You don't need to be in such a hurry.

193
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:14,011
Nobody said that the Holy Grail War would be the
single most important event of your entire life.

194
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:15,310
There will be others.

195
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:16,104
What?

196
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:22,319
When the day finally arrives that you find a
way to live that you can truly be proud of,

197
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:24,919
you'll be forced into your own grand battle,

198
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,696
one that you will have to fight
whether you want to or not.

199
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:31,104
You will have plenty of time, then,

200
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,085
to look for your battlefield.

201
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:35,980
I'm saying that I'm not the only one here

202
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,504
who isn't satisfied with this pact.

203
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:39,439
Mmm?

204
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:42,122
You don't like it any more than I do, right?

205
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,013
Having me as your sworn master, I mean.

206
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:47,633
You'd have been able
to win this war easier

207
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:50,735
if only you'd sworn your allegiance
to a different master, right?

208
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,026
Probably, yes.

209
00:16:05,806 --> 00:16:07,126
Take a look, boy.

210
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:10,391
You see, you're looking at the
real enemy that I'm facing.

211
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:15,980
Now, try to draw a picture of the two
of us standing alongside this enemy.

212
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:20,146
Draw it so you can tell the difference in our sizes.

213
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:23,262
Wait, what do you mean,
that's...  Impossible, right?

214
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,993
Compared to the enemy that we're about to take on,

215
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:29,503
you and I are the same, just little dots.

216
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,538
What point is there in trying to compare our sizes?

217
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:36,661
That is exactly why I'm excited!

218
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,187
The weakest and the smallest; that's just perfect!

219
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,841
With a body tinier than a poppy seed,

220
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:46,605
I will someday overtake and
even surpass the entire world!

221
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,835
Nothing can ever stop my quest,

222
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,947
for in my chest beats the invincible
heart of the King of Conquerors!

223
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:58,119
So, what you're saying is who your
master is makes no difference.

224
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:04,518
No matter how weak I am, it really doesn't
matter one way or the other to you?

225
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:07,227
Now, where did you get that stupid idea?

226
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:14,858
That miserable complaining nature of yours is a
sign that somewhere inside you is a conqueror.

227
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,191
No matter what you want me to believe,

228
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:20,328
you are acutely aware of how small you are

229
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:22,469
and yet, in spite of that,

230
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:26,666
you still struggle to reach heights greater
than you could ever begin to imagine.

231
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:30,060
It's not a compliment; you're making fun of me.

232
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:31,653
Indeed, boy.

233
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:35,419
Face it, you are a stubborn and incorrigible idiot.

234
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:39,893
Your deepest desires are far greater than yourself.

235
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,857
Like they say, glory lies beyond the horizon.

236
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,438
Back in the world that I lived in,
that was the fundamental rule of a full life.

237
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:51,676
Is that why you kept rushing towards the
east all the time like some kind of idiot?

238
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:53,691
Of course, that's right!

239
00:17:54,117 --> 00:18:00,520
I wanted to see Okeanos with my own eyes, but,
alas, my glorious dream was never realized.

240
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:01,334
Huh?

241
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:04,764
You never saw the ocean like in my dream?

242
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:10,689
Even now, boy,
Okeanos remains the place I strive for.

243
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,470
It is a never‐ending dream.

244
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:19,653
That sea in my dream was really an image
of the heart that Rider has been dreaming.

245
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:20,988
Laugh if you like.

246
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:27,615
I, who after 2,000 years still dream the same dream
about a place he's never seen, am a great fool.

247
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:32,549
So, you see, boy, a pact with an idiot like you

248
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,810
is just perfect for me.

249
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:43,330
The river, I feel it.

250
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:48,279
Can you see what is happening?

251
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,485
Could it be him, Lancer?

252
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:53,069
It is Caster, indeed.

253
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:56,117
He is positioned on the river and is doing something;

254
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:59,070
however, I cannot make out what exactly.

255
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:02,733
It's the perfect chance to attack and put him down.

256
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:03,880
Agreed.

257
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:12,415
If I can defeat Caster, I can regain one
of the bonds with Lancer that I lost.

258
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:17,180
I will go and engage him, you stay here, Madam Sola‐Ui,

259
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:20,024
and bear witness to the deeds I perform.

260
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:21,290
What do you mean?

261
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,845
But I have to go, I'm a master now!

262
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,328
I'll be by your side.

263
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:26,748
You mustn't, Madam.

264
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:30,684
You do not understand military
matters as Master Kayneth does.

265
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:33,826
That river will become a deathtrap.

266
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,649
Please understand.

267
00:19:36,678 --> 00:19:37,733
But, I...

268
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:44,173
Unless, perhaps, you still harbor doubts as to
where the true loyalty of Diarmuid actually lies,

269
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,833
that he would fight to serve his own ends?

270
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:54,088
Lancer, go fight as you will,
I leave field decisions to you.

271
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:57,632
Fight the battle freely and without any regret.

272
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,136
I am in your debt.

273
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,360
If you return victorious,

274
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:12,941
I hope you'll grant me a smile, Lancer.

275
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,737
Caster.

276
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:36,517
This incredible outpouring of
mana from him leaves me no doubts.

277
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:40,558
Caster is in the process of
casting some incredible magic.

278
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,565
Hmm?

279
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:49,369
Greetings and welcome, Holy Virgin!

280
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:53,615
I am incredibly overjoyed that
we find ourselves together again.

281
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:56,181
You just never
learn, you monster!

282
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,161
What is it you're trying to do here?

283
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:00,431
I'm terribly sorry, my dear Jeanne,

284
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,921
but you're not the guest of honor this evening.

285
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,122
But if you care to join us in our revelries,
it would give me the greatest pleasure

286
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:10,895
and fulfill the deepest wishes of my tortured soul.

287
00:21:11,255 --> 00:21:16,057
At this banquet of death and decadence that
I, Gilles de Rais, have prepared!

288
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:20,270
You are welcome to come and eat your fill and be sated!

289
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,014
And now, once again,
we raise the blood‐soaked flag of salvation!

290
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:34,372
Unbelievable, Caster is being absorbed?

291
00:21:34,737 --> 00:21:37,667
You who are abandoned gather here!

292
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,201
I shall lead you, I shall rule you.

293
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:47,970
The resentment and rage of we, the oppressed,
shall reach onto the lofty throne of God Himself.

294
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:51,598
God in Heaven, with words of condemnation,

295
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:54,113
I praise Your holy name!

296
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,388
What in the world?

297
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,863
Oh, eminent God!

298
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:01,204
Oh, cruel God!

299
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:05,009
We shall pull you down from your throne!

300
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:15,487
Hail, King of Knights.

301
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:16,947
King of Conquerors.

302
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:18,381
Now, just wait a minute,

303
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:20,402
we're calling a truce for the night.

304
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:25,997
We won't be able to have any kind of meaningful fight
unless we deal with that behemoth Caster created.

305
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:28,683
I have been going around informing everyone

306
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:31,007
and Lancer has agreed to come.

307
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:33,217
He should be here any minute now.

308
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,571
Understood, we will fight alongside you.

309
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:42,612
Our alliance will be short,
but let us pledge our loyalties.

310
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:45,476
Hey, Einzbern, you guys got a plan?

311
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:49,401
We haven't faced Caster yet and
Lancer told me you fought him already.

312
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:50,869
What do you think we should do?

313
00:22:50,962 --> 00:22:53,548
Just defeat him as quickly as we can.

314
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:58,907
That horrid monster is maintaining itself
in this world by using Caster's mana,

315
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,905
but if it gets its own food source and
starts to become self‐sustaining...

316
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:05,336
We must stop Caster before then!

317
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:06,556
Yes, I follow you.

318
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:11,892
We need to settle this before it manages
to come ashore and begins to feed itself.

319
00:23:12,552 --> 00:23:17,608
The problem is Caster's encased himself
deep inside those thick walls of flesh.

320
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:20,047
I'm not sure what to do.

321
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:23,471
Drag him out, that's the only way.

322
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,563
If we can expose his noble phantasm,

323
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:31,908
then my Gáe Dearg can destroy the spell with one strike.

324
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:36,442
Lancer, do you think you can strike
Caster's noble phantasm from the shore?

325
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:40,867
If I can just see it, it'll be child's play.

326
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:43,749
Then Rider and I will act as the advance guard.

327
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:46,157
Acceptable, King of Conquerors?

328
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,399
That is fine.

329
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:50,621
My chariot has no need of roads, of course.

330
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:54,755
But, Saber, how are you going to
attack the enemy in the river?

331
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:58,434
My body has been blessed by the Lady of the Lake.

332
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:02,430
Water cannot stop me,
however many fathoms deep it may be.

333
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:03,867
Oh, very impressive.

334
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:05,520
That is quite a rare skill.

335
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:09,244
I want for you to serve under my command even more now.

336
00:24:09,964 --> 00:24:13,491
You will pay for your words
some other time, but for now,

337
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:17,299
we need to drag Caster out from
within that monster and destroy him.

338
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:21,278
Indeed, then I shall take the lead!

339
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:23,119
Let us begin!

340
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:24,326
Yah!

341
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:32,413
Saber, good luck.

342
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:50,385
Let's finish this, Caster!

343
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:51,768
Now!
