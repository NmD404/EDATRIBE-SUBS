1
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:12,354
Irisviel.

2
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:16,909
Have I lost them?

3
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:20,660
If I can't see them anymore, then I'll sense them.

4
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,824
A chariot?

5
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:29,059
I have you now, Rider.

6
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,453
Hey, Rider, check it out!

7
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:42,580
Doesn't it seem like she's following us?

8
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,847
Well, well, if it isn't Saber herself.

9
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:49,478
This saves us having to search for her.

10
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:51,359
Hey, boy, tell me something.

11
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:54,934
Motorcycles don't usually travel that fast, do they?

12
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,269
A motorcycle, that thing?

13
00:02:57,837 --> 00:02:59,846
No, no way, that's impossible!

14
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:04,275
Of course, with Saber's skill at riding,
we don't really know what it can do.

15
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:07,268
This will be fun!

16
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:12,155
Well, I will also have to do my part to
make this exchange with her interesting.

17
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,476
Huh... we're going down?

18
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,657
Change of plans.

19
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:19,520
I shall use an ordinary race
to settle things with the girl.

20
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,395
Yah!

21
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:27,060
Whoa!

22
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,954
I'm okay, but just try and be careful, okay?

23
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:34,096
Don't worry!

24
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:38,023
Nothing in heaven or on Earth can
stop me from being victorious!

25
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:39,303
Yah!

26
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:56,497
This is bad.

27
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,784
I'm reaching the machine's limits.

28
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:00,690
At this rate...

29
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,734
and I'm so close.

30
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,762
Invisible Air!

31
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:34,145
No way.

32
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,316
She's closing the gap!

33
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,004
She's gonna catch up to us!

34
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:49,331
Ha... a mechanical contraption like
that going so fast is splendid!

35
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:52,530
But this is a battle chariot we are riding.

36
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,131
It's a fair race, but it needn't be polite!

37
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:02,059
This is what you get if you want to chase Iskander!

38
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:22,148
Excellent!

39
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,845
You really are the proud King of Knights.

40
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:28,448
Truly the beautiful flower of the battlefield!

41
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,631
Do not underestimate me!

42
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:55,473
Rider!

43
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,950
Prepare yourself!

44
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,967
Irisviel isn't here?

45
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:18,757
Impossible.

46
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:21,861
That was definitely Rider.

47
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:25,147
So then where is she?

48
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:33,786
Did you really think you could
trick me by imitating a servant?

49
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:39,522
Rider's master lacks the intel‐gathering
skills to have found that place.

50
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:43,221
Tohsaka could not possibly have attacked in his state.

51
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:45,381
And so, by process of elimination,

52
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,551
only the Matous could have abducted Irisviel.

53
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:54,149
Answer me, where is Irisviel?

54
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:55,726
I don't know!

55
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,697
I don't know anything!

56
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,443
Then where is Kariya Matou?

57
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:01,696
Kariya?

58
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,426
I have no idea where that fool is!

59
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:10,335
I don't know... I really don't know anything!

60
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,309
He left this morning with some guy

61
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,863
who said he was the overseer from the church!

62
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:18,769
Did you see Overseer?

63
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,747
Hmm.

64
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:27,278
Kirei Kotomine.

65
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,648
I didn't expect the real Rider to suddenly appear there.

66
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:38,447
Truly a fortuitous development.

67
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:41,999
You seem to have been blessed by good luck.

68
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:45,925
It favors you on the battlefield, Kariya Matou.

69
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:49,760
Father, was this deception

70
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:54,398
really worth the use of two of my three command seals?

71
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:57,506
You don't need to worry about that, Kariya.

72
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,012
Now, hold out your hand.

73
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:13,817
As long as you work with me,

74
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,369
you may use your command seals
without the slightest hesitation.

75
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:21,923
Hmm, very impressive.

76
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,165
A transformation ability of all things.

77
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:33,380
His Noble Phantasm is far too good
for someone of the Berserker class.

78
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,104
There are lots of stories of
him succeeding

79
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:40,145
by disguising himself as another
knight in pursuit of some heroic deed.

80
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:44,692
Even with the command seals, this is the best result?

81
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:49,980
Your servant's obsessive fixation
on Saber is awe‐inspiring.

82
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:53,003
Enough, be gone Berserker!

83
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:03,727
This woman, is she really the vessel for the Holy Grail?

84
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,877
More accurately, her insides are.

85
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,625
Don't worry about a thing, Kariya.

86
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:14,045
As promised, I shall gladly give you the Holy Grail.

87
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:19,106
But before that, there is the other
promise you made to me, Father.

88
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:23,369
Oh, that...  everything is arranged.

89
00:09:24,082 --> 00:09:27,339
At midnight tonight, go to the Fuyuki Church.

90
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:30,423
You will find Tokiomi Tohsaka there.

91
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:36,705
Don't forget, now, Kariya.

92
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:41,531
Tonight at midnight, your wish will be fulfilled.

93
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:50,754
Now then, I've sent Kariya away.

94
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:52,529
I don't know who you are,

95
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:55,163
but I suggest you show yourself now.

96
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,189
Ah, you sensed me.

97
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:03,721
You are indeed a veteran inquisitor.

98
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:06,889
So you're Zouken Matou.

99
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:08,562
That's correct.

100
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,956
Rider, are you sure?

101
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,763
We're really going to attack from right here?

102
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,939
From this range?

103
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:22,064
Straight ahead?

104
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:27,193
The sword of light we saw her use against Caster

105
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:29,288
has a delay before activation.

106
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:31,030
We'll strike then.

107
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,800
Why would you do something so crazy?

108
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:37,003
Precisely because it is, boy.

109
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:39,621
If she loses after all this,

110
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:42,911
her defeat will be bitterly devastating and complete.

111
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:47,751
She may even change her mind and
decide to be my vassal after all.

112
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:50,700
You wanna win her that badly.

113
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:55,216
Right now, on the battlefield,
she is like a star fallen down to Earth.

114
00:10:55,798 --> 00:11:01,553
Only as a part of my glorious army will she
truly be able to shine in her full brilliance!

115
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:08,863
In all his campaigns, he was never
interested in his opponent's power or wealth.

116
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,842
Without destroying or degrading them,

117
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:14,628
he sought to rule their very souls,

118
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:18,236
thus was he the King of Conquerors.

119
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:20,997
Very well, Rider.

120
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:23,401
Win by whatever means you wish.

121
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:28,668
Boy, it seems you are finally beginning
to understand the meaning of conquest.

122
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,753
Glory lies beyond the horizon!

123
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:37,116
Let us go now!

124
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:40,089
Via Expugnatio

125
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,453
Wind!

126
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,000
Ex...

127
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,798
...calibur!

128
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:15,859
What is it you want, Zouken Matou?

129
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,202
Well, to tell you the truth,

130
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:26,581
I was quite interested to see what sort of clever
deception you would employ to destroy Kariya.

131
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:30,252
You would let the Matous's chance at victory slip away?

132
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:35,946
Actually, the sheer pleasure
of watching Kariya suffer...

133
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:40,867
is something I shall never tire of.

134
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,979
Victory for the Matous or a miserable end for him,

135
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,127
it's a difficult choice.

136
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:48,954
Hmm.

137
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:53,795
So, you enjoy watching your own
flesh and blood suffer like that.

138
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:55,486
Indeed.

139
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:59,620
I would've thought that you of all
people would understand that sentiment.

140
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,457
How so?

141
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:05,341
Well, you give off exactly the same scent as I do.

142
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:15,353
That of a hungry, wiggling little maggot
irresistibly attracted by the rotting meat of Kariya.

143
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:20,111
Oh, scary, scary!

144
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:23,033
You are truly a dog of the church.

145
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:26,181
I tease you at my own peril, eh?

146
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:30,337
I can assure you that we shall
see each other again, young one.

147
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,330
By the next time we meet,

148
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:34,988
see to it that you've allowed your true nature

149
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:39,963
to fully ripen, so that you and I
might fight on an equal footing.

150
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:56,682
Hmm.

151
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:58,129
Rider?

152
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:08,799
I'm sorry, boy.

153
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:10,721
I screwed up.

154
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:18,156
Rider, use Ionian Hetairoi!

155
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:24,259
The chariot is all I will use against Saber.

156
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:27,294
I understand, but still.

157
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:42,969
Wait, she left.

158
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:45,446
A motorcycle... hmm.

159
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:46,930
It's magnificent.

160
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:48,103
What the hell?

161
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,043
Those are your first words after she's defeated you?

162
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,405
By the way...

163
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:56,371
Huh?

164
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:58,857
...how are we supposed to get back to town?

165
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:04,180
Well, I suppose we'll have to walk.

166
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:06,187
I was afraid of that.

167
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,306
How many more days do I have?

168
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,979
How many more times can I fight?

169
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,595
But I can't die now.

170
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,061
Not yet.

171
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,238
Tokiomi Tohsaka!

172
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,357
So did you think you killed me, Tokiomi?

173
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:12,183
Well, you blew it.

174
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:16,486
Until I make you pay for that,

175
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:18,927
I'll keep coming back to...

176
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:30,626
Tohsaka!

177
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,422
What?

178
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,503
Kariya?

179
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:07,120
Aoi?

180
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,837
No, wait, it wasn't me!

181
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:11,430
He was...

182
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,046
Are you satisfied now, Kariya?

183
00:17:56,636 --> 00:18:00,056
Now that Matous are sure to win the Holy Grail War?

184
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,190
But I... I didn't.

185
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:08,156
Why?

186
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:13,939
Ripping Sakura completely out of my life wasn't enough?

187
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:17,671
Of all the cruel things you could've done,

188
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:20,195
you had to kill him right in front of me?

189
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,142
Why?

190
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,715
But he... it was all his fault!

191
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,250
If it weren't for what he did,

192
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,156
no one would've ever had to suffer!

193
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,245
You, Aoi, or Sakura!

194
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,428
You could've had a happy life!

195
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:38,873
You shut your mouth!

196
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,817
What could you...

197
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,710
what could you possibly know about it?

198
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,431
You...

199
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:50,012
you've never...

200
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:56,197
You've never loved anyone in your entire life!

201
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,951
There was someone I loved.

202
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,635
She was warm and kind.

203
00:19:04,037 --> 00:19:06,524
I wanted her to be happier than anyone else.

204
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:09,251
For her, I would lay down my life.

205
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,566
That's why I've endured this pain until now.

206
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:19,146
Endured, endured, endured, endured,
endured, endured, endured it all!

207
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,760
I can't let her deny everything I've been through.

208
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:24,485
A lie, a lie, a lie, I do have someone...

209
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,986
there is someone in this world that I love!

210
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,647
Who did I do this for?

211
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,162
Whose fault is it?

212
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:33,150
If I'm going to die, I may as well!

213
00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:01,215
Hmm, it was trite and full of clichés,

214
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:04,955
but still, I have to say, not bad for your first script.

215
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,466
Well, Kirei?

216
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,463
What are your impressions?

217
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,382
It seems the taste of wine changes

218
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,252
far more than I ever expected.

219
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:36,807
Well, then I believe that you're finally beginning
to know what it means to expand your horizons.

220
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,927
If it will taste as wonderful as this has,

221
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,879
then I would dearly love

222
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,625
to sample it once again.
