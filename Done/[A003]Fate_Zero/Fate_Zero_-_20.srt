1
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,180
Kiritsugu.

2
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,257
I'm not dreaming, am I?

3
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:06,530
You really came?

4
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,774
You really came to see me again.

5
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,810
Yes, that's right.

6
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,592
Thank you.

7
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,590
My last task

8
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,434
is to return this to you.

9
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:41,593
Take it.

10
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:47,014
From now on, you will be the
one who will be needing Avalon.

11
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:50,977
When you begin your final battle for the Grail,

12
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,734
I'm sure it will aid you.

13
00:02:58,202 --> 00:02:59,222
You know what?

14
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:01,496
I'm really happy.

15
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:06,416
To love, to be loved.

16
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:10,616
To have a husband and daughter for nine whole years.

17
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:14,061
I'm grateful.

18
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:16,254
You gave me everything.

19
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,104
You gave me all the happiness in the world.

20
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:24,114
Something that was never meant for me.

21
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:30,306
I'm sorry, I wanted to show
you much more of this world.

22
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:33,342
No, it was enough.

23
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:38,188
If there's still any happiness left to experience,

24
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:41,705
I want you to give it all to our sweet Ilya,

25
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,960
to your daughter.

26
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:48,271
Our angel, our beloved Ilya.

27
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:53,474
I want you to promise

28
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:56,115
to bring Ilya to this country someday.

29
00:03:56,649 --> 00:04:02,650
Promise me that you'll show her everything
that I didn't get to see, amazing things.

30
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:05,559
Blossoming cherry trees,

31
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,241
and the summer clouds.

32
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:10,965
I will.

33
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,955
Okay, I have to go.

34
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:19,094
Yes, you be careful.

35
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:21,669
I love you.

36
00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:33,588
Saber is heading to Rider's hideout right now.

37
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:35,010
Is that correct?

38
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,447
Yes, she's on her way.

39
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,470
I'm going to kill Tokiomi Tohsaka.

40
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,998
If Rider and Saber engage in battle

41
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:46,135
there's a good chance Archer will also appear.

42
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:47,637
I'll hit him there.

43
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:51,607
I want you to stay here and watch over Iri.

44
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:52,949
I understand.

45
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:55,910
Um, Kiritsugu.

46
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:00,257
Finally.

47
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:02,755
You look focused.

48
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,016
Just like you used to.

49
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:17,985
I don't feel a servant's presence.

50
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,136
There's no barrier?

51
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:52,573
What's going on?

52
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,195
So, is that good?

53
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:01,646
Nope, it's awful.

54
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,852
Guess Japanese cuisine isn't that good after all.

55
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:11,181
Boy, you walked right by Okonomiyaki Shoki
in Newtown without even stopping to look.

56
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:14,360
Their modanyaki was a thing of beauty.

57
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,535
Too bad you didn't pick up any of that.

58
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:21,571
If you wanna eat there again, you're gonna have
to recover enough so that you can materialize.

59
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:24,822
Do you recognize this spot?

60
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,515
This is the place where I summoned you.

61
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:32,250
It's the Fuyuki location with the
leylines that suit you best, remember?

62
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,540
You should be able to recover much more quickly here.

63
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:39,557
I've decided that I'm staying here all day.

64
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,154
Just sleeping, that's all.

65
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,815
So take my mana, as much as you want.

66
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:45,906
Just don't kill me.

67
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,537
Maybe it'll help you feel a little bit better.

68
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:54,210
If you had already figured it out

69
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:56,405
you should've said something earlier.

70
00:06:56,566 --> 00:07:02,766
Finding out afterwards that someone's been onto you the
whole time is... well, well, it's a bit embarrassing.

71
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:05,714
You idiot, you should've just told me about it!

72
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:09,585
If you aren't at full strength
at the exact moment I need you

73
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,827
I'll be the one who ends up in danger.

74
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:18,859
Why didn't you say anything, Rider?

75
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:23,089
I thought that maybe I could tough
it out a little while longer,

76
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:27,094
but the fatigue from the river battle
has hit me harder than I expected.

77
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,415
Yeah, well, when it's all said and done,

78
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,492
your Noble Phantasm consumes a ton of power.

79
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:35,830
At first, I didn't really notice.

80
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:41,592
Because it wasn't affecting me I thought it
was all incredibly efficient or something.

81
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:49,845
Rider, honestly, instead of using mana
that was supposed to come from me ,

82
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:53,002
you managed to use your own stored power, didn't you?

83
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:56,578
And not only that, you did it twice.

84
00:07:57,762 --> 00:07:59,629
What's the big idea doing that?

85
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:02,690
Well, you know,

86
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:06,425
I mean, when you get right down to it, as a servant,

87
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:09,377
I'm a natural soul eater of sorts.

88
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:12,983
If I involve you when I expend mana at my maximum rate

89
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:15,982
it could put your life at serious risk.

90
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:18,803
Yeah, but I'm fine with that.

91
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:21,856
This is a battle that I got us into.

92
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:25,108
Unless I bleed or make sacrifices,

93
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,276
there's no point at all of winning this war.

94
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,360
Hmmm.

95
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,847
All I wanted was to prove myself,

96
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:38,448
that I could... that someone just like me

97
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:41,499
can take whatever it is he wants with his own two hands.

98
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,272
But boy, I hope you realize that all of
that only applies if the Grail truly exists.

99
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:51,565
You know, I once did something similar.

100
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:55,737
Fought ferociously for something
that might not have even existed.

101
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:57,497
Oceanus.

102
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,054
That's right.

103
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,688
I said I'd show them Oceanus,

104
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:08,319
and they were so swept up by my story that they
all followed me on my quest without a single doubt.

105
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:11,314
Many died along the way,

106
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,245
all dreaming of Oceanus until the very end.

107
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:19,027
When I gained this era's
knowledge, it hit my really hard.

108
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:22,680
I'd had no idea the world was an enclosed sphere.

109
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,723
What a bad joke.

110
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:28,635
But even so, when I saw the map,

111
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,192
I had no choice but to accept it.

112
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:38,752
It seems I've had my fill of
letting people die for fairytales.

113
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,491
If the Grail's existence was
certain,

114
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,271
I'd have no objection to you risking
your life in an effort to possess it.

115
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:50,385
But unfortunately, that is not the case.

116
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:51,666
Even so...

117
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:56,867
don't you forget, I am still your master.

118
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:05,843
Boy, learned to talk back now, have you?

119
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:06,885
Excellent.

120
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:12,554
It's true, your magic circuits
are more powerful than usual.

121
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:18,321
If I rest all day I should be ready
to go another round come nightfall.

122
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,489
Oh yeah, another round?

123
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:24,162
What exactly are you planning to do next?

124
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:26,748
Hm, good question.

125
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,784
I'm thinking that we should begin with Saber.

126
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,846
At the rate you're regenerating,

127
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:36,503
how much will you be able to recover by tonight?

128
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:40,170
If I only use the Gordius Wheel for flight,

129
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:42,372
there really shouldn't be a problem.

130
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:49,530
However, I'm afraid I'll only be able to
employ my Ionioi Hetairoi one more time.

131
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:50,590
I see.

132
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:54,268
We should probably save it for
the later fight with Archer.

133
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,652
Then Rider, I don't get it.

134
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:59,746
Why is it you wanna fight Saber first?

135
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:04,245
I must defeat her, and no one else.

136
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,813
As a heroic spirit, it is my responsibility.

137
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,126
What's that mean?

138
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:13,107
If I don't show that silly girl the right path,

139
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,240
the path to true kingship,

140
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:17,488
I fear she'll never learn.

141
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,836
That would be too sad to bear thinking about.

142
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:24,057
Whatever, have it however you want.

143
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:28,320
Boy, quit keeping yourself awake and just go to sleep.

144
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:31,792
Rest is the battle that you face right now.

145
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,585
Mmm.

146
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:40,503
I am the shunned, the scorned,

147
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:43,613
the despised.

148
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:46,007
Who the hell are you?

149
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:49,622
My name is unworthy of praise.

150
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:52,124
My body unworthy of envy.

151
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,085
I am the shadow cast by the heroic spirits' light,

152
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:59,613
the darkness born in the shadow of shining legend.

153
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,508
Thus do I hate,

154
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:10,183
thus do I resent.

155
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:17,059
I feed on the lamentation of those who sink into
darkness, and curse those who shine so brightly.

156
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:21,207
Her shadow is my shame.

157
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,170
Her honor remains forever unsullied.

158
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,416
Thus am I forever looked down upon.

159
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,696
You are the sacrifice.

160
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:45,291
Healing won't help me.

161
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:47,459
I'm going to die soon.

162
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:54,279
Damn it.

163
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:04,828
Really, what a sorry sight you are.
You look absolutely terrible.

164
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:10,623
Now I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

165
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:13,132
I'm not blaming you for your current condition.

166
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:18,136
To be perfectly honest, I never would've
imagined that you'd hold out for this long.

167
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:21,405
You've really surprised me, and so,

168
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:24,363
I shall give you the ace I've
kept hidden up my sleeve,

169
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:28,239
secreted away for use at
precisely this stage of the game.

170
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:29,407
Take it.

171
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,818
It works quickly, doesn't it?

172
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,755
The worm I just gave you is very special.

173
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,776
It was the first to feed on
Sakura's innocent purity.

174
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:55,020
How does it feel, Kariya?

175
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,996
For an entire year it has been
devouring the girl's life energy.

176
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,365
It's a magnificent mana source.

177
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,715
Now, go back and fight, Kariya,

178
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:09,278
and make good use of the precious life
force you've stolen from young Sakura.

179
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,374
Go and use every ounce of your flesh
and bone to acquire the Holy Grail,

180
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,566
if someone such as you is even capable of it, that is.

181
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,733
Hey, Maiya.

182
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:28,459
I'm curious as to why you fight for Kiritsugu.

183
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,666
Because I have nothing else in life.

184
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,556
I can't remember my family or
my own name for that matter.

185
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,508
Maiya Hisau was the name on the very first fake passport

186
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,416
that Kiritsugu made for me.

187
00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:01,233
All I remember is that the place where
I came from was a terribly poor country.

188
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:03,401
The wars never ended,

189
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:06,406
even though there was no money to maintain the armies.

190
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:09,537
But day after day, they continued to kill one another.

191
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:12,747
Then one day, someone had an idea.

192
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:15,211
Rather than conscript and train soldiers,

193
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:17,853
it was cheaper and faster to abduct children

194
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:20,136
and send them out to fight the battles.

195
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,165
You mean, you were one of them?

196
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,881
Aim at the enemy and pull the trigger.

197
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:29,634
That was my sole function in life.

198
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:31,975
I threw everything else away.

199
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,279
As a human being, I'm dead inside,

200
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:38,509
but the outer shell continues to function.

201
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:41,435
Still working just like it did before.

202
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:46,244
That's always been my life,
but regardless, Kiritsugu took me in,

203
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:52,020
so however he wants to use me is fine by
me, and that's the reason I'm here.

204
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:59,609
To tell you the truth, madam,
it was your passion for all this that surprised me.

205
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:03,252
You've been secluded in the castle where you were born,

206
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:05,939
knowing so little of the outside world.

207
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,620
So I simply can't imagine why you would
fight this hard for Kiritsugu's dream.

208
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:13,223
To change a world you've never really seen.

209
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:18,080
Well, I... you're right.

210
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:21,668
I cannot truly understand Kiritsugu's ideals,

211
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:24,642
or why he holds them close to his heart.

212
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:30,272
It's as you say, I've been sheltered,

213
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:35,037
and I know practically nothing of the
world that Kiritsugu longs to change.

214
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:39,806
All the ideals I speak of are merely
words that I learned from him.

215
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:44,148
But please don't let him know that.

216
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,998
I've always told him that I thought
he was doing the right thing,

217
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:53,886
and also that those same ideals
were worth giving up my life for.

218
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:57,317
And I pretended that I understood him.

219
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,233
Then, madam, in that case,

220
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,841
have you no wish or longing of your own?

221
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:04,231
My wish?

222
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,953
Oh yes, I have one.

223
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:11,256
I wish for Kiritsugu and Saber

224
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:14,322
to prevail and win possession of the Holy Grail.

225
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:17,699
You mean, you support the Einzbern's desire

226
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:19,376
to attain the Third Magic?

227
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,150
No, what I desire is an end to conflict in the world.

228
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:28,860
If Kiritsugu's wish comes true and fighting everywhere
comes to an end,

229
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:32,624
the battles for possession of
the Holy Grail here in Fuyuki

230
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:34,510
will be no exception.

231
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:39,650
I want this fourth battle to be
the last of the Holy Grail Wars.

232
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:42,685
You mean, for your daughter?

233
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:46,726
If Kiritsugu and I fail to get the Grail,

234
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,776
then Ilya's next.

235
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:55,859
It's unfortunate, but that is the destiny
that an Einzbern homunculus must bear.

236
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:59,165
So my wish is to be the last one.

237
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:04,783
If that comes true she'll be able to live
out her life as a normal human being.

238
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:11,859
Maiya, what will you do after Kiritsugu
reaches his goal and saves the world?

239
00:18:12,602 --> 00:18:14,502
I don't expect to survive that long.

240
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,566
And even if I do,

241
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:19,945
there'll be no reason for me to exist anymore.

242
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:23,155
I'm sure it will be that kind of world

243
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:25,921
once Kiritsugu changes it.

244
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:29,060
But you do have a reason to exist.

245
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:30,364
You think so?

246
00:18:31,097 --> 00:18:35,138
You must look for your real name,
and then go out and find your family.

247
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:38,375
Those aren't things anyone should forget.

248
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:43,240
You must learn who you are and etch
yourself into the memories of others.

249
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:46,617
So live, Maiya,

250
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:49,385
for yourself and for me too.

251
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:55,657
I'll do my best, but all that has
to wait until after the battle ends.

252
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:59,904
Right now we must be cautious.
Both he and I

253
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:02,455
must stay on constant guard.

254
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:07,369
The one who died was Tokiomi Tohsaka.

255
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:13,671
Oh, Maiya, you really are stubborn.

256
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:33,023
Maiya!

257
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:34,376
Iri!

258
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,359
By my command seal, I order you!

259
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:42,691
Saber, go to the storehouse immediately!

260
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:43,945
Kiritsugu.

261
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:49,060
What happened?

262
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,311
Maiya!

263
00:19:57,469 --> 00:19:59,129
Saber.

264
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:01,320
Don't try to speak.

265
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,772
Hurry, follow him.

266
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:08,188
Don't let him escape with her.

267
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,992
Rider took madam with him.

268
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,676
But if I leave...

269
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:14,131
Don't worry.

270
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,357
I'll be just fine.

271
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:19,363
And Kiritsugu will come soon.

272
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:21,738
So, hurry.

273
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:32,148
Maiya, you have to try and hold
on until Kiritsugu returns.

274
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:35,090
I shall bring Irisviel back safe.

275
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:52,677
Rider, I can't believe it.

276
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,244
It was Rider.

277
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,214
Yes, I understand.

278
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:32,097
You mustn't cry, not over me.

279
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:39,117
You need to save those tears for your wife.

280
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:41,349
You can't cry here.

281
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:45,646
Be strong, you have to finish.

282
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:47,132
So don't cry yet.

283
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:49,121
You can't break.

284
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:51,182
You can't.

285
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:52,655
Maiya.

286
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:59,447
You know, this morning, you finally
looked like Kiritsugu, like your old self.

287
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,314
Don't lose your resolve over this.

288
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:03,381
Promise.

289
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:09,617
Don't worry, Maiya.

290
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,400
Leave the rest to Saber.

291
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:16,206
Maiya, your task here

292
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:18,367
is finished.

293
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,293
Maiya.

294
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:38,277
Maiya?
