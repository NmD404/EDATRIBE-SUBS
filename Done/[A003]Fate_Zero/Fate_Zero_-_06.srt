1
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:12,357
See, see?
I told you so!

2
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:14,821
This car takes the turns really fast!

3
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:18,182
Well, that's because you're a surprisingly good driver.

4
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:20,781
I know!

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,881
You may not believe it,
but I practice all the time!

6
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:30,250
Of all the toys Kiritsugu has brought me over the
years, this is my absolute favorite!

7
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:32,336
This is a toy?

8
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:41,427
At the castle, I was only allowed to drive
around the courtyard, so this is great!

9
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:46,048
Shouldn't we have maybe hired a professional driver?

10
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:47,720
No, that would be boring.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
I mean, it could be really dangerous.

12
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,801
What if the enemy were to suddenly
launch an attack against us?

13
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:54,847
Well, I suppose you have a point but...

14
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,400
Stop the car!

15
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:05,768
Irisviel, get out of the car

16
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,783
and stay very close to me.

17
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:10,041
This presence...

18
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,487
it's a Servant!

19
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,000
I have come for you, my sweet and holy virgin!

20
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,090
Do you know this man?

21
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,976
I've never laid eyes on him.

22
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:07,722
Oh no!

23
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:10,755
Are you saying that you've forgotten my face?

24
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:11,822
Forgotten you?

25
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,436
I've never met you in my life.

26
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,186
You mistake me for another.

27
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:16,679
Agh!

28
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,652
It's me!

29
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:20,012
It's Gilles de Rais, my darling!

30
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,964
I have prayed for your resurrection and have
been waiting for a miracle to reunite us!

31
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,995
To that end, I've come all this
way, to the end of time, my Jeanne!

32
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,679
Who is Jeanne?

33
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:33,905
I know not your name, I assure you.

34
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,202
Nor have I any idea who this Jeanne might be.

35
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,569
No...

36
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,697
No, you can't
have forgotten!

37
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,781
Not your former identity!

38
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,287
As you have seen fit to give me your name,

39
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,514
then I must, in keeping with
the chivalric code, give mine.

40
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,479
My name is Arturia,

41
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,593
the heir to Uther Pendragon,

42
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,412
and King of Britain.

43
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:59,993
I enter this battle in the Saber class.

44
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:01,199
Oh no!

45
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,479
How tragic!

46
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,130
It's so very sad!

47
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:07,682
She's lost her memory and gone completely insane!

48
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,928
Curse Him.

49
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,065
Curse Him!

50
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:15,884
Such cruel tortures God inflicts upon my
beautiful maiden! Such horrible injustices!

51
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:16,431
Enough!

52
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:17,735
You embarrass yourself!

53
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,670
Awaken, O fair one.

54
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,749
You have no need to call yourself Saber any longer.

55
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,893
Because the Holy Grail War has already ended.

56
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,122
The Grail has chosen me, Gilles,
to be its champion, with no fighting at all!

57
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:37,663
For, you see, my one and only eternal wish, the
resurrection of Jeanne d'Arc, has finally been granted!

58
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:44,726
Ha...

59
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:54,452
If you mock the true prayers of all the other
heroes again, the next strike will be real!

60
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,087
Now rise!

61
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,197
Has your heart been sealed so
tightly, my dearest Jeanne?

62
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:01,149
Very well.

63
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,156
That's too bad.

64
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:05,295
If drastic measures are called for to free your heart,

65
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,027
I will take my leave of you to go and prepare.

66
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:10,074
I swear to you, Jeanne!

67
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,883
I will not rest until I can free your soul
from the terrible prison of God's cruel curse.

68
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,627
It's very difficult to deal with one who
ignores everything that you're saying.

69
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,646
Next time, I shall strike before he speaks!

70
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,356
His type completely infuriates me.

71
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,569
However, this encounter may have
actually been a fortunate one.

72
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,673
I sensed that he was too dangerous to
face without the full use of my left hand.

73
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,812
Following Saber's Master has yielded unexpected fruits.

74
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,914
We found Caster as well.

75
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,993
Of course, we must follow him.

76
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,263
Ah, no, no.

77
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,516
The thumb needs to go like this!

78
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:08,941
That's nice!

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,647
Perfect in fact!

80
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,892
Welcome back, big guy.

81
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,161
Hey!

82
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:25,401
What the hell?

83
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,225
Accursed God!

84
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,721
He keeps an iron grip on Jeanne's
soul, refusing to let go!

85
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,782
By Jeanne I assume you mean the
girl you saw in the crystal ball?

86
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,669
We must prove the cold hear talked to her!

87
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,789
That God's power is gone and my love wasted!

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,061
That no deed no matter how foul,

89
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,711
no crime no matter how horrible
is worthy of God's punishment!

90
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,597
Yeah, I get it.

91
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,757
You're even cooler than I thought!

92
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,180
Therefore, we require greater
depravities, greater blasphemies.

93
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,066
We must erect a veritable Tower
of Babel of human sacrifices!

94
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:07,766
Mmm, uh, so basically,
from now on it's quantity over quality?

95
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,785
Indeed!

96
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,263
Exactly so!

97
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:12,689
Impressive, Ryunosuke.

98
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,132
Our first step will be sacrificing
the eleven in their cells right away.

99
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:21,568
And then, we'll go acquire some
more children for our revelries.

100
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,642
It's kind of a waste, don't you think?

101
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,229
Uh...

102
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:32,695
We interrupt this regularly scheduled program

103
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:35,782
to bring you this important breaking news.

104
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:38,090
An unexplained explosion has occurred

105
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:40,887
in the Fuyuki Coastal Warehouse District.

106
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,800
We go live to the scene.

107
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,580
Why did you fail to finish
off Saber when you faced her?

108
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,263
Not once but twice.

109
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:54,734
You made me waste the Command Seal,
and yet you couldn't finish the job, idiot!

110
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,024
Was your encounter with Saber
really that much fun for you?

111
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,159
It wasn't like that, Master.

112
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:10,222
I swear on my honor as a knight, as a Servant
of the Grail War, I will bring you Saber's head.

113
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,744
You don't need to swear to me again!

114
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:13,990
Of course you will!

115
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,609
You made a pact with me to defeat
all others for the Holy Grail.

116
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:22,225
And now you sit there like a sniveling fool
swearing to bring me the head of Saber?

117
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,523
What about this do you not understand!?

118
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:27,370
Aren't you the one who's mistaken here,

119
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:29,516
Lord El‐Melloi?

120
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:32,756
Sola‐Ui.

121
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:34,944
Lancer actually did well.

122
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,899
I'm afraid you're the one who made the mistake.

123
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:41,340
Saber is a highly skilled and powerful Servant.

124
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,943
I simply couldn't allow a chance to
defeat her pass me by without trying.

125
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:49,011
He inflicted a wound on her that cannot heal.

126
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:52,092
By letting her go, you can defeat her at your leisure.

127
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:58,428
If you're that concerned about her and her lauded
abilities, why didn't you go after her Master instead?

128
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:00,881
You merely stayed hidden and watched.

129
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:02,204
Rather pathetic.

130
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:05,346
Honestly, Kayneth.

131
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:10,035
It isn't that you don't understand your
distinct advantage over all the other Masters.

132
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,535
You were the one who ensured that.

133
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:16,579
You made a special alteration
to the usual Master‐Servant pact

134
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:19,206
that no one other than
I knows anything about.

135
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:24,928
You control Command Seals, and I act as an
additional Master and supply the Servant mana.

136
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,296
Brilliant.

137
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:30,096
You weren't the Evocation Division's
brightest star for nothing, you know?

138
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:34,354
But we must take care at the beginning.

139
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:35,563
Must we now?

140
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:38,588
So you'll hide while you make Lancer take all the risks?

141
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,428
All right, that's enough of that.

142
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:44,606
Any more will be an insult to my Master.

143
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:47,908
As a knight, I cannot allow it.

144
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:51,462
No, I didn't mean it like that!

145
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,508
I've overstepped my bounds.

146
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:54,661
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:05,993
What?

148
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,083
What's going on?

149
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:17,647
Yes, I understand.

150
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:20,613
There's a fire on the lower levels.

151
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:23,428
It can't be anything but an act of arson, of course.

152
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:24,450
Arson?

153
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:26,218
Tonight, of all nights?

154
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:28,231
They wish to empty the building.

155
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:30,491
Then it's an attack.

156
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:35,498
Saber's Master will want to take
down Lancer as soon as possible

157
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:38,248
to lift his spear's curse and make her whole.

158
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,756
Lancer, go downstairs now and defeat her.

159
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:43,806
Don't just drive her off this time.

160
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:45,268
Understood, Master.

161
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:51,161
Let's see to it that our honored guest enjoys the
amazing magical workshop of Kayneth El‐Melloi.

162
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:55,288
A perfect workshop requiring an entire floor.

163
00:10:55,593 --> 00:10:57,303
Twenty‐four layered barriers,

164
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:58,933
three mana generators,

165
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:02,433
dozens of ghosts and spirits
roaming as guard dogs.

166
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:07,069
Thousands of traps and parts of
hallways that open into other worlds.

167
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:15,022
We shall avail ourselves of all the
magical techniques we have at our disposal.

168
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,766
I shall make you retract your statements

169
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:20,331
that I am pathetic very shortly.

170
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:21,146
Oh?

171
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:22,726
I look forward to it.

172
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,435
Mr. Archibald!

173
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,954
Mr. Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald!

174
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:36,803
Are you present here?

175
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:37,395
Yes.

176
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:39,846
That was me.

177
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:41,039
Don't worry.

178
00:11:43,263 --> 00:11:48,508
Both Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald
and his wife Sola‐Ui have exited.

179
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:52,316
Hm.

180
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,529
Oh, I see.

181
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,386
Yes, yes, that's right.

182
00:11:57,472 --> 00:11:59,262
Everyone has evacuated.

183
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:00,129
Good.

184
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:03,693
Everything is ready on my end.

185
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:04,523
And you?

186
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:05,281
All green.

187
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,033
Just give the word.

188
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:47,226
Maiya?

189
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,699
The target never even moved from his position.

190
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:52,145
He didn't leave the hotel before the explosion.

191
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,773
A free fall
from 150 meters.

192
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:58,402
No magical
barrier known to man

193
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:00,595
could've saved him from that.

194
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:13,308
Maiya, withdraw.

195
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:22,806
To blow up the entire building...

196
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:27,878
I can't believe a mage would
actually do something like that.

197
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:33,446
Then again, I suppose he is
excellent at outsmarting mages.

198
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:36,262
Kirei Kotomine.

199
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,026
Oh?

200
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:39,255
I don't believe
we've ever met.

201
00:13:40,114 --> 00:13:43,707
Or do you have a good reason why
you would know who I am already?

202
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:46,933
Well, in that case, I can guess who you are.

203
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:50,869
Don't make me stand here doing all the talking, woman.

204
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,253
One word from you will suffice.

205
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,374
Tell me, where is the man who should have been here

206
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:57,758
instead of you?

207
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,812
Not bad, not bad at all.

208
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:10,796
You seem to have some training.

209
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:27,551
Hm.

210
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:37,924
There's no way she threw this gas canister.

211
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:49,252
No matter.

212
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:55,195
Just the knowledge that someone was here to save her
from the situation means tonight wasn't a total waste.

213
00:14:57,623 --> 00:14:58,673
Master Kirei.

214
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:02,812
I thought I gave you explicit orders
to stay hidden and not to expose yourself.

215
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,423
My apologies, Master.

216
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:08,448
But there is some important news that I
thought you should hear without delay.

217
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:11,303
We've located the Servant Caster.

218
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:17,123
After having Assassin perform a detailed investigation,

219
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:21,371
we learned that Caster and his Master
have kidnapped children from their beds

220
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:24,568
in the town of Miyama and the next town over.

221
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:27,125
By dawn, they had taken fifteen.

222
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,586
I would imagine

223
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,796
that they are the serial killer that's been reported
in the news and that everyone is worried about.

224
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:37,795
They use magic without even the slightest hesitation,

225
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:41,286
and seem to be doing absolutely
nothing to hide their tracks.

226
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:46,459
It is quite possible that they are not
even thinking of the Holy Grail War.

227
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:49,683
A mad Servant out of control

228
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:52,682
and a Master who doesn't even try to control him.

229
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,558
Why are people like them participating in the Grail War?

230
00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:59,442
This is something we cannot ignore, Tokiomi.

231
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:04,436
Their actions are in clear violation
of the rules by which we are all bound.

232
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,436
Of course.

233
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:09,801
As one responsible for guarding the secrets of
magic, this cannot be allowed.

234
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:14,471
Uh, we shall have to eliminate
Caster as well as his Master.

235
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:15,453
Yes.

236
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:19,338
But the problem is that defeating
a Servant requires a Servant,

237
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:23,144
and we can't send my Assassin
without exposing our deception.

238
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:24,516
Ah.

239
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:29,829
Minor rule changes fall completely under my purview.

240
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:33,713
We'll have all of the Masters
work as a group to defeat Caster.

241
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:39,688
Archer?

242
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:44,352
There are far fewer bottles here than in
Tokiomi's room, but of higher quality.

243
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,632
I must say that's some apprentice he has.

244
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,310
What is it you want?

245
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:54,001
Apparently, there are those in this war other than
myself with an abundance of time on their hands.

246
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:56,406
What do you mean?

247
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,320
Otherwise, a Master existing
under the kind protection of the Church

248
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,177
would hardly need to wander about.

249
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,316
I don't know what you're talking about.

250
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,935
Are you dissatisfied with your Master, Gilgamesh?

251
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:13,413
Tokiomi invited me to this world
and maintains my form here.

252
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:18,416
His greeting was worthy of my elevated station,
and so I felt that I had to respond to that.

253
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,915
But I never expected that he'd
be such a dull and boring person.

254
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:25,690
So you are unhappy with him as your Master.

255
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:28,394
He wants to reach the Vortex of the Root.

256
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:31,422
What a boring and tedious little plan.

257
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:38,138
The unflinching desire for
the "Root" is unique to mages.

258
00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:41,241
It's not for outsiders to comment upon.

259
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:46,963
In a sense, the path to the "Root" is
the path to an escape from this world.

260
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:50,691
For us, who are interested only in the world itself,

261
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:53,182
it may well be a tedious plan.

262
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:55,228
Is that so?

263
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:56,549
True.

264
00:17:56,736 --> 00:18:00,084
I am full of love for this universe
that is my personal playground.

265
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:03,899
I have no interest in realms outside my dominion.

266
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,931
This "Root" of yours does not concern me in the least.

267
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:07,924
Perhaps.

268
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,965
But the Grail is not a device
specifically designed to seek the Root.

269
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,315
When we say that it is omnipotent,

270
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:19,390
we mean that it has limitless potential
to alter even the reality of the material world.

271
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:21,718
So you're saying the other Masters

272
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:25,832
have motives other than Tokiomi's
for wanting to obtain the Holy Grail.

273
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:28,165
Tokiomi is an archetypal mage,

274
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:30,960
and at the same time extremely orthodox.

275
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:36,446
What the other Masters seek is one form or
another of success here in the material world:

276
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:39,366
prestige, desires, power.

277
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:40,974
That suits me fine.

278
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:43,256
I love every one of those things.

279
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:47,242
You are a king who rules over
the profane and the vulgar,

280
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:48,734
Gilgamesh.

281
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:52,434
So what is it that motivates you, Kirei?

282
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,566
What do you want from the Holy Grail?

283
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:01,666
Me?

284
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:03,231
Nothing.

285
00:19:03,604 --> 00:19:05,819
I have no real desire for it.

286
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:07,828
I seriously doubt that.

287
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:13,356
Doesn't the Holy Grail call only those Masters
whom it considers worthy of possessing it?

288
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:14,758
So they say.

289
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:16,777
But why did it choose me?

290
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:19,416
I have no ideal or other desire.

291
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:21,667
So why choose me for this battle?

292
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,455
No ideal or other desire?

293
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:27,392
Then why not simply wish for something like joy?

294
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:28,708
Ridiculous!

295
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:29,838
Wish for joy?

296
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:33,518
You'd ask me to long for something
that blasphemous and sinful?

297
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:36,462
Blasphemous and sinful you say?

298
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:38,368
That's going a little far, isn't it?

299
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:40,972
Why the connection between joy and sin?

300
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:43,567
Well, I...

301
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:48,360
True, joy gained by evil
means could be considered sin.

302
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:51,555
But joy may be attained through good deeds as well.

303
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,212
What kind of philosophy calls joy itself a sin?

304
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:57,058
It's absolutely ludicrous.

305
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,179
Joy is another quality that I lack.

306
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,312
I seek it, but never find it.

307
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:06,084
Kirei Kotomine,

308
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,965
I find myself interested in you.

309
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,205
What do you mean?

310
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,826
Exactly what I said.

311
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,006
Be seated.

312
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,116
True joy, you see,

313
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:26,709
might be thought of as a form of the soul.

314
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,935
The question isn't whether it exists or not,

315
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:31,690
but whether you know it.

316
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:36,600
Kirei, you have yet to see
what form your soul has taken.

317
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:40,918
That's what it actually means when you
claim that you lack joy in your life.

318
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,730
You're just a mere Servant

319
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:44,845
and you dare sit there and lecture me?

320
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:46,483
Don't get cocky, mongrel.

321
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,693
I am a king who has tasted all the
pleasures the world has to offer.

322
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,806
Hold your tongue and listen.

323
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:58,346
Kirei, you ought to learn what pleasure is.

324
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,401
Look first to the outside.

325
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:02,143
I know.

326
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,404
Why not begin by joining me in my entertainment?

327
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:10,579
I have no time to waste on pointless trivialities.

328
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,213
Don't be like that.

329
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,579
You can do it between the jobs Tokiomi assigns you.

330
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:22,764
To begin with, your task is to keep watch over
the five other Masters, isn't that correct?

331
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:24,383
What of it?

332
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:29,800
You should investigate not only their plans,
but their motivations for obtaining the Grail as well.

333
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,888
Then give that information to me.

334
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:36,118
That would be possible if I ask the Assassins.

335
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:40,265
But, Archer, what does any of that matter to you?

336
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:42,427
I've already told you.

337
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,286
I enjoy watching humans.

338
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,669
One or two of them are sure to be interesting
enough to keep me entertained for a while.

339
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,851
Compared to that dull Tokiomi at least.

340
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:55,509
Very well, Archer.

341
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:56,649
I will accept.

342
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:59,708
But it will take some time to do it.

343
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,755
That's fine.

344
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,288
I shall wait patiently

345
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,453
as I avail myself of these drinks.

346
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:13,633
My reason for seeking the Holy Grail?

347
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:16,561
I said far more than I should have.

348
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,528
I know that it certainly isn't joy.

349
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:32,516
However, if I can learn about him,

350
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,604
will I also be able to learn

351
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:38,390
what it is I seek as well?

352
