1
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:15,297
You have a charm spell.

2
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:21,227
Apologies, but I'm afraid it's a
little curse that I was born with.

3
00:00:21,862 --> 00:00:24,368
There's really nothing that can be done about it.

4
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,305
Blame it on my birth, or if you prefer,
the fact that you were born a woman.

5
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:33,865
Surely you don't actually believe that
a pleasant face and a charming swagger

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,796
will save you from the bite of my blade, spear man.

7
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:39,870
I certainly hope not...  it would spoil the fun.

8
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:44,738
I see now that the tales of the Saber
classes' resistance to magic are true.

9
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,143
Very well... I prefer not to kill a
girl who's throwing herself at me.

10
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,298
It would sully my reputation.

11
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,822
I'm pleased that my first
opponent is made of stern stuff.

12
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:58,647
Oh, so what you desire is a fair fight.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,569
I consider myself fortunate to encounter

14
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:03,628
such a strong and proud hero.

15
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:07,378
Then let us begin.

16
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:34,176
It's started.

17
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:37,542
Someone has put up a barrier,

18
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,641
probably the master of the enemy's servant.

19
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:46,082
From up on that crane, it would be
possible to survey the whole battlefield.

20
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:50,007
Indeed... that certainly is the best vantage point.

21
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,162
Anyone seeing it would agree.

22
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:56,809
All right, you circle around to the Eastern Wharf.

23
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:59,004
I'll go the other way and take the west.

24
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,206
You and I need to find good spots

25
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:06,597
where we can be totally invisible while we closely
monitor both Saber's battle and that crane, got it?

26
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,945
Yes, understood.

27
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:15,798
Now, then, let's see what you can do,

28
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:18,018
my adorable King of Knights.

29
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:13,368
Saber is watching both spears simultaneously.

30
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:18,740
Lancer's greatest advantage is his opponent's
uncertainty as to which he will use.

31
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:23,170
The long spear in the right hand
or the short spear in the left?

32
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:25,207
Which was the Noble Phantasm?

33
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,806
If I could be certain which one it
was, I could attack and defeat him.

34
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:33,495
If only we knew his true name.

35
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:41,698
Whoever he is, he's a master of the spear.

36
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:44,193
However, that is not enough.

37
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,942
What's wrong, Saber?

38
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:58,737
You're on the defensive.

39
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,050
This man is impressive.

40
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,832
Curse that blade of hers.

41
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:24,316
Without knowing its exact length,

42
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:26,543
I can't get close enough to strike.

43
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:31,283
The fact that she's able to repel my strikes so easily

44
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:34,097
means that she must be a master swordsman.

45
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:07,425
Hmm, Maiya, northeast of Saber and Iri.

46
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:12,079
On the roof of that warehouse, it's Lancer's master.

47
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:13,634
Can you see him?

48
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:18,911
Negative... I can't see him from my position.

49
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:20,839
Understood.

50
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:22,652
I'll take him out from here.

51
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:38,076
Assassin?

52
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:44,945
There is activity at the warehouse
district at the mouth of the Mion River.

53
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:49,351
It seems the first battle has finally begun.

54
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,627
Not the first battle.

55
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:55,016
To the others, this would be the second battle, Kirei.

56
00:06:57,146 --> 00:07:01,518
It would appear that Lancer and
Saber are the combatants in this one.

57
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:05,728
Can you ascertain their status
utilizing Assassin's eyes?

58
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:07,434
With ease.

59
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:11,013
Saber's formidable abilities are especially high.

60
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:15,461
Most of her parameters are ranked
A or higher on the standard scale.

61
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:17,509
I see.

62
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:20,604
It's no wonder they are considered the strongest class.

63
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,235
Saber likely presents a greater threat than Lancer.

64
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:27,155
Can you see other masters?

65
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:32,949
There's only one person besides the servants
who is out in the open and visible to Assassin.

66
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:35,539
She's standing next to Saber.

67
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:38,287
It's a woman with silver hair.

68
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:46,707
Huh, that means that Lancer's master is wise enough to
remain hidden from view, and that he's not a novice.

69
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:50,397
He understands the rules of the Holy Grail War.

70
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:54,196
Wait a minute... a silver‐haired woman?

71
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:56,324
Yes, a Caucasian...

72
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:02,120
with silver hair and red eyes.

73
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:04,695
Very unusual.

74
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,103
She doesn't look at all human.

75
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:10,213
An Einzbern Homunculus.

76
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:14,052
It seems they created another artificial master.

77
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:18,149
I thought that the only pawn Yupstehide had on the board

78
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,937
was Kiritsugu Emiya.

79
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,476
It would appear that I was wrong.

80
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,606
So then that woman is the Einzbern master?

81
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:34,479
Either way, she's certainly going to be a critical
factor throughout the rest of the Grail War.

82
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:37,020
Kirei, keep a close eye on her.

83
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:39,186
Agreed.

84
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:43,656
I shall keep one Assassin tasked to her at all times.

85
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:47,528
I see him, too.

86
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:51,518
But Assassin should be dead, so why is he here?

87
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:53,799
I knew something had to be up.

88
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,531
Let's see how this all plays out.

89
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,177
Continue to observe Assassin.

90
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:03,943
I'll watch Lancer.

91
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:06,971
Let me launch an attack on Assassin.

92
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,673
And then, while I have him distracted,

93
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:11,746
you can take out Lancer's master.

94
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,005
No, Maiya.

95
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:16,806
I don't want you to make any moves against Assassin.

96
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:20,240
We're not equipped to fight servants right now.

97
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,819
It would be disastrous.

98
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,034
Understood.

99
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:40,090
There is really no honor in a battle
fought without a proper exchange of names,

100
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:42,909
but allow me to offer my regards.

101
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:45,476
It's impressive for a woman to fight so hard

102
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,754
without even breaking a sweat as she does it.

103
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:50,469
You needn't be so humble, Lancer.

104
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:52,829
Even without my knowing your name,

105
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:56,888
those words from such a master of the spear do me honor.

106
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:58,981
I gratefully accept them.

107
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:01,661
That's enough fun for now, Lancer.

108
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:04,907
Lancer's master?

109
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:08,595
Do not allow this battle to go on.

110
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:11,476
Saber is a formidable opponent.

111
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:13,494
Eliminate her at once.

112
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:16,613
You may use your Noble Phantasm.

113
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:23,160
As you command, I will comply.

114
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:32,279
So the long spear is his Noble Phantasm.

115
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,267
You heard the command.

116
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:44,414
The time has come for me to kill you.

117
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,466
Saber, are you using focused wind mana

118
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,918
to keep your blade concealed?

119
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:53,716
I see.

120
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:57,056
I'll wager that you have a very good reason

121
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:59,417
to conceal your sword from me.

122
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:03,190
I think the sword reveals your true name.

123
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:05,618
How unfortunate for you.

124
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:09,108
I'm afraid you'll never know the true name of my blade.

125
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:13,231
I'll finish this before you ever get the chance.

126
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,626
We shall see about that.

127
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:19,503
I will discover whatever it is you're hiding, Saber.

128
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:30,730
You've exposed your sword to me.

129
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,689
The Invisible Air is coming apart.

130
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,965
What's going on with Saber?

131
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:16,586
That red spear is chipping away at the Invisible Air.

132
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:19,656
I've figured out the length of your blade now,

133
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:23,459
so I needn't worry about being struck by you anymore!

134
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:31,179
He wields a formidable weapon,

135
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,901
but I still have ways to counter it.

136
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,527
If I wait for an attack...

137
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:47,557
...one less powerful than the rest.

138
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:22,171
Saber?

139
00:13:27,746 --> 00:13:29,383
My thanks, Irisviel.

140
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:33,934
I'm fine... the healing is working.

141
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:38,176
I see... so this won't be an easy victory after all.

142
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:40,262
How could this be?

143
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,796
My armor should've easily deflected that strike.

144
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:47,633
So how did the blade of his spear...

145
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:55,178
The armor itself isn't damaged.

146
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:56,952
What's at work here?

147
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:04,787
The only answer is that Lancer's spear
bypassed the magically woven armor.

148
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:07,096
So that's it.

149
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:10,373
I know the secret of your spear, Lancer.

150
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,194
Oh?

151
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:15,013
That red spear of yours is able to negate magic.

152
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:15,813
Hmm.

153
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,242
So your armor was created using magic, huh?

154
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:24,702
Well, if you were counting on it to protect
you, you should surrender now, Saber.

155
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:28,143
You're as good as naked before my spear.

156
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:31,564
Don't think that simply defeating my armor

157
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:34,010
will give you the upper hand in this fight.

158
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:42,743
If I cannot block your blade,

159
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:45,633
I need only kill you before it strikes.

160
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:49,297
Prepare to die, Lancer!

161
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:51,938
A bold move.

162
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:55,664
You're betting everything on a single strike.

163
00:14:56,876 --> 00:15:00,424
You are attempting to overcome the
disadvantage of your broken armor

164
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:03,015
with the advantages you gain by abandoning it.

165
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:04,694
Excellent.

166
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:06,705
A courageous decision.

167
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:10,553
I like it... it's audacious and bold.

168
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:17,911
But in this case, I'm afraid that it
was a very foolish mistake, Saber.

169
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:20,412
We shall see.

170
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,191
You can tell me your opinion again after my next attack.

171
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:43,372
That was a misstep.

172
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:52,362
A Noble Phantasm needn't be merely a single weapon.

173
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:54,062
A trap!

174
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,802
This is extremely bad.

175
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:10,814
What is?

176
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,483
Lancer has begun his ultimate attack.

177
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,144
He intends to end the battle here.

178
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,196
Well, wouldn't that be a lot better for us?

179
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,596
Ahh!

180
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,166
You idiot... what are you talking about?

181
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,198
I wanted to sit back and watch until
we saw a few more masters fight.

182
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,488
But at this rate, Saber may just fall.

183
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,350
And then it will be too late.

184
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,495
T... t... too late for what?

185
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,603
I mean, the plan was to attack after they'd
fought a few battles and weakened each other.

186
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,740
I have to admit that I had really
hoped at least one other servant

187
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:50,474
would've been sent out to
answer Lancer's challenge,

188
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,368
because, of course, it would be
much faster to fight them altogether

189
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,150
than to seek them all out one by one.

190
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,104
You wanna fight 'em together?

191
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,479
Indeed!

192
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,104
Rarely does one have the extraordinary chance to
exchange blows with great heroes from another time.

193
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,848
And with a chance to fight as many as six of them,

194
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,420
I'd hate to miss out on a single one.

195
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,940
Just observe Saber and Lancer.

196
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:22,549
Both of them are strong, valiant warriors whom I
would dearly love to face in an all‐out battle.

197
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,997
I cannot let either one die.

198
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,703
But isn't that the whole point?

199
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,038
The Grail Wars objective is
to kill one another isn't it?

200
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,023
To win, but never to destroy,

201
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,888
to subjugate, but never to humiliate...

202
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,184
that is a truly good and honorable conquest.

203
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,878
Now, we will watch no longer!

204
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,935
We shall join the fray, boy!

205
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,101
Let us go!

206
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,845
You stupid idiot!

207
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,567
What you're doing is totally insane!

208
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,772
If you really don't approve,
then why don't you just stay up here and observe?

209
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,158
No, I'll go!

210
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,193
Take me with you, dammit!

211
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,313
Excellent, that is my master.

212
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:32,304
Not good... he severed the tendon.

213
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,519
I can't move my thumb.

214
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:36,574
Good counter.

215
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:39,240
You aren't gonna make this easy for me, are you?

216
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:43,176
But I like your indomitable spirit.

217
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:47,696
Stop talking and get to work, you fool!

218
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:50,219
Finish her... what are you waiting for?

219
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,392
My master... much appreciated.

220
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,393
Irisviel, I require healing.

221
00:19:01,877 --> 00:19:02,908
But I have.

222
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:04,697
I've already done it.

223
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:09,922
I mean, I did it...
the healing worked, I'm certain of it!

224
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:12,825
Saber, you should already be fully healed!

225
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:14,358
I don't understand!

226
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:17,140
It was very sharp of you to figure out,

227
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:20,461
that my Gae Dearg was able to penetrate any armor,

228
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:24,282
but it was foolish to abandon it.

229
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:28,070
Had you not done so,

230
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:30,203
my Gae Buidhe would not have gotten you.

231
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:31,804
I see.

232
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,630
You wield a cursed spear,

233
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:36,801
which inflicts devastating
wounds that can never be healed.

234
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,702
I should've realized it sooner.

235
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:43,334
A red spear that destroys magic,

236
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:48,308
a cursed yellow spear, and beneath the right
eye, a mole that enchants women.

237
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,685
First of the Knights of Fianna,

238
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:52,967
Diarmuid of the Love Spot.

239
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:57,275
Never did I think I'd have the
honor of facing you in combat.

240
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:01,842
Such is a sublime pleasure of the Holy Grail War,

241
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,612
but it's I who has the distinct honor here.

242
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:09,584
No hero summoned into service by the Holy Grail

243
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:12,597
could ever mistake that golden blade.

244
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:16,827
To face the legendary King of Knights in battle

245
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:21,868
and land even a single glancing blow is extraordinary.

246
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,607
I must not be too bad.

247
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:27,459
Now then, since we both know each other's name,

248
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,513
we can finally conduct our duel honorably

249
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:31,786
as knights should.

250
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:34,206
Or does this displease you,

251
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:37,116
occurring only after you've lost use of an arm?

252
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:43,665
You jest.

253
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:47,482
It is humiliating that you would show so much concern

254
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:49,084
over such a scratch.

255
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:53,922
Prepare yourself, Saber!

256
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:55,788
This time you're mine!

257
00:20:56,075 --> 00:21:00,392
Only if I fail to inflict the
first decisive strike, Lancer.

258
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:11,828
That's a chariot!

259
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:24,395
Both of you, sheath your blades,

260
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:26,375
for I am a King!

261
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:33,312
I am Iskander, King of Conquerors!

262
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,645
In this battle for the Holy Grail,

263
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,446
I am of the Rider class of servants!
