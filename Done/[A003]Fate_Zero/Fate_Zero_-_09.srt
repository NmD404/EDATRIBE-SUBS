1
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:08,631
Fionn mac Cumhaill,

2
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:12,004
hero of Ireland and leader of the Knights of Fianna,

3
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:13,590
and my daughter, Grainne,

4
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:16,785
are pleased to announce their engagement!

5
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:21,458
Everyone, this night, I want you all to celebrate!

6
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:25,121
That striking man with the mole beneath his eye,

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:26,676
what is his name?

8
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,550
He is a knight of Fianna, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

9
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:34,604
Diarmuid...

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,116
Traitor.

11
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,057
You will suffer for this, Diarmuid.

12
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:52,643
Take me with you.

13
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:55,576
We must run away.

14
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:09,594
Rejoice, Grainne!

15
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,949
Fionn has recognized our marriage.

16
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,908
Did you believe I'd forgotten
what happened with Grainne?

17
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,168
A dream?

18
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:04,862
That dream I had...

19
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:08,270
It was the legend of Diarumuid.

20
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:11,827
Could those have been the memories of my servant?

21
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:17,607
Where am I?

22
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:21,542
I see that you're awake now.

23
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:28,700
Sola‐Ui!

24
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:30,702
What is a meaning of this?

25
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,460
Wh... what am I doing this place?

26
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:39,012
So I gather that you have no memory
at all of what happened to you?

27
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:43,062
I... I was shot.

28
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:47,872
I defended myself with the Volumen Hydragyrum, but...

29
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,655
...what happened to my body?

30
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:55,990
Your body's magic circuits have misfired somehow.

31
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:58,480
You're lucky you didn't die instantly.

32
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:03,881
For now, I've only been able to regenerate your organs.

33
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:10,281
But your magic circuits were utterly destroyed.

34
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,822
I'm afraid you'll never use magic again.

35
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,345
But I can't...

36
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:19,407
I can't...

37
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:23,308
Don't cry, Kayneth.

38
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:26,917
It's too soon to give up.

39
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:29,612
It will be all right.

40
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,465
We haven't lost yet.

41
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:33,771
Sola‐Ui.

42
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:38,227
If the Holy Grail is truly an
omnipotent wish‐granting device,

43
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,144
then healing you completely and making you
whole again should be more than possible for it.

44
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:44,957
We need only to win.

45
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:49,678
If we succeed and claim the Grail,
everything will return to how it was.

46
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:54,419
So, with that in mind, Kayneth,

47
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:57,449
why don't you give the Command Seals to me?

48
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:01,608
That way, I can take over as Lancer's master.

49
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:05,025
I'll win the war and bring the Grail to you.

50
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:05,918
No.

51
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:07,288
I won't.

52
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,696
Oh, you don't believe in me then?

53
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:13,415
Me, who will marry into Archibald family?

54
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:15,604
No, I just...

55
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:22,220
Sola‐Ui, do you think...

56
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:28,306
...Lancer would actually just abandon
me and then swear fealty to you?

57
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:29,726
I do.

58
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,250
He is a Heroic Spirit here by the Grail's invitation.

59
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:37,062
He desires the Holy Grail just as we do,

60
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:40,081
even if he must take on a new master.

61
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,135
He will accept it for the sake of his goal.

62
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:44,284
He won't!

63
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:47,790
Lancer isn't the fine man you think he is!

64
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:50,131
And why do you say that, Kayneth?

65
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:54,281
When I asked him what he would wish
for if he had the Grail, he said to me,

66
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:57,260
"I have no interest in the Holy Grail."

67
00:05:58,013 --> 00:06:00,897
A servant with no desire for the Grail is impossible!

68
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:03,510
He's hiding something important from me.

69
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,104
But no matter. What deep,
dark secret he's trying to keep hidden,

70
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:11,483
as long as I bear these Command Seals,
he must obey me unconditionally.

71
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:12,250
Kayneth?

72
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,466
I won't give you the Command Seals.

73
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:22,495
Oh, Kayneth, you still don't get it.

74
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,442
Don't you see?

75
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:27,951
We must win this war no matter what the cost.

76
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,340
Listen, Kayneth.

77
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,572
With my limited skills as a healer,

78
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:57,173
it is quite impossible
to remove any Command Seals by force.

79
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,692
The bearer's willing consent is the sole
way for me to take them without resistance.

80
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:06,692
If you truly cannot accept this,
you will leave me no choice.

81
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:09,445
I will have to amputate your right arm.

82
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,771
What's your answer?

83
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:24,360
How is she?

84
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:26,167
She's going to be all right.

85
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,857
Magical healing can put a
tremendous stress on the patient.

86
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,174
I think it will take some time yet before she wakes up.

87
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,288
Watch her for a while, okay?

88
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:40,198
You're going to report to Kiritsugu now?

89
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:41,986
Yes, Saber.

90
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,966
I'm sure he's worried too.

91
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,041
Irisviel, I have a request.

92
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,091
I'd like you to speak to him for me.

93
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:54,075
Tell him I feel that we must pursue Caster immediately.

94
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:56,498
But, Saber.

95
00:07:57,415 --> 00:08:02,374
Inaction on our part will mean the
deaths of many more innocent children.

96
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:07,990
May I come in?

97
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,319
How long before Maiya's back?

98
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:20,658
Not too long, but she has to stay
in bed for another day or two.

99
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:22,095
I see.

100
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:25,312
You and Saber stay here.

101
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:28,819
I'm going to go follow Kayneth.

102
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:32,034
No, Kiritsugu, wait a minute.

103
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:33,647
Did Saber tell you?

104
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:36,353
She thinks we should go after Caster right away.

105
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:39,015
Apparently so.

106
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:44,091
Are you angry at Saber for not interfering with Lancer?

107
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,440
Iri, saving a few children,

108
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:50,773
or even a few dozen for that matter,

109
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,581
is not our goal.

110
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:56,825
Saber probably never doubted that
Lancer would spare me that day,

111
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:00,204
but if Lancer had betrayed her, then what?

112
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:04,380
Our Grail War would have ended right then and there.

113
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,030
There's no need to tell her where I'm going.

114
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:18,490
Lancer, please show yourself.

115
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:26,605
Mistress Sola‐Ui, how fares Master Kayneth?

116
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,481
Not well, I'm afraid.

117
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,765
But I've done everything I can for him.

118
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:37,553
This isn't your fault, Lancer.

119
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:39,570
Kayneth brought it upon himself.

120
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:42,130
All it means is that the Grail War

121
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:44,595
was far too much for him to handle.

122
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:47,152
It's not that, I just...

123
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,953
Diarmuid, don't you see?
He isn't worthy of being your master.

124
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:00,804
Kayneth has abandoned the battle,

125
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:03,796
giving his right as your master to me.

126
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:11,858
As a knight, my loyalty is
eternally pledged to Master Kayneth.

127
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,985
Mistress Sola‐Ui, I'm sorry, but I cannot consent.

128
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:18,425
You what?

129
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:23,233
As a servant, do you not manifest
physically in this world using my mana?

130
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,105
And now I also have Kayneth's
consent, as well as the Command Seals.

131
00:10:27,232 --> 00:10:29,664
Before I am a servant of the Grail War,

132
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:31,450
I am foremost a knight,

133
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,451
and a knight can only serve but one master.

134
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:37,970
Am I so unworthy of being your master?

135
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:40,412
I have already told you that is not the issue.

136
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:42,396
Look me in the eye when you speak!

137
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:51,726
Lancer, fight beside me.

138
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:53,783
Please, you must protect me.

139
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:55,598
Lend me your support.

140
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,540
Come and help me win the Holy Grail!

141
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:01,065
I cannot.

142
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:05,391
If Master Kayneth has given up his quest for the Grail,

143
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,710
then I no longer have any interest in it.

144
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,779
We require a miracle to heal him.
He has no chance otherwise!

145
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:18,238
We need the Grail for that miracle.

146
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:21,528
If you're feeling responsible for all this,

147
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:25,383
if you desire to give him back his life and his dignity,

148
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:29,002
you must win the Holy Grail for your master.

149
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:35,417
Mistress Sola‐Ui, do you speak as Master Kayneth's wife

150
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,766
and seek the Holy Grail only on his behalf?

151
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:40,829
Is that what you're saying?

152
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,133
Uh, well, yes.

153
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:44,268
Yes, of course.

154
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:46,725
That is your only desire?

155
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:48,176
You'll swear to it?

156
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:50,844
Yes, I swear.

157
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,310
As the wife of Lord Kayneth El‐Melloi,

158
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,609
I shall bring my husband the Grail.

159
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:07,852
That look in her eyes.

160
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:11,296
It is the same as Grainne had.

161
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:17,125
I don't hate them for what happened.

162
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:22,230
However, fate was simply too cruel
to allow it to happen any other way.

163
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:27,433
What I seek from this life

164
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:30,150
is the loyalty denied me in my last.

165
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:33,898
I wish to keep that sad fate from happening again.

166
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:35,308
But...

167
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:41,136
In my previous life, I threw myself into many battles...

168
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,950
...oftentimes, ignoring the lives that would be lost,

169
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:49,772
and, so, I understand Kiritsugu's reasoning.

170
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:55,800
However, the Holy Grail War has very clear rules.

171
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:59,528
It is supposed to be a proxy war conducted by servants

172
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:02,118
to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

173
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:04,929
Isn't that true, Irisviel?

174
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,605
If Kiritsugu and Lancer's master

175
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,175
had not engaged in a secret battle,

176
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:15,012
we could have struck down Caster.

177
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:19,704
We would no longer have to worry about
more innocent children being killed.

178
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:23,649
Lancer and I could have finished
our duel in an honorable fashion.

179
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:29,599
Is there no chance of Kiritsugu changing his mind?

180
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,953
If you believe only one thing, believe this:

181
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:53,561
For Kiritsugu and me to make our ideal world a reality,

182
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,820
you are absolutely essential.

183
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:11,385
Uh...

184
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:15,612
You know, it does a man good to watch you drink.

185
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,559
Here.

186
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,102
Oh, thank you.

187
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:22,679
You should have told us you had a guest coming over.
I'd have cooked something special for you.

188
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,723
No, no, don't trouble yourself.

189
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:29,030
The simple pleasures of home and hearth
are what are truly best in this world.

190
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:32,128
Oh, my, you are such a flatterer, aren't you?

191
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:39,816
We couldn't help but worry over how
Waver was doing at his school in England,

192
00:14:40,176 --> 00:14:46,277
but if he's managed to make friends with a strapping man
like you, well, I guess we were worried over nothing.

193
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,907
Hm, not at all.

194
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:50,495
It is I who am in his debt.

195
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,772
See, he even picked out these fine pants.

196
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:54,939
Look at the craftsmanship.

197
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,565
They're fit for a king.

198
00:14:57,315 --> 00:15:00,408
So, how long will you be in Japan, Alexei?

199
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:04,978
Oh, I should have all my work here
wrapped up in about a week or so.

200
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:09,885
Well, I was just thinking that, if you
like, you could stay right here with us.

201
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:14,313
I'm pretty sure that there's space enough
to put another futon in Waver's room.

202
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,036
Right, Waver?

203
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:17,234
Futon?

204
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:20,180
Oh, yes, the bedding that they sleep on in this land.

205
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,810
Sleeping on a futon does take some getting used to.

206
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:27,884
It's strange to sleep on the floor instead of a bed.

207
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:31,872
I think that is what is best about
traveling to distant foreign lands.

208
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:35,289
My favorite thing in life is
the surprise of the unknown.

209
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,788
Surely, Asia gives me the most enjoyment in any age.

210
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:41,209
I couldn't agree with you more.

211
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:46,863
I've told you!

212
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,179
Take the spiritual form
when you come and go!

213
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:54,652
Yes, well, had I done so,
I would not have been able to retrieve this.

214
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,905
I even managed to procure this fine pair of pants.

215
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,332
And anyway, boy, it was you who ordered me to do it.

216
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:11,698
Why must I, the King of Conquerors,
go forth to draw water from some country river?

217
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:16,312
Because it's a lot more productive than eating
junk food and watching all those videos.

218
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:18,274
Hmm.

219
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:25,783
What is this, are you playing at being an alchemist?

220
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:27,180
I'm not playing.

221
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,501
I am an alchemist, idiot.

222
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:34,300
How interesting, what is that?

223
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:36,233
Spell casting residue,

224
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:38,652
remnants of magic left in the water.

225
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:43,069
And that means someone was recently
using magic near the river.

226
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,850
If we follow the trail,

227
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,758
it may be able to show us where to look for Caster.

228
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:53,490
Hey, boy, did you know ahead of time that
you were gonna find something like that

229
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:54,999
lurking out there in the water?

230
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,593
Of course not, but this town is unique in
that water flows straight through its center,

231
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,952
so water was the obvious place to look.

232
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:14,697
Rider, was there anything between here and here?

233
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,649
A sewage pipe, or maybe an irrigation channel?

234
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:22,144
Oh, yes, there was one of considerable size down there.

235
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,439
That's it.

236
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:27,516
If we follow it, it will probably
lead us right to Caster's hideout.

237
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:28,991
Hmm.

238
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:34,300
Boy, are you certain you aren't a
mage of not inconsiderable skill?

239
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:37,671
Look, a truly skilled mage
wouldn't have to do it this way.

240
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:40,554
As a skill, it's pretty basic.

241
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,711
Wait a minute, you're making fun of me, aren't you?

242
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:45,682
No, boy, quite the opposite.

243
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,202
To accomplish something so impressive

244
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:52,858
using a simple method outshines those
who use a more complex technique.

245
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:55,641
As your servant, I am proud.

246
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:56,952
Right.

247
00:17:57,434 --> 00:18:00,309
Now that we have his location, he's as good as ours.

248
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:03,810
Shall we go give him a good beating right away, boy?

249
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,472
Wait a second.

250
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:09,431
We're talking about engaging Caster here.

251
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:10,358
I know.

252
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:11,443
No, you don't.

253
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,829
When it comes to defending his lair,

254
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:16,522
he has a tremendous advantage over any attacker.

255
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:20,230
What kind of moron would just
go bursting in the front door?

256
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:27,584
Listen here, in a combat situation, enemy and ally
positions can practically change by the second.

257
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:31,275
If you fail to attack the enemy
when you know his location,

258
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:34,699
it will be too late for regrets
once you've missed your chance.

259
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,218
Really, and what's made you so eager today?

260
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:39,679
Shouldn't I be?

261
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:43,999
My master has finally contributed
something of worth to our great endeavor.

262
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:48,041
As your loyal servant, I must also do my sacred duty.

263
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:49,609
Seek out and defeat the enemy

264
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,643
and bring back his head to you.

265
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:56,341
Ha‐ha, do not be so quick to give
up before we have even begun.

266
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:59,150
Let us go and see what we can find.

267
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,607
It may well work out better than you imagine.

268
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:05,783
Ah!

269
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:08,811
You see, I was right, wasn't I?

270
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:11,042
Everything has worked out splendidly!

271
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:22,072
Hmm, unfortunately, Caster appears to be away.

272
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:27,221
Is this some kind of water storage system?

273
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:31,751
Hey, boy, I think it would be
best if you didn't see this.

274
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,644
What are you talking about?

275
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:37,699
If Caster isn't here, we should at least
search for clues to his whereabouts.

276
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,271
It'd be dumb not to.

277
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:42,439
That may be so, but don't do it.

278
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,223
Boy, this is far too much for you.

279
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:46,940
Oh, shut up.

280
00:20:18,598 --> 00:20:20,314
I warned you, didn't I?

281
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:22,743
I told you not to look.

282
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:23,926
Shut up!

283
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,297
Damn it, stop making fun of me.

284
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,439
Damn it.

285
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:32,696
This is no time for pride, foolish boy.

286
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:34,770
Your reaction is natural.

287
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:41,522
If I saw someone who could look on all of this
and still remain unmoved, I would punch them hard.

288
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:45,392
What do you mean you'd punch them, you idiot.

289
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:47,269
What about you?

290
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:51,191
You look fine, just like you always do.

291
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:56,377
That's because now is not the time for emotion.

292
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:57,610
Huh?

293
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:06,339
Because my young master is in mortal peril!

294
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:09,449
Assassin?

295
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,324
But that's impossible.

296
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:12,999
Assassin's dead.

297
00:21:13,092 --> 00:21:14,623
I saw him die.

298
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,626
We can't afford to be surprised, boy.

299
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:36,756
But how?

300
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:40,329
The how of it is totally irrelevant to us now.

301
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:43,226
However, one thing here is for certain.

302
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:49,451
Anyone in this war who believed in Assassin's untimely
demise, as we did, has been thoroughly deceived.

303
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:56,160
They ran.

304
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:57,439
Didn't they?

305
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:59,334
Do not let your guard down.

306
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:00,789
We killed two,

307
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,098
but there appeared to be an additional two.

308
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:08,229
At this rate, who can say how many
assassins there truly are out there?

309
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:11,191
This is Assassin's preferred terrain.

310
00:22:11,753 --> 00:22:13,874
We should withdraw from here at once.

311
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:17,684
Should we really leave it like this?

312
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:20,486
Perhaps you'd find something if you were to look,

313
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:21,929
but let it go.

314
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,679
For now, we'll just have to break what we can.

315
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,245
If nothing else, it will serve to slow Caster down.

316
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,327
With his hideout destroyed and completely in ruins,

317
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:02,780
Caster will no longer be able to hide.

318
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:07,052
He'll be forced to come out of the
shadows, into the open, and show himself.

319
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:10,227
Then after that, it won't be too long

320
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:12,571
before we put an end to him and his master.

321
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:15,248
All right.

322
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:16,511
I get it!

323
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,131
Quit doing that!

324
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,792
Let us be off, boy.

325
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,154
Do not let it trouble you, Kirei.

326
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:36,297
Indeed, it is unfortunate that
Assassin was exposed to them

327
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:39,704
before we could discern the
nature of Rider's ultimate weapon.

328
00:23:40,189 --> 00:23:41,571
But from this encounter,

329
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,384
we found out that Rider's master
is a mere third‐rate mage.

330
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:48,659
Yes, but had they not been discovered...

331
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:51,922
You think that other options would
have become available to you?

332
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,148
Yes.

333
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:54,501
Hm.

334
00:23:55,163 --> 00:23:57,211
While your plans are certainly important,

335
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:01,726
you must see to it that you remain
refined and relaxed in all matters.

336
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,265
Dignity is required even during battle.

337
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,235
But I never expected that he'd
be such a dull and boring person.

338
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,331
We will certainly have another chance
to see Rider's ultimate attack.

339
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,359
Have Assassin to continue to monitor Rider,

340
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:21,382
but remind them to take great care as they do.

341
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:25,194
Yes, my teacher, it will be done.
