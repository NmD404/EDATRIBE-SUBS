1
00:00:02,306 --> 00:00:04,500
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

2
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:08,199
As you can imagine,
things have been rather hectic this evening.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,944
I'm sure it couldn't be helped
given the extraordinary situation.

4
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,558
It's going to be rather difficult to cover all that up.

5
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,191
Well, perhaps.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,828
What has happened is far too much for
the holy church to handle by herself,

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,502
and so we are accepting any and all aid
proffered for assistance in this effort.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,763
Now the, down to business.

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,202
Regarding my request, I'm curious
as to what your decision is, Father.

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,472
I speak, of course,
of the reward offered for Caster's defeat.

11
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:17,298
This is wonderful.

12
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:25,339
Once I receive the command seal for killing Caster,
Diarmuid and I will finally be truly connected forever.

13
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:36,786
My right hand!

14
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,719
It's gone, it's gone!

15
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,049
My right hand!

16
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,423
My right hand!

17
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,319
I need it or I...
I cannot call Diarmuid,

18
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:48,001
I won't be able to make him care for me.

19
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:49,462
My right hand.

20
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,123
My right hand, my right hand,

21
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,737
my right hand, my right hand!

22
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:54,707
Hand...

23
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:56,520
my right hand.

24
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:03,383
Success.

25
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:05,891
I have secured Sola‐Ui over in New Town.

26
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:09,523
I removed the command seals in her right arm.

27
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:10,637
Fine.

28
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:12,994
Get out of there immediately.

29
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:15,932
Lancer should be returning any time now.

30
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:17,086
Roger.

31
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:31,868
I saved Kariya Matou.

32
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,016
Without doubt, he could threaten my master.

33
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:36,895
There is no excuse.

34
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:38,617
This is an act of rebellion.

35
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:43,136
But what is this I'm feeling?

36
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:46,118
It is not regret.

37
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:48,507
Could it be...

38
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,800
that I'm excited about this?

39
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:55,507
Of course, it's true that in the defeat
of the Servant Caster and his master,

40
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:59,642
the Servant Lancer played an important
part in the overall conduct of the battle.

41
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,010
A fact varified by a number of
reports from various observers.

42
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:05,303
Then it's clear.

43
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,310
As master of Lancer, I have the right
to receive one of the command seals.

44
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:11,478
It's not that simple.

45
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:14,502
Lord Kayneth Archibald...

46
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,402
I am unsure whether it is at all inappropriate
to consider you a master at this point.

47
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:23,139
Father, my pact with Lancer

48
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:27,765
was from the outset executed jointly
by myself and my fiancee, Sola‐Ui.

49
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:32,217
And is Sola‐Ui not the one currently
supplying mana to the servant?

50
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:36,311
And is she not also acting as defacto
caretaker for the command seals?

51
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:37,613
Yes, that's true.

52
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,654
I've temporarily given her
custody of the command seals.

53
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:45,348
However, the rights accorded by the
pact still legally reside with me.

54
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:50,587
After all, Father, the petition I submitted
to the church to be considered a master

55
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,759
was filed in my name and did not include Sola‐Ui.

56
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:57,774
Very well, I agree.

57
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:00,612
Your rights as a master shall remain intact.

58
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:05,270
Now, Lord Archibald, extend your hand, please.

59
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:09,618
Take this and drink from it.

60
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:15,659
This is my blood, the blood of the everlasting covenant
which will be poured out for you and for all mankind.

61
00:05:15,838 --> 00:05:17,901
Do this in my memory.

62
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:32,305
I hope you will continue to fight a noble
battle for the Grail as a worthy master.

63
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:34,398
Yes, of course, Father.

64
00:05:48,238 --> 00:05:50,735
I'm down to a single command seal.

65
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,675
My situation remains dire.

66
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:57,272
I cannot allow the other masters an
opportunity to acquire an additional seal,

67
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,229
not if I intend to possess the Holy Grail.

68
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:05,145
Mistress Sola‐Ui.

69
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,590
You complete incompetent!

70
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:10,612
You useless bumbling fool!

71
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:14,151
You couldn't even protect a
single woman from being attacked?!

72
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:15,211
Huh.

73
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:18,359
I'm sick of all your talk of chivalry.

74
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:20,733
I am grievously sorry, Master.

75
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:23,961
She may have been a mere substitute,

76
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:27,662
but you even failed to protect your
own master from nearly being killed!

77
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:30,633
What good are you as a servant, I ask you?

78
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:34,014
I'm amazed you had the unmitigated
nerve to return here alone.

79
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:36,646
Please understand, my master.

80
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,448
Mistress Sola‐Ui and I never entered

81
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,314
into a proper pact,

82
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:44,746
and as such we could not sense each other's presence.

83
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:46,148
That's no excuse.

84
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:49,098
You should've taken special
care to ensure her safety.

85
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,600
My master, fret not.

86
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,648
Mistress Sola‐Ui yet lives.

87
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,816
She continues to supply me with mana.

88
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:58,258
That's irrelevant!

89
00:06:58,353 --> 00:06:59,744
You are not her servant.

90
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:02,161
And therefore you can not discern her location.

91
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:05,402
So it doesn't matter in the least
whether or not you know if she's alive.

92
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:10,059
Oh, Sola‐Ui, I should've never
given you those command seals.

93
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:13,060
I could not dissuade her, Master.

94
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,510
I share in the responsibility.

95
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:20,733
I really can't believe you
had the nerve to say that.

96
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:22,786
Don't try fooling me, Lancer.

97
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:26,673
It was you who encouraged
Sola‐Ui to become ambitious.

98
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:29,502
I would never do that, Master.

99
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,327
It's just as it was in the legend.

100
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:37,371
Are you truly incapable of seeing your Lord's
fiancee without attempting to seduce her?

101
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:40,345
My master...

102
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:43,578
please retract those words right now.

103
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,619
Have I struck a nerve, Lancer?

104
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:51,275
You're nothing but a beast who swore an
oath of eternal loyalty to his master.

105
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:55,043
And then gave into prurient
lust when the moment suited him.

106
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,385
My master.

107
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:58,069
My lord.

108
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,737
Why will you not understand?

109
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:04,612
Master, I wished only to defend my honor,

110
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:09,013
to fight well in noble battle,
and achieve victory on your behalf.

111
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:12,549
Don't you ever speak to me in that manner, Servant!

112
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:14,773
Understand your place.

113
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,023
You're nothing but a spectral ghost,
granted form and substance by magic.

114
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:21,871
You dare to sit there and lecture your master!

115
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:24,074
It is absurd and unacceptable!

116
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,369
If you are so dissatisfied,

117
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:29,571
I believe you have but one option available.

118
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,808
Use your precious pride to resist my command seal.

119
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,198
You'll never win.

120
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:39,183
You servants are mere puppets,
and this seal the string that controls you.

121
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:41,554
Lord Kayneth.

122
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,333
Master.

123
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:46,361
What now?

124
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:49,547
Don't tell me,
you still have something to say to me?

125
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:50,667
No.

126
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:52,070
That isn't it.

127
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:55,430
Something's approaching this building.

128
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:02,577
Look, Saber, it's just as Kiritsugu said.

129
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:05,431
There are traces of a magical barrier,

130
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:07,324
but it's very strange.

131
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,497
It hasn't been properly maintained.

132
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:13,418
It's already starting to... fall apart.

133
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:18,916
I did not expect to see you here, Saber.

134
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:21,137
Well, my...

135
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,639
allies found this place and informed me.

136
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,936
They said that this was your location.

137
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,477
You would not happen to know where my
master's betrothed is, would you, Saber?

138
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:34,865
My master has not heard from her.

139
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:39,232
No, I do not.

140
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,933
What of it, Lancer?

141
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,993
Never mind, forget it.

142
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:46,150
Anyway, are you sure about this?

143
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:49,840
I am certain you did not come
to engage in idle chit‐chat?

144
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:55,763
After all, you must be completely exhausted
after employing that technique against Caster.

145
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,591
No more so than all the other servants.

146
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:00,071
I'm certain.

147
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:02,453
None of them will be fighting further tonight.

148
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,443
They will focus on defense.

149
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:08,726
That is why we needn't worry about being interrupted.

150
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:15,484
Dawn is nearly upon us.

151
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,883
But this may be the best night

152
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:21,129
for us to finally finish our battle.

153
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,997
What say you, Lancer?

154
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:23,928
Hm.

155
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,103
Brave Saber.

156
00:10:26,478 --> 00:10:29,785
The only thing in this world
that still grants my heart peace

157
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,878
is your honor and the purity
of your fighting spirit.

158
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,602
Her attacks are too weak.

159
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:10,940
Saber, why?

160
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,289
You will not use your left hand?

161
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:17,301
Don't get the wrong idea, Lancer.

162
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,598
If I use my left hand here,

163
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:22,482
the shame is certain to dull my blade

164
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:25,312
against your powerful spear.

165
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,969
A dulling such as that would be fatal.

166
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:29,609
Saber.

167
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:31,704
Therefore, Diarmuid...

168
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:36,993
...this is my best strategy,

169
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,843
the path that will allow me to defeat you.

170
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:46,599
Pride is in the blade of chivalry.

171
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:48,361
Saber...

172
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:51,764
I am glad I was able to meet you.

173
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,193
I am first Bure of Fianna,

174
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,937
Diarmuid O'Dyna.

175
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,350
I come for you.

176
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,430
Splendid.

177
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:06,187
For this night,
Artoria Pendragon accepts your challenge.

178
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:09,395
Come then.

179
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:13,032
Why does he not win?

180
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:18,406
If he has no certain path to victory, should he not
escape with his master instead of risking defeat?

181
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:22,866
Right now our highest priority should
be to locate and rescue Sola‐Ui.

182
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:27,720
Why can't he not understand even that
simple concept?! He's a useless servant!

183
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,356
Why him?

184
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:47,845
Of all people?

185
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,458
This is...

186
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:03,165
a Self‐Geis Scroll.

187
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:06,048
A powerful magical item

188
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:10,313
that has been used throughout the ages
to forge an absolutely unbreakable pact

189
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,271
between one mage and another.

190
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:14,021
"Binding spell.

191
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:16,967
Affected party, Kiritsugu Emiya.

192
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:19,499
The crest of the Emiya family

193
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:21,552
orders the following actions:

194
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:27,046
the pledge is to be obeyed by the affected party
upon fulfillment of the terms described herein.

195
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:33,542
Pledge that Kiritsugu, son of Norikata,
fifth heir to the house of Emiya

196
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:37,156
will be forever forbidden from
harming Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald

197
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:39,672
and Sola‐Ui Nuada‐Re Sophia‐Ri,

198
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,790
or from intending to, by his hand, harm or injure
them or cause them pain in any way whatsoever.

199
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:47,063
Terms.

200
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:54,563
In principle, the curse of the Geis cannot be
removed by any means known to the mage world.

201
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:59,176
Even if you forfeit your life,
as long as the magic crest exists,

202
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,136
it will bind your soul

203
00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:02,727
even in death.

204
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:07,871
It's true that if I do what's written
on this scroll, he cannot kill me?

205
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:16,286
But under these terms, my fight, the fight for
which I prepared my entire life... will end here.

206
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,856
The Grail.

207
00:14:20,462 --> 00:14:22,396
And the Archibald family pride.

208
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,497
He asks me to throw it all away?

209
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:48,313
Sola‐Ui.

210
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,183
Use your remaining command seals to
compel your servant to commit suicide.

211
00:15:15,284 --> 00:15:17,310
The terms of the agreement have been met.

212
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,930
You wanna win!

213
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:28,554
You wanna win so desperately.

214
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,611
You desire the Grail so desperately,

215
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:36,776
you have crushed...  you have
crushed my sole remaining wish.

216
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,506
And you just stand there!

217
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,881
Do you not feel any shame at all?!

218
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:43,218
I will never forgive you.

219
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,462
I will never forgive any of you!

220
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,376
You inhuman monsters who have
ruined the honor of a knight.

221
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:53,555
Let my blood taint your dreams forever!

222
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,706
May the Grail be cursed!

223
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:58,456
May the wish it grants bring disaster!

224
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:01,830
And when you fall into the searing pits of hell,

225
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,838
you'll remember the hateful rate of Diarmuid!

226
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,349
So now the Geis binds you?

227
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,946
Yes, it is sealed.

228
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,919
I can longer kill you or Sola‐Ui.

229
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:42,449
I can't, but...

230
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:52,926
Kill me.

231
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,788
Kill me now.

232
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:56,276
Sorry.

233
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:58,598
Our pact forbids me to.

234
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,380
Kiritsugu Emiya.

235
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:16,217
I finally recognize you as
the lowly beast that you are.

236
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:20,147
I believed that our paths differed,
but we shared a mutual goal.

237
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,987
I was a fool to think this.

238
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,587
Until now, I placed my faith in Irisviel's words,

239
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,171
and thus did not doubt your intentions.

240
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:33,754
But now...

241
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,735
I can no longer believe that your desire for the Grail

242
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:40,479
has anything to do with salvation.

243
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:43,066
Answer me, Kiritsugu!

244
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:45,999
What is the true reason you desire the Grail?

245
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,376
Even should my sword at the
end of this war win the Grail.

246
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:54,430
If that means I must yield it to you, I must...

247
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,236
Answer her, Kiritsugu!

248
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:01,622
After everything that has happened,
you owe her an explanation!

249
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,693
You know, this incident is the very first time

250
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,577
you've seen how I kill, Iris.

251
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:13,398
If you only eliminate a master, the servant

252
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:16,499
may enter into a pact with another party.

253
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:21,158
So I had to eliminate the master
and the servant simultaneously.

254
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:22,846
No, Kiritsugu.

255
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:24,026
Not to me.

256
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,541
Talk to Saber.

257
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,027
She's the one who needs to hear your words now.

258
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,895
No.

259
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,704
Honor, glory...

260
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,656
there's really no point in speaking to a killer

261
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:37,431
who extols the virtue of such things.

262
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:41,121
You would even insult chivalry to my face, monster!

263
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:44,164
A knight cannot save the world.

264
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:47,466
Knights call certain methods of fighting good,

265
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,005
and others evil, acting as if

266
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:52,975
there were some sacred nobility to the battlefield.

267
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:57,629
Such illusions created by heroes throughout history

268
00:18:58,176 --> 00:19:00,686
have led countless young
men to their bloody deaths,

269
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,862
all for the sake of this glory
and honor they all extol.

270
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,449
They are not illusions!

271
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,650
Even the taking of a life in battle

272
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:11,092
as an act as a human being

273
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,807
must have ideals,

274
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:17,268
otherwise every war would bring the
very fires of hell to this world.

275
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,443
And there you go...

276
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:21,333
you heard her, Iris.

277
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:26,674
Our heroic spirit over there considers
a battlefield to be better than hell.

278
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:28,762
What a joke.

279
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,682
A battlefield is hell itself.

280
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:34,394
There's no hope to be had on one.

281
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:37,520
There is nothing but unspeakable despair.

282
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,579
Just a soulless cry we call victory.

283
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,167
Paid for by the pain of the defeated.

284
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:46,879
But humanity has never recognized this truth.

285
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:52,682
And the reason is that in every era a dazzling hero
has blinded the people with their legends and kept

286
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:56,146
them from seeing the evil of bloodshed they bring.

287
00:19:56,936 --> 00:20:01,799
True human nature has not advanced
a step beyond the Stone Age.

288
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:04,289
Tell me this, Kiritsugu.

289
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:07,336
Do you force Saber to endure such humiliation

290
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:10,275
because of your hatred for the heroic spirits?

291
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,626
Of course not.

292
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:14,025
Personal feelings don't enter into it.

293
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:17,143
I will win the Holy
Grail and save the world.

294
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:19,278
And I will wage that war with the most

295
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,333
appropriate weapons I have at my disposal.

296
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,388
Justice and righteousness cannot save the world.

297
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:28,632
I care nothing for such things.

298
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:31,909
Kiritsugu, don't you understand?

299
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:34,572
If you do evil to stop evil,

300
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:38,942
that rage and hatred will
give rise to new conflict.

301
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,117
Kiritsugu Emiya,

302
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:45,668
I do not know what betrayed you,
or what has caused you to lose all hope,

303
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:52,516
but your sorrow and rage are found only in
those who at one time sought for justice.

304
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:56,494
Kiritsugu, in youth, your true self,

305
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:59,013
wished to be a hero, did it not?

306
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,103
A hero to save the world.

307
00:21:02,397 --> 00:21:05,232
You believed in that.
You desired it more than life.

308
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:06,766
Am I wrong?

309
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:12,071
I will break this endless cycle.

310
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,579
The Grail will make that possible.

311
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:20,220
I'll ensure that the blood I spill in Fuyuki
is the last that humanity will ever shed.

312
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,401
If that means I must stain my
hands with every evil in the world,

313
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:25,808
I don't care.

314
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:28,369
If that will save the world,

315
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:30,993
then I do it gladly.

316
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:43,025
Kiritsugu has left, hasn't he?

317
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:44,884
Irisviel?

318
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,116
Irisviel!
