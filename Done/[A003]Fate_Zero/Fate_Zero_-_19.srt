1
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,140
Hurts, huh?

2
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:27,499
Mages carry the pain of that crest forever.

3
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,147
You know, I think your dad
really gave you the perfect name.

4
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,860
Your origin is based on cutting and tying, kid.

5
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:45,667
The nuance is a little different
than destroy and regenerate.

6
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:48,764
If you cut a thread and then re‐tie it,

7
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:50,726
it will be thicker where you cut it,

8
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:52,279
isn't that right?

9
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:57,160
In that sense, it carries a
connotation of irreversible change.

10
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:02,736
Kiritsugu, with the characters for cut and tie,

11
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:06,304
these will be your ace in the hole.

12
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,747
I've powdered some of your ribs
and put a little bit in here.

13
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:20,793
Your origin will materialize in
anything shot by this bullet.

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,765
If your target attempts to use any magic against it,

15
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:28,417
it will cut his circuits and thoroughly fry them.

16
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:31,577
Just one shot will incapacitate him.

17
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:34,460
I've made 66 in total.

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,822
Don't waste them.

19
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:04,408
Natalia, do you read me?

20
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:05,782
I'm almost there.

21
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:06,728
Roger.

22
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:18,871
Natalia, do it.

23
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:40,952
Huh?

24
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:04,364
In the end, after leaving the island,

25
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:08,565
I spent the next several years
living with Natalia Kaminski.

26
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:15,441
That meant choosing the same path as Natalia.

27
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,171
The solitary path of a highly skilled master hunter.

28
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,664
Natalia belonged to no organization.

29
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:29,846
She was a total freelancer,

30
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,434
interested only in the money she could earn.

31
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:36,670
The Mage's Association and the Church,

32
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,618
the rivalry between those two enormous organizations

33
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:42,298
kept her business booming.

34
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:40,616
During that time,

35
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:44,692
I witnessed many tragedies
like the one on Arimago Island.

36
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:49,795
I also learned that all around the world

37
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:51,539
on every single continent,

38
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,919
the same horrors happened every day.

39
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:19,174
Just missed.

40
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,530
Are you trying to be a hero or something?

41
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,115
Was there no meaning to it?

42
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:49,432
I thought...

43
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:54,065
I thought I had killed my father to
keep more people like them from dying.

44
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,774
Killing merely one man isn't the solution.

45
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:00,022
It's not that simple.

46
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:05,494
Kill every single person all around
the world who's like our target here.

47
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:08,049
If you could somehow manage to do that,

48
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:10,133
maybe it would be possible.

49
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:26,801
No matter what happens, do whatever you must to survive.

50
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:30,658
That's a rule I set for myself when
I got started in this business.

51
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,935
Regardless of what you face,
put your own life ahead of anything or anyone.

52
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:43,736
Look, kid, if you try to save someone and you
get yourself killed, it'll all be for nothing.

53
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:48,722
I don't think it's possible to save everyone.

54
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:54,551
But I do want to save as many as I possibly can.

55
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,530
Well, suit yourself.

56
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,866
This target really is a nasty piece of work.

57
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,406
Do you know him?

58
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,030
The Mage Odd Vorzak.

59
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:26,861
He's a Dead Apostle who uses his
bee familiars to create his ghouls.

60
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:30,702
The Mage's Association has
put a huge bounty on his head.

61
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:32,435
You know a lot about him.

62
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:37,818
He causes destruction wherever he goes.

63
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:42,743
The last town he visited was
completely and utterly annihilated.

64
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:44,070
Our town.

65
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,174
Natalia, can I have one of those too?

66
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,737
How old do you have to be in
your country to smoke tobacco?

67
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:05,392
I won't try to stop you,
but they aren't good for you.

68
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:20,889
What's his destination?

69
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:24,680
There's a flight from Paris to New York in four days.

70
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:26,726
Vorzak will be on board.

71
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,361
I'll be handling this myself.

72
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,286
This guy is a clever target who
managed to give me the slip once.

73
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:36,779
You gotta clean up your own messes, right?

74
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,554
So, even you fail sometimes?

75
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:41,871
That should tell you how tough he really is.

76
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:48,935
What should I do?

77
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:53,789
I'm fairly certain he has associates
working for him in New York.

78
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,873
I want you to go there and eliminate them.

79
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,754
Then you'll fight Vorzak alone.

80
00:09:01,902 --> 00:09:05,014
He can't keep his bees with him
in a carry‐on when he flies.

81
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:06,988
I see.

82
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:09,827
There's no risk of him getting away from you this time.

83
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,287
Shut your mouth, kid.

84
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:24,572
Kid, do you copy?

85
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:27,788
Roger.

86
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:29,054
Loud and clear.

87
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:33,211
All right, good luck to both of us then.

88
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,947
That was much easier than I expected.

89
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:45,207
Yes, well, I'm just glad you were able
to kill him with a minimum of force.

90
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,317
All right, Kiritsugu,

91
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,597
his corpse is in the passenger cabin.

92
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,389
Are you ready to carry it out?

93
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:02,771
I've secured a vehicle.

94
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:06,339
The only thing we need now is a doctor

95
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,379
who will carry out our sick patient.

96
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:11,896
I don't have a license, but that's okay.

97
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,005
Hey.

98
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,707
Natalia, what's wrong?

99
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,573
A ghoul!

100
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:40,096
We have a big problem here.

101
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:46,292
He was keeping the bees inside of his own body.

102
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:49,963
Natalia, you have to get out.

103
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:52,461
I'm not exactly close to the ground here.

104
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:55,409
I didn't come prepared to sky dive out of here.

105
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:01,169
This isn't good.

106
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:03,142
Looks like they've taken the cockpit.

107
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,759
I've got no choice.

108
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:18,036
Natalia, what are you gonna do?

109
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:20,839
I am coming home.

110
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,592
I'm coming home alive

111
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:25,036
carrying Vorzak's body.

112
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,315
But first I need to do something about this plane.

113
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,460
You got something to say?

114
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:34,235
Yeah.

115
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:36,126
You can do this, Natalia.

116
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:38,197
That'll do.

117
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,854
Prepare a nice warm bed for me and wait.

118
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,759
Hey, kid, do you read me?

119
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:05,713
You didn't fall asleep, did you?

120
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,140
Reading you loud and clear, Natalia.

121
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:10,116
We've both been up all night.

122
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:11,505
It's a rough morning.

123
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:15,343
If you'd slept in a bad last
night with me stuck up here,

124
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:17,594
I would have to kill
you after this is over.

125
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:21,706
Now, I have good news and bad news.
Which do you want first?

126
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:25,474
Isn't it a rule that you always
start with the good news?

127
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,056
Okay.

128
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:29,782
I guess I'll start with the good news then.

129
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:32,445
For the time being, I'm alive.

130
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:35,231
The plane is also undamaged.

131
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:38,148
I made it up to the cockpit fairly easy,

132
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:41,152
though repairing the comms array wasn't easy at all.

133
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,047
I also think I can pilot it, assuming
the controls are similar to a Cessna.

134
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,762
Have you contacted the control tower?

135
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:50,609
I have.

136
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:53,674
At first they thought I was
pulling some kind of prank.

137
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:57,553
Those kind folks say they'll escort me in.

138
00:13:58,853 --> 00:13:59,507
All right.

139
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:02,247
And the bad news?

140
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:05,538
I'm the only one here who hasn't been bitten or stung.

141
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:10,068
300 passengers and crew, they're all ghouls now.

142
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:14,443
All that separates me from the
Night of the Living Flying Dead

143
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:17,003
is the damn cockpit security door.

144
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:18,923
Spooky, right?

145
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:22,717
Given everything you've just told me,

146
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:25,255
will you be able to make it out of this alive?

147
00:14:25,944 --> 00:14:28,479
Well, the cockpit door is actually pretty tough.

148
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:31,127
They're scratching at it as we speak,

149
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:33,497
but they can't seem to break it down.

150
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:36,525
It's the landing that's worrying me.

151
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:40,279
This thing may be too big for me to handle by myself.

152
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:44,694
Natalia, I know you'll be able to manage it.

153
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,792
Were those words of encouragement?

154
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,561
It's good to hear them from you.

155
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:54,613
I can handle the landing.

156
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:58,269
But what do I do with all these monsters in back?

157
00:14:59,233 --> 00:14:59,729
Hm.

158
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:01,744
Don't worry about that.

159
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,252
I have it all worked out, Natalia.

160
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:05,559
Hm?

161
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,820
I can always count on you.

162
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,359
50 more minutes till we get to the airport.

163
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:14,949
That's a little bit too long to spend praying.

164
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:18,102
Kid, keep me company for a while, okay?

165
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:19,559
I can do that.

166
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:51,589
Way back when you first said you
wanted to help me with my work,

167
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:54,244
I really didn't know how to respond.

168
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:58,248
You just didn't look ready to
relent no matter what I said.

169
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:02,727
So, I showed that little promise as a student?

170
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:04,690
No, it's not that.

171
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,725
You had a lot of potential.

172
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:08,265
Too much.

173
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:09,995
What does that mean?

174
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:14,369
The ability to pull a trigger to
kill regardless of your feelings

175
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:19,377
is a skill most killers take
many years to fully develop.

176
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:22,452
You had that skill from the very start.

177
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:24,127
It's a hell of a gift.

178
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:31,618
But choosing your occupation based solely on your
talents doesn't necessarily guarantee your happiness.

179
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:37,812
If you think only of what you should do
and completely ignore what you want to do,

180
00:16:38,585 --> 00:16:42,059
then you're just a simple
machine, a force of nature.

181
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:45,009
That isn't how a human being should live.

182
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,222
I'm surprised.

183
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,863
You know, I always thought of you
as a much colder person than that.

184
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,626
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm cold.

185
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:59,076
In all these years, have I ever
spoiled you or coddled you even once?

186
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:02,733
True, you've always been a rather strict teacher.

187
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:05,341
You never held anything back

188
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:07,527
and taught me what you could.

189
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:15,144
Under normal circumstances,
training a boy like you is the father's job.

190
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:18,406
But...well...

191
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:23,460
I'm afraid that in your case

192
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,788
I basically took away your chance
for that kind of upbringing.

193
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:29,396
Anyway, I...

194
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:32,113
I did feel a little bad about it.

195
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:37,254
This was the only way of life I knew how to teach you.

196
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:41,169
So you consider yourself my dad?

197
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:44,596
I'm a full‐grown woman, you rude little jerk.

198
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,627
At least call me mother.

199
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,447
You're right.

200
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:49,599
Sorry.

201
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:54,715
I spent an awfully long time on
my own in this bloody business.

202
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:59,121
So long that I even lost track
of the fact that I was alone.

203
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:04,079
But...it's been pretty entertaining in its own way,

204
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:06,563
having something like a family in my life.

205
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:08,181
For me too.

206
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:10,289
For all these years,

207
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:12,943
I did always think of you as a mother.

208
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,340
I was happy to have you.

209
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,063
Look, kid, I think we'd better quit saying stuff
that'll embarrass us next time we see each other, okay?

210
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,957
You're throwing me off my game.

211
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:29,494
I've got to land this thing in 20 minutes or so.

212
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:34,859
If I'm laughing over what we were just talking
about and screw up, I'll end up dead, you know?

213
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:38,913
Sorry, I'll stop.

214
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:46,540
You know, maybe I'm just getting too old for this job.

215
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:49,346
Maybe the reason I screwed up so badly

216
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:53,318
is because playing at having a
family made me lower my guard.

217
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:56,335
If that's true, I should walk away.

218
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:58,803
Maybe it's time to retire.

219
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:01,555
If you quit this job,

220
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:03,482
what would you do with your life?

221
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:05,930
If I weren't working...

222
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:09,653
The only thing left for me to do

223
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,401
would be to really act like a mother, I guess.

224
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:29,518
Natalia, you are...

225
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:34,464
...my real family.

226
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,829
Did you see that, Shirley?

227
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,365
I killed someone again,

228
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:30,938
just like I did with my dad.

229
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:34,202
I didn't screw up like I did with you.

230
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:37,209
I saved an awful lot of lives.

231
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,631
If Natalia had landed that plane safely,

232
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:44,614
there's no telling how many people

233
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:47,107
might have died.

234
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,144
Her sacrifice prevented all of that.

235
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:57,592
So I...

236
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,165
So I...

237
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,051
Shirley, I...

238
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:12,825
Shut your mouth.

239
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:14,079
Just shut up.

240
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:16,184
Bastard!

241
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:28,192
Tell me, Kerry,

242
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,542
what do you want to grow up to be?

243
00:21:32,864 --> 00:21:33,604
I...

244
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:42,520
I want to...
