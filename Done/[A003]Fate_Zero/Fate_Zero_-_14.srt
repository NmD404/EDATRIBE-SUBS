1
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:07,994
If there really is a giant monster out there,
do you think they'll authorize us to attack?

2
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:12,529
If this was a monster movie,
I guarantee we'd be the first to get killed off.

3
00:00:13,337 --> 00:00:16,701
You know, curtain raisers to set things
up till the main character shows up.

4
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:19,027
Uh, that's not even funny, sir.

5
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,222
Whatever it is, we'll find out soon enough.

6
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,332
Didn't work, it's just restoring itself.

7
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,737
What incredible regenerating power.

8
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:07,521
It's all they can do to keep it from coming ashore.

9
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:10,094
Well, at this rate,

10
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:12,837
I'll never get through to Caster.

11
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,826
Awesome, so awesome.

12
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,405
That is so totally awesome, big guy!

13
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:23,492
The Lord has come.

14
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:27,214
The Lord has come!

15
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,915
It's terrible, how could this have happened?

16
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,736
In the long and winding history of the Holy Grail Wars,

17
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,729
a foul up like this is unprecedented.

18
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,450
According to our observers' reports,

19
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:13,921
even though the Mion River area is blanketed in mist,

20
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,781
a large number of onlookers have
already begun to gather there.

21
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:22,107
I fear we can no longer handle this by ourselves.

22
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:26,072
We must petition the Mage's Association for assistance.

23
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,978
What is Tokiomi doing right now?

24
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:35,731
My master left for the scene with Archer

25
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:38,601
immediately after Caster's monster appeared.

26
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:43,480
In that case, I will see to the
arrangements for the cover up.

27
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:48,296
Go to Tokiomi immediately and
assist him in any way you can.

28
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:51,210
I understand, Father.

29
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:02,672
This sight has begun to turn my stomach.

30
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:09,201
Mongrels though they may be,
they are still figures of at least some slight renown.

31
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,206
Yet here they are working together with all
their might to finish off that disgusting thing.

32
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:18,669
Surely there are limits to which one may sink.

33
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,606
Do you not agree with that, Tokiomi?

34
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,537
We must destroy that monster

35
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:30,295
before there are any more witnesses to the battle.

36
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:34,078
The honor of the Tohsaka family is at stake.

37
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,643
My king, that monster is a vermin
that is ravaging your garden.

38
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:43,310
I humbly beseech you to slay it yourself.

39
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:47,134
Dealing with pests is the job of a gardener,

40
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:50,800
or is your intent to mock my Noble Phantasms,

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,385
putting them on the level of a gardener's hoe, Tokiomi.

42
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:57,097
I would never dream of such a thing,

43
00:04:57,249 --> 00:05:01,516
but as you can see, Majesty,
this creature is beyond the ability of the others.

44
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:05,159
It's the perfect opportunity
to demonstrate your true might.

45
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:07,737
I beg you, please take action.

46
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:13,362
Hm.

47
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:47,708
It can't be.

48
00:05:49,186 --> 00:05:50,735
We're leaving, Tokiomi.

49
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:54,343
I've grown weary of watching that disgusting creature.

50
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:57,686
No, King of Heroes, wait, I beg you.

51
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:03,991
Tokiomi, I sacrificed four swords
thinking it might duty towards you.

52
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:10,522
Having been defiled by touching that filthy
thing, I have no interest in retrieving them.

53
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,641
Do not presume upon my generosity.

54
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:16,091
You are the only heroic spirit alive

55
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:17,924
able to defeat that thing.

56
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:23,945
Given its regenerative abilities, the sole way
to defeat it is to annihilate it in one strike.

57
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:28,697
Only your Sword of Dissociation is
capable of accomplishing that so‐-

58
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,630
You fool!

59
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:33,646
You dare suggest that I draw forth Ea here!

60
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:37,526
Don't forget your place, I should have your head

61
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,778
for being so impertinent to your king!

62
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,991
I could use a Command Seal, but if I did, it would
shatter my relationship with the King of Heroes.

63
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:55,849
Father Risei and I had originally arranged
for this Caster hunting expedition

64
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,745
so that I could recover
the Command Seal I lost.

65
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:02,942
How could my plan be backfiring so badly?

66
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,968
Damn.

67
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,507
What the hell is that?

68
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:19,914
There's a weird light hovering
in the sky at six o'clock.

69
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,372
It's not a helicopter.

70
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,844
Is it a UFO or something?

71
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:28,104
Control to Diablo One,

72
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,961
we need a situation report.

73
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:32,756
The situation is,

74
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,590
uh, well...

75
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:39,214
Diablo Two, gonna go down to get a closer look.

76
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,617
Wait, Kobayashi!

77
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:46,065
Diablo Two, get back here!

78
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:51,010
Official inspection from up close
will tell us what that thing is.

79
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,891
Kobayashi.

80
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,930
Kobayashi!

81
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,291
A fearsome creature indeed.

82
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,151
It... it ate it.

83
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,260
Control to Diablo One.

84
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,166
What's going on over there?

85
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:35,606
Report!

86
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:39,198
Eyes, it has eyes.

87
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,015
It's absolutely covered with eyes!

88
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,294
Eyes, what do you mean it has eyes?

89
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:48,893
Shit, that thing wants to eat me too.

90
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:51,359
Captain Ogi.

91
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:54,587
Diablo One engaging.

92
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:57,388
Wait, Ogi, engaging what?

93
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,712
I'll kill it before it gets me.

94
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,554
This is for Kobayashi.

95
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,628
I'm gonna pump you with missiles, ya bastard.

96
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,964
Berserker?

97
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,007
Oh man, what's he doing here?

98
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:18,060
You fool, stay down!

99
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,657
Now he decides to join us?

100
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,285
Isn't that...

101
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:35,630
Ah, so that mad dog has turned up again.

102
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,478
This should be amusing.

103
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:43,637
My king, allow me to deal with his master.

104
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:47,107
Very well, merely toy with him.

105
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:49,877
Then good luck to us both, Your Majesty.

106
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:09,683
Dogs like you belong prostrated on the ground.

107
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:12,653
Yet you dare to climb into my sky.

108
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:17,568
Don't put on airs, you mongrel!

109
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:35,773
Such impertinence.

110
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,019
How amusing.

111
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,432
I've not played a game like this in quite some time.

112
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:12,220
For a lowly animal, you're providing me

113
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:14,895
with no shortage of entertainment.

114
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,828
I hardly recognize you,

115
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,691
Kariya Matou.

116
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,001
Though you turned your back on
magecraft, you still desired the Grail.

117
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,984
To think you'd slink back in such a sorry state.

118
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,259
The very sight of you is enough to invite whispers

119
00:11:40,705 --> 00:11:43,449
that the Matou family has fallen from grace.

120
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:49,807
Tokiomi Tohsaka, answer me a question.

121
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:53,532
Why did you hand your daughter Sakura over to Zouken?

122
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:55,290
What?

123
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:59,381
You really think that's what you should
be worrying about at this moment?

124
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:01,960
Answer me, Tokiomi!

125
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,556
Do you even need to ask?

126
00:12:06,663 --> 00:12:10,157
I did it because I wished to give
my beloved daughter a happy future.

127
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:12,297
You what?

128
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:17,213
All mages who have two children
eventually suffer for it.

129
00:12:17,728 --> 00:12:21,226
The family's secret arts can
be passed to only one child.

130
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:27,134
They suffer over the issue that one of them
must be cast down into the common masses.

131
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:31,942
The simple fact is that my wife
is superior breeding stock.

132
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:38,269
Both Rin and Sakura were born with equally
rare natural gifts and magical abilities.

133
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:45,061
And so both my daughters were in need of the
protection and nurturing attention of a mage family.

134
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:51,126
For the future of one daughter I must waste the
vast potential lurking deep inside the other?

135
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:56,617
What father would wish such a
woeful tragedy upon his children?

136
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:00,862
Common masses.

137
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:05,128
The memory of his children and their mother on that day.

138
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:10,078
This heartless man is writing it off
as something for the common masses.

139
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:14,872
If I was to preserve the hopes I
had for both sisters' abilities,

140
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:17,440
my only option would be to send one away.

141
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:21,966
That is why the Matou family's offer was such a godsend.

142
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:26,086
If she were to be adopted by a mage family,

143
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,565
it would give her that much greater
chance of reaching the root.

144
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:33,713
A mage is someone who is born with great power,

145
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,176
and before he knows it,
he will attain even greater heights of power.

146
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:42,705
Even before a mage embraces his destiny,

147
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,676
his responsibility to do so is in his blood.

148
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:49,717
That is what it means to be born the child of a mage.

149
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:54,586
If I fail, it falls to my daughter, Rin,

150
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,954
and even if Rin fails in her quest, then Sakura

151
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:02,487
may yet fulfill the dream of the Tohsaka family.

152
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:09,203
You bastard, you want them to fight each other?

153
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,018
Sister against sister?

154
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:14,388
Even if such a development were to come to pass,

155
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:17,718
it is still best for the future of my descendents.

156
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:18,555
What?

157
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:21,188
Glory will go to the victor,

158
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:24,514
and to the loser, honor to the family of her forbearers.

159
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,403
The best outcome I could possibly hope for.

160
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,758
You bastard, you're insane!

161
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:33,999
It is a waste of time to try to explain it to you.

162
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:37,502
You don't comprehend magecraft's grandeur,

163
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,330
and even turned your back and walked away from it.

164
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:41,848
A lowly traitor.

165
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,494
Screw you, bastard!

166
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:53,006
I'll make all you bastards pay.

167
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:56,494
You filthy rotten mages.

168
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:58,840
I'll kill you all.

169
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,539
Zouken and you.

170
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,061
Every last one of you.

171
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,340
I'll kill you all.

172
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:09,419
When you turned down the family leadership,

173
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,267
the Matou's magic secrets were passed on to Sakura.

174
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:17,292
In spite of the fact that I
really should be thanking you

175
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:19,485
for my Sakura's future,

176
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:23,298
you are one man that I simply cannot abide.

177
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,689
The weakness revealed by shirking of your obligations,

178
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:32,561
the deficient character revealed
by your lack of indebtedness to it.

179
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:35,598
You, Kariya Matou, are a disgrace.

180
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:41,421
Having crossed paths with you again I
have no choice but to put you to death.

181
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,844
Don't talk so high and mighty, you inhuman bastard.

182
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:51,637
You're mistaken, shouldering one's responsibilities
is the first requisite of being human.

183
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:55,021
It is those who fail to do so...

184
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:01,030
...that are subhuman dogs.

185
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,604
Kariya.

186
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:06,124
Hear me now, bugs.
Devour this bastard.

187
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:09,583
Eat him alive!

188
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:15,530
Oh yeah, go get 'em, Bluebeard!

189
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:18,030
Crush 'em down, tear 'em apart!

190
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:20,717
This place is God's toy box!

191
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,264
Saber!

192
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,946
I am much obliged, Saber.

193
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:49,895
I'll never be bored again as long as I live.

194
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,005
I won't have to go through all
the trouble of murdering people.

195
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:55,612
They'll die in droves
without me lifting a finger.

196
00:17:56,595 --> 00:18:01,259
They'll be flattened,
chopped to bits, smashed, eaten.

197
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:04,431
They'll die and die and die left and right.

198
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:10,965
I'll be able to see one kind of guts and gore
after another that I've never seen before.

199
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:15,944
All day, every day, all around the
world, everywhere I look!

200
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,512
It'll be nonstop, never‐end...

201
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:25,741
It stopped moving.

202
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,600
Hm?

203
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:32,885
What the... hey, what happened?

204
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:36,282
Huh?

205
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,397
That's so pretty.

206
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,860
Now I get it.

207
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:54,997
No wonder I never realized it before.

208
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:59,951
Oh man, talk about not being able
to see the forest for the trees.

209
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:02,301
It was in me.

210
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:05,292
I was looking for my own guts.

211
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:08,606
I didn't have to go searching for it.

212
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:11,822
It was hiding right there all along.

213
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:14,844
Ryuunosuke!

214
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:19,545
I finally found you.

215
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:23,033
I've been looking for you my whole life.

216
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:26,427
What the hell, man?

217
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,557
If you were inside me all along,

218
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:31,332
I wish you would've

219
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:35,798
just told me so in the first place.

220
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:57,802
Ryuunosuke, my master.

221
00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:02,174
How could you die and leave me here all alone?

222
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,073
But never you fear, dear Ryuunosuke,

223
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:11,836
for I, Gilles de Rais,
will fulfill the solemn promise I made to you.

224
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:20,953
Ryuunosuke, watch closely!
Behold my offering to you!

225
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,763
I shall give you the greatest "cool!" ever!

226
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,573
I just put down the man I believe to be Caster's master.

227
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:38,034
It looks like I was right about him.

228
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:44,008
While all the other servants are being distracted
by the monster, shall I eliminate the next target?

229
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,754
Wait, Maiya, that's no ordinary monster.

230
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:50,957
It's a creature with limitless regenerative ability.

231
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,818
It's still possible that it could
reach the shore before it dissipates.

232
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:57,648
If it does and begins to feed, it's all over.

233
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:01,753
Caster will have a new source of
mana to maintain his physical form.

234
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,633
If that happens, the damage will spread even further,

235
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:08,148
and there's a risk that the Holy
Grail War itself will break down.

236
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:09,834
Exactly.

237
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,693
But how do we kill an indestructible monster?

238
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,218
The only way is to annihilate it in a single strike.

239
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:20,568
To do that, its entire body will have to be incinerated.

240
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:23,625
Leaving nothing, not even the smallest scrap of flesh.

241
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,595
Anti‐Personnel Noble Phantasms won't suffice.

242
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:29,585
An Anti‐Fortress one is needed.

243
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:35,500
Saber possesses just such an
Anti‐Fortress Noble Phantasm.

244
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:40,942
However, because of Lancer's curse,

245
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:42,303
she can't use it.

246
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:45,818
We'll just have to wait and see

247
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,587
exactly what they can really accomplish

248
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:51,523
with their so‐called chivalric spirit.
