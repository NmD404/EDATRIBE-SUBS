1
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,177
Ah!

2
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:52,083
What?

3
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,596
Ah!

4
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:08,934
Rin.

5
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:56,712
Hey!

6
00:02:57,857 --> 00:03:01,241
You losers shouldn't gang up on
someone and bully them like that!

7
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:04,229
You guys suck, you really suck!

8
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:07,583
What's your problem, Tohsaka?
There's nothing here that concerns you.

9
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:11,462
Yeah, in that case, why don't you do the same to me?

10
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,984
And then it will concern me.

11
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:19,216
Come on, this is getting lame.

12
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:23,658
Here.

13
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:31,541
You used too much mana all at once.

14
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:34,335
Maintain a calm mind.

15
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:39,752
In order to control magic, you must first
achieve complete control of your thoughts.

16
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:50,093
Lose control and the mana will
suddenly rebound back to your body.

17
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:57,027
Too much power or power in the wrong form will
endanger not only you, but those around you.

18
00:03:57,926 --> 00:04:00,948
Strive to consistently maintain the proper flow.

19
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:03,538
That is the Tohsaka family motto.

20
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:07,004
It means always remaining reserved

21
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,544
and elegant.

22
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:15,715
You shouldn't let them get way
with it when they try that stuff.

23
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:19,547
If they're in the wrong, you just have
to get mad and do something about it.

24
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:23,258
You're amazing, Rin,
the way you always speak your mind like that.

25
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,756
I'm not amazing at all.

26
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:27,565
I think it's normal.
I mean, it's only natural.

27
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,097
That's right, it's only natural.

28
00:04:40,324 --> 00:04:41,402
Hold out your hand.

29
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:45,539
Oh.

30
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:48,321
Father, oh please teach me more.

31
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:50,869
How do I make something like this?

32
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:55,119
Well, my dear, that might be a
bit difficult for you right now.

33
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:59,757
But if you work hard every day,

34
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,748
you'll be able to make it eventually.

35
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:07,262
After all, Rin, you're a daughter of the Tohsaka family.

36
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,912
Hey, Rin, could you please
show me how to do this part?

37
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,595
Of course, which part?

38
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:23,135
Yeah, me too.

39
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,371
Me too.

40
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,790
Oh, this was on page 23 of the textbook.

41
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,031
You see, you just did the math wrong here.

42
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,930
For this problem, it's just like this example, see?

43
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:44,298
Kotone, have a seat, I'll help everyone in turn.

44
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:46,013
Okay.

45
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:07,298
Do I really have to go and live with the Zenjo family?

46
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:12,937
Once the Holy Grail War begins,
it will no longer be safe for you in Fuyuki.

47
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:18,501
But I... but I want to do something to
help you with the Grail War, Father.

48
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,870
Rin, you mustn't cause trouble for your father.

49
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:24,676
Do you think that we're in the way?

50
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,075
Not at all.

51
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,707
Please try to understand,
I need to make preparations for the battle.

52
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:35,911
Those preparations include doing
what's necessary to ensure your safety.

53
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:40,468
And for me to do that,
you simply can't stay in Fuyuki.

54
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:45,205
But I'm certain there's
something I can do to help!

55
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:55,655
That's right, I just haven't learned how to yet.

56
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:59,187
So, all I need to do is study on my own.

57
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:06,123
I don't understand any of this.

58
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:08,180
What is this?

59
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:09,540
Tease!

60
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:12,174
Oh.

61
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,656
I have to close it.

62
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,492
It won't move.

63
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:38,951
Rin!

64
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:41,602
Are you all right?

65
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:53,055
It's still too soon for you to read this book.

66
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:57,927
Some things in this world contain their own mana.

67
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:12,278
This is called a mana compass. Normally, it doesn't
point to anything except for mana traces in the area.

68
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:16,015
Rin, try generating mana in this.

69
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:17,162
Okay.

70
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:23,425
Ah.

71
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:24,982
You see?

72
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:27,487
And with that book.

73
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:34,974
Anything that provokes a reaction like that
is beyond your ability, so be very careful.

74
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:36,207
Ah.

75
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,969
I'll give this to you as an early birthday present.

76
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:43,598
Oh, thank you so much, Father.

77
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:48,984
Once the Holy Grail War is all over,
you and I will try some real jewel magic.

78
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:54,591
And then strange things began to happen.

79
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:07,041
They said we have study hall again.

80
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:12,848
There was another kidnapping on the news this morning.

81
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:14,263
...the sudden disappearance of children

82
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,143
has police investigators baffled.

83
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:18,603
The teachers have been in a meeting all day.

84
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:20,433
They said we won't have fifth period today.

85
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:21,273
All right!

86
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:23,195
But they said we should stay home.

87
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,603
Why?

88
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:25,139
Another kidnapping.

89
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,728
They say only children have been kidnapped.

90
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:29,071
Hey, did you hear?

91
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:29,844
Uh.

92
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:37,496
Apparently there's no body inside the
coffin, it was in such bad shape.

93
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,455
It definitely happened in Fuyuki, right?

94
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:51,859
My name is Tohsaka and I'm in Kotone's class...

95
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,223
The person you are calling is not home.

96
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,513
Please leave your message after the beep.

97
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,450
Thank you.

98
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:14,132
Please be safe.

99
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,384
Kotone.

100
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,919
This is Fuyuki at night.

101
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:38,143
It's different than during the day.

102
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,713
Ooh, it's really cold and creepy.

103
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,944
What is this?

104
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:49,799
I've never seen it do this.

105
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:54,186
Does this mean there are traces
of magic all around here?

106
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:58,914
I've got to find Kotone.

107
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,672
Huh?

108
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:44,438
Someone out with their kid this late?

109
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:48,633
What was that flash?

110
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:15,404
Oh, no.

111
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:26,963
That was close.

112
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:29,272
If I'm spotted, they'll take me home.

113
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,558
Come on, you've got to walk, kid.

114
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:48,555
Two of them?

115
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:55,561
He's gathered more kids.

116
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:57,448
But why?

117
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,501
Wait, why am I hiding?

118
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:05,566
I can't accomplish anything this way.

119
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,813
Looks like no one's here.

120
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,546
Hey, hey you?

121
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,178
Kotone, Kotone, Kotone!

122
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,437
Something's been done to her.

123
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,910
What do I do?

124
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:52,391
Think, Rin.

125
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:02,287
Well now, are you lost little girl?

126
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:05,314
No, um I...

127
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:06,801
Perfect timing.

128
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,286
We were just about to get the party started.

129
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,256
But we still don't have enough guests.

130
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:16,133
Want to help?

131
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:17,621
It'll be fun.

132
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:27,281
When it comes to parties,
the more the merrier I always say.

133
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:30,288
No!

134
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:33,210
What, what just happened?

135
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:35,203
Don't run from me.

136
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:44,776
Is he controlling them with that bracelet?

137
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:57,146
Ow!

138
00:15:58,142 --> 00:15:59,007
I've got it.

139
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:11,182
Well, well, you're gonna help me after all?

140
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:20,481
Huh?

141
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:38,903
What is that?

142
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:42,705
You use too much mana all at once.

143
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,335
I can destroy that!

144
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:49,376
What?

145
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:58,173
Kotone!

146
00:17:00,962 --> 00:17:01,560
Rin?

147
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:03,479
What's going on?

148
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,226
This is not the time to cry.

149
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,226
Run!

150
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:12,183
Hey, wait!

151
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:17,240
Oh, man.

152
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,006
I hope the big guy won't be too pissed.

153
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:27,857
Where's Rin?

154
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,082
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

155
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,801
Good, it's done.

156
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:38,775
I did it, Father.

157
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:42,930
What?

158
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:47,677
Ah!

159
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:57,730
Anything that provokes a reaction like that
is beyond your ability, so be very careful.

160
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:00,846
Ah.

161
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:29,411
Rin, I just can't believe she went to Fuyuki.

162
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,640
Rin!

163
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:41,224
Rin.

164
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:42,661
Rin is fine.

165
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:44,474
She's just asleep.

166
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:50,866
Kariya.

167
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:54,491
What's happening here?

168
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:56,578
What are you doing here?

169
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,018
Your face.

170
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,797
Behold the family magic of the Matous.

171
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:09,147
You offer your flesh and your life is slowly devoured.

172
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:11,738
That is the magic's price.

173
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,083
But Sakura will be fine.

174
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:18,027
I'll save her before this happens to her.

175
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,435
Zouken's only desire is the grail.

176
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:25,502
He gave me his promise that he'll release Sakura

177
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:27,168
as soon as I win it for him.

178
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:29,517
If you win the grail?

179
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,329
Yeah, so don't worry.

180
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:33,371
My servant is the strongest.

181
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:35,266
It won't lose to anyone.

182
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:41,175
Considering what she's been through, hope would
be nothing but cruel torture to Sakura right now.

183
00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:44,359
So, pray for her since she can't.

184
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:48,077
Pray for my victory, for Sakura's future.

185
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,350
Kariya, wait.

186
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,612
Someday I'm sure we'll all play in this park,

187
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:01,561
just like we used to back in better days.

188
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,471
And Rin and Sakura will be sisters again.

189
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:09,347
So, Aoi, you don't need to cry anymore.

190
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:17,737
Kariya, are you going to die and kill Tokiomi too?

191
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:23,338
Mother?

192
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:27,081
Rin, I was so worried about you.

193
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,236
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

194
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,724
I'm so sorry.

195
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:33,624
I'm so sorry.

196
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:42,786
Master Kirei, are you certain that you wish to allow
Tokiomi Tohsaka's wife and daughter to go free?

197
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:44,552
It's fine.

198
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:47,888
You are to continue
monitoring Berserker's master.

199
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:49,823
Understood.

200
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,457
It wasn't much, but I did manage to do something.

201
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,741
I guess I'm not a full‐fledged mage yet.

202
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:17,207
I passed out half way through.

203
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:20,732
That means I need to work harder.

204
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,607
But that's just for now.

205
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:27,013
I have plenty of time to train more.

206
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:31,745
And someday, I'll take my place as a Tohsaka mage.

207
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:37,638
I'll have to practice really hard and obey my
father so that I'll be ready when that day comes.

208
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:40,571
And when the time does come,

209
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:45,129
I'll do it to the best of my
ability, as elegantly as I can.
