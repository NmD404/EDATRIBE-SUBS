1
00:00:05,526 --> 00:00:08,059
I am Iskandar, the King of Conquerors!

2
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:10,215
In this battle for the Holy Grail,

3
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,607
I am of the Rider Class of Servants.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,786
Wh... what the hell are you thinking
announcing yourself that way?

5
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:18,750
You idiot!

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,491
Ow!

7
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:20,711
Ow...

8
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:28,277
Fate has brought us all together in this place to
do battle for the possession of the Holy Grail.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,540
But first, I wish to make a proposition and offer.

10
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:38,655
What think you of yielding the Holy Grail to
me and joining my glorious and invincible army?

11
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:42,442
You will be treated as honored
allies, friends, and brothers in arms!

12
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:47,281
Together we shall share in the glory of
battle and the joy of world conquest!

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,331
Hm.

14
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:53,483
I'm afraid that I must decline your offer.

15
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:55,923
As tempting as that offer may be,

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,477
I may give the Grail to but one man.

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,699
My new avowed lord and Master.

18
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:04,371
And not to the likes of you, Rider!

19
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:05,743
Tell me, Rider.

20
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:09,358
Did you come here and interfere
with our battle, rudely,

21
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:12,762
merely to proffer that ridiculous
and laughable plan of yours?

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,653
This is a grave offense against my honor!

23
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:16,768
Hmm.

24
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,821
I'd be willing to discuss compensation.

25
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:21,827
Enough!

26
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:24,133
Hm.

27
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:25,487
And further,

28
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:30,320
I am the rightful king of Britain
and not merely a knight of the realm.

29
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:34,244
I could never lower myself to mere
retainer, even to a mighty king!

30
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:36,660
Ooh, you are king of Britain?

31
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:38,096
That is quite a surprise!

32
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,660
I would hardly have expected the
King of Knights to be a little girl.

33
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,561
Then would you like to taste of this
little girl's blade, King of Conquerors?

34
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:51,488
I suppose negotiations have failed.

35
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:53,030
Such a terrible waste.

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,911
A truly awful shame.

37
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,430
Rider!

38
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:40,879
I can't believe it.

39
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:43,388
That moron nearly conquered the known world?

40
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:45,967
What the hell is wrong with you?

41
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:49,613
So, you were the one who did it, huh?

42
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:58,334
I'd been wondering what twisted madness had invaded
your psyche and compelled you to steal my relic.

43
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:04,553
I never even imagined that you yourself had
being planning to enter the Holy Grail War.

44
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:06,886
Waver...

45
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:08,859
Velvet?

46
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,901
Now I know you're not experienced in these matters.

47
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:17,088
How would you like me to offer you a private lesson?

48
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,440
What it really means for mages to kill one another?

49
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:26,280
I'll teach you all about the fear and
pain involved in such noble endeavors.

50
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:29,137
You should feel honored.

51
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:35,038
Hm.

52
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:37,421
Mage who is speaking now,

53
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:44,108
do I understand correctly that you believe you were to
be my Master rather than this boy I'm sworn to serve?

54
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:47,041
That whole idea is absurd and laughable!

55
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:50,629
Only one brave enough to openly
ride onto the battlefield

56
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:53,816
standing at my side could
ever hope to be my Master!

57
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,355
A coward who lacks sufficient courage to show himself

58
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,333
is nowhere close to being worthy of me!

59
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,379
Of course, there are also others!

60
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:11,634
They're out there skulking in the darkness, watching us!

61
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:13,716
What are you talking about, Rider?

62
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,748
Saber and Lancer,

63
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,769
the skills and bravery you showed were impressive!

64
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:21,536
Your duel was magnificent!

65
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:25,328
Surely the sound of your blades
and the fury of your battle

66
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:30,327
called other Heroic Spirits here to bear
witness and glean knowledge from your encounter.

67
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:31,415
Heroic Spirits,

68
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,859
born again through the Holy Grail,

69
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:35,514
gather here and now!

70
00:05:35,907 --> 00:05:39,255
Those too craven and cowardly
to show themselves here tonight

71
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,094
will draw the vicious scorn of Iskandar,

72
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,364
King of Conquerors!

73
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:49,347
Kirei.

74
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:50,840
Yes?

75
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:52,674
This is not good.

76
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,167
Not good indeed.

77
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,107
Oh no, that's him!

78
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,689
The Servant that defeated Assassin?

79
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:14,487
So, two lesser beings dare to name themselves kings

80
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:16,913
even in my royal presence.

81
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,850
I fail to see where the problem lies, Servant?

82
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,063
For I am Iskandar,

83
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:26,064
the legendary King of Conquerors known
through all the lands of the world.

84
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,701
What nonsense!

85
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:31,669
You're deluding yourself!
I am the one true king of the world!

86
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,348
All others are mongrels!

87
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:34,961
Pretenders to the name!

88
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:38,818
If you are that insistent of your
claim, then why not name yourself?

89
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:44,614
No true king should be troubled by something as simple
as giving his name to those he wishes to challenge.

90
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:47,620
So, you would question me, you filthy mongrel?

91
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:50,379
Me, the one true king?

92
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:56,040
If you cannot now discern my identity
in the presence of my magnificent glory,

93
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:59,921
then your ignorant blindness
will serve to seal your doom!

94
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:04,539
I see now.

95
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:06,634
That is how he killed Assassin.

96
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:12,571
That is his Noble Phantasm.

97
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:22,472
Kill them all.

98
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:33,555
Berserker?

99
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,747
So, King of Conquerors,

100
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:39,060
are you planning to ask him to join too?

101
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:40,253
Perhaps not.

102
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:44,945
He doesn't seem terribly interested in
civilized negotiations of any kind, does he?

103
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:46,209
Hey there, boy.

104
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:49,432
How powerful a Servant is this monster, huh?

105
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:51,607
I don't know.

106
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,074
I can't really tell.

107
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:54,511
What do you mean, boy?

108
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:57,288
Are you not a Master chosen by the Holy Grail?

109
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:02,538
You're supposed to be able to sense all
their strengths and weaknesses, aren't you?

110
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,432
I can't tell anything.

111
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:09,411
That black thing is definitely a Servant,

112
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:12,992
but I can't read its status or anything else!

113
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,354
Hmm.

114
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:18,586
It appears you'll be facing another difficult enemy.

115
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:19,934
Yes, so it seems.

116
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:22,436
That spirit has some curse or other ability.

117
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,931
It fully conceals nearly everything about him.

118
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,777
But that isn't all.

119
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:32,044
With four other Servants present,
we have to be very careful.

120
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:35,843
Why did he materialize here?

121
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,898
No sane Master would ever choose

122
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:42,299
to send their Servant out here
under these circumstances,

123
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,943
certainly not right into the middle of all this chaos.

124
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:49,022
Maiya, keep watching Assassin.

125
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,657
I'll look for Berserker's Master.

126
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,791
Who gave you permission to look upon me?

127
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,571
You rabid dog.

128
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:09,400
May your death provide me some
modicum of entertainment, mongrel!

129
00:09:18,694 --> 00:09:19,752
Good God!

130
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,411
Is that truly Berserker?

131
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:25,026
For a madman completely devoid of a soul or conscience,

132
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,370
huh, he is rather nimble.

133
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:28,150
Huh?

134
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:29,174
Come now.

135
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,987
Couldn't you tell what he did?

136
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,714
That black thing casually snatched the first
blade that was flying toward him out of the air

137
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:38,554
and used it to deflect the second spear.

138
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:46,941
You dare lay your filthy hands
on my precious treasures.

139
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:50,442
You must long for a painful death, cur!

140
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,203
No way, that's impossible!

141
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:58,000
All right now, mongrel.

142
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:00,963
Let us all just see how long your parlor tricks

143
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:03,323
can keep you alive now!

144
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:52,319
Fool...

145
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,405
I belong among the heavens,

146
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,844
yet you would have me trod upon the ground?

147
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,461
Your impudence has guaranteed your death!

148
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:01,661
Mongrel!

149
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:05,304
When I am through with you,
nothing will remain of your corpse!

150
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:13,284
Gilgamesh is serious.

151
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:18,932
He plans to open the Gate of Babylon even further.

152
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:23,499
Repeatedly exposing his Noble
Phantasm to all the others.

153
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:24,980
Very rash of him.

154
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,667
Your decision, my Master.

155
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:35,223
By the power of my Command Seal.

156
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:38,897
King of Heroes, quell thine anger and withdraw.

157
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:46,019
You dare to order a king to
withdraw, to leave the fight undone?

158
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:48,667
You have much nerve, Tokiomi!

159
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:55,836
You were fortunate, mad dog.

160
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:57,652
You mongrels!

161
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:58,715
By our next meeting,

162
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:00,704
see that you culled your numbers!

163
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:04,405
Only a true hero is worthy to
look upon my glorious presence!

164
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:08,632
Hm.

165
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:14,648
It would seem that Archer's Master has much less
fortitude and is far less courageous than he is.

166
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,584
Irisviel!

167
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:29,517
Get back!

168
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:39,131
What?

169
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:48,774
So that's what it is.

170
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:53,917
Whatever he grabs onto with his
hands becomes his Noble Phantasm.

171
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:58,844
Saber!

172
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:04,807
Hey, Maiya,

173
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:08,348
have you gotten any visual on Berserker's Master?

174
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:09,787
No, I haven't.

175
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,762
This looks bad.

176
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,197
Damn.

177
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,525
What are you, monster?

178
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:43,087
That's quite enough messing around for now, Berserker!

179
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:47,203
You see, Saber has a prior engagement.

180
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,533
If you insist on interfering with that obligation,

181
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,542
you'll have to face me.

182
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:53,990
Lancer...

183
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,989
What are you doing, Lancer?

184
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:00,950
This is your chance to defeat
Saber and take her out of play.

185
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:03,385
My Master!

186
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:05,862
I, Diarmuid,
will defeat Saber!

187
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:07,970
I swear it upon my honor!

188
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,425
If you insist I kill her here and now,

189
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,145
then I will first defeat that mad dog Berserker!

190
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:16,170
Please, my Master, let it be so!

191
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:20,539
With my Command Seal, I order you.

192
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:21,709
My lord!

193
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,520
You are to help Berserker kill Saber!

194
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:28,362
Now!

195
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:38,557
Lancer!

196
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:52,344
Sorry, Saber.

197
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:56,374
Irisviel, listen!

198
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:57,940
I shall hold them here!

199
00:14:58,218 --> 00:15:01,804
While I do that, you must leave
this place as quickly as possible!

200
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,405
Run!

201
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:04,195
Get as far away as you can!

202
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:06,888
Irisviel, please!

203
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,081
Run away!

204
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,016
It's all right, Saber.

205
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,738
Please believe in your Master!

206
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,972
Kiritsugu is here?

207
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:22,173
Kiritsugu, I know that you can
still turn this to a victory!

208
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,187
All right, I'll kill Lancer's Master now.

209
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,155
It's the only way out of this situation.

210
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,811
Maiya, proceed with your attack of Assassin on my mark.

211
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,626
Suppressive fire.

212
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:38,479
Right, acknowledged.

213
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,106
Six.

214
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:46,214
Five.

215
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:48,703
Four.

216
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:50,893
Three.

217
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,761
Two.

218
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:56,767
One.

219
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:04,559
Rider?

220
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:27,646
Ah, this Servant is quite a tough one, isn't he?

221
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:38,620
Well, as you can see, our dark malevolent
friend will be retiring for the evening.

222
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:41,077
Master of Lancer!

223
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:43,492
I know not from whence you are watching,

224
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:47,682
but do not sully a battle between
knights with your petty tricks!

225
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,475
Have Lancer withdraw.

226
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,242
If you insist on humiliating him further,

227
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:55,026
then I shall join Saber against him.

228
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:59,529
And I assure you that together the two
of us will annihilate your Servant.

229
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:01,122
What will it be?

230
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:06,492
Fine; Withdraw, Lancer.

231
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,785
That's enough for tonight.

232
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:12,639
My thanks, King of Conquers.

233
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:13,885
It was nothing.

234
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:16,507
The flowers of a battlefield must bloom.

235
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:31,215
I must know.

236
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:33,397
What was your purpose in coming here,

237
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,063
King of Conquers?

238
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:39,304
Well, honestly, I try not to
think too hard about such things.

239
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:44,178
Saber, first settle matters with Lancer and battle.

240
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:48,366
And then, I shall face the victor of your contest.

241
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,612
Be it you or Lancer.

242
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:53,355
Well, King of Knights, goodbye for the moment!

243
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:54,502
It was a pleasure,

244
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:56,741
and I sincerely hope to enjoy our next meeting

245
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:58,370
as much as I did this one.

246
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:02,957
Hey, boy, don't you have
anything nice to say to the lady?

247
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,303
Hm?

248
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,803
I really do wish he'd man up a little.

249
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,910
Oh, well.

250
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:18,788
Fare thee well!

251
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:24,053
Saber!

252
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:25,575
Your left arm!

253
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:28,167
Yes, it was a painful blow.

254
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:29,996
It is as Rider says.

255
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:34,317
If I fail to deal with Lancer first
and undo the curse on this wound,

256
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:37,545
it will damage my chances against the other Servants.

257
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:41,685
Thank you, Saber.

258
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:44,727
I survived thanks to you.

259
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:48,290
The reason I could focus on the battle before me

260
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,905
was because I had you to stand behind me.

261
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,231
Saber.

262
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,657
The battle is only beginning, Irisviel.

263
00:18:56,838 --> 00:19:02,286
Tonight we saw the opening gambits have an epic
battle that is only just beginning to unfold.

264
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:04,725
I know.

265
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,607
They were all powerful adversaries.

266
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,877
Not one of them was a conventional enemy.

267
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:15,153
So this is the Holy Grail War.

268
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:23,597
He turned and ran like a cowardly
rat away from my Berserker.

269
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:29,025
And I also got to embarrass that stupid arrogant ass.

270
00:19:29,277 --> 00:19:33,197
Tokiomi, how I wish I could
have seen the look on your face.

271
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:45,475
That damn Berserker broke free of my
control and started fighting Saber.

272
00:19:45,587 --> 00:19:46,389
Bastard!

273
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:50,179
If he keeps doing that, my body won't last long.

274
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,198
But if I can
control him,

275
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:53,847
I can win.

276
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:01,587
Just hold on, Sakura.

277
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:09,377
Begging your pardon, Master Kirei.

278
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,564
What is it?

279
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:16,929
Master, I've come to report that I've found
something of interest outside the church.

280
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:18,308
A familiar?

281
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:19,603
Yes.

282
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:21,627
It was outside the barrier.

283
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,188
But it was clearly sent here for the
purpose of monitoring this church.

284
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,642
Awesome!

285
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,743
That was so awesome!

286
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:37,797
Hey, Bluebeard!

287
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:39,271
That was all real, right?

288
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:40,702
Right?

289
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:42,123
It was for real!

290
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:44,536
Not some kind of cool special effect, right?

291
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,158
So awesome!

292
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:48,647
So, about this Grail War,

293
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,075
you're gonna do it, aren't ya?

294
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:51,620
Right, big guy?

295
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,595
Ah...big guy?

296
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:57,299
My wish has come true.

297
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:00,202
What do you mean by, uh,

298
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:01,980
wish come true?

299
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:08,703
Look at her!
The answer to my prayer!

300
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:10,694
Her extraordinary face,

301
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:13,107
her strong and noble bearing!

302
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:16,223
She is none other than the maiden of my dreams!

303
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:19,058
The one perfect woman in the world!

304
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:25,123
You know this chick?

305
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,590
Yes indeed!

306
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:28,595
She was forsaken by God!

307
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:32,227
Died in abject shame and terrible loneliness and now,

308
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:34,840
at last, she has come back to life!

309
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:37,281
It is such a miracle!

310
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:38,461
What else could it be

311
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,358
but the fulfillment of all my hopes and dreams!

312
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:43,999
Oh, maiden.

313
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:46,625
My holy virgin!

314
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:50,381
Soon I will come for you!
