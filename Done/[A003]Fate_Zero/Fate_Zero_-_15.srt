1
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:18,014
What are we gonna do now, Rider?

2
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:19,567
Hmm.

3
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:31,967
Hmm.

4
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:40,043
So what now, Mad Dog?

5
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:50,649
Tokiomi.

6
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,100
I'll kill you, bastard.

7
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:15,712
Saber!

8
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:26,853
They can't make it through.

9
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:32,974
If only Saber could use her left hand.

10
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:05,721
Hey, Saber!

11
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,041
We're not getting anywhere like this!

12
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,432
Let us withdraw!

13
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:10,893
Don't be a fool!

14
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,950
We must stop its advance!

15
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:16,139
That may well be, but we're in a stalemate!

16
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:17,863
Just fall back for now!

17
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:19,378
I have an idea!

18
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:27,082
Listen, everyone.

19
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:29,735
Whatever strategy we devise tonight,

20
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:32,207
we first need to buy some time to organize it.

21
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:36,822
For the time being, I will drag
that beast into my Ionian Hetairoi,

22
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:40,303
but it will be impossible for my elite troops to slay it

23
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:42,758
even if they attack in full force.

24
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:46,614
The best we can hope for is to halt
its advance within the Reality Marble.

25
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:48,598
And after that?

26
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:50,635
No idea.

27
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:51,702
Huh?

28
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:54,334
After swallowing something as big as that,

29
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:59,066
my bounded field and its army will
only hold for a matter of mere minutes.

30
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:02,002
In that short time, we must act.

31
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:06,835
Heroic spirits, I want you to
find some way for us to prevail.

32
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:09,630
Boy, disembark!

33
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:11,560
You're staying here with them.

34
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:13,100
Huh?

35
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:16,123
Hey!

36
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:21,586
Once my reality marble is deployed,
I will not know what is going on in the outside world,

37
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:25,634
and so if anything happens, concentrate and call to me.

38
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,785
I'll send a messenger to you.

39
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:34,764
Saber and Lancer,

40
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,331
the rest is up to you.

41
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,824
Right.

42
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,245
Understood.

43
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:40,574
Yah!

44
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,931
You only prolong the inevitable.

45
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:18,367
Mom!

46
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:28,162
What is that?

47
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:12,515
How does plunging headfirst into that
filthy creature sound to you, you mongrel?

48
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:48,058
After all that raging and ranting against me.

49
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:52,250
When it comes time to act, this is all you can do?

50
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,024
Is he trying to kill himself?

51
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:04,240
Kariya, consider this an act of mercy.

52
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,046
Intensive, Einäscherung

53
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:18,494
I can't kill you.

54
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,007
I'll kill you.

55
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:23,605
Tokiomi...

56
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:44,188
What now?

57
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,915
I know he said he'd buy us some time,
but if we don't think of something really fast,

58
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,255
We'll be right back where we started.

59
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:51,115
Come on now, Einzbern.

60
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,118
Don't you have any ideas?

61
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:55,398
Say something!

62
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:01,159
Wait a minute.

63
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,645
I don't know how to use this.

64
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:06,353
Iri.

65
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:09,557
Um, no, I'm... wait, who is this?

66
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,140
Ah, well, you must be Rider's master.

67
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:14,213
Good timing.

68
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,100
There's something I wanna discuss with you.

69
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:18,301
Who... who are you?

70
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,756
That's not important.

71
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,976
Caster's disappearance...
I gather that was your servant's doing?

72
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:26,644
That's right, basically.

73
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:31,165
Question... Rider's reality marble, when he releases it,

74
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,133
can he put down the contents in a specific area?

75
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:37,483
To a point.

76
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:40,442
He can get within 100 meters or so, I think.

77
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:41,731
It should be possible.

78
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:46,285
Rider has control over where
he enters back into this world.

79
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:47,598
Good enough.

80
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:51,312
When the timing seems like it's
right, I'll send up a flare.

81
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,272
Release Caster directly underneath it.

82
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:55,612
Can you do that?

83
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:58,777
I can, probably, I think.

84
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,054
One more thing... give this message to Lancer.

85
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:06,541
Tell him Saber's left hand contains
an anti‐fortress Noble Phantasm.

86
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:07,714
Huh?

87
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,644
Something the matter?

88
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,998
Well, he asked me to give you a message.

89
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,322
Saber's left hand has an anti‐fortress Noble Phantasm.

90
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,534
Is this true, Saber?

91
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:28,774
I see.

92
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:33,064
Do you think it's capable of
obliterating Caster's monster?

93
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:35,137
I believe so.

94
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:40,791
But Lancer, my blade and my pride are the same.

95
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:45,538
This wound you inflicted on me
is a mark of pride, not shame.

96
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:50,004
If that loss was the price of
securing Diarmuid Ua Duibhne's aid,

97
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:52,232
then it was worth a veritable host.

98
00:09:58,405 --> 00:09:59,519
Listen, Saber,

99
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:01,960
I cannot abide this Caster.

100
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:07,294
He finds the despair of others both right and
good and takes pleasure in spreading terror.

101
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:08,922
On my word as a knight,

102
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,255
his is an evil that I cannot let go unchallenged.

103
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:16,884
Lancer, no, you mustn't do that!

104
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:20,948
Must it be Saber who is victorious today or Lancer?

105
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:23,432
No, it is neither of us.

106
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:27,688
What must triumph here today is the path of chivalry.

107
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:30,749
Agreed, heroic Arturia?

108
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:45,338
Lancer.

109
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,146
I entrust our victory to the single
strike of the King of Knights.

110
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:53,099
I'm counting on you, brave Saber.

111
00:10:56,518 --> 00:11:01,735
Rest assured, Lancer. Upon my blade, I will prevail!

112
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,918
That is from the Arthurian legends.

113
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,669
Saber!

114
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:28,862
Berserker?

115
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:30,015
Why now?

116
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:55,738
You dare turn your back on me, you lowly mongrel?

117
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,105
Blasphemy!

118
00:11:58,828 --> 00:11:59,362
What?

119
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:10,067
Saber!

120
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:12,327
What the hell does Berserker think he's doing?

121
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,588
I've finally regained the use
of my left hand and now this.

122
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,758
Regardless of its own self awareness of this fact,

123
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:43,862
a soul instinctively seeks out joy in its life.

124
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:47,201
He was the only one you ordered Assassin

125
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:51,807
to investigate thoroughly enough such that
you could understand those circumstances.

126
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:55,830
And this was due to your unconscious interest in him.

127
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:41,474
Still too soon.

128
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,762
What are all these tremors?

129
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:50,360
An omen that Rider's reality marble
is approaching its limits, I imagine.

130
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,646
Come, Rider.

131
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:59,831
I am Mithrenes, Soldier of the Hetairoi.

132
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:04,223
I have come here to act as my king's eyes and ears.

133
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:09,041
Tell him to wait for our signal,

134
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:13,093
then release the bounded field and
dump Caster at the designated location.

135
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:14,773
Can you do it?

136
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,247
We can, sir, but it will be a race against time.

137
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:22,240
We of the Hetairoi are no longer able

138
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:26,058
to slow the progress of that
horror within the bounded field.

139
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:27,813
I understand that!

140
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:29,260
I know!

141
00:14:33,795 --> 00:14:35,109
Damn that Berserker!

142
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:37,250
Can't we do anything about him?

143
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,597
Allow me.

144
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,539
Lancer!

145
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:48,807
I am putting an end to this mad warrior!

146
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:06,855
It's all or nothing.

147
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:20,887
Archer!

148
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,636
There it is!

149
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:42,143
Right under there.

150
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:42,896
Yes, sir.

151
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:04,583
Finally... what took them so damn long?

152
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:16,305
Oh.

153
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:25,199
All right now, Saber, show me your best!

154
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,427
I shall judge your worth as a heroic spirit

155
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,582
with my own two eyes!

156
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,117
The light.

157
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:56,057
It shines bright.

158
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:58,147
It is the true embodiment

159
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,599
of the sad yet noble dream of all soldiers

160
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,976
past, present, and future who lie
dying on the fields of battle,

161
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:09,346
clutched to their hearts with their last breath,

162
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,866
holding aloft their dying wish,
making certain that their loyalty will not be in vain.

163
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:20,329
The invincible king is about to cry out the true name

164
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:22,944
of the miracle she wields in her hands.

165
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:31,745
That name is...

166
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,806
Excalibur!

167
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:58,995
This brilliant light!

168
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:17,054
There is no doubt, this is the light

169
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:21,414
from when Jean and I were
blessed with such profound joy!

170
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,386
What...have I...

171
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,275
Did you see that, King of Conquerors?

172
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:09,872
Such is Saber's brilliant skill.

173
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:12,547
Having seen such light,

174
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,609
you still refuse to grant her your respect?

175
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:21,898
Hmm... that light is a result of her accepting
the hopes and dreams of the people of her time.

176
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:24,872
It hurts me because it's so bright.

177
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,127
And because I know that this burden

178
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:31,457
was thrust upon the shoulders of a little girl.

179
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,246
What I see is what became of a girl
who was never allowed to admire

180
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:38,785
butterflies or flowers or fall in love,

181
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:42,373
but was instead taken hold of by the curse of ideals.

182
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,872
It is too painful to look upon.

183
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:49,668
Which is exactly what makes her so endearing...

184
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:52,857
the unattainable dream she held so dear

185
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:57,350
was certain to explode in a brilliant
flare that would burn her to ash.

186
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,763
The tears of bitter lamentation she shed,

187
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:04,724
how sweet they'd have tasted as she laid there dying.

188
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,511
You and I will never get along,
Babylonian King of Heroes.

189
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,411
Really?

190
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:13,961
You only now realized that fact?

191
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:16,576
What are you going to do, Rider?

192
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,957
Perhaps give vent to your righteous anger here and now?

193
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:23,876
It would give me great pleasure were I to do so.

194
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:29,554
But if you and I were to do battle, it would mean
expending more energy tonight than I would care to.

195
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:35,637
Of course, if you were to decide that you
couldn't pass up the chance to attack,

196
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:38,025
I would be forced to respond in kind.

197
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,860
This once, I shall allow you to escape.

198
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:45,474
There would be no satisfaction in crushing you

199
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,240
if you were not in your prime.

200
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:54,569
Or is it that you yourself are injured from
being shot down by that ridiculous lunatic?

201
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:58,303
I respond to provocation with death.

202
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:02,213
We'll save it for next time, King of Heroes.

203
00:21:02,674 --> 00:21:07,899
Ours will be the epic battle that will determine
who is the champion of the Holy Grail War.

204
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:14,483
Don't be so certain.

205
00:21:15,294 --> 00:21:21,826
I have yet to decide if there is but one who is
worthy of the gift of my greatest treasure, Rider.

206
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:28,470
You glorious fool who strives to achieve
that which man was not meant to have.

207
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:32,708
In all of Heaven and Earth, none but I, Gilgamesh,

208
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,486
can truly appreciate your destruction.

209
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:43,813
You who shine so brightly yet so briefly,

210
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:45,663
come to my arms.

211
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,080
This I have decided.

212
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,698
I am first Bure of Fianna,

213
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,238
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

214
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:32,448
Saber, I am glad I was able to meet you.

215
00:23:32,448 --> 00:23:34,828
Splendid... for this night,

216
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:37,618
Arturia Pendragon accepts your challenge.

217
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,918
‐Come then! ‐I come for you!
