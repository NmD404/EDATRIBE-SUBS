1
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:15,109
Master Kiritsugu!

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,132
Your child has been born.

3
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:27,877
She's so cute, she's adorable,

4
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:31,395
and so small, so very delicate.

5
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:34,161
Look, Kiritsugu.

6
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:36,823
She has your eyes too.

7
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:42,192
She's beautiful.

8
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,311
I'm so happy that I could give birth to her.

9
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:54,728
Iri, I...

10
00:00:57,072 --> 00:00:59,223
I will be the cause of your death.

11
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:07,073
I know.

12
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:10,288
The Einzberns have dreamed of the day.

13
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:12,998
It is the very reason I exist.

14
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:15,482
When I came to know your ideals,

15
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:17,515
I made your wish my own.

16
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,575
You made me who I am today.

17
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:23,062
You have guided me on my path.

18
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:27,818
You offered me a better life
than that of a simple puppet.

19
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:33,841
You needn't pity me, because I am part of you already.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,696
So

21
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,375
But...

22
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:43,148
I have no right to hold that child.

23
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:45,711
None.

24
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:52,080
Kiritsugu, don't forget.

25
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,037
You're striving to make a whole new world

26
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:57,781
where no one cries.

27
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:01,289
This is what your whole life has been about.

28
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:07,090
Eight more years, and your fight will come to an end,

29
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:11,210
and our ideal will become reality.

30
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,774
The Holy Grail will save you.

31
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:15,549
I'm certain of it.

32
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,245
So take this child, Ilyasviel, and hold her close.

33
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:27,575
Hold her and be proud, like any other father would be.

34
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,016
A Command Seal?

35
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:05,910
Yes.

36
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,456
The mark identifies you as a
participant in the Holy Grail War.

37
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,855
A stigmata bestowing upon you
the power to command a servant.

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,318
Kirei Kotomine.

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,789
The Holy Grail War,

40
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:24,391
the battle for an ancient relic that performs miracles.

41
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,228
But why me?

42
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:33,658
Normally, those chosen by the Grail as masters for
the servants are experienced and accomplished mages.

43
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,272
It is highly unusual for someone like you,

44
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:40,838
who has no connection to magic
whatsoever, to be chosen to participate.

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,731
Heroic servants.

46
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:48,443
I still find it strange to command the summoned
spirits of ancient heroes to fight as familiars.

47
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,580
Of course, I know all this can
be very difficult to believe,

48
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,781
but heroes from every age and nation will
come back to life in the modern world,

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,027
killing one another to vie for supremacy.

50
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:02,985
That is the Holy Grail War.

51
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:06,550
Also, there is an unspoken agreement among all involved

52
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:08,135
to keep this all secret.

53
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:10,015
To ensure this rule is kept,

54
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,803
someone of the Holy Church is
always sent as an observer.

55
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:16,593
Should one of us really be judging?

56
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,939
A secret battle between godless magicians?

57
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:22,143
A Mage's Association member

58
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,755
would be too partial to one party to assure fairness.

59
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,624
And so once again,

60
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,074
just as we did some 60 years ago,

61
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:34,700
we've recruited your father to
watch over and referee our battle.

62
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,955
My father will be coming to Fuyuki?

63
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:41,304
But wait, how can this be considered fair?

64
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:45,517
It's a conflict of interest for the
overseer's child to also be a participant.

65
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,750
Tokiomi?

66
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:50,067
Perhaps it's time we got to the point.

67
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:57,542
Kirei, everything we've spoken of thus far is just
the official background of the Holy Grail War.

68
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:04,051
However, there is an additional reason I've
introduced you to Mr. Tokiomi Tohsaka here today.

69
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,200
And what would that be?

70
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,405
Actually, we found proof a long time ago that
the Holy Grail that will appear in Fuyuki

71
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:14,582
is not the sacred relic that belonged to the Son of God.

72
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,537
So I gathered

73
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:22,189
Otherwise, an order to retrieve it would've been
given to us of the Eighth Sacrament Assembly.

74
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:27,135
Be that as it may, Fuyuki's Holy
Grail is far too powerful to ignore.

75
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:29,861
It is an omnipotent wish‐granting device.

76
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:34,630
Who knows what disaster it could unleash
should it happen to fall into the wrong hands.

77
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,193
In which case,

78
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:41,900
the best course of action would be to ensure
that the Fuyuki Grail falls into the right hands,

79
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,938
hands that would not misuse it.

80
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:46,963
The Tohsakas are a family of mages,

81
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:50,767
but they are mages with a long
history of friendship with the Church.

82
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,420
We know what kind of person Tokiomi is,
and more important than anything else,

83
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,691
the Tohsakas' ultimate intentions for
the Grail are plain and honorable.

84
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,912
To reach the root.

85
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:05,565
That is the Tohsaka family's sole desire.

86
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:10,452
But the Einzberns and Matous have both
forgotten the wish we once shared with them,

87
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,438
and have other less altruistic plans now.

88
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:18,523
It goes without saying that the plans
of the other masters will be even worse.

89
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:24,090
Who knows what dark desire they may harbor for
the power of the Grail should they obtain it.

90
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:30,778
That being said, I assume that the goal of my
participation is to ensure Tokiomi Tohsaka's victory,

91
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,925
rather than to prevail myself.

92
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:34,644
To achieve that goal

93
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:39,480
we will conduct ourselves in a manner that will
maintain the appearance of us being enemies.

94
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,844
However, we will actually be working together

95
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,090
in total secrecy to soundly
defeat the other five masters,

96
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,748
and assure our victory in the end.

97
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,343
And so, Kirei,

98
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:56,912
you will be officially transferred from
the Church to the Mage's Association

99
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,299
where you will become my student.

100
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,532
The official orders have already been issued.

101
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:06,273
You must go to Japan and study the principles of magic,

102
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,658
and become a mage of sufficient strength and skill

103
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:15,087
to command a servant in the Holy Grail War
in three years time when the battles begin.

104
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,262
Now then.

105
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,783
Do you have any questions for us, Kirei?

106
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,472
Only one.

107
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:29,865
How exactly does the Holy Grail
go about selecting its masters?

108
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,301
What kind of criteria does it use?

109
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,118
Hm.

110
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,911
The exact criteria it uses is unknown,
but it chooses those masters who need it most.

111
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:44,813
So all the participating masters
have a reason to covet the Grail?

112
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,352
Not necessarily.

113
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:50,354
I'm told that in the past there
were cases where Command Seals

114
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,449
appeared on those whom you would never have expected.

115
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,636
Oh, I think I understand.

116
00:07:57,123 --> 00:08:00,936
You're still puzzled at being chosen to
be a master by the Grail, aren't you?

117
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,450
I didn't expect Kirei to give his consent so quickly.

118
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:12,213
My son would jump into fire if the
Holy Church ordered him to do so.

119
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,430
To be honest with you, I'm even a little shocked.

120
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:17,306
From his perspective,

121
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,693
he's being drawn into a senseless war that
has absolutely nothing to do with him.

122
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,529
No, this is as it should be.

123
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:27,243
Perhaps this ordeal will do him some good.

124
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,960
Only a few days ago, my son lost his wife.

125
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:37,045
I believe that a complete change of scenery
and a difficult new mission to focus on

126
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:40,246
may be exactly what he needs to nurse his wounds.

127
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:52,642
Hi, Aoi.

128
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,198
Kariya, it's good to see you again.

129
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:01,439
You're back from your trip?

130
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,359
This one seemed to last a long time.

131
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,813
Yeah, I guess it did.

132
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,001
Uncle Kariya!

133
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,132
Uncle Kariya, welcome back!

134
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,906
Hi, Rin.

135
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:17,563
Did you bring me a present again?

136
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,867
No, Rin, you're being very rude.

137
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,716
Here.

138
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,500
Thank you, Uncle Kariya.

139
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:32,566
You are very welcome, Rin, I'm glad you like it.

140
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,553
Where's Sakura?

141
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,751
Sakura's gone now.

142
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,643
What did she mean?

143
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:51,625
Sakura is...

144
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:55,341
well, she's no longer my
daughter or Rin's little sister.

145
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,031
She's now with... the Matou family.

146
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:03,457
But why?

147
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,642
The Matous want a child who carries
in them the blood of a mage.

148
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,321
You know why, better than anyone else.

149
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:21,875
The head of the Tohsaka family decided to give our
ancient allies, the Matous, that which they requested.

150
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,490
It wasn't my place to speak out.

151
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,543
You're all right with that?

152
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,594
When I married into the Tohsaka family,

153
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,947
when I decided to marry a mage,

154
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:35,541
I knew what might be required of me.

155
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,022
And you're all right with that?

156
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:45,040
The reality is that a clan bearing mage blood can
never expect to enjoy the happiness of a normal family.

157
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,371
That's not true!

158
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:48,886
When you married him you wanted happiness, you wanted...

159
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,148
Enough!

160
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,250
This is between the Tohsakas and the Matous.

161
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,129
You left the world of mages a long time ago.

162
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,075
This doesn't concern you.

163
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:05,415
If you get the chance to see Sakura again,

164
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,083
please be kind to her.

165
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,584
She was always very fond of you.

166
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:19,646
So, the failure actually had
the nerve to show his face here.

167
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:26,750
I distinctly remember telling you to stay far away
from this house, and to never darken my doorstep again,

168
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:28,143
Kariya.

169
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:31,305
I heard you adopted the Tohsaka's second daughter.

170
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,080
Then you have sharp ears.

171
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:39,563
Is it really so important to keep mages in
the Matou lineage that you have to do this?

172
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:41,469
Would you tell me we're wrong to?

173
00:11:41,563 --> 00:11:43,147
You of all people?

174
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:48,008
Tell me who's fault do you think it is
for our present reduced circumstances.

175
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:49,379
Kariya,

176
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:52,558
had you only agreed to carry on the family name

177
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:54,743
and to learn the secrets of the Matou,

178
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,913
things would never have gotten this bad,

179
00:11:56,913 --> 00:11:59,691
and that little girl would still be with her mother.

180
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:02,246
You're not fooling anyone, you vampire.

181
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,907
You only want the Grail to give yourself eternal youth.

182
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:07,704
You just wanna live forever.

183
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:14,449
Nearly 60 years have passed since
the last time the masters gathered,

184
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:18,828
but the Matous have no pawns yet to
offer for the fourth Holy Grail War.

185
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:24,787
Though you have it inside you, your brother Byakuya
lacks the power needed to control a servant.

186
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:31,722
But even if we forfeit this round, we could still
win the next in 60 years if we prepare ourselves.

187
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:37,270
The Tohsaka girl's womb will one day bear
us a powerful mage, one who could prevail.

188
00:12:37,318 --> 00:12:41,155
She has a lot of potential,
that one, she could be the key.

189
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:45,343
So then in other words,
if you can get your hands on the Grail,

190
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,056
you won't need Sakura Tohsaka anymore.

191
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:52,197
What is it you're scheming, Kariya?

192
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:54,480
A trade, Zouken.

193
00:12:55,235 --> 00:12:58,986
Next year I will return from the Grail
War, Grail in hand,

194
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:02,871
and in return, you will release Sakura.

195
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:06,273
Don't be a stupid idiot.

196
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:09,443
You're a failure and you haven't
trained a day in your life.

197
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:14,790
You actually believe that in a single year
you'll achieve the power to control a servant?

198
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:21,413
You have the secret magic to make that happen and
you know it, using your special worm techniques.

199
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:24,903
So?

200
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:28,294
You can implant me with your crest worms.

201
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:31,395
Kariya, you want to die?

202
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:34,883
The Matous should rely on
themselves to gain what they want.

203
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:37,152
I won't let anyone else get involved.

204
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:42,568
Surely you're not concerned for my well-being, Father.

205
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:48,448
If what you're trying to do is keep her out of all this,

206
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:53,249
Kariya, I'm afraid you're a little late.

207
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,185
You bastard, you didn't!

208
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:04,861
For the first three days in there she did
nothing but constantly scream her head off.

209
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:08,976
But on the fourth, she settled down and finally stopped.

210
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:14,832
Early this morning, I threw her down into
the worm pit to see just how long she'd last.

211
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:20,039
She's been in there for over 12
hours and she's still breathing.

212
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,007
The Tohsakas have very powerful inner spirits.

213
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:25,607
Sakura!

214
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,194
What will you do now?

215
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:33,668
She's a broken little girl ripped from the life
she knew, and violated by worms from head to toe.

216
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:36,945
But if you still wish to save her from this ordeal,

217
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:39,700
I might be willing to think about it.

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,107
I agree.

219
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,963
But I intend to continue her
education until you show results.

220
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:49,242
That point is not negotiable.

221
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:53,877
I still expect to achieve victory
in the next war 60 years from now,

222
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:59,553
but should you somehow manage to retrieve
the Grail in this war, all the better.

223
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,273
Naturally, I'll no longer need the girl.
In that case, her education will only last a year,

224
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:08,696
and then she'll be free to go where she wants.

225
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:11,918
You won't renege on your words, Zouken Matou?

226
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,394
You can start by serving as
the breeding ground for a week.

227
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,033
If you don't die or go insane then I'll concede that

228
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:22,433
you're actually serious and
will keep my word completely.

229
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:32,553
It's finally here.

230
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:36,348
What does it say?

231
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:40,020
It's a report from the spies I
sent to the London Clock Tower.

232
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:44,401
It says that the Grail chose a
master from within the tower,

233
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:47,392
the headquarters of the Mage's Association.

234
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:48,714
Who is it?

235
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,097
A rather big problem.

236
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,810
The eldest son of the Archibald family,

237
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,562
a ninth generation mage.

238
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:57,842
Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald.

239
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:05,522
In the world of mages,
a long and distinguished lineage is everything.

240
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:07,465
Nothing else matters.

241
00:16:07,738 --> 00:16:12,530
This is because magic will not yield
up her secrets in a single generation.

242
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,093
A parent passes on the fruits of a
lifetime of magical training to his child.

243
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:22,448
Thus, the older the family of mages,
the greater their power ultimately becomes.

244
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:27,063
You are no doubt wondering why I begin
today's lecture with something so basic.

245
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,797
It is because a student from this class
submitted a fascinating paper to me yesterday.

246
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,605
"How Wizardry Should Be in the New Century."

247
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:42,201
It attempts to make a case objecting to the
longstanding traditions of which I just spoke.

248
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:46,469
It claims that if one were to achieve
a deep understanding of the techniques

249
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:49,028
and precise control over mana application,

250
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:52,773
it would allow one to overcome any
difference in inherent ability.

251
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:59,067
In short, even someone with diluted blood could,
through his own efforts, become a master mage.

252
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,383
To be honest, I've learned something

253
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:02,726
from reading this paper.

254
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:04,969
Silence, please.

255
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:08,883
I will be perfectly frank.

256
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,063
This paper is nothing but immature juvenile fantasies.

257
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:13,975
Huh?

258
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:16,944
Blood determines a mage's powers and abilities.

259
00:17:17,097 --> 00:17:20,287
This is a hard and unchanging reality of this world.

260
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,823
Even for you, Waver Velvet.

261
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:29,586
I am very, very disappointed that one of my
students would indulge in this moronic nonsense.

262
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:34,691
Sir, I was only trying to raise a question the Mage's
Association has become too reluctant to address.

263
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:38,039
Mr. Velvet, if I recall correctly,

264
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:41,554
your family has produced mages
for only three generations.

265
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:42,976
Isn't that right?

266
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:48,128
Listen to me, compared to the Mage's
Association's long and illustrious history,

267
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:51,063
your family is no more than a newborn baby.

268
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,578
Don't you think a baby should learn to
speak before it tries to voice an opinion?

269
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,549
He made a fool of me,

270
00:17:58,574 --> 00:17:59,428
he made a fool of me,

271
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:00,842
he made a fool of me!

272
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:02,701
Is that any way for a teacher to act?

273
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:05,634
Reading my paper made him jealous
and he couldn't handle it!

274
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,743
The pompous ass is afraid of my talent.

275
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:10,155
That's why he embarrassed me in front of everyone.

276
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:11,263
Whoa!

277
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:14,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

278
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:15,867
Are you all right?

279
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:17,337
I'm fine.

280
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:20,988
You're in the Spiritual Evocation Department.

281
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:22,705
Why aren't you in class?

282
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,763
Well, uh,

283
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:27,028
Mr. Archibald asked me to run an errand for him.

284
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:29,168
That's why I was in a hurry.

285
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:32,023
I see, that's great.

286
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:34,904
Would you mind giving this to
him when you go back to class?

287
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:39,192
Okay, sure, why not?

288
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:42,995
Just make sure he gets it,
it's supposed to be important.

289
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:44,394
It's important?

290
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:48,851
Package origin, Macedonia?

291
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:57,113
This is it.

292
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,096
So it seems that all the rumors about that

293
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:05,806
bastard Kayneth Archibald preparing to fight in some
kind of mages tournament in the Far East soon are true.

294
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,591
The Holy Grail War.

295
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:18,693
According to the legend, 200 years ago,
the Einzberns, the Makiris, and the Tohsakas,

296
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,323
collectively known as the three first families,

297
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,823
worked together to summon the Holy Grail,

298
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:27,763
said to have the power to grant any
wish, and eventually succeeded it.

299
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:34,033
But the Holy Grail would only grant
one of the family's supplications.

300
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:39,625
Their cooperation quickly turned
to violent and bloody conflict.

301
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:42,820
That was the beginning of the Holy Grail Wars.

302
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:46,152
Ever since then, once every 60 years,

303
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:48,762
the Holy Grail appears in the city of Fuyuki.

304
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:53,974
It selects seven mages from across the globe
to compete for it, and grants them powers.

305
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:58,788
Each magically summons a heroic
spirit known as a servant.

306
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:05,903
Archer, Saber, Lancer, Rider, Assassin,

307
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,085
Caster, Berserker.

308
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:14,161
Divided into these seven classes of warriors,
the servants, guided by their masters,

309
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:19,900
fight each other to the death in secret battles
to determine who is worthy to win the Grail.

310
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,750
So it appears that this Grail War

311
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:31,193
is a battle of pure strength where stupid
titles and influence mean absolutely nothing.

312
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:34,618
That looks like it's the perfect place for me.

313
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:42,927
Wait, in order to summon a servant some kind of
relic related to them is needed to act as a catalyst.

314
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:45,409
A relic.

315
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,878
That device always strikes me as being indecent.

316
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:21,438
There's a report from the Clock Tower.

317
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:25,309
It looks like Lord El‐Melloi has acquired another relic.

318
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,006
His participation in the war is certain now.

319
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:33,183
It troubles me that two of the
slots are still unaccounted for.

320
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,089
Don't worry, when the time comes,
the Grail will select seven, regardless of skill.

321
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,549
The ones it selects to round out the group are...

322
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:43,259
well, often weak and inexperienced.

323
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:44,813
Don't concern yourself.

324
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,893
Speaking of matters of real concern, Kirei,

325
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:51,374
I trust that no one followed you
or saw you enter this mansion.

326
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:52,672
No, don't worry.

327
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:58,621
No familiars or devices, visible or invisible,
are watching me or this mansion right now.

328
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,248
On that

329
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:02,658
You have my guarantee.

330
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:08,862
No matter what tricks or deception they
use, no one can deceive the eyes of Hassan,

331
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,122
the spy heroic spirit.

332
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:16,226
There is no trace of anyone following
my master or watching this house.

333
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,473
Please, you can put your mind at ease.

334
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:23,217
If a servant has been manifested by another master

335
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,687
my father is certain to be aware of it.

336
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:28,326
The other mages will not take action,

337
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:30,559
at least for a little while longer.

338
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:35,293
Assassin, you may go,
continue guarding the surrounding area.

339
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:37,479
As you wish.

340
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:41,831
It's only a matter of time before that changes.

341
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:48,898
Very soon now this place will be swarming with familiars
and magical devices sent by other masters to spy on me.

342
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,699
What is that?

343
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:52,491
Another investigation.

344
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:57,231
I've been gathering what information
I can on the Einzbern master.

345
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:03,309
Nine years ago, the Einzberns,
a family notoriously proud of their pure blood,

346
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:07,150
suddenly allowed an outsider
mage to marry into the family.

347
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,859
The Einzbern mages have devoted
themselves solely to alchemy,

348
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,299
rendering them unfit for combat.

349
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:20,646
Their losses in previous Grail Wars
can all be traced to that fact.

350
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:23,725
They must have finally run out of patience.

351
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:28,711
The man they chose was perfect for their needs.

352
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:37,308
Kiritsugu Emiya, the man known as the Mage Killer.

353
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:49,049
We finally found the relic we've been
searching for in Cornwall all these years.

354
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:53,035
If you use it as a catalyst you'll be
able to summon what is widely considered

355
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,604
the strongest of all known sword‐wielding servants.

356
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,367
Kiritsugu,

357
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:04,279
this is the greatest gift the Einzbern can offer
to the man who is working in service to our needs.

358
00:24:04,316 --> 00:24:06,483
Thank you, Elder, I am honored.

359
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:10,242
This time there are to be no survivors.

360
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:13,862
You are to hunt down the six
other servants and eliminate them,

361
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:17,012
and fulfill the third magic, Heaven's Feel.

362
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:18,671
Yes, sir.

363
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:22,013
Kiritsugu Emiya?

364
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,805
Yes, I know that name.

365
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,004
So, even the Holy Church has heard of this man.

366
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:34,424
Kiritsugu Emiya, the Mage Killer,
was quite infamous in his time.

367
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:38,825
Officially, he was a rogue mage who
didn't belong to the Association,

368
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:43,870
but the higher ups found him, shall we
say, convenient for their own purposes.

369
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,624
It sounds to me like he was quite similar to us.

370
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:48,764
Executioners for the Holy Church.

371
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:50,724
Far worse, I assure you.

372
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:54,196
He spent his life as a freelance master assassin

373
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:56,964
who specializes in exterminating mages.

374
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:03,278
He knows what mages are capable of, so he deals with
them in a way that is unlike a mage as possible.

375
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:05,972
Read that.

376
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:12,209
Sniping, poisoning, bombs in public places.

377
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:14,889
He once brought down an entire jetliner

378
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,747
just because his target was on it.

379
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,189
A man who will do anything without a second thought.

380
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,865
It is because mages function outside
the laws of the regular world

381
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:31,535
that we must diligently obey the strict
laws that we have set for ourselves.

382
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:36,554
But this man lacks even a single
trace of a mage's pride or honor.

383
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:40,257
The methods he employs are unforgivable.

384
00:25:41,348 --> 00:25:45,991
Then tell me, what does this Kiritsugu Emiya gain...

385
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:49,976
by hiring himself out as a killer?

386
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:51,922
Money, I would imagine.

387
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,844
As you can read in that report,

388
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:58,845
he's been involved in more
than just mage assassinations.

389
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:05,596
He's appeared in war zones all over the
planet offering his services as a mercenary.

390
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,864
I see.

391
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:11,363
May I borrow this for a while?

392
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:19,771
Let's go over what we know, Iri, all right?

393
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,672
Of the seven masters that the Grail will
choose we have identified four of them.

394
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:29,778
Tokiomi Tohsaka, Tohsaka family head.

395
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:33,317
Fire mage, uses jewel magic, very formidable.

396
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,711
Kariya Matou.

397
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,599
So they took the kid who left the family

398
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,014
and made him a master, huh?

399
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,376
That old man must be desperate.

400
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,050
Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald.

401
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,292
Wind and water affinity.

402
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:52,953
He's a top expert in necromancy, summoning, and alchemy.

403
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:54,604
And next...

404
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:56,091
Kiritsugu Emiya.

405
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:02,387
Newest member of the Einzbern family and
their trump card, and the man that I love.

406
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:08,570
And the fourth master...  no, I mean the fifth one,

407
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,940
is representing the Holy Church.

408
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:12,775
His name is Kirei Kotomine.

409
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:14,884
He's from the Church?

410
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:18,860
He's the son of the overseer, Father Risei Kotomine.

411
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:23,468
Reports say he studied under Tokiomi
Tohsaka starting three years ago,

412
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,069
splitting with him after his Command Seal appeared.

413
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:28,156
Did something happen?

414
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,204
This is his personal history.

415
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,248
Read it for yourself.

416
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:39,981
Kirei Kotomine followed his father on
pilgrimages around the world since childhood,

417
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:43,460
graduated from the St.
Ignatius School of Divinity in Manresa,

418
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,586
skipped two years, graduated valedictorian.

419
00:27:46,984 --> 00:27:48,603
He sounds pretty impressive.

420
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,972
But then suddenly, he leaves the primrose
path and volunteers for the Holy Church.

421
00:27:54,312 --> 00:27:58,782
Why would someone like that decide to
work for a secret Church organization?

422
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:00,884
Maybe because of his father?

423
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:06,137
It says here that Kotomine is a member of
the Holy Church's Eighth Sacrament Assembly.

424
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:09,431
Then he would've pursued that
path from the very beginning.

425
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:16,007
But until he arrived at the same place as his
father, he changed positions three times.

426
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:19,062
At one time he was even an inquisitor.

427
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,298
An inquisitor?

428
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:23,465
A heretic hunter.

429
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,604
In essence, exactly what I was.

430
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,819
A ruthless mage killer.

431
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:32,439
Kiritsugu Emiya.

432
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:38,450
His assassinations were always carried out in
clusters over a relatively short period of time.

433
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:43,330
During the same general time periods,
he appeared in a number of war zones,

434
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:46,005
but only when the combat was at its fiercest.

435
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:50,099
It was almost as if he had some
obsession with chasing his own death.

436
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,098
These were clearly the actions of a man bent on suicide.

437
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:58,793
So then why is he doing this?

438
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:03,140
Alchemy, necromancy, summoning, divination, healing.

439
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:07,548
Interesting, look at all the
categories of magic he studied.

440
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:09,703
Why did he try to study so many?

441
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,634
He gets almost to the point of mastery of a discipline,

442
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:16,572
then switches to another field,
and never looks back again.

443
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:22,068
It's... it's as if he throws away everything
he's learned like yesterday's trash.

444
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:28,384
Iri, this man, Kirei Kotomine, terrifies me.

445
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:31,645
He has no concept of self interest.

446
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:36,762
His actions are completely disconnected
from any thought of risk versus reward.

447
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,207
No way, there's no way he's just
a freelancer in it for the money.

448
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:45,119
He's never shown any passion
for anything at all in his life.

449
00:29:45,489 --> 00:29:47,716
He believes in absolutely nothing.

450
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:52,547
He has no deep desire,
no wish of any kind to be granted.

451
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:54,774
A man like that...

452
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:57,718
Then what is he after?

453
00:29:58,065 --> 00:30:01,639
Why would he put his life at risk to get the Holy Grail?

454
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:07,164
But the Grail chose him to be one
of its seven masters for this war.

455
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:12,594
You're right, he must have some reason
we don't know about to want the Grail.

456
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:19,403
But I can't even begin to imagine what it
is, and that terrifies me.

457
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,479
Kirei Kotomine.

458
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:25,883
Kiritsugu Emiya.

459
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:32,826
His endless string of battles came to a sudden halt
nine years ago, and he virtually vanished from sight.

460
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,362
It appears that his final encounter
with the mages of the North,

461
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:39,374
the Einzberns, is where he at last found his answer.

462
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:42,785
So, I must ask the question,

463
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,262
what did he seek in those battles?

464
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:47,259
What was he looking for?

465
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:50,091
And what exactly did he find?

466
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:04,225
Well, you just barely made it.

467
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:11,039
If the Grail has chosen you, that must mean that
you've made at least some progress as a mage.

468
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:13,772
I'll give you that much, Kariya.

469
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:16,930
But look at you.

470
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,550
You look like bloody hell.

471
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:23,989
Is your left leg working all right, eh?

472
00:31:32,552 --> 00:31:39,009
Now don't get angry, you know if you get the crest worms
inside you worked up too much they'll simply devour you.

473
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:46,115
Either way, I'd give you perhaps a month at best before
they do their damage and drain the life out of you.

474
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:48,564
That's plenty.

475
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,945
What did you say?

476
00:31:50,114 --> 00:31:52,858
I said that that will be plenty of time.

477
00:31:53,865 --> 00:31:58,167
Kariya, this is your present
for surviving an entire year.

478
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,408
I found the perfect relic for you.

479
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:05,185
Don't let your loving father's kindness go to waste.

480
00:32:16,425 --> 00:32:19,325
I did it, I've got a Command Seal too!

481
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:21,845
The Grail chose me as a master!

482
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:25,711
My incredible talent has been recognized by the Grail!

483
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:29,595
I can't just sit here.

484
00:32:30,154 --> 00:32:32,474
I have to prepare to summon my servant.

485
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:39,088
Mikina Nishimoto, the missing sixth grade girl from...

486
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:40,462
Good morning, Waver.

487
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:44,193
Good morning, dear. How did you sleep?

488
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:47,948
Morning, Grandpa and Grandma.

489
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,681
Fuyuki's getting bad these days.

490
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:52,795
Yes, it really is.

491
00:32:52,988 --> 00:32:55,045
By the way, Martha, it's very strange.

492
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:59,177
I've heard roosters making a big racket
since the sun came up this morning.

493
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,150
What's that all about?

494
00:33:01,432 --> 00:33:04,685
It's because there are three roosters in our yard.

495
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,293
What're they doing there?

496
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:07,629
I don't know.

497
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:10,368
I've been wondering where they might've come from.

498
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,321
Oh, sweetie, you want some coffee?

499
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:14,935
Mhm.

500
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:16,025
Waver.

501
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,061
What happened to your hand?

502
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:19,610
Crap.

503
00:33:19,837 --> 00:33:20,979
That mark.

504
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:21,972
What mark?

505
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,098
You didn't have that mark on your hand yesterday.

506
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:27,157
Ah, bugger!

507
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:30,031
I really wish you hadn't noticed that.

508
00:33:30,431 --> 00:33:31,964
What's wrong, Waver?

509
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,465
What is it, dear?

510
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,670
Nothing's wrong, here, have some coffee.

511
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:38,907
I put lots of milk in it.

512
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:42,813
You two like coffee, right?

513
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:47,975
They were all stabbed using a
similar, if not identical, weapon.

514
00:33:50,315 --> 00:33:51,870
What a pain in the ass.

515
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:58,086
Do I have to start their hypnosis all over again,
starting from me being their grandson back from abroad?

516
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:05,882
I need to think of a cover story
for those roosters I stole too.

517
00:34:07,194 --> 00:34:10,882
I can't believe they really found
the legendary Excalibur's scabbard.

518
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:13,322
There's not a scratch on it.

519
00:34:14,124 --> 00:34:16,547
Is this thing really 1,500 years old?

520
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:20,137
The object itself is a type of conceptual weapon.

521
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:24,116
It doesn't rust or degrade as
ordinary physical objects do.

522
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:31,037
Just like in the legend surrounding its existence,
it heals its owner's wounds and halts the aging process.

523
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:35,538
Of course, that's only when supplied
with its original owner's mana.

524
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:40,267
In other words, the master can use this
in tandem with the summoned heroic spirit

525
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:43,046
to protect himself during the course of a battle.

526
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:44,701
That's just like you.

527
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:47,969
What you're saying is that a tool is just a tool?

528
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:51,173
That's right, I am, and that goes for the servant too.

529
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,578
No matter how famous the heroic spirit,
when summoned as a servant they're nothing

530
00:34:55,986 --> 00:34:57,760
but a tool for their master.

531
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:01,327
Anyone who lets their fantasies get the better of them

532
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:04,222
will never have the wherewithal to win this battle.

533
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,818
And because you're the way you
are, my great‐grandfather decided

534
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,542
this scabbard was the perfect relic for you.

535
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:12,272
What do you think?

536
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:15,849
Does his gift not satisfy you?

537
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,604
Of course it does.

538
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:19,573
Acht did a wonderful job.

539
00:35:20,024 --> 00:35:22,908
None of the other masters have something this powerful.

540
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,018
What's wrong with it then?

541
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:28,802
Given how perfectly the ancient
relic is connected to it,

542
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,914
the heroic spirit, the one we're after,

543
00:35:32,154 --> 00:35:34,264
will surely respond to the summons,

544
00:35:34,954 --> 00:35:38,290
the King of Knights, Arthur Pendragon.

545
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:42,437
My own compatibility with him is a secondary concern.

546
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:45,938
But Arthur, the wielder of Excalibur,

547
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:49,711
is sure to be the strongest Saber class
servant the Grail Wars have ever seen.

548
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:51,445
That's true.

549
00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:54,882
I'll have a servant far stronger
than any other in the battle.

550
00:35:55,594 --> 00:35:59,017
The question is, how best to use that power?

551
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,920
How to make it work for us?

552
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:04,371
To be honest, in terms of ease of use,

553
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:09,002
Caster or Assassin would be far better
suited to the way I usually fight.

554
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:13,268
What good will it do to worry about
that before you've even summoned him?

555
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:16,780
After all, we don't know what
the King of Knights was like,

556
00:36:17,584 --> 00:36:20,770
and besides, no matter what your strategy is,

557
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:24,374
once he learns of your ideals, of your dream,

558
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:27,697
he'll understand, I know he will.

559
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:31,227
Just like I did.

560
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:37,644
What is it?

561
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:41,970
I've found my strategy, the way to get the best use.

562
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,419
From the strongest servant fighting in the battle.

563
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:56,108
Hello, Rin.

564
00:36:58,263 --> 00:36:59,950
Oh hello, Kirei.

565
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,283
Heading out?

566
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,503
That's some heavy luggage you have there.

567
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:08,104
That's right, I have to go live
with the Zenjou family for a while.

568
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:14,604
You're staying to fight alongside my
father in a coming war, aren't you?

569
00:37:14,823 --> 00:37:18,592
That's why I'm here as his student,
to help him and to learn from him.

570
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:23,462
Kirei, can I depend on you?

571
00:37:23,623 --> 00:37:24,215
Huh?

572
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:27,509
Will you promise to protect my father to the end?

573
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:29,577
Will you promise to keep him safe?

574
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:31,777
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

575
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:36,233
If this battle were going to be simple enough
that I could honestly make that promise,

576
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:40,561
we wouldn't have to send you or your mother
away from here to keep you safe and sound.

577
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:47,153
I guess that means I just can't like you no matter what.

578
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:51,015
Rin, you shouldn't just blurt out
what you're really thinking like that.

579
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:54,150
People might start to cast aspersions on your father.

580
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:56,741
He is the man who's educating you after all.

581
00:37:56,823 --> 00:37:58,929
My father has nothing to do with it!

582
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:04,356
Listen, Kirei, if you somehow get sloppy and
because of that my father gets hurt or worse,

583
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:06,658
I'll show you no mercy, got it?

584
00:38:06,873 --> 00:38:10,700
Rin, what're you doing out there?
How come you're yelling at him?

585
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:15,057
Um, I... Well, you see...

586
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,932
Oh, she was just giving me a bit of
encouragement before we said goodbye, ma'am.

587
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:21,917
Rin, allow me.

588
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:25,095
That big suitcase is far too
heavy for you to carry alone.

589
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:28,132
No thank you, I'll carry it myself.

590
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,008
Kirei, do your best to take care of my husband.

591
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:34,996
Please help him to achieve his desire.

592
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:36,965
I will do my best.

593
00:38:37,225 --> 00:38:38,431
Please, don't worry.

594
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:43,474
Excuse me.

595
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:50,225
You've arrived at a very opportune time. The relic I
made arrangements for finally arrived this morning.

596
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:51,692
Have a look.

597
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:54,473
What is it?

598
00:38:55,337 --> 00:39:00,558
A fossil of the very first skin
shed by a snake on this world.

599
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:06,805
If we use it as a catalyst and are lucky enough
to summon the heroic spirit that we're after,

600
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:09,758
total victory is as good as ours.

601
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:17,726
Hey, Sakura.

602
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:19,786
Did I startle you?

603
00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:22,651
Yeah, your face is...

604
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:23,651
I know.

605
00:39:24,122 --> 00:39:27,596
Seems I lost a little bit of it
to the worms that are inside me.

606
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:32,350
I guess I'm just not quite as tough as you are.

607
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:38,451
Uncle Kariya, you're turning into
a different person, aren't you?

608
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,068
Yeah, maybe.

609
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:46,655
You know, I don't have to go
to the worm pit again tonight.

610
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:51,248
Grandfather said there will be a more
important ceremony that I have to attend.

611
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:52,634
Yeah, I know.

612
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:56,172
That's why I'm going to the
basement tonight instead of you.

613
00:39:56,646 --> 00:40:00,158
Uncle Kariya, are you going somewhere far away?

614
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:04,361
Well, I have an important job
that I need to do for a while.

615
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:10,235
I might not have much time to talk to you
then, at least until I get back.

616
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:12,765
I see.

617
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:14,771
Hey, Sakura.

618
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:19,437
When my job is finally over,
you wanna go somewhere and just have fun?

619
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,613
With your mom and your sister too.

620
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:27,263
I don't have anyone I can call Mom or Sister.

621
00:40:27,994 --> 00:40:30,435
Grandfather said that I should just think of them

622
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:32,706
like they never existed.

623
00:40:34,963 --> 00:40:36,063
I see.

624
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,024
Uncle?

625
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,497
All right then.

626
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:52,947
When this is all over let's take
Aoi and Rin from the Tohsakas

627
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:56,152
and go somewhere as far away
from this place as we can get.

628
00:40:56,712 --> 00:41:00,535
We can hang out and have fun like we used to.

629
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:04,132
Does that mean we'll see them again?

630
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,410
Yeah, you will.

631
00:41:07,371 --> 00:41:08,987
You have my word on that.

632
00:41:14,017 --> 00:41:15,105
All right.

633
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:17,875
I have to get going now.

634
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,239
Mhm.

635
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:22,527
Bye‐bye, Uncle Kariya.

636
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:28,478
Bye‐bye.

637
00:41:30,106 --> 00:41:33,628
I assume you've memorized the summoning spell correctly?

638
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:34,943
Sure.

639
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,176
Very well.

640
00:41:36,503 --> 00:41:40,801
But I'm going to have to add two
extra lines to the basic incantation.

641
00:41:41,221 --> 00:41:42,612
What do you mean?

642
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:44,778
It's really quite simple, Kariya.

643
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:47,239
Because of your short time in training,

644
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:52,434
your rank as a mage is somewhat lower than that
of the other masters that the Grail has summoned.

645
00:41:53,176 --> 00:41:55,808
That will affect the servant's base abilities.

646
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:59,209
This means we have to boost the servant's parameters

647
00:41:59,234 --> 00:42:03,017
by attempting to modify the
servant's class as much as possible.

648
00:42:04,428 --> 00:42:11,155
Kariya, to that end, I want you to add the
affinity insanity to the servant you summon today.

649
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:15,776
Fill, fill, fill, fill, fill.

650
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:21,235
Repeat five times, but when each is filled, destroy it.

651
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:27,574
For the elements silver and iron,
the foundation stone and the Archduke of Pacts,

652
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:30,637
and for my great master, Schenewerk,

653
00:42:30,993 --> 00:42:34,252
raise a wall against the wind and
close the gates of four directions.

654
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:39,033
Come forth from the crown and follow
the forked road leading to the kingdom.

655
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:44,800
Is a simple ritual like this really
enough to summon a heroic spirit?

656
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,800
Surprisingly, yes.

657
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:52,796
You see, the summoning ritual doesn't
require a big elaborate evocation.

658
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:56,659
The actual summoning is preformed by the Grail itself.

659
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:58,847
My job as a master is to firmly anchor

660
00:42:59,173 --> 00:43:02,140
the heroic spirit in this world and to supply it

661
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:05,519
with enough mana to take physical form.

662
00:43:06,457 --> 00:43:07,869
That should do it.

663
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:11,722
Iri, put the relic on the altar.

664
00:43:12,337 --> 00:43:14,381
That is the final step.

665
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:20,977
Heed my words, my will creates your
body, and your sword creates my destiny.

666
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:27,148
If you heed the Grail's call and obey my
will and reason, then answer my summoning!

667
00:43:27,727 --> 00:43:32,049
I hereby swear that I shall
be all the good in the world,

668
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:36,314
that I shall defeat all evil in the world.

669
00:43:36,761 --> 00:43:40,907
Then let thine eyes be clouded
with the fog of turmoil and chaos.

670
00:43:41,237 --> 00:43:47,069
Thou who art trapped in a cage of madness,
and I the summoner who holds thy chains!

671
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:50,376
Seventh heaven clad in the great words of power,

672
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:52,916
come forth from this circle of binding,

673
00:43:52,982 --> 00:43:54,866
Guardian of Scales!

674
00:44:26,478 --> 00:44:28,032
Behold him, Kirei.

675
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:30,038
We have won the battle.

676
00:44:31,446 --> 00:44:33,053
Victory is ours!

677
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,761
Impossible.

678
