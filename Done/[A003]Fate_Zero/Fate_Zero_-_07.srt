1
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:05,730
This way, sir.

2
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:10,751
What is that?

3
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:16,147
All of you, return to your post.

4
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:19,753
Looks like an enormous ball of mercury doesn't it?

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,263
It's almost as if the damn thing is alive.

6
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:29,105
I need to get this out of here...

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,773
What's the matter, is something wrong?

8
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:31,853
I need to get this out of here,

9
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:33,403
I need to get this out of here.

10
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:34,058
Sir?

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,034
Load that thing onto the truck!

12
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:37,244
Quickly!

13
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:12,781
I'm afraid I must inform you
that the Grail War is in grave peril.

14
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:18,318
We have identified Caster's master as the
person behind the recent kidnappings in Fuyuki,

15
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,726
a disturbing revelation, indeed.

16
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:25,866
Thus, in accordance with the emergency powers
granted to me as overseer,

17
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:28,940
I am temporarily altering the rules of the Grail War.

18
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:33,783
Masters are to hereby cease all
ongoing combat in pursuit of the grail

19
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:36,929
and focus on the elimination of Caster instead.

20
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:41,477
And the one who succeeds in
defeating Caster and his master

21
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,177
will receive an additional
Command Seal as their reward.

22
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:51,851
These are the unused Command Seals left behind
by the fallen masters of past grail wars.

23
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:56,826
One of them should prove to be of
immeasurable value to whoever receives it.

24
00:02:57,526 --> 00:03:00,788
Once Caster's destruction has been positively confirmed,

25
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,459
the Holy Grail War will
recommence until a victor emerges.

26
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:07,256
Now then, if anyone has questions,

27
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:08,932
please ask them now.

28
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:14,541
But, of course, that offer is limited to those
who can actually speak in human languages.

29
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:20,507
Well played, Father.

30
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:25,020
Now all the masters will do whatever they
can to hunt him down and destroy him.

31
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:30,335
There were five familiars gathered at the
church for my announcement, which means that...

32
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:36,762
Which means that the elusive missing master
Lord El‐Melloi is still very much alive.

33
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:37,787
Indeed.

34
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:40,846
And the offer of a Command Seal as the reward

35
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:42,482
should draw him out

36
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:45,072
given that he's already used one of his.

37
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:48,543
Of course, the other masters will be drawn out as well.

38
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,658
They'll seek to keep the Command Seal from the rest

39
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:54,956
by making certain they can claim it for themselves.

40
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:59,615
That's true, but it also means
that the master who wins the seal

41
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,471
will gain a formidable
advantage over the others.

42
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:04,538
Naturally, it's not ideal.

43
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:07,111
Once Caster has been thoroughly weakened

44
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:10,551
and is on the run from all the
other masters who are chasing him,

45
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:15,183
Archer must be the one to deal the final blow.

46
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,925
Um...

47
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,874
Excuse me, is this the Mackenzie residence?

48
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,167
I have a delivery.

49
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:25,867
Yes, that is the name of this domicile's residents.

50
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:31,594
Well, then, might there be a Mr. Iskandar,
King of Conquerors here?

51
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,223
That would be me.

52
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:34,916
I see, right.

53
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:36,324
I should've known.

54
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:40,772
Uh, could I have your signature on this receipt here?

55
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:42,099
My signature?

56
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:43,370
Very well.

57
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,667
You have my thanks.

58
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:51,806
Well, thank you very much for your business, sir.

59
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,949
To have the entire world emblazoned across my chest.

60
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:01,022
What a great feeling!

61
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,080
Wait, why are you dressed like that?

62
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,228
The package I was awaiting arrived.

63
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:09,666
So you went outside the house?

64
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:13,607
Ta‐da, I merely tried out that
mail‐order thing I heard about.

65
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:16,460
But I told you that you were
never to leave the second floor!

66
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:21,458
If the residents are not at home and you are off
somewhere all day occupied with your familiar,

67
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:23,628
who else is there to answer the door?

68
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,256
I had no choice.

69
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:29,117
A summons to appear by the Holy
Church is a big deal and I had to go.

70
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:30,570
Don't be so grouchy.

71
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:32,841
After seeing Saber last night,

72
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:34,684
I came to a realization.

73
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:40,984
If one wears modern attire, there should be no
issue whatsoever with going outside the domicile.

74
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:42,321
Hey, wait!

75
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:43,457
Stop!

76
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:46,238
At least put on some pants before you go out!

77
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:48,350
Oh, yes, leggings.

78
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:52,951
That's true, I forgot.
Everyone in this land wears them.

79
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:54,857
Do I have to wear them?

80
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:56,630
Yes, of course you have to!

81
00:05:56,662 --> 00:05:58,242
And just to be perfectly clear,

82
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,596
I'm definitely not going to make
a special trip all the way to town

83
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,614
just to buy you a pair of
triple XL pants, understand?

84
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:05,902
You won't, why?

85
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,105
Boy, would you actually stand in the way
of my triumphant conquest of the world?

86
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:12,721
You conquering the world and
whether or not you have pants have

87
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:15,602
nothing, not even the slightest
thing to do with each other!

88
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:18,502
Before you start planning to go screwing around outside,

89
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,672
why don't you go out and do your job
and beat one of the other servants?

90
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:24,484
Then I'll buy your pants or anything else you want.

91
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:25,375
Very well.

92
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:26,908
I understand.

93
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:30,435
Do you swear that once I defeat
one of the other servants

94
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:34,757
you will go and buy me a modern pair
of pants so that I can go outside?

95
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:36,496
Unbelievable.

96
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:40,557
You really want to put on modern clothes
and go walking outside that much?

97
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:43,141
The King of Knights was walking around outside.

98
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:45,888
I simply cannot allow myself to be undone.

99
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,445
I like the design on this shirt.

100
00:06:48,597 --> 00:06:51,162
It is fitting attire for a strong ruler.

101
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,777
Look, we have to go find and defeat Caster too.

102
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,130
What the hell are we doing?

103
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:00,952
There is a powerful barrier over Mount Enzo

104
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:02,866
with Ryuudou Temple at its center.

105
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:06,521
Because of that,
except for natural spirits like servants,

106
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:09,205
anything can enter only via the temple path.

107
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:12,448
Keep that in mind as you're using Saber.

108
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,808
There are three other spots
where the ley lines converge:

109
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,675
Tohsaka Manor, Fuyuki Chapel,

110
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:21,591
and this new residential area, east of the city center.

111
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,962
Consequently, this means that there
are four locations in Fuyuki

112
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:29,736
that have all the spiritual characteristics
needed for the grail to appear.

113
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:31,889
In the war's second phase,

114
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:34,519
when there are fewer servants left in the fight,

115
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:36,856
we'll have to secure one of these spots

116
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:39,016
as our base of operations, won't we?

117
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,276
Yes, that's correct.

118
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:42,924
Well, that just about covers the lay of the land.

119
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:44,442
Are there any questions?

120
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,270
Is there anything that you aren't clear on?

121
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:48,955
I understand perfectly.

122
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,402
It was an adequate explanation.

123
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,931
Kiritsugu, can we assume that all the
other masters will go after Caster?

124
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,582
It's a safe bet.

125
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:02,699
However, we have an advantage
as far as Caster is concerned.

126
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,748
In his madness,

127
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:08,712
he believes that our Saber is actually his Jeanne d'Arc

128
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:10,429
which is to our benefit.

129
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,193
We need only wait for him to come to us.

130
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,608
But, master, that is not enough.

131
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:17,786
His evil deeds must be punished.

132
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,756
We should take the fight straight to him

133
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,688
before he can do any more damage.

134
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:29,314
Iri, do you have a handle on
this forest's barrier spells?

135
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,205
Yes, I do, however,

136
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:35,249
our real problem is the unbreakable
curse on Saber's left hand.

137
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:39,611
Eighteen hours have already passed
since your defeat of Canaan,

138
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,265
but Saber's wound has still yet to heal.

139
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:46,237
Lancer must still be alive.

140
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:52,219
Shouldn't we go find and defeat Lancer first so we
can face a battle with Caster at our full strength?

141
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:53,999
That isn't necessary.

142
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:59,856
You just need to use your knowledge of the area
to confuse the enemy, keeping Saber moving around.

143
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,698
You won't have her fight Caster?

144
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,852
No, someone else will deal with him even if we don't.

145
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:12,023
The masters and servants hunting Caster in
a frenzy will make excellent targets for us.

146
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:15,783
I'll attack from their flanks and take them out.

147
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,317
Master, you can't.

148
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,725
To what depths do you intend to sink in your pursuit?

149
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:24,505
You do insult to heroic spirits.

150
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,159
Why do you not allow me to go out and fight?

151
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:29,533
Do you mean to imply that you cannot trust me,

152
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:31,108
your own servant?

153
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:35,295
There's a truce against everyone
but Caster, isn't there?

154
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,836
It'll be fine.

155
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,212
This overseer of ours can't be trusted.

156
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:44,709
He harbors Assassin's master in his church
and doesn't say anything about it to anyone.

157
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:47,458
He may also be working with Tohsaka.

158
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,905
We should be skeptical of his actions.

159
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,565
All right, dismissed.

160
00:09:58,821 --> 00:09:59,774
Kiritsugu.

161
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:04,547
If...

162
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,010
If I...

163
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:12,024
If I decided to abandon everything
and simply run away from all of this,

164
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:16,400
Iri, would you consider coming with me?

165
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:18,243
But what about Illya?

166
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:20,627
She's still waiting back at our castle.

167
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:24,266
I'd return for her, killing anyone in our way,

168
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,077
and then I would just...

169
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:28,674
I'd give all I have

170
00:10:28,955 --> 00:10:31,321
for you and Illya, and no one else!

171
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,656
Could we really get away?

172
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,435
We could escape if we go now!

173
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:40,024
You're lying.

174
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:41,820
That's a lie.

175
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:45,783
You could never run away from this.

176
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:48,040
You would never forgive yourself

177
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,447
for abandoning the Holy Grail,

178
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,030
for failing to save the world.

179
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:57,888
You would be riddled with guilt,
and as your first and final accuser,

180
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,010
you would eventually kill yourself.

181
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:04,667
I'm scared.

182
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,616
He... Kirei Kotomine is after me.

183
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,182
Maiya told me.

184
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:15,153
He used Canaan as bait to draw me out.

185
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:17,735
He anticipated my actions.

186
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:20,786
I've already sacrificed you, Iri,

187
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,764
and I've left Illya behind,

188
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:26,563
but the most dangerous of them all
has already set his sights on me,

189
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,994
the one that I had hoped
to never cross paths with!

190
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:34,698
I won't allow you to fight alone.

191
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,416
I will protect you, and Saber will, too,

192
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:41,848
and also Maiya is here.

193
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:47,037
Kiritsugu.

194
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:49,929
An attack.

195
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:53,519
We're lucky I hadn't sent Maiya out yet.

196
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:56,197
We can mount an all‐out defense.

197
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:03,037
Iri, find us a remote‐viewing crystal ball.

198
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:10,306
There they are.

199
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:12,371
Irisviel.

200
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,739
He's trying to lure us out.

201
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:17,733
It looks like he has hostages.

202
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:20,745
I'll have to go out there and
do what I can to save them.

203
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:26,935
He knows that we're watching him.

204
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:32,589
Just as I promised you last night, I,
Gilles de Rais, have come for you, my darling.

205
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:38,502
I wish to see you, fair Jeanne, my enchanting
and radiantly beautiful holy virgin of my dreams.

206
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,860
Irisviel.

207
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:42,291
You may take your time if you wish.

208
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:48,575
I have come fully prepared for a lengthy wait, and will
be as attentive and patient as you need for me to be.

209
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:53,558
Now, children, it's time for
us to play some hide‐and‐seek.

210
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,971
The rules are simple.

211
00:12:55,156 --> 00:12:56,497
You need only to elude me.

212
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:58,886
But if I find you...

213
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:00,653
No, don't!

214
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:06,964
Run, children.

215
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,376
When I count to a hundred, the chase begins.

216
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:14,817
Well, Jeanne, how long do you think it will
take for me to catch them all and win the game?

217
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:20,783
Saber, go!

218
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,206
Defeat Caster!

219
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:23,239
Yes!

220
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:32,344
Huh?

221
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:50,029
Welcome, fair Jeanne.

222
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,904
How do you like this horrible sight?

223
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,806
Does it not pain you?

224
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,913
Do you despise me, Jeanne?

225
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:03,121
Yes, I'm sure you must.

226
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:07,741
I'm certain you'll never forgive
me for turning from God's love.

227
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:10,568
Unhand the child, monster!

228
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:19,866
Jeanne, if you so dearly wish to save the boy, then,
child, you should rejoice and be exceedingly glad.

229
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:24,743
God's devout messenger says that she will save
you from the fate of your departed friend.

230
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:31,408
It's dangerous here.

231
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,767
Now, you need to run.

232
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:37,255
Just follow this path and you'll find a castle.

233
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:56,212
Ha‐ha, do you not remember what I told you?

234
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:59,016
I said that the very next time we would meet

235
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:01,185
I would be prepared for you.

236
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:03,148
Very well.

237
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,952
My fight with you is no longer over.

238
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:07,360
The Grail!

239
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,563
Oh, my fair Jeanne, how noble, how beautiful!

240
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:25,069
Oh, holy virgin,
even God's beauty pales before you.

241
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:28,976
Caster, I take up my sword solely to destroy you!

242
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:30,036
Prepare!

243
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,885
If only I could use my left hand.

244
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:56,562
Even Caster's mana isn't infinite.

245
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:59,389
If she can last until it runs out,

246
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:03,388
Saber can with this battle, right, Kiritsugu?

247
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:08,067
More importantly, there's still no sign
of other masters entering the forest.

248
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:12,325
Maiya, take Iri and get away from the castle

249
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,995
in the opposite direction of the fight.

250
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:18,066
But why can't I just remain here?

251
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:21,677
With Saber fighting away from you,
it simply isn't safe for you here.

252
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:25,936
At least one of the other masters is
certain to have had the same idea.

253
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:29,327
All right, I'll go.

254
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,057
What's wrong, Iri?

255
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:37,996
It appears that another one has arrived.

256
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:43,402
How is this?

257
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:45,719
Is there no end to his mana?

258
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,967
Impossible.

259
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:50,056
The source of his mana is...

260
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:52,781
So that book is your Noble Phantasm?

261
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:57,032
That's right, the grimoire left to
me by the legendary teacher, Prelati,

262
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:01,331
gives me the ample means to command
a demonic legion to do my will.

263
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:03,594
What do you think, my fair Jeanne?

264
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:05,906
It brings back memories, doesn't it?

265
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,196
Everything is just as it was then.

266
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:14,342
Your indomitable warrior spirit and noble bearing
proves you to be none other than Jeanne d'Arc!

267
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,451
So why, fair Jeanne,
why do you not awaken to the truth of this?

268
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:22,088
Do you still believe in God's grace even now?

269
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,147
Faced with mortal peril,
you still believe a miracle will save you?

270
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:30,740
How terribly tragic.
Have you forgotten the Battle of Compiègne?

271
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:36,531
Even after that awful humiliation,
you still chose to remain God's puppet!

272
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:50,756
Ah!

273
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,085
Rather pathetic.

274
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:59,961
Such swordsmanship is unworthy
of the title King of Knights.

275
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:00,892
Hmm.

276
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,861
Who are you?

277
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,191
And who gave you leave to
interfere with our private affair?

278
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:09,202
Yes, well, that is my question to you, monster.

279
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:12,821
It will be my lance alone that takes Saber's life.

280
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:15,382
Ah, no, it was my prayer!

281
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:18,655
It was my Holy Grail that brought her back to life!

282
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:21,146
She is mine, intruder.

283
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:26,274
Every scrap of flesh, every drop of
blood, even her very soul belongs to me!

284
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:31,503
Listen, Caster, I am not gonna comment
on your bizarre notion of romance here.

285
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:35,116
So if you really believe that you're
gonna make Saber yours here today,

286
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:36,651
then go ahead and try it,

287
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:43,469
but know that I, Diarmuid, will never allow you
to defeat a crippled Saber in any sort of battle

288
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:44,876
before I can!

289
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,117
You came to help?

290
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:50,420
Don't get the wrong idea.

291
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:55,306
The only thing that brought me here today
was the order to find and defeat Caster.

292
00:18:55,734 --> 00:19:00,018
And, so, I believe cooperation
is our best option, right?

293
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,607
Mmhmm.

294
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:05,142
Just to be perfectly clear, Lancer,

295
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:09,482
right now, I could kill a hundred of
those things with just my left arm.

296
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,969
Hmm, a mere hundred of them is child's play.

297
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:16,917
You will pay.

298
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:20,482
Don't be conceited, you savage!

299
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:25,237
Fervor, mei sanguis.

300
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,191
Kayneth El‐Melloi has arrived,

301
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:38,804
the ninth patriarch of the Archibald family.

302
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:43,682
Mage of the Einzbern, come forth and let
us duel for possession of the Holy Grail

303
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:45,922
with our lives and our sacred honor.

304
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,569
Mechanical traps, of all things.

305
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,453
Have you fallen so low, Einzbern?

306
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:27,116
Very well, then this is no longer a
duel, but an extermination.

307
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,685
I see.

308
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,051
Automated probes.

309
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:49,876
I found you, pathetic rat.

310
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,536
Now scalp!

311
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:59,539
Time alter, double accelerate.

312
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,261
Huh?

313
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:07,612
Oh.

314
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:14,507
He manipulated the flow of time to greatly accelerate
himself by using his own body as a reality marble.

315
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:17,733
It seems that he knows a little magic after all.

316
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:24,216
Still, only a miserable, little coward would depend
on petty tricks after being trained as a mage.

317
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:27,547
Perhaps dying will teach him his place.

318
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:30,969
Ire sanctio.

319
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:38,795
If he's manipulating his inner time,
it must be placing enormous stress on his body.

320
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,277
I found him.

321
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:47,566
Now then, how far can you run as exhausted as you are?

322
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,810
Time alter, triple stagnate.

323
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:09,843
These things don't have eyes.

324
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:13,483
If I can slow my internal time to a third

325
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,742
and lower my pulse and
respiration as far as they can go,

326
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:20,330
they can't sense me.

327
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:34,537
Kayneth!

328
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:38,407
You're a fool!

329
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:40,052
It's a waste of time.

330
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,835
Hmm.
