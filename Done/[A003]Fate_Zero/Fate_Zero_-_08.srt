1
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:07,447
Madam?

2
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:08,226
Huh?

3
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:10,983
Please hurry.

4
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:19,902
Madam?

5
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,516
Another intruder has just arrived.

6
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:25,163
They're waiting for us in the direction we're headed.

7
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:27,856
We'll run into them if we go this way.

8
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:29,151
Understood.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,843
Let's circle around to the north side then.

10
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:36,078
Madam?

11
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,009
The one who is coming is...

12
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:41,591
Kirei Kotomine.

13
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,534
Kirei Kotomine.

14
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:24,291
Maiya, the orders that were given to you by Kiritsugu

15
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:26,991
were to protect me from harm, right?

16
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:28,095
Yes.

17
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:31,004
‐But... ‐But what?

18
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:33,935
We mustn't let him get to Kiritsugu,

19
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:36,303
no matter what we have to do to stop him.

20
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:39,211
Isn't that what you're thinking?

21
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:44,763
Madam, how did you...

22
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,272
What a coincidence.

23
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:48,737
I was thinking the very same thing.

24
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:52,216
Maiya, Kirei Kotomine

25
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,545
represents the most dangerous threat

26
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:57,118
that Kiritsugu has ever had to face.

27
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:00,510
You and I are going to hold him off here.

28
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,710
Understood, Maiya?

29
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,072
I apologize.

30
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:09,551
But, please prepare yourself, madam.

31
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:10,585
I will.

32
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:12,913
Please don't worry about me.

33
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:15,527
Do whatever you think you have to do,

34
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,364
what you believe to be necessary to win,

35
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:20,968
and not what Kiritsugu ordered you to do.

36
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:21,890
Right.

37
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:25,562
What's funny?

38
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:31,391
Isn't the human heart a funny thing?

39
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:45,574
Hmm, you repeat an attack you
know to be absolutely futile.

40
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:01,703
Scalp!

41
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:22,074
He was somehow able to breach Volumen
Hydragyrum's autonomous defense?

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,052
He couldn't have.

43
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:28,866
His ineffective childish attack simply
rolled me into lowering my guard!

44
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:34,826
I shall take steps to provide for a much
swifter, more efficient defense from now on.

45
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:39,053
You're disgrace to mages everywhere,

46
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,991
you piece of lowborn trash!

47
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,382
For spilling my blood,

48
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:46,123
you will pay with your life.

49
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:54,211
He knows exactly how powerful this is now.

50
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,579
It's not going to work on him twice.

51
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:01,217
Next time, he'll channel all his mana into his defense.

52
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:06,827
Yes, that exactly what I need him to do.

53
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:22,050
Huh?

54
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:33,968
An illusion?

55
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,376
Maiya, no!

56
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:23,297
Madam, please don't.

57
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:27,507
Woman, this may come as a surprise to you,

58
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,393
but I haven't come here to this
place in order to defeat you.

59
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:35,103
I'm well aware of that, Kirei Kotomine.

60
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:40,131
I know what you desire, but I will not allow it.

61
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,088
You will never reach Kiritsugu Emiya tonight or ever!

62
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,099
We will stop you...

63
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:48,068
...right here.

64
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,157
Madam!

65
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:50,867
He's a skilled executioner!

66
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:52,700
An expert at hunting mages!

67
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:55,584
Regular magic won't be enough to stop him!

68
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:02,845
Kiritsugu taught me a lot more than how to drive a car!

69
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:09,028
He taught me to live and to survive!
Shape ist Leben!

70
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:38,639
Look out!

71
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:39,848
Not so fast!

72
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:53,624
Maiya!

73
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:56,570
Finish him!

74
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,354
It can't be.

75
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:39,426
Hm.

76
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:50,947
You bastard... ah!

77
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,791
I'm honestly stunned

78
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,000
that we've made so little progress with these things.

79
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,170
It's that grimoire, Lancer.

80
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,237
As long as he holds that Noble Phantasm,

81
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,167
our situation will not improve.

82
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:16,551
I see, so that's his secret.

83
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:23,232
Of course, if you plan to go over and knock the book
from that pale freak's hands, you've got a problem.

84
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:26,212
You'll need to get pass his big wall of monsters first.

85
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:29,588
Well, then, what say you to taking in

86
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,026
all‐or‐nothing gamble?

87
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:36,622
It feels a bit shameful, but there's no glory
in simply fighting these ugly things.

88
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,881
Very well, count me in, Saber.

89
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:41,851
I shall clear a path for you.

90
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,179
We will have but one chance at this.

91
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,570
Lancer, can you run on the wind?

92
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:49,327
I understand.

93
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,074
It's child's play.

94
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,441
How delightful!

95
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:54,237
Have you two said your prayers?

96
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:57,733
Tremble down to your soul!
Sink into despair!

97
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:03,905
Superior skill can only defeat so many before
being completely overwhelmed by sheer numbers.

98
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,474
It must be humiliating!

99
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:10,096
You will die!

100
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:14,870
Suffocated under a horde of monsters
that know nothing of honor or glory!

101
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:18,406
There can be no greater disgrace for a hero!

102
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:21,901
Oh, that beautiful face of yours.

103
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:26,426
Make it twist and contort in pain for me, Jeanne!

104
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:32,441
Strike Air!

105
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:38,623
Ah!

106
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:43,016
Prepare to die!

107
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:48,251
Strike him, Gae Dearg!

108
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,356
Ahh!

109
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,390
Damn you.

110
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:17,940
Damn you, damn you, damn you, damn you, damn you!

111
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:20,347
Damn you!

112
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,216
Did you like that?

113
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,782
Had Saber had the use of her left hand,

114
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:28,710
well, you would've experienced the same.

115
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:32,148
Prepare to die...

116
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,007
...monster.

117
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:52,487
Pathetic.

118
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:58,538
I didn't come here and join the Holy Grail War
only to fight in this ridiculous sort of battle!

119
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,385
Where is he?

120
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,402
Find him.

121
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,705
There you are...

122
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:23,256
...you skulking little rat.

123
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:33,799
Surely you don't expect the same trick to work
on me a second time, do you, lowborn scum?

124
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:41,521
The fact that you succeeded in landing a single
blow wasn't due to any great strategy of yours.

125
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:42,609
It was a fluke.

126
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,484
A stroke of luck, plain and simple.

127
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:46,978
Now I'm going to teach you the difference.

128
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:49,561
I shan't let you die easily.

129
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:53,208
I shall use healing magic to
regenerate your heart and lungs

130
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:56,186
while I rend every millimeter
of your lowborn flesh.

131
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:58,789
In excruciating pain and despair,

132
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:00,768
you will die as you suffer.

133
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,434
And while you die, you will curse them,

134
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,440
you will curse the cowardice of those who hired you.

135
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:10,341
You will curse the Einzbern for
making a mockery of the Grail War!

136
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:12,811
Insolent fool!

137
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,559
Fervor, mei sanguis!

138
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,546
Hm.

139
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:24,905
I knew you'd do that, scum.

140
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,911
Hm.

141
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,406
Ah!

142
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:36,733
You struggle in vain!

143
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:53,738
Disgusting.

144
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:56,230
He is nothing but a sniveling coward!

145
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:58,217
Lancer.

146
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:01,919
Is something wrong?

147
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:07,601
It's my master.

148
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,158
He's in danger.

149
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:14,251
It seems, he left me here and
breached the castle himself.

150
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:20,376
I'm certain that the danger comes from my own master.

151
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,260
Lancer, hurry to his side.

152
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,174
Go to your master as aid.

153
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,688
King of Knights, you have my thanks.

154
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,219
Think nothing of it.

155
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:36,797
You and I have sworn to settle matters
in a manner befitting two knights.

156
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:38,808
Let us keep our pride intact.

157
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:50,439
That must mean that all went
according to Kiritsugu's plan.

158
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:59,872
Your origin is based on cutting and tying, kid.

159
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:01,624
To cut and tie.

160
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:08,186
The nuance is a little different
than destruction and regeneration.

161
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,244
If you cut a thread and then retie it,

162
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,571
it will always be thicker where you cut it.

163
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:14,507
Isn't that right?

164
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:15,688
In that sense,

165
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:18,965
it carries a connotation of irreversible change.

166
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,974
I've powdered some of your ribs,

167
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:27,635
and also put a very special part inside of here.

168
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,216
Your origin will materialize

169
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:32,679
in anything shot by these bullets.

170
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:35,968
It's especially powerful against mages.

171
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:38,669
If they attempt to use any magic against it,

172
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:44,685
your origin will interfere with and destroy their
magic circuits which will reconnect improperly.

173
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:50,063
The more powerful the mage, the more their
magic circuits will run haywire and short out.

174
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:53,288
Naturally, they will never be able to recover

175
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,307
either as a mage or human.

176
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:58,412
These will be your ace in the hole.

177
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,129
"Origin Rounds".

178
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:02,496
I've made 66 in total.

179
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,619
Don't waste them.

180
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:56,046
I'm sure you must know how easy it would
be for me to skewer you right now, correct?

181
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:58,969
Master of Saber.

182
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,505
So that's it, is it?

183
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:04,204
I shall not let you kill my master,

184
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,968
nor will I kill Saber's master.

185
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:11,211
Neither of us wish for our duel to be ended that way.

186
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,110
Never forget this.

187
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:15,962
The reason you survived our encounter

188
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:19,681
is the nobility demonstrated by the King of Knights.

189
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,371
Woman, I have one question.

190
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:36,776
It appears to me that the two
of you came here to challenge me

191
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:40,521
with the intention of
protecting Kiritsugu Emiya.

192
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:44,868
By whose order do you dare attack?

193
00:17:46,636 --> 00:17:48,950
You do not possess Command Seals,

194
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:51,104
so you are not the Einzbern Master.

195
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:56,228
Most likely, you are a homunculus
charged with protecting the Grail vessel.

196
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:58,944
There's no way that someone like that

197
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:03,681
would ever be stupid enough to risk
going to the front lines of the battle.

198
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:06,024
So I ask again.

199
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:07,851
Tell me now.

200
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:10,576
Who ordered you to fight me?

201
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,325
Hm.

202
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:23,169
Master Kirei.

203
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,204
Caster, as well as Lancer and his master,

204
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,151
have left the forest.

205
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:31,788
Saber will arrive shortly.

206
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:35,024
My lord, it is dangerous here.

207
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,121
Hm.

208
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:45,487
Fascinating.

209
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:47,544
So it's red after all.

210
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,407
Impossible.

211
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:06,794
Could these women have challenged me of their
own accord without being ordered to do so?

212
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:09,672
No.

213
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:12,755
Kiritsugu Emiya is like me.

214
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:15,510
He is alone and empty inside,

215
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,814
understood by no one.

216
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:22,486
He must be.

217
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:25,990
Irisviel!

218
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:28,103
Irisviel!

219
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,621
Can you hear me?

220
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:34,696
Saber.

221
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:36,143
Stay awake.

222
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:37,755
You must stay awake.

223
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:39,765
I'm going to call Kiritsugu.

224
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:41,705
Be strong until then.

225
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:43,824
Where is Kirei,

226
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:47,639
the enemy who was here just a minute ago?

227
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:49,348
He escaped.

228
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,255
Had I been only a second faster,

229
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:54,632
this would never have happened to you.

230
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:57,841
What happened to Maiya?

231
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,891
Her wounds are grave, but not life‐threatening.

232
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:03,173
I'm more concerned about you.

233
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:05,277
You've lost so much blood.

234
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:06,488
Huh?

235
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:11,069
Irisviel, how...

236
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,143
How can this be?

237
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:21,797
I want you to carry Avalon, Iri.

238
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:23,133
What?

239
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:27,684
But, this is a Noble Phantasm
that heals its bearer's wounds.

240
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,298
I think you should keep it.

241
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:35,375
No, Iri, unless its original owner,
Saber, is nearby to supply it with mana,

242
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:38,020
the scabbard won't function at all.

243
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,922
You will be the one who'll be
working with Saber from now on.

244
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,265
So you should have it.

245
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:48,031
Keep it within you as a conceptual weapon.

246
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,375
Additionally, tell no one of this,

247
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,014
not even Saber herself.

248
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:06,129
From the moment you touched me, I felt Avalon's power.

249
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:08,679
Thank you, Saber.

250
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,812
Kirei Kotomine.

251
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:19,176
That inquisitor is as dangerous
as I imagined he'd be.

252
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:21,980
No, even more so.

253
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:23,998
We were lucky today.

254
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,169
But there's no telling what will happen next time.

255
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:32,682
All I know for certain is that I can't
let him get to Kiritsugu no matter what.

256
00:21:34,097 --> 00:21:38,446
But, I'm not the only one here who is protecting him.

257
00:21:39,576 --> 00:21:42,041
Isn't that right, Maiya?

258
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:46,808
Next time, we'll win for sure.

259
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:50,454
We'll both protect Kiritsugu, okay?
