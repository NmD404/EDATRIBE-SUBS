1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:03,766
By my third command seal, I order you again.

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,392
Stop!

3
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:08,934
Now, Saber, destroy

4
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:11,029
the Holy Grail.

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,393
How could I possibly hope to know a man

6
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:22,033
from merely three commands alone?

7
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:26,543
I, I never even knew the hearts of those

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,126
who served me well,

9
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:30,492
and were closest to me.

10
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:38,787
Perhaps all this was a punishment meted out to a king

11
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:41,336
who cannot understand others.

12
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:22,343
That can't...

13
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:43,192
It can't be.

14
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,413
It's impossible!

15
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:15,007
Daddy?

16
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,560
Ilyasviel, what's wrong?

17
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:23,021
I had a really scary dream.

18
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,202
A dream where,

19
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:29,140
where I become a really big cup...

20
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:35,893
...and then I dreamed that these seven
gigantic lumps started to come into my body.

21
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:39,947
It felt like they were gonna tear me apart.

22
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:42,391
It's really scary,

23
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:45,359
but I can't run away.

24
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:51,297
And then I hear the
voice of Lord Justice.

25
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:59,886
After that, a big black hole opens up above my
head, and then the world burns.

26
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:03,925
Daddy looks at it all

27
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:07,255
and just begins to cry.

28
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:13,324
Mother, is Daddy okay?

29
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:15,728
Is he scared and alone?

30
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,849
Is he in trouble?

31
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:19,969
It's okay.

32
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:22,559
Daddy's doing the best he can for you.

33
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,060
He'll make certain that our prayers are realized

34
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,872
so you'll never have to be scared again, Ilyasviel.

35
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:36,055
That's right.

36
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:38,175
I know he will.

37
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:42,365
Daddy always works very hard.

38
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:48,931
He'll finish all of his important work,
and he'll come home as soon as he possibly can.

39
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:57,793
Hey, Sakura.

40
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,205
Come on.

41
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:00,985
Uncle?

42
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:03,253
I'm here to save you.

43
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:04,874
It's okay now.

44
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,039
Let's go.

45
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:11,263
It's Sakura!

46
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,803
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

47
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:21,962
Kariya.

48
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,021
Hi, Aoi.

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,847
Thank you, Uncle Kariya.

50
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:33,827
Thank you so much.

51
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:39,065
Daddy Kariya!

52
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,859
You're such a fool.

53
00:04:57,092 --> 00:05:00,187
Never disobey Grandfather.

54
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,272
Where am I?

55
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:10,171
You're a difficult man to look after.

56
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:16,882
Digging you out from underneath all of this
rubble was quite a troublesome endeavor.

57
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,975
Gilgamesh, what happened?

58
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:22,110
Who can say?

59
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:24,618
That mud spit me out and here I am.

60
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:28,306
I imagine it to be an obvious message from heaven

61
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:31,802
that I should return to this age to rule the world.

62
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,364
Are you saying you have achieved incarnation?

63
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:38,216
Infuriatingly enough.

64
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:44,894
I can't believe we struggled over that ridiculous
thing as if it were actually a wish‐granter.

65
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:51,070
This ill‐conceived and disappointing play remained
a meaningless farce right to the very end.

66
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:53,663
But I was shot.

67
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:55,347
I don't get it.

68
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,767
I have no heartbeat.

69
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:08,152
Did you somehow heal me and
bring me back to life, Gilgamesh?

70
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:11,257
The fact is I really have no idea.

71
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,101
To my eyes, you still seem quite dead,

72
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:17,311
but the two of us were connected by our pact.

73
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,755
When I regained flesh within that mud,

74
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:25,613
perhaps you were trapped in some
sort of magical nonsense of your own.

75
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,247
Impossible, you're saying that thing granted me life?

76
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:33,953
All the other servants are gone,

77
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:37,345
so I suppose we must be the ones who have won the Grail.

78
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:41,830
Kirei, behold the result of our victory.

79
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:46,893
If it is true that the Grail
grants the victor's heartfelt wish,

80
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:51,585
what you see before you,
Kirei Kotomine, is your wish.

81
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,382
It is exactly what you most desired.

82
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:04,480
Hm?

83
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:11,941
This is it, what the hell does this make me?

84
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:13,969
What manner of dark evil?

85
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:16,053
What manner of cruelty?

86
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:18,759
This, this is my wish?

87
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,601
This horrible
destruction and tragedy?

88
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:24,051
This is the joy I sought?

89
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:27,708
Could something so twisted, so corrupt,

90
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,927
have truly sprung forth from the
seed of Father Risei Kotomine?

91
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:37,812
No way, it is impossible!

92
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,566
Did my father sire a soulless demon
more evil than the devil himself?

93
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,732
Are you satisfied now, Kirei?

94
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:53,678
No, no, not yet.

95
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:56,269
This isn't nearly enough.

96
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:01,682
Yes, it is true that my life of questions

97
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:03,832
has finally found its answer.

98
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:09,408
However, the problem solving
process itself was skipped over,

99
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:12,232
and the solution was just simply handed to me.

100
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:16,356
How is it that I'm supposed to
accept all this at face value?

101
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:23,941
The formula that yielded this strange,
unsettling answer should exist somewhere

102
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,240
as a greater, clearer principle

103
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:27,584
one can understand.

104
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,983
No, not should, it must.

105
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:36,201
I must question, I must search.

106
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:40,318
I must dedicate the remainder of my life

107
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:43,248
to fully understanding it.

108
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:46,278
You know, you never fail to bore me.

109
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:51,786
As you like, your questions
would slay the very gods.

110
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:55,036
I shall watch you seek out your answer.

111
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,443
Angra Mainyu.

112
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:05,037
I will reach it again, and next time,

113
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:07,263
I will see it to the end.

114
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:11,906
Its birth and the proof of its existence.

115
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,825
Kiritsugu Emiya.

116
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:30,119
I accept your challenge.

117
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:48,213
What's the matter, Kirei?

118
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:50,846
Nothing.

119
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,692
I remember the look on his face,

120
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:09,469
the tears in his eyes

121
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,886
over finding someone alive in the rubble.

122
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:15,779
A man filled with joy

123
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:18,238
from the bottom of his heart.

124
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:20,815
He looked so happy to me.

125
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:28,635
It was almost as though it had been him
who had been saved that day, and not me.

126
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,760
He's alive, he's alive!

127
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:35,466
He's alive!

128
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:43,610
And then, so fervently that even as I teetered
on the brink of death, I felt jealous of him.

129
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:47,298
He said, "Thank you,"

130
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,672
that he was glad he'd found someone,

131
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:54,589
that by saving even one person

132
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,422
he had saved himself.

133
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:11,503
And now for our next story,
the explosion that occurred... 

134
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:15,633
I hope that Alexey made it back
to his home in England safely.

135
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,435
He called me this morning from Heathrow Airport.

136
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:21,471
That idiot forgot all about the time difference.

137
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:23,144
Oh, he called?

138
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:24,995
I didn't hear the phone ring,

139
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:28,845
but then, it's just like him to do that.

140
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:36,082
Hey, Grandpa and Grandma,

141
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:39,810
I have a favor to ask, if it's okay.

142
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:43,452
What is it, Waver, speak your mind.

143
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:47,499
Actually, I'm thinking of taking
some time off from school.

144
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:51,218
Of course I'll talk to Dad in Toronto about it first.

145
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:55,463
There's something that I wanna spend
my time on more than studies at school.

146
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:56,778
Oh?

147
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:58,058
My goodness.

148
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:01,012
But what brought all this on, dear?

149
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:04,260
Is it school, you aren't fed up with it, are you?

150
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:05,887
No, it's not that.

151
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:13,127
You see, so far I haven't really been
interested in anything besides studying.

152
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,780
I'm regretting that a little.

153
00:12:17,428 --> 00:12:18,665
And so...

154
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:22,768
I'd like to do some traveling.

155
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:27,022
Oh my, did you hear that, Glen, my dear?

156
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:32,463
Waver just said something that sounded
exactly like something Alexey would say.

157
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:35,627
Anyway, there's a lot I'd have to do first,

158
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,708
and I'll need money to do it too.

159
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:41,101
For starters, I was thinking of finding a part‐time job.

160
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:44,198
And so, um,

161
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,243
to make a long story a lot shorter,

162
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,328
if you wouldn't mind too much,

163
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,441
could I possibly stay here until
I get everything worked out?

164
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:00,607
Of course you can, Waver, dear.

165
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,930
It will be so wonderful to have you
live here with us for a while longer.

166
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:07,193
We'll have to celebrate today.

167
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:16,375
Oh, look at this.

168
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:22,269
He was just a spirit, so I don't get how he
could've possibly left such a mess behind.

169
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,926
I really did want him to take me with him.

170
00:13:35,694 --> 00:13:39,378
I guess it basically means that I'm just not there yet.

171
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:40,741
I'm not ready.

172
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:51,658
He never even got the chance to open this.

173
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:52,946
Too bad.

174
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:09,910
A limited edition with an original t‐shirt.

175
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,542
Does anyone even want stuff like this?

176
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:16,808
What an idiot.

177
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:30,995
I know that my redeemer lives,

178
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:32,994
and that in the end,

179
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,585
he will stand upon the earth.

180
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,612
And though, after my skin worms destroy this body,

181
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:43,823
yet in my flesh shall I see God.

182
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:46,871
I myself will see him

183
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,341
with mine own eyes.

184
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:52,060
I am not another.

185
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:55,266
How my heart yearns within me.

186
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:57,406
Amen.

187
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:07,111
Rin, it was an excellent debut for the
young new head of the Tohsaka family.

188
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:11,168
Your late father would've been
very pleased with you today.

189
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:12,572
Well done.

190
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:17,863
You haven't quite grown fully
accustomed to your crest yet I see.

191
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:19,725
Does it hurt?

192
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:23,220
It's nothing, I'm fine.

193
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:27,572
It seems that Tokiomi's
preparations for you were flawless.

194
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:32,097
I imagine that all the magic the
Tohsaka family has accumulated, Rin,

195
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:34,581
will pass to you without incident.

196
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:39,308
Well, why don't you go and fetch your mother now?

197
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:41,886
Yes, I'll do that.

198
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:49,594
Come on, Mother, let's say our last goodbye to Father.

199
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:56,268
Rin, is it someone's funeral today?

200
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,406
That's right, Mother, Father died.

201
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:01,613
Oh dear.

202
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,729
Then I should take out Tokiomi's black suit.

203
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:10,131
Oh, and Rin, help Sakura get changed, will you?

204
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:15,724
My, what should I do?
I have to get myself ready to go too.

205
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,743
Goodness, dear, your necktie isn't on straight.

206
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,582
You need to look good.

207
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:27,752
After all, you're the father of Sakura and Rin.

208
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:33,310
I have to go away,
I'll be leaving Japan again for a while.

209
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:36,901
Do you have any immediate concerns?

210
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:40,298
None at all, I don't need your help for anything.

211
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,983
We will next meet six months from now.

212
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:46,891
At that time, I will conduct the
second crest transplantation.

213
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:50,554
Take care that you are in peak
physical condition when I return.

214
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:53,226
I know, you don't need to tell me.

215
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:58,765
Rin, you are now the head of the
Tohsaka family both in name and reality,

216
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,820
and to commemorate this day,

217
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,990
I'd like to offer you a very special gift.

218
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:07,993
An Azoth dagger.

219
00:17:08,712 --> 00:17:13,376
When my master acknowledged the results of
my training and declared it finally complete,

220
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:15,222
he presented this to me.

221
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:19,482
But given the circumstances,
I think you should have it.

222
00:17:21,131 --> 00:17:23,953
This was my father's?

223
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,639
I'm here again.

224
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:01,903
Everyone...

225
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:07,624
Lance... Lancelot.

226
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:17,970
Because I could not stop
myself from loving Guinevere,

227
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,836
I was never able to forgive myself.

228
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:26,718
But, King Arthur,

229
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:30,106
you never once spoke of my many sins.

230
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:33,428
You never sought atonement from me.

231
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:38,147
You simply continued to stand
before us in your righteousness.

232
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:41,157
But deep in my heart

233
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:43,854
I desired judgment at your hands.

234
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,209
Had your anger judged me,

235
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:48,622
had your righteousness condemned me,

236
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:56,112
I might not have fallen onto the path of madness,
and my quest to atone and save my immortal soul.

237
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,392
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

238
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:00,140
I...

239
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,510
I am unworthy.

240
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:07,072
But this much I can say with certainty.

241
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:09,253
King Arthur.

242
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:11,195
One day, friend,

243
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,692
I will claim the Grail.

244
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:18,504
You were the greatest of all kings who ever lived.

245
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:23,596
All of those at the Round Table who served you... 

246
00:19:24,055 --> 00:19:25,553
It was not I.

247
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:30,328
Felt the same as I did.

248
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:35,390
I shouldn't have been king.

249
00:19:43,237 --> 00:19:47,171
After that day,
I visited the Einzberns many times.

250
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:50,317
But as I had not returned with the Grail,

251
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:54,060
Jubstacheit never opened the forest's barrier for me.

252
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,565
And so, I never saw Ilya again.

253
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:05,850
However, I swore

254
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:10,420
that Ilyasviel would be the
final person I would ever lose.

255
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:15,498
My life was meant to be one solely of loss.

256
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,357
But everyone is still here,

257
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:21,033
just like when we met.

258
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:29,115
Once I was able, I adopted my son Shirou,

259
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:32,089
the little boy I saved that day.

260
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:34,950
Hey.

261
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:38,167
Hey, old man!

262
00:20:38,745 --> 00:20:39,213
Hm?

263
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,215
If you're so tired you're gonna fall asleep, go to bed!

264
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,483
Huh?

265
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,421
Right, I'm fine.

266
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,803
When I was little,

267
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:56,265
I really wanted to be a hero.

268
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,798
What are you talking about?

269
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,748
You don't want to anymore?

270
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:02,559
Did you just give up?

271
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:06,827
Yeah, unfortunately.

272
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:10,456
Seems that wish has an expiration date.

273
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:13,960
When you grow up, it's hard to call yourself one.

274
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,576
I wish I'd realized that sooner.

275
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:23,419
I see, well, guess there's nothing you can do about it.

276
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:26,740
Yeah, right.

277
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:28,248
I guess not.

278
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,999
It really is a nice moon tonight.

279
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:42,073
Fine, since you can't do it,

280
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:45,306
I'm gonna be a hero for you.

281
00:21:46,314 --> 00:21:46,689
Hm?

282
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:50,815
You're an adult now,
so you can't do it anymore, but I still can.

283
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,388
Just leave it to me.

284
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:56,583
I'll make it happen.

285
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:07,361
All right.

286
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:14,419
You do that.

287
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:17,909
I can rest easy now.

288
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:25,721
Tell me, Kerry, what do you wanna grow up to be?

289
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,681
Well...

290
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:32,391
what I wanna be

291
00:22:33,617 --> 00:22:34,486
is a hero.
