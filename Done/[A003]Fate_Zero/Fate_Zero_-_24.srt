1
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,154
Did you hate me?

2
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,047
Did you hate me so much that you became this?

3
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:36,242
Origin rounds. They cause the
target's mana to go out of control,

4
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,825
causing their body to rip itself apart.

5
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:41,427
What?

6
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:43,700
Time alter.

7
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,003
Double accel!

8
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:03,070
The origin rounds are working.

9
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,311
No, I understand.

10
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:09,521
He's using command seals as his mana source.

11
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,614
By the time the round strikes and takes effect,

12
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,575
the command seal mana source has already vanished.

13
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:20,227
Since he doesn't use his own magic circuits for attacks,

14
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:22,686
the origin rounds' magic won't work.

15
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:25,299
But if I can land a solid hit,

16
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:27,951
it'll still be strong enough to kill him.

17
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,436
Don't think you'll escape next time.

18
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,360
Now that I know you're moving at double speed,

19
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:38,956
I simply need to adjust the
distance to compensate for it.

20
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:53,415
He's fast!

21
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:14,271
The depth of your violent madness...

22
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:19,902
...is that my fault as well?

23
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:38,108
Is it?

24
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:41,758
Is it my fault?

25
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:02,623
Time alter, double accel.

26
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:54,258
I'm at a massive disadvantage at close range.

27
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,325
I've lost my Calico.

28
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:58,406
My Contender needs reloading.

29
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,419
However, Avalon.

30
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:11,642
He has healing ability that allows him to
instantly regenerate a demolished heart?

31
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,841
Well then, I'll have to destroy the brain.

32
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:18,225
But I can't use my right arm.

33
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:21,506
Avalon will even work on self‐inflicted wounds.

34
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:25,435
I have a knife I can use and two grenades left.

35
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:30,144
I have 12 blades remaining
and eight spare command seals.

36
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:31,615
Time alter.

37
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:33,730
Triple accel.

38
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:14,557
Time alter.

39
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,594
Square accel!

40
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:12,169
But, even so, I will win the Grail.

41
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:16,761
If I do not, there will be nothing I can do

42
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,687
to atone to you.

43
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:27,233
Even after all that has happened

44
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:29,997
you would still take up your sword

45
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:32,568
for a reason such as that?

46
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,568
What a difficult person you are.

47
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,520
Where am I?

48
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,653
I knew you would come, Kiritsugu.

49
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:12,460
I had faith that you would be
the one to reach this place.

50
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:15,220
Iri.

51
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:18,702
This is where the wish you
have lived for will be granted.

52
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:22,277
We are inside the Grail that you have been seeking.

53
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:29,000
That is the Holy Grail.

54
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:31,052
It has yet to take form,

55
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:34,067
but the vessel itself is more than filled.

56
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:37,195
All you need do now is offer it your prayer.

57
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:41,882
Only then will it be able to
go out into the physical world.

58
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:47,090
Now, please, hurry and give the Grail its form!

59
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:53,424
Kiritsugu, you have proven yourself more
than worthy to define its existence.

60
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:57,269
Who are you, really?

61
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,953
I am Irisviel, as you see.

62
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,766
No.

63
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,637
If the Grail is prepared to receive a wish,

64
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,375
then she is already...

65
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:08,643
Answer me!

66
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:10,516
It's true.

67
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:13,798
I will not deny that this is no more than a mask.

68
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:19,625
You see, unless I use a
preexisting personality as a shell,

69
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,053
I cannot communicate with others.

70
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:25,910
However, the personality of Irisviel that I recorded

71
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:28,005
is undeniably the real thing.

72
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:33,050
And so I have inherited the last
wish that Irisviel held in her heart.

73
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,687
Are you the will of the Holy Grail?

74
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:39,955
I am, that interpretation is not incorrect.

75
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:43,549
I have my own will and my own wish.

76
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:46,499
I have the will to be born into the world.

77
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:47,814
No way.

78
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,111
If that's the case, then how does the Grail

79
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:53,560
intend to totally fulfill my wish?

80
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:57,269
Well, Kiritsugu, that is something

81
00:10:58,022 --> 00:10:59,957
that you should know far better

82
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:02,037
than anyone else could possibly know.

83
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:02,938
What?

84
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,455
You learned exactly how to save the world

85
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,557
a long, long time ago.

86
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,383
So I will do exactly as you always did...

87
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,879
to carry out your will and to
ultimately answer your prayer.

88
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:19,167
What are you talking about?

89
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:22,637
I have no choice.

90
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:28,265
The only way is to have you go and explore
that same question through your inner self.

91
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,300
This is...

92
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,439
Three hundred are on one ship,

93
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:42,934
200 on another.

94
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:44,837
What the...

95
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:49,263
hundred total Five passengers and
crew, plus Kiritsugu Emiya.

96
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:52,917
Let's assume that these 501 people

97
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:55,137
are humanity's last survivors.

98
00:11:56,217 --> 00:12:00,010
Giant holes simultaneously open
up in both ships, crippling them.

99
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,974
Kiritsugu alone has the skills needed to repair a ship.

100
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:08,611
Now then, which one of the
ships would you choose to fix?

101
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:12,827
Simple... the one holding 300 people.

102
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:14,986
As soon as you make that decision,

103
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:17,830
the 200 passengers on the other ship

104
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,169
kidnap you and take you prisoner.

105
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:23,626
They demand that you fix their ship first.

106
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,370
What will you do?

107
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:28,053
I would...

108
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:58,134
You would kill all 200 passengers.

109
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,777
That is correct, that is the Kiritsugu Emiya we know.

110
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:10,561
Next, the surviving 300 passengers
abandon their damaged craft.

111
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:14,506
They split themselves between two
new ships and continue their journey.

112
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:17,690
This time, there are 200 on one,

113
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,460
and 100 on the other.

114
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:23,881
But again, holes open the hulls of both ships

115
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,721
at exactly the same time.

116
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:27,896
Wait.

117
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:30,742
The hundred in the smaller ship take you prisoner,

118
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,930
and like the others,
demand that you fix their ship first.

119
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,364
Now what will you do?

120
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:39,248
You already know, but you...

121
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:58,304
Yes, you made the right decision.

122
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:00,522
No, that's impossible!

123
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,139
How can that be the right decision?

124
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,544
Two hundred survived, but 300 died so they could live.

125
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:08,870
The scales are tipped the wrong way!

126
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,898
No, your calculations were correct.

127
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:15,750
You made a choice to sacrifice the few to save the many.

128
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:19,436
Isn't that right, Kiritsugu Emiya?

129
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:24,086
You have consistently chosen to kill
those in the lighter side of the scales,

130
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,180
even if it meant leaving a long trail
of bodies behind you in your wake.

131
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:32,019
If it saved lives, the lives of the saved

132
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:34,541
must've been worth more than those you destroyed.

133
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:38,835
This...

134
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:41,430
this is what you wanted to show me?

135
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:44,002
Yes, this is your truth.

136
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,188
The answer that lies within Kiritsugu Emiya.

137
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,308
The course of action that should be taken by the Grail

138
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,168
as an all‐powerful wish‐granter.

139
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:52,887
No.

140
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:55,084
No, this is not what I want!

141
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:58,290
I want there to be another way to save the world.

142
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,176
That's why I believed

143
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,404
that a miracle was my only hope.

144
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:05,512
Your wish cannot include

145
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,307
a method you yourself don't already know.

146
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,848
If your wish is the save the world,

147
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:15,394
it must be done in a manner
that you can fully comprehend.

148
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:16,736
Like hell!

149
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,822
How in the hell can you call that a miracle?

150
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:23,142
But it is.

151
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:27,035
The deed you tried so hard to accomplish

152
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,157
and failed to do on your own

153
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:33,060
can be accomplished on a scale
beyond the power of any man.

154
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:36,619
If that is not a miracle, what is?

155
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,441
Father.

156
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:52,780
Natalia.

157
00:15:56,606 --> 00:15:57,983
Kiritsugu Emiya.

158
00:15:58,337 --> 00:16:00,731
You truly are Angra Mainyu...

159
00:16:01,478 --> 00:16:04,815
the one worthy to bear all the evil in the world.

160
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:08,312
Now, the final question.

161
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:12,852
Three remain.

162
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:20,301
Will you save two or choose one?

163
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:33,966
Welcome home, Daddy!

164
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:38,231
Oh, I'm so happy that you're finally back!

165
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,146
You understand now, right?

166
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:47,296
This is all the Holy Grail granting
your heart's fervent prayer.

167
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,949
All you need do now is to wish for it,

168
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:58,266
to bring back your wife, to take back your daughter.

169
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:10,453
I won't be able to go looking
for chestnuts with you anymore.

170
00:17:11,473 --> 00:17:13,679
It's okay, don't worry about it!

171
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:17,507
I'll be happy just as long as you
and Mother are with me from now on.

172
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,711
Thank you.

173
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:22,923
Daddy loves you, my precious Ilya.

174
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,920
If nothing else, I swear that's true.

175
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:34,728
Goodbye, Ilya.

176
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,453
Ilya!

177
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,517
Ilya!

178
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:41,962
Ilya, Ilya!

179
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:43,535
Ilya!

180
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,860
Ilya.

181
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,782
But why?

182
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:49,705
Why would you do this?

183
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,565
My love, you killed our Ilya!

184
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:00,300
My love...

185
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,095
why?

186
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:08,869
Why do you...refuse us...

187
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,022
and the Grail?

188
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,185
Six billion people on the Earth.

189
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:18,366
I...

190
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:19,988
curse you...

191
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:23,798
Kiritsugu Emiya.

192
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,933
Versus you two.

193
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:29,701
Angra Mainyu curses you.

194
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,732
That's why.

195
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:33,436
You'll suffer...

196
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:34,287
That's why...

197
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:35,258
...till the day you die.

198
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:37,232
... I have to kill you.

199
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:39,220
I will...

200
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,151
And I will save...

201
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:43,265
the world.

202
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:44,995
Never forget...

203
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,243
What a boring conclusion to this fight.

204
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:17,731
Why did you refuse it?

205
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,284
You were able to see all that?

206
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:26,344
I thought you sacrificed everything you had including
your family in order to make it to this point.

207
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:31,329
How can you simply deny the worth of
something you worked so hard to attain?

208
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:34,873
It's so foolish, I cannot understand it.

209
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,836
The tremendous toll it demands

210
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,025
is far greater than anything it can offer.

211
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,228
That's the simple truth.

212
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:47,249
That thing is no omnipotent wish‐granter.

213
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:49,353
Then give the damn thing to me!

214
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,444
You may not think you need it,

215
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,708
but I most certainly do.

216
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:57,755
If it... if it is given the life it is seeking,

217
00:19:58,314 --> 00:20:00,443
then it can surely answer my every doubt

218
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,923
and finally bring everything into clarity.

219
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:05,599
The Grail longs for a life of its own,

220
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:07,346
longs for its own birth!

221
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:10,373
Please, don't kill it,

222
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,590
it's...

223
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:21,599
No, you are the fool I can't understand.

224
00:20:31,724 --> 00:20:33,549
Oh, Iris, you...

225
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,529
You're late, Saber!

226
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:41,346
I realized you were enjoying
yourself with your old Mad Dog,

227
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:45,374
but it is imprudent to the extreme
to keep me waiting like you did.

228
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:46,617
Archer.

229
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:50,624
Look at that delightful expression,

230
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,488
like that of a ravenous wild dog.

231
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:56,207
Get out of my way.

232
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,475
You haven't won.

233
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:01,698
The Holy Grail belongs to me!

234
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:09,385
Dear Saber, it is when you are
delusional and crawling in the dirt

235
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:12,837
that you are at your most beautiful.

236
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,661
Lay down your blade and be my wife.

237
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:20,735
A Grail that grants miracles?

238
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:25,265
Where is the sense in totally
obsessing over something so dubious?

239
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:30,510
Abandon these foolish ideals and childish vows of yours.

240
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:34,335
From now on, seek only me and
devote yourself to me alone.

241
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:38,600
If you do, I swear as King of All Creation

242
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:42,404
that I shall give you every
pleasure the world has to offer.

243
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:47,327
You would steal the Holy Grail from me

244
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:49,722
for such utter nonsense?

245
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:55,713
I was not asking for your opinion.

246
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,604
I am informing you of my decision.

247
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:02,555
Now, let us hear your response.

248
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,429
I refuse.

249
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:06,193
I would never...

250
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,985
Shyness has left you at a loss for words, I see.

251
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:11,311
That's fine.

252
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:14,375
You may answer wrongly as many times as you like.

253
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,812
If you would learn the joy of serving me,

254
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:20,570
you must first learn the exquisite pain of it as well.

255
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,696
Kiritsugu!

256
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:37,437
Ah, then you have finally made your decision.

257
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:40,123
In the name of Kiritsugu Emiya,

258
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:42,415
and by my command seal...

259
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,301
Give me the Holy Grail.

260
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:48,460
...I order you, use your Noble Phantasm.

261
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:51,036
Destroy the Grail.

262
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:57,508
Impossible... what are you doing, Saber!

263
00:22:58,672 --> 00:22:59,617
No!

264
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,069
By my third command seal,

265
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,490
I order you again.

266
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:08,841
But why, Kiritsugu...  you of all people?

267
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:09,833
Why this?

268
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:11,200
Damn you to Hell.

269
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,754
You dare interrupt my nuptials?

270
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:14,821
Mongrel!

271
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:17,240
Saber, destroy...

272
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:20,394
Stop!

273
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:21,653
...the Holy Grail.
