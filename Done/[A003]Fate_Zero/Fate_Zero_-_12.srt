1
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:04,395
What of Rider's Noble Phantasm?

2
00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:08,657
Equal to that of Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,789
In other words,

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,237
too powerful to be given a rank.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,115
Hmm.

6
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:17,029
It all ended exactly as we planned.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,110
If we'd gone against Rider without
this new knowledge and unprepared,

8
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:25,556
we would not have been able to
defend ourselves against him.

9
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:42,968
This will begin the second stage.

10
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:46,363
We will use the information Assassin gathered for us

11
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:48,765
to have Archer defeat our enemies

12
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:53,463
and in the process,
discover the means to defeat Rider.

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,185
Yes.

14
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,930
Thank you for your fine work as a Master.

15
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:33,649
It is my belief that last night's attack

16
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,312
involved all of the existing Assassins.

17
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,094
Understood.

18
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:39,571
By the way, Maiya,

19
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:42,164
where are we with our new base of operations?

20
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,157
Tomorrow morning.

21
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:45,265
I will take Saber and madam there.

22
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,699
Good, thank you.

23
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:48,333
Of course, goodbye.

24
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,834
No sign of movement at the Tohsaka residence.

25
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,635
Since Assassin's attack on the very first day,

26
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,600
Tokiomi hasn't left the building.

27
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,052
An unsettling silence.

28
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:20,222
Matou Master appears undefended,

29
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:21,695
an easy target.

30
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:22,968
But...

31
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:30,605
Berserker's strange special ability

32
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,434
suggests that he should be left alive

33
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,113
to distract Archer and Tohsaka.

34
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:40,329
Lord El‐Melloi should have been
removed from battle already.

35
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,482
But Lancer still remains.

36
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:45,306
We must discover his new Master's identity

37
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,436
as soon as humanly possible.

38
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,408
Caster's location remains unknown.

39
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,120
But last night several children
vanished from this city again.

40
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:59,524
They continue their atrocities
with no apparent plan whatsoever.

41
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,724
Rider and his Master are constantly on the move.

42
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:06,715
Tracking him is difficult.

43
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:09,267
However large‐hearted he may seem,

44
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:10,771
he is a dangerous foe.

45
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:16,212
Furthermore, I'm quite concerned about
the Ionioin Hetairoi that Maiya reported.

46
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:20,820
But more importantly...

47
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:24,650
Is it safe to assume that Assassin
has been completely destroyed?

48
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:28,849
In that case, his Master...

49
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,827
If his plan was to work with Tohsaka,
using Assassin to spy on the others,

50
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:44,966
then he should have never been
able to leave Fuyuki Church.

51
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,101
But that isn't what happened.

52
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,518
His ambush at the Fuyuki Hyatt,

53
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,780
his attack in the Einzbern Forest,

54
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:54,466
both actions defy explanation.

55
00:04:56,499 --> 00:05:00,002
Of course it all fits assuming he was after me.

56
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,770
But why, why pursue me?

57
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:09,075
Two days ago, he should have had no way of
knowing for certain that I am Saber's Master.

58
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:16,662
Kirei Kotomine, who are you?

59
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,077
You seem to be in rather fine sprits today, Archer.

60
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:34,160
I still see little value to this Grail.

61
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:37,328
But even if it is trash, that's fine.

62
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,860
It seems I found another form of pleasure.

63
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:45,817
Here in this world that you've constantly
mocked for being vile and full of imposters.

64
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:47,774
That remains unchanged.

65
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:52,808
However, I am now curious to see this
Holy Grail War through to its end.

66
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,507
I am fond of lives full of hubris.

67
00:05:57,275 --> 00:06:00,787
Those who harbor grand ambitions
but are unequal to the task.

68
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:04,531
The mere sight of such people
gives me great enjoyment.

69
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,246
There are two kinds of arrogance,

70
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:12,104
one where you are unequal to the task
and one where your dreams are too big.

71
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,636
The former is just commonplace stupidity.

72
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:19,529
But the latter is a rare
species, difficult to find.

73
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:23,568
But they are identical in that
both kinds are fools, are they not?

74
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:30,763
Isn't the foolishness of the few a more precious
commodity than the wisdom of the masses?

75
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,852
There are those that are born human,

76
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,872
but harbor wishes that man was not meant for

77
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:38,537
and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit.

78
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,152
I simply never grow weary

79
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:44,001
of watching their grief and despair.

80
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,724
Kirei, what of you today?

81
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,316
For once, you seem almost strangely pleased.

82
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,457
I'm simply relieved.

83
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:59,505
I've finally been freed from a most unpleasant burden.

84
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:03,037
What becomes of the Command Seals once they disappear?

85
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:04,886
According to theory,

86
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:07,796
Command Seals ultimately return to the Grail.

87
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:13,409
And the Holy Grail repossesses the unused Command
Seals from any Master who has lost his Servant

88
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,573
and has withdrawn from the war.

89
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,236
Also, if for whatever reason a Servant loses its Master,

90
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,740
the Grail will give those
seals to a newly chosen Master,

91
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:26,726
assuming one can be found
before the war is over.

92
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:30,353
The Command Seals stay a part
of this world until their use.

93
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:35,472
At the end, any remaining seals are
given to the overseer for safe keeping.

94
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,707
So, depending on what happens now,

95
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:42,272
a new Master may yet appear and
enter the fight for the Grail.

96
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:43,365
Possibly.

97
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:48,353
But the Holy Grail does not deem many
on this Earth to be worthy of that role.

98
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:51,718
Thus, when a replacement Master is sought,

99
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:56,102
the Grail tends to select one of those
whom it had previously considered

100
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:58,777
and deemed suitable for participation.

101
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,683
What's the matter, continue with your talk.

102
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:04,673
Go on.

103
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:10,861
There is an unspoken reason that the Holy church
gives asylum and protection to those Masters

104
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,252
who have left the war.

105
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,889
In the event a place should open
among the remaining Masters,

106
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:21,515
there's a high probability that any unpaired
Masters will receive the Command Seals left behind.

107
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:25,561
This is why Grail War Masters try to kill

108
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:30,120
rather than injure or temporarily
incapacitate enemy Masters.

109
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,358
Well, then from that perspective,

110
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,569
is there not a good chance that the
Command Seals will be given to you again?

111
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,241
Impossible.

112
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,778
If as Tokiomi has always suggested,
the Holy Grail only chose me

113
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:46,522
as a support mage to the Tohsaka team.

114
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,822
I have fulfilled that duty and am finished.

115
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:55,981
Tokiomi already possesses a winning strategy for
dealing with the remaining Masters and their Servants.

116
00:08:57,357 --> 00:08:59,577
There is simply nothing more for me to do.

117
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,286
If I may opine,

118
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,561
Tokiomi's hypotheses have been dubious from the start.

119
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:09,899
He has never struck me as a man truly fit to be
backed by the power and prestige of the Grail.

120
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:15,449
I must say, I am surprised that you have such
harsh words to offer regarding your own Master.

121
00:09:15,731 --> 00:09:21,371
Kirei, you seem to be mistaken as to who
serves whom in my relationship with Tokiomi.

122
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:24,590
He is treated civilly as my vassal.

123
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:27,574
And he supplies me with mana as an offering.

124
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:32,515
I answered his summons precisely because
those were the terms of our pact.

125
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,412
I'm curious, what do you make of the Command Seals then?

126
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:41,605
I hate them, but if a vassal is
trying to become a better vassal,

127
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:45,824
I don't mind listening to a differing
opinion or two from time to time.

128
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:52,437
By the way, Kirei, you mentioned earlier that Assassin
had fulfilled all his missions before he was destroyed.

129
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,552
What of the matter we discussed?

130
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:58,967
You mean your interest in learning the
motives of each Master for desiring the Grail?

131
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,989
Yes, they completed that investigation.

132
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:05,853
I should have had an Assassin present
the report to you in person last night.

133
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,329
That would have saved me the trouble of having to...

134
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:10,083
No, this is better.

135
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,916
I'm not interested in what
that walking shade has to say.

136
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:19,538
Kirei, this report is meaningless to me
unless it comes directly from your lips.

137
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:22,155
Hmm.

138
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:32,357
How does it feel to drive a car, Saber?

139
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:33,372
Do you like it?

140
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:35,737
Yes, I think this is a splendid vehicle.

141
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:39,677
I can not help but wonder what would have
happened had these existed back in my time.

142
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:44,618
Irisviel, are you certain it is all
right with you that I drive this vehicle?

143
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:48,834
You seemed to thoroughly enjoy the act of
driving when we were out the other night.

144
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:50,369
No, this is fine.

145
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:53,624
If you're happy driving the
car then I'm happy, too.

146
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:57,653
I have to say, the skills of a
Servant are absolutely amazing.

147
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,283
This is your first time touching this machine,

148
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,255
yet you're driving it perfectly.

149
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:05,873
Oh, thank you, but I'm finding
the sensation somewhat odd.

150
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:11,133
It's like I'm employing skills I was taught a long
time ago that were buried deep within my memory.

151
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:16,164
Rather than understanding it intellectually,
my body instinctively knows what to do next.

152
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:22,223
Still, do you really think this is a wise idea?

153
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,152
The estate that is to be our new base of operations

154
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,853
lies precisely in the heart of the main battlefield.

155
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,628
Don't you worry about that.

156
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:33,072
Because secrecy is the hallmark of the Grail War,

157
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:37,257
the Tohsakas and Matous have openly
established fortifications in the city.

158
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:42,182
The Einzberns are unusual for building
that castle in such a distant location.

159
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:46,432
On the contrary, this new base that Kiritsugu
has secured might be more advantageous

160
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:51,155
than the castle we'd been using because
its location is unknown to the others.

161
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:05,653
It's another very unusual building.

162
00:12:06,382 --> 00:12:09,839
From now on, this place will be your base of operations.

163
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,774
Ah, if you can take those for me, Saber.

164
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:15,125
Yes, of course I can, Irisviel.

165
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,445
Maiya, what does this key open?

166
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:26,300
It appears quite different from the others.

167
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,340
It's for the storehouse in the yard.

168
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:32,414
It's fairly old, but I've
confirmed that is is solidly built.

169
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:35,253
There was really no time for preparations,

170
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:38,647
so this may be somewhat lacking as a proper residence.

171
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:44,135
That's fine... for now so long as it keeps
us out of the rain, that's sufficient.

172
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:55,254
Now then, come on, Saber,
let's go and explore our new place.

173
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:56,949
Yes, let's.

174
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:02,743
I think this is like one of
this country's haunted houses.

175
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,615
I'm sure all the hallways have wooden
floors and the room's floors are woven grass

176
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:10,223
with nice partitions made of paper.

177
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:15,108
I told him once I wanted to see a Japanese mansion.

178
00:13:15,468 --> 00:13:18,103
Maybe Kiritsugu remembered I said that.

179
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:32,080
Is our new base of operations not what you expected?

180
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:38,765
No, it's not that, I like it well enough,
but this isn't really an ideal base for a mage.

181
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:41,680
There are a few things that could be better.

182
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:46,152
The magical barriers are well laid
out, but for a workshop it's...

183
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,577
well, when it's this open to the outside,
the magic has lots of ways to leak out.

184
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:55,510
I would have preferred a more secure
room walled off with stone or clay.

185
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,911
Ah, this is ideal!

186
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:10,569
It's a bit small,

187
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:15,361
but I'm sure I can craft my spells in here
just as well as I did back at the castle.

188
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,903
Perfect.

189
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,133
Inscribing the magic circle here should
be good enough to make it my own.

190
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,573
All right then, let's get started, shall we?

191
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,371
There's a lot of work to do.

192
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:27,911
Will you help me, Saber?

193
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:31,583
We'll draw a magic circle right
there, six feet in diameter.

194
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:32,333
Right.

195
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,815
I'll need your help most once
we start to craft the mercury.

196
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:38,779
And don't worry,
I'll tell you exactly how to do it.

197
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,872
Will you do me a favor?

198
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:44,168
Could you bring in the ingredients
we left out in the trunk?

199
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:48,354
Irisviel, I must ask you something.

200
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,508
It seems all day today, you've acted as if
you've been carefully avoiding touching anything.

201
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:55,952
Have I been imagining this?

202
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,212
Driving the car, holding the keys.

203
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,790
Those matters by themselves would
not have caused me to worry,

204
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:07,884
but now it is beginning to appear as if you're
not even going to handle your own magic.

205
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:11,774
If you were not feeling well today,

206
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:14,436
it is important that you tell me about it.

207
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:19,385
It is my duty to ensure your
safety whenever it is necessary.

208
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,449
So I must know if anything is wrong.

209
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,310
You're absolutely right, I'm sorry.

210
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,344
I couldn't keep this hidden
for very long anyway.

211
00:15:33,822 --> 00:15:34,662
Your hand?

212
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:45,830
Saber, I'm going to squeeze your hand as hard
as I can using all the strength I can, okay?

213
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,728
All right, go ahead.

214
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:55,616
Irisviel?

215
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,333
Are you sure you are not pretending.

216
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,986
I know it's weak, but this is all I can do right now.

217
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:05,804
Just touching your fingers is the most I can manage.

218
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:09,428
Grasping something or
picking it up is beyond me.

219
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:12,536
Dressing this morning was so difficult.

220
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,990
But, but what is the matter with you?

221
00:16:18,463 --> 00:16:19,569
Have you been injured?

222
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:22,195
No, I'm just not feeling too well.

223
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,337
So I've disabled my sense of touch.

224
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:28,927
Just shutting down one of my senses
allows me to control my power quite a bit

225
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:32,619
and it means that I can continue
to do everything else I must.

226
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:37,026
Being able to do things like this
is the specialty of a homunculus.

227
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,945
But Irisviel, that simply can not be all there is to it.

228
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:44,538
What exactly is wrong with you?
Should you not go see a doctor?

229
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,466
What if it's serious?

230
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:52,300
Perhaps you may have forgotten, Saber,
but I am not in any way a normal human being.

231
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:57,210
If I happen to catch a cold,
I can't even go to the clinic like everyone else does.

232
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:02,901
I suppose you could say my condition stems
from an inherent flaw in my creation.

233
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,332
Don't worry about it.

234
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:09,955
Of course what this means is I'm going to
need for you to do a few things for me.

235
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,163
From now on, I'll need you to
drive the car like you did today.

236
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:17,963
And you'll have to help me set up
and perform my magical rituals.

237
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:22,302
I'm sorry, but I'll be depending on you,

238
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:24,012
my brave and gallant knight.

239
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:25,858
Yes, I'll help.

240
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:29,889
I apologize for prying into the
details of your private life.

241
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,346
Forgive me.

242
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:32,814
It's really okay.

243
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:36,993
Now, why don't we get started on
that circle before it gets too late.

244
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,630
If I rest in a magic circle that's
connected to local lay lines,

245
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,240
my condition will improve.

246
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,366
At least it should start to a little bit.

247
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:45,646
Understood.

248
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:48,014
Then I shall retrieve the materials right away.

249
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:58,123
With regards to Lancer's Master and Ryder's
Master, they appear to have no wish in particular

250
00:17:58,182 --> 00:18:01,717
that they plan to ask for should
they happen to win the Holy Grail.

251
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,162
They simply seek victory as a
means to win glory as mages.

252
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:09,122
Now then, as for Caster's Master,

253
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:12,341
he seems to have no real
understanding as to what the Grail is.

254
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:18,129
He is only taking part in the Holy Grail War
as an extension of his interest in killing for fun.

255
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:24,901
Regarding Berserker's Master, he is immature and
seeks a measure of absolution above all else.

256
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,936
For a time, he had severed all
ties with the Matou family,

257
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:33,897
yet he is now demanding that the family set free
the younger Tohsaka daughter whom they adopted.

258
00:18:34,121 --> 00:18:38,218
She is currently being groomed to be the
next head of the Matou family in his place.

259
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:44,250
He has been given the assignment of winning the Holy
Grail to secure his end of a bargain for her release.

260
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:49,839
In addition, he appears to have a
past relationship with Tohsaka's wife.

261
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:55,133
In a sense, it might be said that between
all of the five competing Masters,

262
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,448
he has the most unrefined and
banal motives of them all.

263
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,060
What is it?

264
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:03,813
Continue, Kirei.

265
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:06,374
It's Saber's Master.

266
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:13,945
Hmm.

267
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,214
He is merely a hired mercenary

268
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:21,906
retained by the Einzberns to achieve their
long‐held dream of attaining the Grail.

269
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:24,996
I was a fool to expect more from him, hmm.

270
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:27,188
What an utter disappointment.

271
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:30,990
It seems he turned out to be just another mongrel.

272
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:35,486
With dull and stupid reasons for
seeking out and stealing my treasure.

273
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:37,676
Exactly like all the rest of them.

274
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:44,046
You cause me to go to all that trouble
investigating and that is all you have to say?

275
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:46,853
Think of those whose effort has been wasted on you.

276
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,082
Wasted effort?

277
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:50,103
What wasted effort?

278
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:52,508
The work put in by you and Assassin

279
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:54,498
has paid off rather handsomely.

280
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:57,724
Are you mocking me, King of Heroes?

281
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,194
Is that it?

282
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:00,861
You don't understand.

283
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:02,678
That's to be expected.

284
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:07,132
You are an obtuse man who can
not even recognize his own joy.

285
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:13,166
Regardless of its self awareness of this fact,
a soul instinctively seeks out joy in its life.

286
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:17,723
This expression of the soul appears in
the form of interest or appreciation.

287
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:24,339
Thus, Kirei, having you tell me what you've seen and
heard was of great interest and importance to me.

288
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:27,149
And was very instructive, indeed.

289
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:30,217
What you spoke about at the greatest length

290
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:33,434
was what actually interested you the most.

291
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:39,693
For now, let us just set aside the man
you've deliberately avoided speaking about.

292
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,462
A conscious interest is no more than a simple obsession.

293
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:48,222
That being the case,
of the remaining four Masters in the war,

294
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,539
of which one did you
speak about most passionately?

295
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:54,682
Berserker's Master.

296
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:56,451
Kariya, was it?

297
00:20:57,741 --> 00:21:02,786
Kirei, when you told me about him you
spoke of his motivations in great detail.

298
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,209
His circumstances are complicated.

299
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:10,679
Thus they required the most detailed
explanation out of all of them.

300
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,263
Hmm, you are wrong.

301
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:17,303
He was the only one you ordered Assassin to
investigate to a thorough enough degree such that

302
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:19,679
you can understand
those circumstances.

303
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:22,967
And this was due to your unconscious interest in him.

304
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:27,761
I accept that I made an error in judgment.

305
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:32,043
It's true that in the long term,
Kariya Matou poses no threat.

306
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:33,908
He was not worth the attention.

307
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:40,591
My overestimation of his abilities has invited
your unnecessary speculations about me.

308
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:42,537
Is that so?

309
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:45,893
Then imagine for me a scenario
in which chance and fortune

310
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:51,419
ensure that Berserker and his Master survive the
many battles and lasted until the end of the war.

311
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,881
Can you imagine what would happen then?

312
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:55,400
What do you think?

313
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:05,841
Listen, Kirei.

314
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,348
Is it not time that you finally understood

315
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,479
the actual question that I am asking you?

316
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:23,383
Tell me, Archer, what could possibly be the
point in imagining Kariya Matou's victory?

317
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:24,723
No point.

318
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:26,707
There is no point at all.

319
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:30,790
Come now, don't be so angry with me.

320
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,372
Think about it for a moment.

321
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:37,902
The fact that Kirei Kotomine never recognized
the futility in such a speculation.

322
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:42,273
Do you not agree there is a
clear, unshakable meaning here?

323
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,238
Explain for me, Archer.

324
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:48,717
It is like this.

325
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:52,844
If you had been given the same question
but regarding the other Masters,

326
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:58,296
you would have perceived that there is no point to
it and you would have rejected it as a waste of time.

327
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:02,472
However, that was not how it went with Kariya.

328
00:23:02,978 --> 00:23:08,137
For him, you abandoned your usual sharp wits
and wasted your time in pointless thought.

329
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:10,412
You ignored the futility

330
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:15,588
and the waste of effort,
you found enjoyment in the exercise.

331
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:21,753
Celebrate, Kirei, you have finally
understood what pleasure is at long last.

332
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,065
Pleasure, are you talking about joy?

333
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:26,467
Indeed.

334
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:33,571
There is nothing in Kariya Matou's
fate that could bring a man any joy.

335
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:38,316
His tortured life is nothing but an
endless string of suffering and tragedy.

336
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:43,528
For him, a quick and unexpected
death would actually be a blessing.

337
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,646
Kirei, why must you define joy so narrowly?

338
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:52,835
Where is the paradox in finding suffering
and tragedy simply other forms of joy?

339
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:55,676
There is no one fixed type of joy.

340
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,986
You are confused because
you fail to understand that.

341
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:01,406
This is something that can not be allowed!

342
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:06,630
King of Heroes,
a sick and human monster such as yourself

343
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:10,185
may find joy in some small
amount of another's pain.

344
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:15,341
But that is the soul of a Godless sinner!
An evil that must be punished!

345
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:20,138
Thus, I have sworn to follow the
path of pure faith in my life.

346
00:24:20,971 --> 00:24:24,168
And so you have defined joy itself as a sin.

347
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:27,918
It's astonishing to see how far you've twisted it.

348
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:30,593
You never cease to be a source of fascination.

349
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:31,793
Delightful.

350
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:37,571
This pain.

351
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:40,548
Aarrgh.

352
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:44,878
Ah, exactly as I expected.

353
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:48,292
I must admit that did not take very long at all.

354
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:50,133
Impossible.

355
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,675
This can't be, no Servant has
been freed from their pact.

356
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:57,063
Why has the Holy Grail chosen a new Master?

357
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:59,118
It appears that the Holy Grail

358
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:03,150
still expects much more from Kirei Kotomine in this war.

359
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:07,231
Kirei, you should go and heed the Grail's summons.

360
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:12,858
Without a doubt, you have some hidden
reason to seek this mystical wish granter.

361
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:15,708
I have a reason to seek the Grail?

362
00:25:16,294 --> 00:25:19,605
If this wish granting device is truly omnipotent,

363
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:25,270
then it can give shape and substance to the wish
that lies within the darkest depths of your heart.

364
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,982
A wish of which even you remain unaware.

365
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,401
So you claim that since I do not know my desire,

366
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:37,901
I should use the wish granting device
as a means to learn what it is?

367
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:39,967
That can only happen

368
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:45,255
if I enter the war as an independent mage
and systematically crush six other wishes.

369
00:25:45,482 --> 00:25:49,145
If I selfishly seek possession
of the Grail for my own desires,

370
00:25:49,358 --> 00:25:55,138
that means that I will have ruthlessly
betrayed my own teacher and mentor.

371
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:59,284
Then you will need to have a strong
Servant on your side to fight for you.

372
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:01,813
If you would seek to do battle against me.

373
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:06,184
Of course before any of that,
you must steal a new Servant for yourself.

374
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:10,408
One already summoned and controlled
by one of the other Masters.

375
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:16,315
In that case...  no, I won't say it.

376
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:19,953
Everything from this point forward is up to you.

377
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:23,703
Do it all exactly as you desire.

378
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,728
That is the true meaning of pleasure.

379
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:29,578
Pleasure leads to the experience of joy.

380
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:32,668
And joy will lead you to happiness.

381
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:35,900
Your path is now clear, Kirei.

382
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:40,425
So clear there is no longer any need to hesitate.
