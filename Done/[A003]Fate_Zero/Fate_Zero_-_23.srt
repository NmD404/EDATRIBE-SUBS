1
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,793
Rider, over there.

2
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:38,154
Are you scared, boy?

3
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:40,856
Yeah, I'm scared.

4
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:44,504
I'm wondering if this is what you mean

5
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:47,141
when you say that your heart is dancing.

6
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:52,075
Hm, it seems you're finally starting to understand.

7
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:02,314
The enemy is inside.

8
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:25,438
Berserker?

9
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:04,693
Are they having a party here?

10
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:07,612
Where is that little chariot of yours?

11
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:10,896
Well, the thing is,

12
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:14,899
I'm embarrassed to say I lost it to Saber in a battle.

13
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:17,663
Did you forget my decision?

14
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:22,432
I believe I told you that I would fight and
defeat you when you were at full strength.

15
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,590
True, the weapons at my disposal are somewhat depleted.

16
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:33,063
However, Iskandar tonight is less than perfect,
and thus, is far greater than perfection itself.

17
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,671
So I see.

18
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:39,006
Indeed the aura that is emanating from you

19
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,043
is unusually potent.

20
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:47,985
It appears you have come before me actually
believing that you have a chance of victory.

21
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:49,598
Hm.

22
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:01,745
King of Babylonia, a final word.

23
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:04,207
Our banquet's last question.

24
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,050
I shall allow it, speak.

25
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,999
Well, this is purely hypothetical of course,

26
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:13,346
but were my Ionioi Hetairoi
armed with your Gate of Babylon,

27
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:16,861
it would create the most powerful army imaginable.

28
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:18,745
Hm, so?

29
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:22,970
Why would you not ally yourself with me?

30
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:28,240
The two of us together could conquer the
universe and beyond if we desired it.

31
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:34,594
You never cease to amuse me, mongrel.

32
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:40,238
It has been ages since I laughed so hard at
gibberish spouted by one who is not a fool.

33
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:47,814
But unfortunately, I have had one comrade
and he is all I ever intend to have.

34
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:51,471
Furthermore, there is no need for there to be two kings.

35
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:54,330
The lonely path of kingship, eh?

36
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:56,654
With all respect due to a king,

37
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:59,886
I shall challenge your strong unwavering spirit.

38
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:03,423
Very well, show me what you think you can do,

39
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:04,782
King of Conquerors.

40
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:09,112
You are a usurper truly worthy of my judgment.

41
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:25,494
Are you guys actually friends with each other?

42
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:28,244
I could hardly be unfriendly to him.

43
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:33,931
After all, he may very well
be the last person I ever see.

44
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,122
Don't be stupid, you're not gonna be killed here today.

45
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:41,552
I won't allow it!

46
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:43,595
Have you forgotten my command seal?

47
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:48,149
You are right, ha.

48
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:50,252
You are exactly right.

49
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:57,008
Gather here, my glorious comrades!

50
00:05:57,353 --> 00:06:02,173
Tonight we shall become the
greatest legends in all of eternity!

51
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,855
Our enemy is the mighty King of Heroes,

52
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:22,527
a most worthy opponent.

53
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:26,351
My warriors, let us show the first heroic spirit

54
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:29,701
our noble path of ultimate conquest!

55
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:47,278
Come to me, Lord of Conquering armies.

56
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:51,635
Now you will be privileged to
behold the sight of a true king.

57
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:45,725
Why are you suffering so much?

58
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:49,824
Because of Berserker.

59
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:52,030
He must fight a battle right now,

60
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:53,680
and needs mana.

61
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:55,353
Why?

62
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:59,837
Because that priest said so.

63
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:02,863
That priest?

64
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,997
Yeah.

65
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,669
He made a promise to me that he'd
give me the Grail once he got it.

66
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:14,417
If I have the Grail, I can save you, Sakura.

67
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:16,938
You're going to save me?

68
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:20,021
Yeah, of course.

69
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:24,435
Remember, I promised that we would all play together

70
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:27,415
like we used to with your mom and sister.

71
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:31,331
Then I'll be able to see Mother again?

72
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:34,399
See your mother.

73
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:05,052
Ahhh!

74
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:17,626
Now.

75
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,983
No good.

76
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:37,672
Can he see it?

77
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:52,823
He knows the lengths of my blade.

78
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,971
Could he be some knight I once knew?

79
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:02,298
From your skill I assume you
to be a knight of some renown,

80
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:06,825
and so I ask, if you know me to be Arturia Pendragon,

81
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:09,158
King of Britain and founder of Camelot...

82
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:14,017
...name yourself right now as a knight's pride demands.

83
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,531
Challenging me with your identity
concealed is tantamount to using deceit.

84
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:28,772
Who are you?

85
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,195
Impossible.

86
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:46,356
That's Arondight.

87
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,049
It can't be you.

88
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:07,476
Sir Lancelot.

89
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:22,592
But why, my friend?

90
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:27,795
You were esteemed as the greatest of
all the Knights of the Round Table.

91
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:30,838
How can you be Berserker?

92
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:35,323
Stop!

93
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:41,815
Lancelot.

94
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:52,434
You may indeed have saved them,

95
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:54,620
but you never led them.

96
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:58,352
Because I never really led them.

97
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,391
Enraptured by a false idol of a humble king

98
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:03,447
who always serves others.

99
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,997
My ideals, my kingship.

100
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:07,772
You're just a little girl.

101
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:10,342
Did how I rule drive you to this?

102
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,928
Please stop, Lancelot.

103
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:33,091
Uniting dreams beneath a banner of conquest.

104
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,380
I praise your efforts at least.

105
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:40,611
But foolish warriors, have you not learned?

106
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,494
Dreams disappear when the dreamer wakes,

107
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:49,488
every last one of them with no exception.

108
00:13:11,511 --> 00:13:16,691
Therefore, it was inevitable that I
would be the one to stand in your way.

109
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,597
King of Conquerors,

110
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:23,505
now know the end of your eternal dream.

111
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,405
I shall show you the stark reality.

112
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:29,334
Here it comes!

113
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:33,011
Now, awaken Ea!

114
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,677
A stage worthy of you has been set!

115
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:42,212
Look up and behold, at my liege!

116
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:47,757
Hang on, boy!

117
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,287
What?

118
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:12,533
That sword is the Anti‐Universe Noble
Phantasm that can destroy all creation?

119
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:55,619
Hm.

120
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:00,203
Rider.

121
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:09,000
I just remembered, there is something important

122
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:10,654
that I must ask you.

123
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:15,705
Master Waver Velvet,

124
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:18,931
would you be willing to serve as my retainer?

125
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,183
You...

126
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,738
...you are my king, sire.

127
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,692
I will serve you with devotion.

128
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:38,605
Do me the honor of leading me.

129
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:42,200
Let me dream what you dream.

130
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:46,003
Ah, very well.

131
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:57,015
As king, my duty is to inspire others to dream,

132
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:05,069
and as my retainer, it is your sacred duty to see my
dream to the end and share it with future generations.

133
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:12,840
Now live, Waver.

134
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,930
See all of this through.

135
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:17,478
Live long and tell everyone you meet

136
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:20,189
of how your king comported himself,

137
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,866
of the last charge of Iskandar.

138
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:34,460
All right, it is time to go, Bucephalus!

139
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:39,000
Rider!

140
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,768
Glory lies beyond the horizon.

141
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,783
Challenge the unattainable.

142
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:47,236
Speak of conquest and make it real

143
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:50,900
for my men and for those who watch behind me.

144
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,584
Hm.

145
00:17:54,834 --> 00:18:01,685
I swear to the gods, it is just one strange
toy after another with you, isn't it?

146
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:11,557
Have you awakened from your dream, King of Conquerors?

147
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:19,230
I suppose I have.

148
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:25,356
However, once again, during this glorious campaign,

149
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:30,157
my heart was able to dance a good deal.

150
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:38,343
Feel free to challenge me again as
often as you like, King of Conquerors.

151
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:46,510
This entire world is my garden
until the very end of time.

152
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,830
Thus, I guarantee you this,

153
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,231
it will never bore you.

154
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:53,973
It will always be entertaining.

155
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:04,185
That sounds very good.

156
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,055
Now I see.

157
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:18,056
It was the beating of my heart

158
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:22,720
that was the sound of Oceanus' waves.

159
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:58,960
Child, are you Rider's master?

160
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,962
No, I'm not.

161
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:04,165
I am his retainer.

162
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:06,312
Hm?

163
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:07,980
I see.

164
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,749
But child, if you are truly a loyal subject to him,

165
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:18,026
your duty now is to avenge your fallen sovereign.

166
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:22,662
If I challenge you, I'll die.

167
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,535
Yes, of course you will.

168
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:26,785
I can't do that.

169
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:30,387
I was ordered by him to survive.

170
00:20:42,494 --> 00:20:44,249
Your loyalty is splendid.

171
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,624
Never allow anything to tarnish it.

172
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:06,074
He restoreth my soul.

173
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:09,380
He leadeth me in paths of righteousness

174
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,415
for his name's sake.

175
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:16,242
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

176
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:18,563
I will fear no evil,

177
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:21,345
for thou art with me.

178
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,806
Thy rod and thy staff,

179
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:26,623
they comfort me.

180
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:29,358
Thou preparest a table before me.

181
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:32,008
Thou anointest my head with oil.

182
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,472
My cup runneth over.

183
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:39,420
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.

184
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:41,548
My cup runneth over.

185
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:46,468
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.
