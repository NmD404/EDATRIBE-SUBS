1
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:09,240
Hey! Come on, Kerry!

2
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:10,824
Hurry! Hurry up!

3
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:12,194
Kerry, jump in! Come on!

4
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:13,610
Come on! Come on!

5
00:00:13,737 --> 00:00:15,033
It's so nice! Hurry up!

6
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,951
That was sweet, Kerry!

7
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,957
That was so cool! You're so awesome.

8
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:43,207
That was nothing. You're so cool.

9
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:43,873
That was really great.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,366
Shirley!

11
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,592
Shirley!

12
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:48,852
Kerry!

13
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:50,338
Sorry I'm late.

14
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,620
Hey, Kerry,

15
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,800
do you know where this island's name comes from?

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,528
Uh‐uh.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,683
Oh, isn't Arimago the word for crab?

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,657
Yep.

19
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:09,119
Long ago, this was a place where they
would make offerings to the sea gods.

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,260
But then one day a girl who was very poor and
had absolutely nothing to feed her sick mother

21
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:18,976
took some of the food that had been
set out by the village as an offering.

22
00:01:20,023 --> 00:01:25,035
The sea gods were so upset by this that they
cursed the girl and transformed her into a crab.

23
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:26,559
That's where it comes from?

24
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,214
What an awful story.

25
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:32,400
Well, according to the legend,
the shrine where the village worshipped those gods

26
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:36,427
was located way up in the mountains,
right about the place where your house is.

27
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:41,345
That's why none of the villagers in
this area ever want to go up there.

28
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,225
They say it's bad luck.

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,119
They tell me that if I go there too often,

30
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,090
I'll end up cursed for life.

31
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,323
You're kidding.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,516
Really?

33
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:52,650
But everyone's nice to me.

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,800
Of course they are.

35
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:56,996
You're not an outsider to them anymore.

36
00:01:58,178 --> 00:02:00,961
In the village, they just treat
you like you're my little brother.

37
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:05,069
Your little brother, huh?

38
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:09,295
You know, Kerry, you've really settled in nicely here.

39
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,232
Yeah?

40
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:16,248
Back when you first arrived, everyone used to
really bully you, saying you had a weird name.

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,348
Hey!

42
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:21,464
You were the very first one to call my name weird,

43
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:24,559
and it was your big idea to call me Kerry.

44
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:29,293
Well, yeah, because your actual
name is really hard to say.

45
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,031
Kerry, uh...

46
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,372
Kerry...

47
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:33,474
Kiritsugu.

48
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,470
Jeez.

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,524
Kerrystugu!

50
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:37,359
Not even close.

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,559
Really?

52
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,794
Oops.

53
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:53,797
Okay.

54
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:54,977
Hm?

55
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:58,358
Hey, Dad, is that a new one?

56
00:02:59,137 --> 00:02:59,877
That's right.

57
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:03,110
This would make my 100th success.

58
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:07,870
Amazing.

59
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:09,508
These flowers don't wither.

60
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:12,720
That's because I've altered the flow of time.

61
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,132
They will never grow beyond
this, but they will never die.

62
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:18,692
Unbelievable.

63
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:23,739
The big question is whether or not we can
get the same theory to work on humans.

64
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,253
Sorry for the wait!

65
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,872
Shirley, what you got?

66
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:34,723
Check it out.

67
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,796
It's my first successful flower.

68
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:40,668
Shirley has been watching closely
and learning while she assists me.

69
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,048
She does seem to have the natural gift to be a mage.

70
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:49,245
Aw, come on now, Professor.

71
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:50,558
You did most of the work.

72
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,402
I only did a little bit, and it was right at the end.

73
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,463
Maybe, but it's amazing.

74
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:57,510
Uh, hey, Dad?

75
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:58,760
Huh, what?

76
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:01,422
You think I could give it a try?

77
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:03,137
What Shirley did, I mean.

78
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,634
That'd be great!

79
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,636
I think if you had a little bit of help,

80
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:07,755
you could do it.

81
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:09,642
Right, Professor?

82
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,052
No.

83
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:14,502
Kiritsugu, it's still too early for you.

84
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,282
Mm.

85
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,430
This isn't a game.

86
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:18,976
There are dangers.

87
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,595
I only let Shirley try it because she has the
necessary knowledge and experience to succeed.

88
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,394
Hm.

89
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:43,328
Father Simon, why won't you try to understand?

90
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,286
Shirley.

91
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:47,130
Everyone in town has the professor all wrong!

92
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:49,632
Shirley, listen to me.

93
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:52,295
You must stop going up to that mansion.

94
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:57,812
Let's talk inside.

95
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:06,387
I think Dad should spend some
time with the villagers too.

96
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:10,683
I don't know.

97
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:15,433
Father Simon just has it in for him for some reason.

98
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:18,343
He keeps lecturing me all the time.

99
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:20,818
He says if I stay working there,

100
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:23,559
I'll get possessed by a demon someday.

101
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:24,919
Check this out.

102
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:26,961
He gave this to me yesterday.

103
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:30,117
Says I should always keep it near me.

104
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:33,048
He told me that it's a powerful talisman.

105
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:38,919
So you're not scared, you know, of my dad?

106
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,092
Not at all.

107
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:44,520
I realize that magical research
like he does isn't exactly normal.

108
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:48,263
But the professor's research
and discoveries are a big deal.

109
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:50,534
I mean, they could make history.

110
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:53,948
Actually, I think he's amazing.

111
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,297
Are you sure you should be...

112
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:04,903
What; It's sharp and it's really easy to use.

113
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,015
Well, see you tomorrow.

114
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:13,180
Shirley, something wrong?

115
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:17,668
Keeping a flower blooming forever.

116
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:19,917
It's really amazing magic.

117
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:22,374
But you're doing it too, Shirley.

118
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:25,024
The work with flowers is all I can do.

119
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:28,089
But he can do a lot more than that.

120
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:32,859
The medicines he makes could make
human beings effectively immortal.

121
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:37,051
I really want him to use his power
for the good of the whole world

122
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:41,126
so that everyone will finally
understand how incredible he is.

123
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,442
He's given up on that.

124
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,004
But, Kerry, I think you can do it.

125
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:49,719
Oh, come on.

126
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:52,271
You're the best student he's ever had.

127
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,048
If anyone could carry on his work,

128
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:56,396
it'd be you.

129
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:59,129
Kerry, I'm not really his student.

130
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,497
At best, I'm his assistant.

131
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:03,408
Running his errands,

132
00:07:03,644 --> 00:07:04,569
helping out.

133
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:10,957
See, I'm not his student.

134
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:11,863
Far from it.

135
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:16,597
So even when Father Simon says bad things about
him, there's nothing I can say.

136
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:21,644
Kerry, you're his heir, there's no doubt about it.

137
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:27,756
You do realize that everything he's working
on now he plans for you to continue.

138
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:31,988
It's just a little too soon, that's all.

139
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:36,269
Hey, come with me.

140
00:07:53,996 --> 00:07:54,755
Whoa.

141
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:01,752
Tell me, Kerry,

142
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,672
what do you want to grow up to be?

143
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:06,029
Huh?

144
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:08,564
If you decide to take up your dad's work,

145
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:10,690
what do you think you'll use it for?

146
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,451
It's a world changing power,

147
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,088
and one day it will be yours.

148
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,327
So, go change the world.

149
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,217
You can do it.

150
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:23,924
I guarantee it.

151
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:26,625
Well, I, uh...

152
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:29,269
That's a secret.

153
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:32,499
Hm.

154
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:41,430
Then I guess I'll have to wait until you grow
up to see what you're gonna do with your power.

155
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:47,653
I'll stay with you until that day comes, okay?

156
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,302
Yeah, right, whatever.

157
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:03,581
Stop it!

158
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,408
No way!

159
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:15,460
Oh, good morning, Dad.

160
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,906
Kiritsugu, you didn't go into
my workshop last night, did you?

161
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:21,712
Huh?

162
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:23,300
No, I didn't.

163
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:24,926
I see.

164
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:30,489
Listen, don't leave the house.

165
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:31,417
Huh?

166
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,207
Stay here.

167
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:33,947
Don't go into the village today.

168
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:38,482
What's gotten into him?

169
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,360
Shirley's late, I wonder why.

170
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,354
Hey!

171
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,284
Have you guys seen Shirley?

172
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:03,504
Uh‐uh.

173
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:12,367
Shirley?

174
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:22,518
Shirley?

175
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:26,399
Hm.

176
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:33,706
Huh?

177
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:46,631
What the?

178
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:47,978
What happened?

179
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,003
Kerry.

180
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:15,304
Shirley!

181
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:21,965
I...

182
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:26,462
I only wanted to prove him right.

183
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:29,543
His resear... research.

184
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:34,331
But I guess

185
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:36,619
it didn't work.

186
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,860
Kill me.

187
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:51,430
Use that.

188
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:52,858
Please.

189
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:55,433
You have to kill me.

190
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:58,850
Do it now

191
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:01,809
before it's too late.

192
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:05,101
Please do it!

193
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:07,516
I can't stop.

194
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,202
Can't hold it back anymore.

195
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,644
Hurry!

196
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:25,501
Hm.

197
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,306
Are you certain it was Shirley who did this?

198
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,681
Kerry, I want you to stay here for the time being.

199
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,882
I'll go inform the village.

200
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,438
Agh!

201
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,609
Agh!

202
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:56,429
Agh!

203
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:10,847
What?

204
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:13,533
What is all this?

205
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:33,885
Father Simon?

206
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:02,236
Yah!

207
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:24,794
Agh!

208
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,900
Agh!

209
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,329
Looks like we got here just a little too late.

210
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:35,682
Wait a minute.

211
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,066
Who are... who are you?

212
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,527
Agh!

213
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:41,782
Agh!

214
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:46,603
Don't you think you should worry about yourself first?

215
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,299
Well, if you just sit there like that,
you'll be joining them soon enough.

216
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,856
So what's going on?

217
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,516
Who did all this?

218
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,797
Why would they burn the village?

219
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,667
Surely you must have heard of them before.

220
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,267
You would know them as vampires.

221
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,368
The name we use is Dead Apostles.

222
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,843
Apostles?

223
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,652
They drink blood to increase their numbers.

224
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,383
Nearly everyone living on this
island has become one now,

225
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:26,974
and here we are having to clean up the mess.

226
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:31,990
So, we have two groups down there
right now trying to eliminate them all.

227
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:35,547
One of the groups is made up of Church Inquisitors,

228
00:16:35,747 --> 00:16:38,077
those who believe beyond the shadow of a doubt

229
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,221
that it's all right to slaughter
anyone who defies the will of God.

230
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:44,807
They'll show no mercy to any Dead Apostles they find,

231
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:48,818
and they'll kill anyone they even
suspect of having had their blood sucked.

232
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:51,844
The other group is from the Mage's Association,

233
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:53,708
and they're harder to explain.

234
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,946
Suffice it to say, they'd very much like to
keep the secret of who made such bizarre things

235
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,301
as the Dead Apostles to themselves.

236
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:05,604
Naturally, since their motto is All To Ourselves,

237
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:08,772
they'll kill anyone they suspect of knowing the secret.

238
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,792
They'll do anything to cover this up.

239
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:13,957
It was the mages who set a torch to the village.

240
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,894
So then whose side are you on?

241
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:22,233
I'm something akin to a salesman
to the Mage's Association.

242
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,296
All right, it's your turn, kid.

243
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:27,487
Time to answer one of my questions.

244
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,714
I'm looking for a mage who's marked for sealing.

245
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,805
What's a mage?

246
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,679
I suppose that word doesn't really mean anything to you.

247
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:40,314
There was someone who became a Dead Apostle first,

248
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:44,411
someone infected them with the medium
that turns people into those creatures,

249
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,470
the trigger that started their transformation.

250
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:50,749
The son of a bitch mage who conjured that medium up

251
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:53,772
should be laying low somewhere on this island.

252
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,216
Can you think of any likely spots where I should look?

253
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,397
Oh, good.

254
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:15,340
There you are.

255
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,345
You're okay.

256
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,972
Well, thank goodness.

257
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:21,073
Didn't I tell you not to go into the village?

258
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:26,320
Dad, why were you researching Dead Apostles?

259
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,257
How did you know about that?

260
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:33,383
Shirley used the magic on herself.

261
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:38,981
Oh, well, that's most unfortunate.

262
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:41,552
But you can't change what's already happened.

263
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:44,872
It just means Shirley gave me
an answer I was looking for,

264
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,692
that's all.

265
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,531
Dad, will... will you use me

266
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:51,822
like you used Shirley?

267
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:53,175
Don't be stupid.

268
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:56,269
A Dead Apostle that can't control its blood lust

269
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,320
is a failure.

270
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,385
But the Emiya family research
requires an unlimited amount of time.

271
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:06,216
The Root will never be attained
by someone with a mortal body.

272
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:08,887
It was a time consuming task,

273
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,497
but it seems to have ended in failure.

274
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:14,943
I'm going to have to reconsider my entire theory.

275
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:18,775
Kiritsugu, let's save this matter for another time.

276
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:21,465
For now, escaping comes first.

277
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,653
It's not too late to escape?

278
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:27,403
I suspected something like this might happen one day,

279
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,314
so I've kept a motorboat hidden on the south coast.

280
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:34,924
I'm sorry, Kiritsugu,

281
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:37,689
but we don't have time to let you gather your things.

282
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:38,995
Come on.

283
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:40,495
I'm gonna do it.

284
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,397
There's a Bounded Field around the forest,

285
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:45,365
an extremely powerful one.

286
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:48,051
It'll take a little bit of time to break through it,

287
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:51,175
but I'll be able to get in.

288
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,478
I have to be the one.

289
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,435
Tell me, Kerry...

290
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,469
What do you want to grow up to be?

291
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:54,636
That Bounded Field,
I was able to break through it easily.

292
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,717
Are you mad or stupid?

293
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,218
It was only dumb luck that you showed up in time.

294
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,137
If this man had escaped,

295
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,534
he'd have continued his Dead
Apostles research somewhere else.

296
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:12,641
Yeah, well, that's a pretty crappy
reason for a kid to kill his father.

297
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:17,478
You're a good person, aren't you?

298
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:21,545
I'll get you off this godforsaken island.

299
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,975
You can decide the rest for yourself.

300
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:26,170
Wanna take anything?

301
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,194
Nothing at all.
