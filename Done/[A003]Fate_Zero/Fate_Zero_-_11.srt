1
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:34,449
Irisviel.

2
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:38,873
Are you all right?

3
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,520
They waited for Kiritsugu to leave

4
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:43,933
before launching a frontal assault.

5
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:48,599
That sudden lightning and that
unscrupulous appearance of his.

6
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,082
The enemy.

7
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:52,453
His likely Rider.

8
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,161
Whoa!

9
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:34,888
Huh?

10
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,854
Hello, Saber.

11
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,179
Rider?

12
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,861
I came because I wanted to see your castle.

13
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,524
It's kind of gloomy here, don't you think, hmm?

14
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:51,012
And what's with the tasteless armor?

15
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:53,380
Are you going out to fight someone right now?

16
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:57,639
Why aren't you wearing your
fashionable clothes like I am tonight?

17
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:58,583
Rider.

18
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,303
What are you doing here?

19
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,689
You mean you can't tell?

20
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:08,074
I've come to drink, what else does
it look like I've come here to do?

21
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,927
So stop standing there like statue
and show me around this place.

22
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,921
Surely you have a garden here suitable for a banquet.

23
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:19,927
Honestly, this castle is far too dusty to be in.

24
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,847
The Grail is said to be fated for the
hands of the one most worthy to possess it.

25
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:44,337
And the epic battle taking place here in Fuyuki

26
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:47,070
will determine exactly who that person is.

27
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:52,395
And if it's simply a means to decide that
fact, there's hardly a need for bloodshed.

28
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:57,333
After all, if the heroic spirits
can agree on our rankings,

29
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:00,419
then the matter can simply settle itself.

30
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:10,598
Oh.

31
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:16,852
Then I assume you wish to compare
your rank against my own, Rider.

32
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,065
Indeed I do.

33
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,547
As one who also claims the title of king,
you can not refuse this opportunity.

34
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,498
You might consider this a Grail
dialog, rather than a Grail War.

35
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:31,718
And the matter of who among us who is
most suited to claim the Holy Grail

36
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:37,692
will become clear to us as we
drink our fill and converse.

37
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,966
I believe that is quite enough nonsense.

38
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,536
You mongrels.

39
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:50,462
Archer, what are you doing here?

40
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:52,219
Ah, yes, well,

41
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:56,905
I saw him in town so I thought I might as
well invite him to our little gathering.

42
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,987
You're a little late don't you think, goldie,

43
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:03,724
though it stands to reason since
you traveled by foot unlike myself.

44
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:08,742
You actually chose to hold a banquet of
kings in a depressing place like this?

45
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:12,419
How will you recompense me for
the rudeness of calling me here?

46
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:15,212
Oh, why don't you just relax yourself.

47
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,820
Here, start with a little drink.

48
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:28,901
What is this disgusting swill?

49
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:33,186
You really thought we could discern a
hierarchy of heroic spirits with this?

50
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,748
You don't like it?

51
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:39,167
This cask was among the very best I could
find at the city marketplace this afternoon.

52
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,095
You are pitifully ignorant of true drink.

53
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:44,137
Of course you believe that.

54
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,123
Stupid mongrel.

55
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:55,235
Ah!

56
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:58,341
Now behold and acknowledge your folly.

57
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:00,702
This is the beverage of a true king.

58
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,588
A fine treasure, indeed.

59
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:08,827
Aaahhh.

60
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,900
Ah, magnificent.

61
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:24,349
My treasury houses only the very finest
of drinks and the finest of swords.

62
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:32,402
This alone should indicate which
among us is the greatest of kings.

63
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:38,849
Archer, your finest drink is indeed worthy
of the finest vessel in all of history.

64
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:42,227
But the Holy Grail is not a drinking cup.

65
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,774
First, we must hear what wish
you would have the Grail grant

66
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,974
should you win it.

67
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,028
The wish is what gives the Grail its purpose.

68
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:51,117
You are not ruler here, mongrel.

69
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,591
Already you wantonly disregard
the time honored rules

70
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,750
which dictate we fight for the Grail.

71
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,105
Hmm?

72
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:02,102
Besides all that, the Grail already belongs to me.

73
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:07,112
All of this world's treasures without exception
trace their origin to my treasure house.

74
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:08,374
They do, do they?

75
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,124
Then I assume that means you once held the Holy Grail,

76
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,130
you can identify it by sight.

77
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:14,325
No.

78
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:15,190
Huh?

79
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:17,432
Do not consider me as you would a lesser being.

80
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,477
The amount of wealth in my treasury
long ago surpassed my own knowledge.

81
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:25,738
But that the Holy Grail is a treasure
also means that it belongs to me.

82
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:28,811
And any who would take it for themselves

83
00:07:29,477 --> 00:07:32,634
is not but a filthy scoundrel and a common thief.

84
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:37,004
Your words are no different than
Caster's senseless and insane rants.

85
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:41,016
It appears he isn't the only
Servant to have gone completely mad.

86
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:43,999
Come, let's not go that far.

87
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:50,164
However, I believe I now have a clue
as to what goldie's actual identity is.

88
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:56,727
So then, Archer, you suggested if we desire
the Grail we must first get your permission?

89
00:07:56,987 --> 00:08:03,634
Indeed, however there is no reason whatsoever
for me to reward lowly mongrels of your ilk.

90
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:07,446
Wait a minute, you're going to be stingy?

91
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:12,502
Fool, my magnanimity is limited to
my vassals and to my loyal subjects.

92
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:17,041
Which means, Rider, if you were to swear fealty to me,

93
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:19,657
I could lend you a Grail or two,

94
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,867
whenever you felt the need for one.

95
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:24,919
Sorry, that is totally out of the question.

96
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:30,748
But tell me, Archer, surely you have no special
interest in the Holy Grail itself, do you?

97
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:34,614
Of course not, but I must render my judgment upon those

98
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,807
who would dare to steal treasure from me.

99
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:39,254
It's simply a matter of principle.

100
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:42,733
Hmm, I'm curious, Archer.

101
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:46,885
On what morals and reasoning are
these principles of yours based?

102
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,693
It is the law, my law which I
set down as the rightful king.

103
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:53,459
Perfect.

104
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,080
Living by one's own law is the epitome of kingship.

105
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:05,602
Nevertheless, I desire the Holy Grail
so badly I could almost taste it.

106
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:09,209
And it has always been my
style to just take what I want.

107
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:11,829
After all, the Great Iskandar

108
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,948
is the King of Conquerors, is he not?

109
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,243
Right and wrong are irrelevant.

110
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:19,860
You break the law and I will punish you.

111
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,531
There is no place for discussion.

112
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:23,679
Hmm.

113
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:27,138
Which means that all we have left to us

114
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:29,602
is to meet on the field of combat.

115
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:35,975
So then, Archer, would you still like
us to help you finish this off tonight?

116
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,397
There'll be plenty of time to kill each other after.

117
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:45,111
Indeed, or do you dare sit there and cast aspersions
on the superior drink I did you the honor of providing?

118
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:49,759
No, of course not, I wouldn't dream
of letting this drink go to waste.

119
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,312
King of Conquerors.

120
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:54,992
Hmm?

121
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,437
A moment ago you agreed that the Holy Grail's
rightful ownership lies with another and not yourself.

122
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:03,059
And yet you would just take it by force?

123
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,560
What makes the Grail so important to you?

124
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:19,371
Reincarnation.

125
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:20,444
Huh?

126
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:21,546
What?

127
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:24,567
Wait a minute, wasn't your goal
supposed to be world conquest?

128
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:25,393
Ah!

129
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:31,754
Idiot, as if I would leave the
conquering to some mere cup.

130
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:35,058
Conquering the world is my dream to make true.

131
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:37,626
The wish I would ask of the Holy Grail

132
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,494
is the first step towards that goal.

133
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:44,755
Mongrel, you would dare challenge me for my treasure

134
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:46,782
over something so trivial?

135
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,843
Even in magic lends us form in this world,

136
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,442
ultimately we remain Servants.

137
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,407
I wish to live as flesh and blood

138
00:10:57,874 --> 00:11:00,768
within this world in which I find myself.

139
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,990
And with nothing but my body

140
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,085
I shall defy both heaven and Earth,

141
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:08,908
succeeding in that endeavor is
the true meaning of conquest.

142
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:10,621
Thus it begins.

143
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:14,477
Then proceeds onward and finally is finished.

144
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,272
Such is the path of my conquest.

145
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,675
Hmm, then the matter is settled.

146
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,296
I shall take great pleasure in killing you myself.

147
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,210
You don't have to remind me of the obvious.

148
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:35,649
I have every intention of plundering your abundant
storehouse until it's been laid bare, so get ready.

149
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:40,179
That is hardly fitting of how a true king should behave.

150
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:45,337
Oh, well then, let us hear what
you would ask of the Grail,

151
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,037
if you were to win it.

152
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:54,663
I wish for my homeland's salvation.

153
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:58,429
With the omnipotent wish granting device,

154
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,526
I shall avert Britain's fate of destruction.

155
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:10,350
They're having a drinking party of all things?

156
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:14,307
Shall I continue to leave Archer to his own devices?

157
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:16,544
Hmm, it can't be helped.

158
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:23,293
After all, when one is King of Kings, it simply wouldn't
do to turn one's back on an interesting invitation.

159
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:30,584
Incidentally, Kirei, how do you judge the
relative strengths of Rider and Archer?

160
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:36,064
Rider may very well possess a trump
card that surpasses the gordius wheel.

161
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,312
I believe we should put this to the test.

162
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:43,640
Hmm, with Rider and his Master
drinking and their guard's down,

163
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,249
a better chance to attack them
will never again present itself.

164
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:50,736
The odds of victory don't matter to our overall plan.

165
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:52,946
Even if Assassin is defeated,

166
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,881
as long as he can gauge their relative strengths,

167
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:57,934
our objective will be accomplished.

168
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:00,049
We do have the option

169
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:03,072
of launching an attack right now, Kirei.

170
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:05,396
I have no objections.

171
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:10,265
I believe it will take roughly ten
minutes to summon all the Assassins.

172
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:13,258
Fine, give the order.

173
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:16,368
It is a large gamble, but even if it fails,

174
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:17,945
we stand to lose nothing.

175
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:22,069
Use a command seal to give Assassin the following order.

176
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,946
Be victorious no matter the cost, got it?

177
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:35,601
Hey, King of Knights,
did you just say that you would change fate?

178
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:39,328
Does that mean that you wish to change events long past?

179
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:43,868
Indeed, even if it is a wish that
a miracle alone can not fulfill.

180
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:46,783
If the Holy Grail is truly omnipotent,

181
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:48,233
then surely...

182
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:54,841
Um, Saber, just so I am clear on this,

183
00:13:55,261 --> 00:14:00,626
it was back during your time that his country
you call Britain was conquered and fell?

184
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:02,896
When it was under your rule?

185
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:06,084
Correct, that is why I can not allow it.

186
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:08,486
And that is why I regret it.

187
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:10,472
Why I want to alter that outcome,

188
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:14,109
for it was I and none other who was to blame.

189
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,933
Archer, what's so amusing?

190
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,757
You call yourself a king and are praised by all as such,

191
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:25,958
and yet you feel regret.

192
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:30,768
How can I not laugh at such nonsense?

193
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:35,089
Saber, surely you do not really mean

194
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:40,185
that you would erase the marks that
you yourself have left on history?

195
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:42,336
I do, and what of it?

196
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:43,662
Why do you laugh?

197
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:47,727
My beloved country to which I
devoted my whole life was destroyed.

198
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,893
Why is my sadness about that strange?

199
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:51,866
Did you hear that drivel, Rider?

200
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:55,480
Did you hear what this little girl who
calls herself King of Knights said?

201
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,977
Her beloved country to which she devoted her whole life.

202
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:01,046
Why is that humorous to you?

203
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:04,276
For their country's prosperity,

204
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,575
a true king should be willing to make any sacrifice.

205
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,087
You are wrong.

206
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:12,358
The king does not devote himself.

207
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:14,077
It is the nation and the people

208
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:16,423
who must devote themselves to the king.

209
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,258
You have reversed the concept.

210
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:19,391
I what?

211
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:21,995
Those are the words of a brutal tyrant.

212
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:22,937
Just so.

213
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,536
We are heroes precisely because we are tyrants.

214
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:32,758
However, Saber, if a king regrets his rule or
regrets the manner in which his rule came to an end,

215
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:36,895
that king is nothing but a fool,
worse than the tyrant you disdain.

216
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:40,658
Iskandar, your reign ended with all your heirs slain

217
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:43,988
and your great empire broken up by civil war.

218
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:48,127
Do you mean to say you have no regrets about that end?

219
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:49,111
None at all.

220
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:57,008
Not if it came to pass by my own decisions and by
the considerable sacrifices of my many retainers.

221
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:59,100
Its destruction was inevitable.

222
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,149
I shall mourn it and shed tears over it,

223
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,410
but I shall never regret it.

224
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:05,983
But you...

225
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,989
Let alone undo it all!

226
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:13,796
Such an act would be an insufferable insult to all
those who fought and bled and died alongside me.

227
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:16,771
It is only a warrior who can find glory in destruction,

228
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:19,568
worthless is a king who fails to protect the weak.

229
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:22,703
A just rule guided by just laws,

230
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,113
those are the true duties of a king.

231
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:28,830
So you, the king of your realm,

232
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,727
are a slave to what is right?

233
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,002
I am.

234
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:34,912
Kings are martyrs to their ideals.

235
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:38,678
That is not the way a person should live.

236
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:41,623
If I rule a nation as king,

237
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:43,965
I can not expect to live as a person.

238
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:49,339
King of Conquerors, you seek the
Grail merely for your own benefit.

239
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,969
And as such, you could never understand that.

240
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:57,363
You, who became a ruler only
to satisfy your endless greed.

241
00:16:57,426 --> 00:17:00,012
A king without greed is even worse than a figurehead!

242
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:05,532
Saber, you said you would
martyr yourself for your ideals.

243
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:10,057
In life you must have been something
akin to the purest of all the saints.

244
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:13,621
A proud and noble figure at the very least.

245
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:19,375
But who can truly admire the rough and thorny
path that a martyr must follow in life?

246
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:22,291
Who actually dreams of such an ending?

247
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:27,990
A king must be greedier than any other.

248
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:31,684
He must laugh more loudly and rage for much longer

249
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:35,454
and embody the very extreme of all things good and evil.

250
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,051
That is why his retainers envy his very existence.

251
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,764
And adore him as well.

252
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:43,261
And why the flames of aspiration

253
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,729
to be just as the king is

254
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,415
can burn within his people.

255
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:54,195
Proud king of chivalry,

256
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:58,221
the righteousness and ideals you embraced in life

257
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,627
may have indeed saved your nation

258
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,489
and her people once.

259
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,667
However, surely you must know what became of those

260
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:09,535
who were saved by you.

261
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:13,007
But then were left to fend for themselves.

262
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:14,327
What are you saying?

263
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,473
You may indeed have saved them,

264
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,721
but you never led them.

265
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:34,313
You never showed them all
what a king should really be.

266
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,364
You abandoned your men when they lost their way.

267
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,096
Then alone and untroubled by that fact,

268
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:44,341
you went on to follow your own
pretty little ideals to the end.

269
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:48,942
Thus, you are no true king.

270
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:55,450
You spent your life enraptured by a false idol
of a humble king who always serves others.

271
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,745
You're just a little girl.

272
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:02,746
I...

273
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:06,773
I...

274
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:20,600
What are you laughing at, Archer?

275
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:21,953
Oh, nothing.

276
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,953
I simply felt that your anguished
face was a rather lovely sight.

277
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:30,787
It was the face of the virgins who
showered me with flower pedals in my bed.

278
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:33,334
A woman after my own heart.

279
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:34,500
Bastard!

280
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:39,066
Huh?

281
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,080
Hmm.

282
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:42,591
Ah.

283
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:46,513
Ahhh.

284
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,216
Assassin.

285
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:03,735
So is this all your doing, goldie?

286
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,617
Tokiomi, what a shameful cur.

287
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:12,176
This isn't fair. Why are there
so many Assassins surrounding us?

288
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:15,046
We are one divided into many.

289
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:17,407
An army and also one.

290
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,988
A Servant with many shadows.

291
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:21,108
And one.

292
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,979
A Servant with separate bodies for
each of his multiple personalities?

293
00:20:31,492 --> 00:20:33,545
Rider, um, I...

294
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:34,853
Oh, calm yourself.

295
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:37,050
Nothing to worry about, boy.

296
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:39,894
Even those rude enough to interrupt our banquet

297
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:42,875
may yet show us which is the greatest king.

298
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:47,576
So I suppose you'll invite them all to our
little banquet as well, King of Conquerors?

299
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,195
But of course, a king's words are
meant for all to hear and absorb.

300
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:56,651
If they have come here to listen,
it matters not if they are friend or foe.

301
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:01,239
Now then, don't hold back.

302
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,837
Any who would speak with us, come forth and take a cup.

303
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:08,195
This drink is as your blood.

304
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,220
Very well.

305
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:21,137
As I said, this drink is as your blood.

306
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,723
If you insist on spilling it here tonight,

307
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:26,351
then so be it.

308
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,966
Saber, Archer, here is our banquet's final question.

309
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:48,482
It is, does a king always stand alone?

310
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,170
The king must indeed be alone, always.

311
00:21:54,343 --> 00:21:57,602
No, no, you obviously don't understand.

312
00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:00,779
I suppose I'll just have to show you both right now

313
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,209
exactly what a real king is all about when
faced with an adversary like this one.

314
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:18,515
Huh?

315
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:20,181
Huh?

316
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:31,352
A reality marble?

317
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:32,974
That's impossible.

318
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:36,580
A mental image materialized into the real world.

319
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,309
My glorious armies once rode across these sands.

320
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:48,165
A place that all the heroes who stood with
me through joy and sorrow will never forget.

321
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:57,955
I can make this world as real as real can ever be.

322
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,290
Because it still exists deep within our hearts.

323
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:06,697
Behold my endless armies.

324
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,986
Their bodies utterly destroyed and their souls
offered to the current world as heroic spirits of old.

325
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:17,627
And still, these legendary heroes
pledge their loyalty to me.

326
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,215
My bond with them is my greatest treasure.

327
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:22,985
My path to kingship.

328
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,738
The ultimate noble phantasm that I possess!

329
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,764
I order in Haitari.

330
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:37,906
Wait a minute, so each of these is a Servant?

331
00:23:39,165 --> 00:23:41,276
It has been a long time, partner.

332
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:45,612
Hear me!

333
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:50,391
A king must live a grand life and
embody his people's image of admiration.

334
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:53,192
Aye, aye, aye.

335
00:23:55,555 --> 00:24:00,792
He who is worthy of all heroes envy and
he who leads their way, that is a king!

336
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:04,074
Therefore, the king is not alone,

337
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:09,996
for his will equals that of all who would
follow him to his ultimate glory combined!

338
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,525
Aye, aye, aye!

339
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:18,023
Now then, shall we begin our battle, Assassin?

340
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:26,104
As you can see, what we have created is a vast plane
and with our superior numbers, we hold the advantage.

341
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,028
Annihilate them!

342
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:18,393
Aaarggh!

343
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:42,603
That ending wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped for.

344
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:45,903
We have said all there is to say.

345
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,069
I suppose that will do for today.

346
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,808
Wait, Rider, I have not finished.

347
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:53,997
You may keep silent.

348
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:57,289
Tonight was for a conversation amongst kings.

349
00:25:58,472 --> 00:26:02,869
But I no longer recognize you as a king, Saber.

350
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:13,046
Little girl, you must wake from
your sad dream and see the truth.

351
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:19,047
If you don't, you'll someday lose even that
modicum of pride you retain as a heroic spirit.

352
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,831
The dream of a king you spoke of earlier is a
curse and a burden which blinds and cripples you.

353
00:26:25,012 --> 00:26:25,825
A what?

354
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:38,156
Pay that base mongrel no heed, Saber.

355
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:42,514
You are correct, follow the path you believe in.

356
00:26:43,864 --> 00:26:46,542
Your agonizing pain and terrible sorrow

357
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:50,581
as you bear a burden of kingship
that is too heavy a weight for any

358
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:54,873
is quite a splendid and
marvelous thing to look upon.

359
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:58,316
Keep at it, oh great King of Knights.

360
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:03,408
It is possible you may prove worthy
of still more of my magnificent love.

361
00:27:13,162 --> 00:27:14,051
Saber.

362
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,400
I remember now.

363
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:20,230
There was once a knight who left Camelot

364
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:23,704
claiming the king didn't
understand how others felt.

365
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:32,837
Well, perhaps that... that sentiment was shared by all
of the knights who sat with me at the round table.
