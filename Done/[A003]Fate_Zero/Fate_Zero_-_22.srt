1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,647
Finally made it.

2
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:20,592
Hey, Waver!

3
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:24,165
No, no, not there. Over here.

4
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:27,382
Grandpa, what are you doing up there?

5
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:30,868
Enough with the questions, just come on up here.

6
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,661
Let's talk for a while.

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,547
He wants to talk?

8
00:00:34,787 --> 00:00:36,462
Why do we have to talk on the roof?

9
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:39,707
Grandpa, can't it wait a while?

10
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:42,209
Oh, come on, don't be like that.

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,597
He really does like you, boy.

12
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:50,087
Rider, come on, they're just under my spell and...

13
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:51,697
Oh, go up there.

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,021
The old man seems to have something
important he wants to tell you.

15
00:00:56,885 --> 00:01:00,515
Relax, boy, I'll patrol the area and keep watch.

16
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:02,235
Don't be shy.

17
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:04,335
That's not the problem.

18
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:43,482
I love it up here.

19
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,618
This is the best place to catch
the first rays of the morning sun.

20
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:51,992
Take a seat.

21
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:56,108
Here, I even have some coffee for you,

22
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,467
it'll warm you up.

23
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:00,598
Grandpa, just how long have you been sitting up here?

24
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:05,430
When I woke up this morning and checked in on
you, I saw you hadn't made it back yet,

25
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:11,289
so I thought I'd take the opportunity to watch the sun
come up while I waited for my grandson to come home.

26
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:20,219
When you were just a tyke, we used to come up to
the roof on clear nights and stargaze all the time.

27
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:22,394
Do you remember?

28
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,391
Yeah, I guess.

29
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:32,123
When Martha and I decided to live in Japan, we made
sure to build our house up here in the hills of Miyama

30
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:36,339
and built it with a large skylight,
so we could easily gain access to the roof.

31
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:42,528
We dreamed of sitting up here gazing at the beautiful
sky with our grandchildren alongside us,

32
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:45,390
entranced by the stars as much as we were.

33
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:49,160
We never thought our wish would
actually come true, though.

34
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,248
In all these years, our real grandchildren never
once came up here to watch the sky with us.

35
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:02,424
Sadly, whenever I've come up here to
stargaze, I've always been alone until now.

36
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,871
Now, Waver, you really aren't our grandson, are you?

37
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:17,355
It's very strange, the way Martha

38
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,692
and I were so completely convinced that
you were actually part of our family.

39
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,832
To be honest, you were a bit
too nice to be our grandson.

40
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:27,562
You really messed up there.

41
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:33,413
I suppose you're pretty mad.

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,036
Well, I guess I probably have every right to be, Waver.

43
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,745
But lately, Martha's been acting so happy
and smiling nearly every moment of every day.

44
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,669
I couldn't have imagined her like that before.

45
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:49,631
Really, I'm very grateful to the both of you.

46
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:51,874
It's been quite a blessing.

47
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:55,185
Besides, it doesn't seem to
me you decided to move in

48
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,168
with Martha and I because you
intended to cause us any harm.

49
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:01,865
So, what do you think?

50
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:08,147
If you can, Martha and I would really like
it if you'd stay with us a while longer.

51
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,970
I'm sorry, I can't promise that.

52
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:18,173
I can't even guarantee I'll make it back here safely.

53
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:22,194
So, I gather you two are risking your lives?

54
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:23,047
Yes.

55
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:29,367
Well, I can't even begin to venture a guess as to
how important whatever it is you're doing is to you,

56
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:33,112
but when you've had a long life
like me and look back on it all,

57
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:38,702
you come to realize that there is absolutely nothing
in this world so valuable or so important

58
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,888
that it's really worth risking that life for.

59
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:04,555
I guess it's been about 40 hours
since I last slept...maybe more.

60
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:07,731
To win the battle and summon the grail,

61
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:13,343
one must perform the ritual at the location
of one of the four Fuyuki ley lines.

62
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,804
At two of them, the church and the Tohsaka Estate,

63
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:20,627
Kirei Kotomine was nowhere to be found,

64
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:22,633
which leaves the other two:

65
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:26,541
Here at Mt. Enzo and the Fuyuki Citizens Building.

66
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,752
Given the ley lines' relative power,

67
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,276
this one is more likely.

68
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:32,748
Even if he's chosen the Citizens Building,

69
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:34,937
I can launch a frontal assault there.

70
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:41,260
If Maiya were still alive,
I would have sent her to secure it.

71
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:48,317
Once again, I'm all alone.

72
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:59,463
Come to think of it,
I never really figured her into my plans.

73
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,563
Since last night,

74
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:11,456
I've been searching the whole city for
Irisviel's location, but I found no sign of her.

75
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,430
I am deeply sorry.

76
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,432
Well, then, if you need me,

77
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,580
summon me using the command seal.

78
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:39,497
Wake up.

79
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:43,804
Can you hear me, woman?

80
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:50,908
So, it's you, Kirei.

81
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:55,920
This building was once the place where
Caster's young master hid,

82
00:07:56,753 --> 00:08:00,960
though it appears that Kiritsugu
Emiya was never able to locate it.

83
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:04,215
Soon, the Holy Grail War will be over.

84
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:10,080
It's likely that I'll be the one that will have
the power to grant the wish of the Einzberns.

85
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,788
Are you so unhappy that it would be me?

86
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,065
There is but one man to whom I would entrust the grail,

87
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:20,720
and it is certainly not you, Inquisitor.

88
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:26,393
Kiritsugu Emiya has already
seen right through you, Kirei.

89
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:30,427
He recognizes you as his most dangerous enemy.

90
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:31,907
You can't escape.

91
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:34,791
Your words are as the gospel to my ears.

92
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:40,404
Kiritsugu Emiya is exactly as
I imagined him to be after all.

93
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:42,604
How laughable.

94
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:46,312
You couldn't be any further from him if you tried.

95
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:48,542
What did you say?

96
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,435
Even though Kiritsugu can see through you,

97
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:53,388
the reverse is impossible.

98
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,851
You have none of the wonderful things

99
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,888
that he carries deep inside his heart.

100
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:03,550
Why do you speak of me in such a manner, woman?

101
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:09,144
I freely admit it, I'm a man
who is empty and desolate inside.

102
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:11,901
So, how do he and I differ?

103
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:15,612
Devoted himself to one fruitless
war after another for years?

104
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,940
Senseless slaughter,
utter recklessness, wasted effort?!

105
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:24,232
If he does not doubt or find this life
pointless as I do, then what is he?

106
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:32,205
Tell me, what is his wish?

107
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:34,538
What would he ask of the Holy Grail?

108
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:38,617
What prayer would he entrust
to the wish‐granting device?

109
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,734
Very well, I'll tell you.

110
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:49,948
Kiritsugu Emiya's wish

111
00:09:51,263 --> 00:09:53,257
is humanity's salvation,

112
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,434
an end to all warfare

113
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,471
and bloodshed and suffering...

114
00:09:58,663 --> 00:09:59,493
forever.

115
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,403
True peace upon the Earth.

116
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,364
What was that?

117
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:12,475
You can never understand it.

118
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:15,474
That is the difference between you two;

119
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:18,114
he has something to believe in.

120
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,816
Conflict is intrinsic to humanity.

121
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,488
To eliminate it completely would mean

122
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:30,103
the elimination of humanity itself.

123
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:33,067
As an ideal, it's totally futile,

124
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,073
nonsense that a child would spout.

125
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:41,389
Yes, and that is why his only
hope is for a true miracle.

126
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:45,745
Many times, Kiritsugu has been forced to...

127
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:50,919
to sacrifice the lives of people
he's loved because of his beliefs.

128
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:56,631
Yes, you see, he's far too kind to chase ideals.

129
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:00,296
He must love even knowing

130
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,000
it will mean losing that love.

131
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:06,308
I understand.

132
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:39,254
I understand well.

133
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:41,635
So, that is Kiritsugu Emiya.

134
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,928
At last, I see it, my reason for fighting.

135
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:59,170
Kiritsugu Emiya, I shall grind your
ideals to dust right before you,

136
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:02,090
along with the Holy
Grail you long for.

137
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:29,949
Oh, you finally woke up, boy.

138
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:33,078
I thought I told you to
wake me up at nightfall.

139
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:34,204
Did you forget?

140
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,329
Oh, sorry, but I thought it might be
good to take our time with preparations.

141
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:42,419
Tonight, there is no reason to rush.

142
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:43,888
How come?

143
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:47,129
I can't say why exactly.

144
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:51,335
It feels like everything will be concluding tonight.

145
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:52,808
Uh‐huh.

146
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:56,223
The night air seems way too still.

147
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,754
Is that because there are fewer
participants still in the fight?

148
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:09,692
From now on, only the truly
strong remain in the battle.

149
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,327
W‐what was that?

150
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:19,142
It's a very strange mana surge.

151
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:21,879
I felt something similar before.

152
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:28,266
Look at that pattern.

153
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:31,272
What is it... some kind of secret code, do you think?

154
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,613
Four and seven in different colors.

155
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:35,595
"Success and victory."

156
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:37,701
If they're sending up that signal...

157
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:41,913
...does that mean that someone
got the grail and the war is over?

158
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,404
No, it's coming up from

159
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:46,789
a completely different
direction than the church is,

160
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:49,642
which means that the church
didn't send the message.

161
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:55,253
In essence, somebody is getting way ahead
of themselves and claiming to be victorious.

162
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,409
That says, "If you
object, come and get me!"

163
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,492
It is an obvious challenge.

164
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:05,542
It looks like the big showdown
is going to happen tonight.

165
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:11,004
I see, that means this is it, then.

166
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:12,620
Quite right, boy!

167
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,566
Now that we have our battlefield,

168
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:23,511
I must go forth and bring honor to the rider
class and ride gloriously into the final fray!

169
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,943
Come now, my steed!

170
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:38,904
Now then, boy, it may not be as
smooth a ride as by chariot, but... Huh?

171
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:41,623
Hey, what are you waiting for?

172
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:42,644
Come on!

173
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:48,117
From this point,
only the truly strong can continue, right?

174
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:58,201
My servant, Rider, by his command
seal, Waver Velvet orders you...

175
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:02,439
fight until you attain the victory you seek.

176
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,826
And by my command seal, I further order that
you, Rider, go now and win the Holy Grail.

177
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,844
And by command seal, I further order, Rider,

178
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,569
take the world for your own.

179
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,389
I will not tolerate failure.

180
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,152
There, it's all over.

181
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,285
I'm no longer your master.

182
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,810
Go, go wherever you wish.

183
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,610
I don't even wanna see you.

184
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:42,016
I'll certainly be on my way in a moment,

185
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,244
but after all those annoying orders you just gave,

186
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,284
surely you're prepared to see this though to the end?

187
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:50,664
You total idiot, listen to me!

188
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:53,555
I used the command seals and quit being your master!

189
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,615
Why would you still wanna take me, dammit?!

190
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,985
I'm not your...

191
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,053
Master or not, boy, you are still my friend

192
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:02,368
and always will be.

193
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:03,282
Huh?

194
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,330
I'm...you mean...

195
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,783
you're really okay with me?

196
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:15,817
You want someone like me by your side?

197
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,012
What are you saying?

198
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:20,725
After all the battles you and I have seen
together, you have to ask that?

199
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:21,625
Idiot.

200
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,283
Up until now, have you not faced
the same enemies as I have?

201
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,760
That means you're my friend.

202
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,708
So, be proud and consider yourself

203
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:33,624
my equal.

204
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:44,342
All right, I shall begin by
obeying the first of your orders.

205
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,292
Now, boy, keep your eyes open to the end!

206
00:16:49,938 --> 00:16:51,812
Well, let's see what she can do.

207
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:54,589
Right before my open eyes!

208
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:19,305
He chose the place least suited to the required
ritual only to gain the early initiative in battle.

209
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,808
In other words, his plan is not to obtain the grail,

210
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:27,205
but rather to use it as bait

211
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:31,732
to lure me and the other masters into a
trap, then kill us all.

212
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:37,859
That simplifies things.

213
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:40,552
If he's going to be this incompetent,

214
00:17:41,332 --> 00:17:43,949
I'll just outmaneuver and eliminate him quickly.

215
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,091
Kirei Kotomine.

216
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:55,234
Hm, very impressive.

217
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:59,631
I must say, you look particularly
ferocious tonight, Kirei.

218
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:02,714
Now what will you do?

219
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:05,663
Do you wish for me to stay here and wait?

220
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:11,465
Unleashing all of your power at this close
range could endanger the ceremony itself.

221
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:15,813
If you want to fight it full strength
you'll have to go out and meet them.

222
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:20,172
Very well, what if this place
falls under attack while I'm gone?

223
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:24,588
Will you allow me to utilize the
command seals to save myself?

224
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:28,794
I will, but I do not guarantee the Holy Grail's safety.

225
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,648
For tonight, I shant be holding back.

226
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,789
That would be the worst outcome,

227
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:36,687
but if that should happen, it will be fate.

228
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:41,825
Kirei, you seem to have finally
found your reason to fight,

229
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:45,584
but have you still no prayer to offer the Holy Grail?

230
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,583
I can think of nothing I want.

231
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:55,563
My only hope is that nothing will interfere with
the conduct of the battle we're about to enter.

232
00:18:56,043 --> 00:19:03,126
Honestly, Kirei, as I suspected, the only recourse is
to let the grail reveal what hides within your heart.

233
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:12,103
Oh, if it appears as if Saber will
be arriving here before I can return,

234
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:15,296
just have Berserker entertain
her for a little while.

235
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:17,474
Understood.

236
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:22,913
Speaking of Saber, what happened to
the doll that was so important to her?

237
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:27,807
The Holy Grail's vessel is inside of her, is it not?

238
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:30,686
I took her life.

239
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:33,976
I had no reason to let her continue living.

240
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:01,575
Are you crying?

241
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,114
Are you, Mother?

242
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:08,118
Hey, Mother, I had a scary dream.

243
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,017
I dreamed that I turned into a cup,

244
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:16,784
and then I dreamed that these seven
gigantic lumps started to come into my body.

245
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,985
It's okay, it's okay.

246
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:22,169
I would never let that happen.

247
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:25,470
I promise that will never happen to you, Illya.

248
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:31,287
I know in my heart that you'll be
released from the shackles of fate.

249
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,429
Where am I?

250
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:53,913
Inside the Holy Grail?

251
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:55,946
This shouldn't be happening!

252
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,493
If I'm here...

253
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:10,997
who am I?

254
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:31,054
That's right, this is inside the Holy Grail:

255
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:35,865
The omnipotent wish‐granting device
that will dispel all the world's sadness

256
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:38,265
and remove all its suffering.

257
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:41,647
I will have the power to make that happen.

258
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:46,869
The end is nearly at hand.
