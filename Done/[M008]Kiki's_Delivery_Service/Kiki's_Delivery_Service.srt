3
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,730
But, first, here's the weather forecast.

4
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,190
Skies are clearing up,

5
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,151
thanks to a high-pressure front
moving in from the mountains.

6
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,487
Mild winds will be
blowing in from the west,

7
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,115
pushing the clouds out by this evening.

8
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,201
There'll be a beautiful full moon
lighting up the sky,

9
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,453
so if you have been planning
something special,

10
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,581
tonight might be the night.

11
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,667
Tomorrow also looks good
with clear skies and sun.

12
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,532
Jiji, wake up. Tonight's the night.

13
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,785
Hey, Mom.

14
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,165
Hi, Miss Dora.
Hey, Mom, it's gonna be clear tonight.

15
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,376
And guess what?
The radio says there'll be a full moon.

16
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,796
Did you borrow your father's radio
again without asking?

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,215
Don't worry. He doesn't mind.

18
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,717
Please excuse me, Miss Dora.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,428
Mom, it's a perfect midnight
for me to leave home.

20
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,348
You mean tonight?
Next month is what you told me.

21
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,808
Yeah. But the next full moon
might be on a cloudy night.

22
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,977
And I want to leave
on the perfect midnight.

23
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,937
Huh? But, Kiki... Wait.

24
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,570
My, oh, my. What's this all about?

25
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,240
It's one of our oldest customs
that when a witch turns 13,

26
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,327
she has to leave home for a year
to begin her training.

27
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,996
Your little baby is 13?

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,832
My goodness, but time flies so quickly.

29
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,628
I know. She seems so young
to be leaving home now.

30
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:54,841
I remember very well
the exact day you arrived in this town.

31
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:59,137
A little girl flew down from the sky
on her broomstick.

32
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:03,308
And I was certain she was much
too young to hold such an important job

33
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,976
as resident witch.

34
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,523
Yes, but I could fly.
Kiki barely knows how to do that.

35
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,943
And I have had no time
to teach her how to mix potions like me.

36
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:17,823
Hmm. Young people are all the same.
They all want to do something different.

37
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,743
But I hope you at least get to teach her
the potion that cures my rheumatism.

38
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:27,791
Hurry up! We always said we'd leave
on the perfect night. Didn't we?

39
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,961
Uh-uh. Our plan was that we would
stick around for another month

40
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,879
and play it safe. I like that plan.

41
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,425
And if we put it off for a month,
and I find some wonderful boyfriend,

42
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,093
then what'll we do?

43
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,469
Come on, Jiji.

44
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,639
I'm gonna put my paws together
and pray you're not serious.

45
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,433
Of course I am.

46
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:49,688
You know, ever since I turned 13,
I've been excited about making this trip.

47
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,442
There. Dad.

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,736
Dad. Guess what?

49
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,655
I've decided to leave tonight.

50
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,241
- You're going away?
- Yeah. There's a full moon.

51
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,618
Well, yeah, but what happened
to the camping trip

52
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,245
we were supposed to take
this weekend?

53
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,997
Sorry, Dad.

54
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,543
Uh! Kiki, wait.

55
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,427
Yeah, I'll expect you then. Thanks.

56
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,143
Hi, Mom, it's me. I wanted to make sure
you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.

57
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,311
Yes, midnight.

58
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,984
Very pretty.

59
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,236
Lilac would look prettier on me,
or white.

60
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,239
Witches have worn this color
for a very long time, Kiki.

61
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,160
Oh, Mom. I look really dumb.

62
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,954
It's not really important
what color your dress is.

63
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,123
What matters is the heart inside.

64
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,376
Well, I'm gonna be
the very best witch that I can be, Mom.

65
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,004
And I know having a good heart
is important.

66
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,381
Just follow your heart and keep smiling.

67
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,549
Yeah.

68
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,887
And be sure to write home
as soon as you're settled.

69
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,055
Okay.

70
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,016
Dad. Oh, can I please take the radio?

71
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,519
Mom, didn't you say
I could have the radio?

72
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,686
Yay!

73
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,064
- All right. It's yours already.
- Thank you.

74
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,361
Well, now, you certainly look
very grown-up, my little princess.

75
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,739
Ta-da!

76
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,910
You look just like your mother
when she was young.

77
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,995
I'm glad about that.

78
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,706
Dad, can you lift me up high,
like when I was little?

79
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,124
Well...

80
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,630
I don't know.

81
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,507
Here we go!

82
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,182
How come you never told me
you were growing up so fast?

83
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,935
If things don't work out,
you can always come home.

84
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,562
And come back a failure?

85
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,985
Will you write us
if you have the time?

86
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,945
Mmm-hmm.

87
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,244
After all, she is a baby.

88
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,125
Aren't you worried about Kiki
living in a big city all alone?

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,918
Of course, they are.
But Kiki will be just fine.

90
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,880
- You're gonna find a city by the ocean?
- Or maybe a town?

91
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,382
Uh-huh. That's what I'm hoping anyway.

92
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,050
Wow! You're gonna have
such a good time.

93
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,719
I'm so jealous. You'll have so much fun.

94
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,054
But I'm not going just for a good time.

95
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,558
In order to be a good witch,
I have to train a year away from home.

96
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,060
Yeah. Be sure to tell that to the boys.

97
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,440
Kiki, it's time.

98
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,649
Okay.

99
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,236
That's the broom
you're going to be leaving on?

100
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,239
Yup. I just made it this morning
all by myself.

101
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,241
Honey, it's too small to be really safe.

102
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,493
I'd rather you took my broom.
I know it better.

103
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,789
- But, Mom, that one's so old.
- And that's why it's good.

104
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,251
You can rely on it time after time
in any kind of weather.

105
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,545
Now, Kiki, do this for me, please.

106
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,590
But I put so much work into this one.
Right, Jiji?

107
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,135
Your broom is nice,
but let's take your mother's.

108
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,219
You're no help.

109
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,055
Now, Kiki,

110
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:14,392
can't you make yourself another
fine broom when you get settled down?

111
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,478
Mmm-hmm.

112
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,775
Be careful.

113
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,652
- You be strong. Okay?
- I will.

114
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,696
Bye, Kiki.

115
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,574
- Fly safely.
- Go get 'em!

116
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,747
Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki.

117
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,542
Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go!

118
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,428
Aim your broomstick.

119
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,690
May our little baby be well
and have a safe trip.

120
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,693
I'm going to miss
the wonderful sound of those bells.

121
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,277
Mmm-hmm.

122
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,954
- Where are we going?
- I'm headed south to see the ocean.

123
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,877
Jiji, climb up and turn on the radio.

124
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,922
I don't think I can handle it.
Can you do it?

125
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,848
Hey. Good evening.

126
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,559
It was.

127
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,770
You're new, aren't you?

128
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,272
Yup! How'd you guess?
I just left home tonight.

129
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,609
Mmm-hmm. Would you mind
turning off that radio?

130
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,738
- I prefer to fly without being distracted.
- Oh. Yeah, sure.

131
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,370
Could you tell me? Is it really hard
to get settled into a brand new city?

132
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,872
Oh, yes. A lot can go wrong.

133
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,292
But since my skill is fortune-telling,
I can handle anything.

134
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,046
- Fortune-telling?
- Yes. I tell fortunes about love.

135
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,464
Wow!

136
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,633
And what exactly is your skill?

137
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:37,262
Um. Well, I haven't really decided
that yet.

138
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,598
Ah. Well, I'm nearly finished
with my training period.

139
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,434
I'm going home soon
to show off my new skills.

140
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,688
- That's my town down there.
- It's so big!

141
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,150
Yes, to you I'm sure it looks big.

142
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,236
- I hope you don't have too tough a time.
- Thanks.

143
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,447
Ciao!

144
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,662
Jeez, what a snob.
And did you see that cat?

145
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,748
What's my skill?

146
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,089
What are we gonna do?
We can't stay up!

147
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,601
Hold on!

148
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,948
We better rest here until it's dry.

149
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,285
- Won't we get in trouble?
- Not if nobody finds us.

150
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,210
I'm soaked through down to the bone.

151
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,920
Hello?

152
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,467
Mmm. This smells great.

153
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,546
Oops! Sorry. We didn't mean
to fall asleep in your breakfast.

154
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,098
Wow!

155
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,477
Jiji, you've gotta come see the ocean.
It's beautiful.

156
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,356
Big deal. It's just a big puddle of water.

157
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,649
Look. Up ahead.

158
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,368
How lovely.

159
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:51,581
- I wonder if they have a witch there.
- Oh, great.

160
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:06,387
Ready, set, go!

161
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,181
Hold on.

162
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,274
You okay back there?

163
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,568
Wow!

164
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,280
This is just the kind of place
I've always imagined.

165
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,182
Wow! A clock tower.

166
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,894
Look at this city. A place like this
would be great to live in.

167
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,730
But there may be some witches
living here already.

168
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,190
And there may not be.

169
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,896
Look at how many people there are.

170
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,065
Too many, if you ask me.

171
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,694
Bless my hourglass.
It's a real, live witch.

172
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,696
Good morning.

173
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,950
- Do any witches live in this town?
- Why...

174
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,453
Nobody's seen one around here
in a long time.

175
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,831
That's great. Our trip is over.
We're staying right here.

176
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,834
- Thanks, mister. Bye.
- No problem.

177
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,967
- Tell me we're not landing down there.
- Well, of course, we are.

178
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,190
- They're looking at us.
- I know.

179
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,525
Smile, so we make a good impression.

180
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,902
Um. Hi. My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch.

181
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,571
And this is Jiji. He's my black cat.

182
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,491
And we'd be honored
if we could live here.

183
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,789
Your city is SO amazing.
And what a beautiful clock tower.

184
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,794
Really. That's very nice, dear. Bye.

185
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,837
Uh...

186
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,303
Hey, you, kid.

187
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,847
Who do you think you are,
jumping out into the street like that?

188
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,183
You were almost responsible
for a big accident,

189
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,977
zooming around on your broom
back there.

190
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,397
But I'm a new witch, sir.
We're supposed to fly around.

191
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,316
You're supposed to obey the law.
I'm gonna have to write you up.

192
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,026
Now give me your name and address.

193
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,861
Will you tell my parents?

194
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,281
Of course, I'm going to tell your parents.

195
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,158
- I have to do that with every minor.
- Thief! Thief!

196
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,910
- Huh?
- Somebody call the cops.

197
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,163
- He's getting away!
- Now you stay right there.

198
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,354
Uh, Kiki?

199
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,360
Miss. Wait up.
I sure fooled that cop, huh?

200
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,988
Hey, that was me yelling "thief."

201
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,741
You'll be okay now.
Worked out pretty good, huh?

202
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,660
You gotta be a real witch,
the way you can fly that broom.

203
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,787
Do you think maybe
you can teach me how to fly it?

204
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,456
Hey, Tombo.

205
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,292
Maybe you can sweep her
off her feet with that broom.

206
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,628
Hey, shut up, all right?

207
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,469
You know, miss, I love flying, too.
Can I see your broom? Hey, wait!

208
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
Thank you for getting me out of trouble.

209
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,556
But I really shouldn't be talking to you,
and you wanna know why?

210
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,141
It's very rude to talk to a girl

211
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,394
before you've been introduced
and before you know her name. Hmph!

212
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:07,855
Uh...

213
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,984
Hmm.

214
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,031
You're kind of old-fashioned,
aren't you?

215
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,534
- You sound like my grandmother.
- Just go away and leave me alone!

216
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,662
Hey! Don't go.

217
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,254
Hmm. What a cool witch.

218
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,011
Stay here tonight?
I'm afraid I don't understand.

219
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,721
Your parents are here with you,
aren't they?

220
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,390
No, sir, I'm alone.

221
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,601
I've come to this town
because I'm a new witch in training.

222
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,269
Do you have some identification?

223
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,605
Oh, never mind.

224
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,748
- Kiki, aren't you going to eat that?
- No, you can have it, Jiji.

225
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,628
Where are we going to stay tonight?

226
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,638
Let's go.

227
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,845
Why don't we go find another town?

228
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,555
I'll bet there are bigger and better ones.

229
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,183
Ones that are friendlier than this.

230
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,521
Oh, dear. Oh, my goodness.

231
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,151
Hey, there! Your pacifier!

232
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,696
Ma'am, you forgot your baby's pacifier.

233
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,908
Oh, poor baby.

234
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,996
Without this, the baby'll wake up
and cry all the way home.

235
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,791
I better go give it to her myself.

236
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:37,546
I'm sorry, folks. But could you wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.

237
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,637
Excuse me. But would you like me
to deliver it for you?

238
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,721
What?

239
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,599
The woman with the baby carriage
who just went around the corner.

240
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,977
- I could reach her in no time.
- Really? You'd do that?

241
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,563
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

242
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,190
Let's go, Jiji.

243
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:07,993
Wow!

244
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:21,423
Sorry to surprise you, but the lady in the
bakery asked me to return this pacifier.

245
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,860
- Here you go.
- Okay, I'd like one of those.

246
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,113
Yes, sir. Oh, hi, there.
Come in and wait a minute, will you?

247
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:49,118
Mmm. These are nice
and fresh. Just out of the oven.

248
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,579
There you are.

249
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,332
Here you go. See you tomorrow. Bye.

250
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:59,128
And that'll be all for you?
All right. Thank you.

251
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,132
Now, come back again.

252
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,557
When I saw you fly off,
I thought for a second I was dreaming.

253
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,809
The baby's mother told me
to give you this message.

254
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,019
Hmm?

255
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,648
"Thanks for returning the pacifier.

256
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,902
"Your new delivery girl
is really quite special."”

257
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,072
- Well, I'll be on my way.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

258
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,658
I really must do something
to show you my thanks.

259
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,335
Follow me. Bakery is downstairs.
Upstairs is home.

260
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,049
Sit down and relax.
Would you like some hot chocolate?

261
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,216
Okay.

262
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,731
- There you go.
- Thank you very much, ma'am.

263
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,233
And, this is for you, little guy.

264
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,197
So tell me if I'm right.
I'm guessing you're a witch in training.

265
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,535
I really love it here. But people
don't seem to like witches in this town.

266
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,329
Depends on the people.

267
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,416
Now, take me, for instance.
I just met you and I know I like you.

268
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,088
So, tell me,
whereabouts are you two staying?

269
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,174
- Uh...
- Oh, I see.

270
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,053
Why didn't you tell me
you have no place to stay?

271
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,806
We have a spare room in the attic.
You can use that.

272
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,307
You'd really let me stay with you?

273
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,604
Why, of course.
But we haven't introduced ourselves.

274
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,899
- My name's Osono.
- And I'm Kiki, ma'am.

275
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,985
And Jiji here is my very best friend.

276
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,988
It's right up here, Kiki.

277
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,865
It may need a little dusting,
but I think you'll like it.

278
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,165
Oh, my! It's a little bit dustier
than I remember.

279
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:03,002
If I weren't about to have a baby,
I'd help you clean.

280
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,545
- That's okay.
- All right, then.

281
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,381
Water and bathroom are downstairs.
Give a shout if you need anything.

282
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,799
Thank you.

283
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,682
- This is quaint.
- Jiji.

284
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:31,405
Hmph! If you wake up tomorrow
and find a white cat, it's me.

285
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,287
Jiji, we can see the ocean from here.

286
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,962
Can we look for a new town?

287
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,102
Pardon me, Miss Snooty Cat.

288
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,945
And the excitement is building

289
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,657
for the moment when the big blimp
appears in our skies.

290
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,745
And so we're gonna go to Scott,
live, as he reports in from...

291
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,206
Jiji, I've decided not to leave this town.

292
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,334
Maybe I can stay and find
some other nice people like Osono

293
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,087
who will like me
and accept me for who I am.

294
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,838
...and the ship making
some kind of landing

295
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,465
just so that everyone
can get a closer look.

296
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,864
And the amazing thing is

297
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,451
there's never been a dirigible this large
and this safe before.

298
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,328
How much do you think it would cost
to get a phone here?

299
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,248
- A phone?
- Yup. We're gonna need a phone.

300
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,564
- Morning, everyone.
- Well, look who's up.

301
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,150
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes. Oh, that smells good.

302
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,277
- Can I help out?
- Sure can.

303
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,300
Ooh, a delivery business, huh?

304
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,053
Well, I really only have one skKill,
and that's flying.

305
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,056
So I thought a delivery service
wouldn't be a bad idea.

306
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,518
It's a great idea.
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.

307
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,105
And since you're staying right here,
I can be your very first account.

308
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,149
You mean it? Oh, that's great.

309
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,111
I was planning
on putting a phone upstairs.

310
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,447
- But a phone is so expensive.
- I have a little saved up already.

311
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,949
Don't waste your money.

312
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,202
What I think you should do
is use our phone.

313
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,955
You know, it will take some time
to get regular customers.

314
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,374
I'll make you a deal.
Since I'm expecting a baby,

315
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,583
I could use help.

316
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,460
If you mind the store once in a while,

317
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,962
I'll let you have the room and the phone.

318
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,298
And I'll throw in a free breakfast, okay?

319
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,550
Yeah! We've got a deal.

320
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,802
I'm gonna work very hard for you.

321
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,723
Osono, you're the greatest.

322
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,068
Hmm?

323
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,423
Jiji, come on. I'm all through.

324
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,094
We're gonna go shopping. Come on.

325
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,613
Kiki, in the city,
you can't just run out into the street.

326
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,366
I'm sorry. We're still alive, aren't we?

327
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,201
You know how boys are.

328
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,373
He's so cute. I hope
he's still invited to her birthday party.

329
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,666
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

330
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,968
I wish I had something pretty to wear.
My dress is so ugly.

331
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,313
Wow! This costs so much.

332
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,649
Kiki, look. It's me.

333
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,497
Any money left, Kiki?

334
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:59,668
Not much. Looks like all we can
afford to eat now is pancakes.

335
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,265
Look, Jiji. Aren't they beautiful?

336
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,357
Hey. Pull over.

337
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,154
Hey, there.
Miss Witch, do you remember me?

338
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,489
How come you're not flying today?

339
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,867
It's me, you remember? Tombo.

340
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,705
You can tell she's a witch
"cause she always wears a dark dress.

341
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,875
Hey, wait. Come back, please.
I didn't mean to insult you.

342
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,586
- Yeah.
- Better luck next time, Tombo.

343
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,514
Oh, Kiki, perfect timing.

344
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,058
There's a lady here
who wants you to make a delivery.

345
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:00,520
- She's your first customer.
- Customer? Oh, my! I'll be right back.

346
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,582
Dear, this lady is a customer of ours,

347
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,001
and we were talking
about your new delivery service.

348
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,129
- What a charming girl.
- My name's Kiki, ma'am.

349
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,465
Osono's told me great things about you.

350
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,425
Do you think you can deliver this
by tonight?

351
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,219
Yeah. I can.

352
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,471
It's a birthday gift
for my nephew.

353
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:38,099
But something came up at work,
and I can't make it to the party on time.

354
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,477
I can get it there for you,
guaranteed.

355
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,145
Show me on the map
where you want it delivered.

356
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,439
Huh? But that's me.

357
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,317
Are you sure it won't be too far?

358
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,529
- I can fly there straight from here.
- Great. How much will it cost?

359
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,448
Oh! Well, I haven't really thought
about a price.

360
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,742
Aha! How about this much then?

361
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,162
I hope it'll be enough.
What do you think?

362
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,041
This much for me?
That's great. Thank you.

363
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,474
Yeah. I got to see this.

364
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,486
- She's the most amazing girl.
- She sure is.

365
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,989
Hey, what can you tell me about her?

366
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,884
Kiki, how high do you intend to go?

367
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:59,514
This is my first job, and I do not want
to be stopped by that traffic cop.

368
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,477
Well, don't look now,
but that's an airplane flying under us.

369
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:12,027
Now, let's see.
Yup. It's just past the cape.

370
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,157
- Here we go.
- Whoa, boy.

371
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,499
I'm getting to like this town
more and more.

372
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,376
I'm getting sick to my stomach.

373
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,172
I can't wait to write Mom and Dad
about my new business.

374
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,859
Look who's behind us. Wild geese.

375
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,197
And they're coming with us.

376
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,295
Hi.

377
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:26,017
- They seem awfully upset.
- They say they're going to fly higher.

378
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,977
- Huh?
- They say a gust of wind's coming.

379
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,062
Onh.

380
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,973
Oh! A nest!

381
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,559
Oh, I'm sorry.

382
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,979
Leave me alone.

383
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,984
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs. Really.

384
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,704
Oh, my goodness.

385
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,915
Well, it's your fault. The geese were
kind enough to warn us of that wind.

386
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,834
- But would you listen?
- Oh, be quiet.

387
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,922
Look at them. Up so high.

388
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,550
That gust of wind
took them all the way up.

389
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,762
Kiki, we've got a problem.
The toy fell out.

390
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,139
We've gotta go back.

391
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,862
They're calling you an egg stealer.

392
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,866
If I were you,
I wouldn't go back down there, again.

393
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,493
We have to. Hold on!

394
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,804
Hey. Stop that. Go away.

395
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,932
Leave us alone. Stop it.

396
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:45,740
- Maybe we better rethink our plan.
- Frankly, I think this is a major insult.

397
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,660
Crows used to serve witches
and do what you told them.

398
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,079
That was a long time ago, okay?

399
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,667
How about if we go in after dark?
Go in. Get it. Get out.

400
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,461
We won't be able to make it in time.

401
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,755
Unless we buy ourselves some time.

402
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,674
You gotta be kidding.

403
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:06,094
You can just pretend to be the doll
until 1 find the real one.

404
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,350
Don't worry. Hold still.

405
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,853
- Can I breathe?
- No, no breathing.

406
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,661
It must be my present from aunty.

407
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,788
Yeah. Give it to me.

408
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,419
This is dumb.

409
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,342
You're a bit late.

410
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,178
After my sister telephoned,
we were wondering where you were.

411
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,805
Uh, I'm sorry.

412
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,433
Um...

413
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,644
Could I please
have your signature, ma'am?

414
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,481
Mom, can I put the canary in here?

415
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,818
Uh-huh. But you be sure
not to let it fly away, Ket.

416
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,986
Okay.

417
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,450
I've gotta run. Bye!

418
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,288
Thank you. Enjoy your present.

419
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,795
Come on, you stupid bird.

420
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,674
I got a brand-new home for you.

421
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,597
Please hurry, Kiki.

422
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,673
I know you fell close by,
so you've got to be here somewhere.

423
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,562
There you are.

424
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,236
Hello. Anyone home?

425
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,947
Is anybody here? Anybody? Hello.

426
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,040
- Anybody here?
- Yes.

427
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,918
Stop shouting. I'm on the roof.
What do you want?

428
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,171
Why don't you come up?

429
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,684
What do you want?

430
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,354
Oh, well, you have a black cat
in your cabin window,

431
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,440
and, you see,
it's mine and I need it back.

432
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,111
You're a good birdie, aren't you?

433
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,198
So, why was it alone in the forest, huh?

434
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,869
That's where I dropped it.
Um. May I have it back, please?

435
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,955
I really need to finish this.

436
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,458
That's my girl.

437
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,711
You're just about through, okay?

438
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,639
Well, why didn't you tell me sooner
why you needed it in such a hurry?

439
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:43,227
He keeps me company. I've gotten
sort of fond of him, you know?

440
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,353
Thank you.

441
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,939
Oh! Oh, no!

442
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,650
His head's falling off.

443
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,737
Ooh, it must have been the crows. They
were making such a big fuss over him.

444
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,323
This is terrible. I can't deliver it like this.

445
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,949
Hmm.

446
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,620
Hey! I know.
How about we work out a deal?

447
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,709
So you're on your own at 13.
That's pretty exciting.

448
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,004
To be completely independent
and a witch. Impressive.

449
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,257
- How's it going?
- Trust me. He'll be good as new.

450
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,177
Almost done.

451
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,349
Ket, dear. Turn off the TV.

452
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,104
Your birthday guests
are gonna be here soon.

453
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,357
Ket. Did you hear me?

454
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,861
- Ket, turn off the TV!
- Okay, okay.

455
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,172
- I'm done.
- Thank you very much.

456
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,800
- Better go get Jiji before it's too late.
- But I haven't finished yet.

457
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,887
Don't worry. You've done enough.
Now, go on and get him.

458
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,180
Thanks.

459
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,609
Jeff likes my present more than me.

460
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,236
Jeff's such a funny dog.

461
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,198
He simply adores that stuffed cat.
He won't leave it alone.

462
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,741
I'll bet he thinks it's a puppy.

463
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,036
He'll be upset when Ket
wants to take it and play with it.

464
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,079
- He sure will. He sure will.
- That's okay.

465
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,540
Just don't forget to
send your aunt a thank-you note.

466
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,168
- Okay. Okay.
- Ket.

467
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,546
Well, I'm glad to see Jeff
excited about something.

468
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,673
He's getting to be such an old dog.

469
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:21,385
- Yeah. All he does is sleep all day.
- All day.

470
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:26,140
Ket, dear, go open the door.
Jeff wants to go out.

471
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,560
Jeff, shut the door
when you're done. Okay?

472
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,614
- There you are.
- What took you so long?

473
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,826
- I'm sorry.
- Jeff helped me escape.

474
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:51,499
Kiki, if we ask him, I bet he'll
take the stuffed one back inside.

475
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,752
He'll do it. He's a good dog.

476
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,928
Could you take this in, please?

477
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:37,211
- How are you? Hungry?
- No, I'm tired.

478
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,796
Yeah, me, too. I'm very tired.

479
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,133
We're both gonna sleep well tonight.

480
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,635
By the way, that painter
who found the stuffed cat

481
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,971
told me she wants to do
a drawing with me in it.

482
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,556
- Naked?
- Jiji.

483
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,487
Boring.

484
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,123
Wake up. You're supposed to be
minding the store.

485
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:40,000
I am, but today this place is boring.

486
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,128
But it always gets busy about this time.

487
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:45,339
I know that. That's not what I mean.

488
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,633
I mean, my customers.

489
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:51,095
Jiji, if nobody comes in,
I'm gonna have to eat pancakes forever

490
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,849
and be fat, fat, fat.

491
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,226
And what am I supposed
to do about that?

492
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,729
Well, I like pancakes,
provided they're not burned.

493
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,941
Look, fur ball, when you get as fat
and round as a pancake,

494
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,693
you see if I care.

495
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,203
Beautiful, isn't she?
They tell me she's a clothes designer.

496
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,457
Her designs may be fabulous,
but her cat's still a snob.

497
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,296
Hello. Good Cooking Pan Bakery.

498
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,756
What? Pardon? Uh, yes, ma'am.

499
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,634
About time we got a customer, huh?

500
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,345
Yes, ma'am, 4:30 will be a perfect time
to pick it up.

501
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,055
If you'll just...

502
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,267
And the address?
Yes. The blue roof. Right.

503
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,564
Yeah. I'm pretty sure I have it all.
And thank you very much, ma'am.

504
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,819
Hi.

505
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,997
I'll take this, please. Okay?

506
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,963
Thank you very much. Good afternoon.

507
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,174
Oh, come on.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

508
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,676
Listen, we're gonna have a huge party
at the club tonight.

509
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:17,056
It's called the Aviation Club,
and we'd really like for you to come.

510
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,058
Here's your invitation.

511
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,897
It's a serious club for kids
who are into flying and aircraft and stuff.

512
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,858
And, you know, everybody'd be
really excited if you came.

513
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,527
Yes. May I help you, sir?

514
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,530
They tell me
you have a delivery service.

515
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,199
Uh, oh. I'm sorry.
Yes, of course, we can handle it.

516
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,202
It's very urgent this package arrive
as soon as possible.

517
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,537
That's no problem.

518
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,165
Are you all right?

519
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,125
- I do this every day.
- Can I help you?

520
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,561
Well, I hope you make up
your mind by 6:00.

521
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:04,812
"Cause that's when I'll be by
to pick you up.

522
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,231
- See ya.
- How much will that be?

523
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,067
Will that be inside
or outside city limits, sir?

524
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,821
- I wrote the address on the box.
- Oh! Oh, the box. Oh, I'm sorry.

525
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,659
Osono! Osono! I've got a big problem.

526
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,329
I got an invitation to go to a party
at Tombo's flying club.

527
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,206
I'm sure it'll be a great party, Kiki.

528
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,251
No. But my problem is,
what am I going to wear?

529
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:31,130
Kiki, you haven't got a problem.
You look fine in that.

530
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,757
Besides, it makes you look
beautiful and mysterious.

531
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,384
- Really?
- How's work?

532
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:39,555
I almost forgot about that.
It's already 4:00. Oh, no.

533
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,767
Can you watch the store
until 1 get back, Osono?

534
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,936
Jiji? Jiji?

535
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,786
You were so mad at that boy.

536
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,205
I don't understand
why you're going to his party.

537
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,917
Please don't talk.
I'm trying to fly this broom, okay?

538
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,147
Thank you very much. Bye.

539
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,066
Come on, Jiji.

540
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,239
We can't keep
our next appointment waiting.

541
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,742
There's the blue roof.

542
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,838
Here we are.

543
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,944
My name's Kiki, and someone
telephoned for a delivery service,

544
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,154
so here I am.

545
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,031
Right this way, dear.

546
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:30,124
- You are right on time.
- Thank you.

547
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,880
Oh, madam, the delivery girl is here.

548
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,467
My, delivery time already?

549
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,972
Come in, dear.
Please make yourself right at home.

550
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,099
- Please do.
- Thanks.

551
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,143
May I take that for you?

552
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,520
Thank you.

553
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,695
Broom and a black cat.

554
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,990
Well, it's just as
my great-grandmother told me.

555
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:07,161
- My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch.
- Mmm-hmm.

556
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,330
Oh, my, what a pretty witch you are.

557
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:16,044
I'm so sorry, but that special treat you
were supposed to deliver isn't ready yet.

558
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,592
I think there's something wrong with it.

559
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:25,345
It's got a mind of its own,
and it doesn't want to heat up.

560
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:29,683
It's old. Like me, it's seen better days.

561
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,852
I was hoping you'd be able to deliver

562
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,605
a dish to my
granddaughter's birthday party.

563
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:38,859
It's my specialty,
herring and pumpkin potpie.

564
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,361
But I must admit defeat.

565
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:44,281
I'll have to phone her
and tell her I'm sorry.

566
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,158
I feel just awful
having you come here for nothing.

567
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:50,579
Barsa. Barsa.

568
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,792
Would you get Kiki's money, please?

569
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,084
Certainly, madam.

570
00:54:56,418 --> 00:55:00,255
- All of it. Pay her what we agreed on.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

571
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,926
Please accept it. This was all my fault.

572
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,385
Yes, but...

573
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,556
Ma'am, since I don't have
any other jobs, maybe I can help.

574
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,767
How about we use that old oven
over there?

575
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,311
Well, maybe.

576
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,733
It used to bake beautiful bread,
but I haven't baked in it lately.

577
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,486
Well, if it burns firewood,
I can help you.

578
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,113
I used to help my mom bake all the time.

579
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,241
But it's such a big job to build a fire.

580
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,911
A great idea, ma'am.
I never liked that electric thing.

581
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,248
- I think her plan is perfect.
- Ma'am, it'll work, really.

582
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,752
You think so? All right then. Let's try it.

583
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,426
Don't blame me
if you're late for your party.

584
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,387
I can't take her money and not help out.

585
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,355
Let's go.

586
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,526
Madam, here. Look what I found.

587
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:07,155
You're a very clever girl, my dear.
Your mother must be proud.

588
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,917
Oh, well, this is exciting.

589
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,587
Mmm-hmm. Yes, this is much better.

590
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,020
It should be about time.

591
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,314
Yes, the fire's almost ready.

592
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,201
Now we wait.

593
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,579
You think 40 minutes
should be about right?

594
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,415
Exactly right.
So why don't we take a little break?

595
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,834
Maybe I can help around the house
while the pie is baking.

596
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,837
Oh. How nice of you to offer.

597
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,508
- What a wonderful witch.
- There we go.

598
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,971
You're never gonna make the party
on time.

599
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,181
Stop worrying.

600
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,476
It'll only take me 15 minutes
if I fly there fast.

601
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,147
Would you like some hot tea?
It's no trouble.

602
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,944
Dear! What did you say to me
was the time of your party?

603
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:30,197
It's at 6:00,
but it's only 15 minutes away.

604
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:34,660
Oh, my goodness. I'm afraid
my clock runs about 10 minutes slow.

605
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,164
- I'm gonna be late.
- Check the potpie and see if it's ready.

606
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,834
Help. Barsa, come.

607
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,837
Quickly! We have to hurry.
Kiki is running very late.

608
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:54,221
- Is the pie baked? Is it ready?
- It seems fine. Now you'd better hurry.

609
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,305
Uh-huh.

610
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,983
- We're ready. Come on.
- Okay.

611
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,610
Let me pay you for your time.

612
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,071
- But that's much too much.
- Not for all of your help.

613
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,906
Hurry up. Hurry up.

614
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,034
- Have a good time now.
- Here you go.

615
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,202
- Bye-bye.
- Fly carefully.

616
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,461
We can beat the rain
if we just fly a little faster.

617
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,422
Not according to my whiskers.

618
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:54,031
Could we get out of the rain, please?
I'm begging you.

619
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:58,618
We can't. That'll make us even later,
and the food will get cold if we stop.

620
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,058
Yes? What do you want?

621
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,686
- I have a delivery.
- But it is soaking wet.

622
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,106
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.
It began to rain on the way.

623
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,358
But don't worry.
The food came through all right.

624
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,527
Oh, no. I told Grandma I didn't want that.

625
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,694
Hey, what'd you get?

626
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,989
Oh, Grandma sent me another one
of her crummy herring pies again.

627
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,533
Mmm, yummy. Herring pie.

628
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,702
Uh, will you please sign this receipt
for me?

629
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,289
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.

630
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,381
I cannot believe they're related.

631
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,604
Maybe we still have time.

632
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,422
Kiki, there he is.

633
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,841
Come on. We can catch him.

634
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,141
Kiki, we were all so worried about you.

635
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,602
And that poor boy waited
such a long time.

636
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,314
It doesn't matter anyway.
I can't go in these wet clothes.

637
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,622
Kiki, what's wrong?
Are you not feeling well?

638
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:52,209
Maybe we should eat something, okay?

639
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,862
Wake up, Kiki.

640
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:27,494
Hmm?

641
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,302
Not feeling very well, huh?

642
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:50,934
- You have quite a fever.
- My head's hurting so much.

643
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,187
Well, you flew in that weather
and you never really dried off.

644
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,525
- Do you think I'm going to die, Osono?
- Huh?

645
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,614
No, you're not.
I'll bring some medicine right up,

646
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,325
and maybe you should have
some potpie.

647
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,410
Not that.

648
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,121
Well, then, I'll just make
something else for you.

649
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:14,249
How about some nice hot oatmeal
with honey in it? You want some, too?

650
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,299
This oatmeal will pick you right up.

651
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,551
There you go. Here.

652
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,305
Now, don't burn your tongue.

653
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,977
You should come and eat your meal
while it's still warm.

654
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,564
- Here it is.
- Do I have to eat it?

655
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,190
Only if you want to get well.

656
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,819
Oh! You know that boy stopped by
to see you again today.

657
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,739
That's right.
When I told him you were sick,

658
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,366
he asked me how a witch
could catch cold in the first place.

659
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:53,204
Oh. And he said he wanted
to visit you a little later.

660
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,497
Oh, my gosh. No.

661
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,044
Well, I thought you might feel that way,
so I turned him down politely.

662
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:01,880
You must be tired.
You try to get some sleep.

663
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:05,467
Now, I'll just open up the window
so you'll have some fresh air.

664
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,268
- Osono?
- Hmm?

665
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,271
Um... Never mind.

666
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,634
Breakfast.

667
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,178
Jiji.

668
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,305
What?

669
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:56,643
Mmm. Hmm...

670
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,378
- Where are you?
- Kiki?

671
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,756
- Are you feeling better?
- A lot better. Thank you.

672
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,342
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I'd overslept.

673
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:32,929
That's okay. Come down later.
I have a favor to ask you.

674
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,681
- All right?
- Okay.

675
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,102
- The name is "Koppori"?
- Uh-huh. Now, take this money.

676
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,105
Oh, no, ma'am. No money. It's on me.

677
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:46,526
Impossible. Work is work,
and make sure you deliver it in person.

678
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,947
Jiji.

679
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,701
- What is it?
- We've got a delivery.

680
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,289
- Hey. Who's your friend there?
- Lily's her name. Be right there.

681
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:03,209
Stay there. I'll be right back.
He's all yours. Bye-bye.

682
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,761
It's so pretty and warm.

683
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:04,354
Hey. Hey, there, Miss Witch.

684
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,817
Taking a walk?

685
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,654
Uh-uh. I'm looking for someone
named Koppori.

686
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:15,198
Hey, that's my name. That's me.

687
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,702
If you go around that way,
I'll be right with you, okay?

688
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:20,954
Okay.

689
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,792
Osono, how could you do this to me?

690
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:28,920
Hi.

691
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,674
Gee, thanks a lot.

692
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,807
About the other night.
I'm sorry I didn't show up.

693
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:44,310
Huh? Mmm-mmm. I'm sorry
you had to end up so sick like that.

694
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:48,815
Hey, come over to my place.
There's something I wanna show you.

695
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,192
Oh, you gotta see it.

696
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,906
The party was to celebrate
the completion of this thing.

697
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:57,991
What do you think?

698
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,954
This is the engine
of a man-propelled plane.

699
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,414
Watch this.

700
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,419
We're going to assemble the wings and
the frame at somebody else's house.

701
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:13,631
I'm planning on flying this thing
during most of my summer vacation.

702
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,263
Miss Witch, I got a great idea.

703
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,182
Why don't we go down to the beach
where that dirigible landed yesterday?

704
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:26,185
- Dirigible?
- Don't tell me you didn't hear about it?

705
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:28,896
- I was sick.
- Then we gotta see it. Let's do it.

706
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,941
- We're going on this?
- Why not?

707
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,445
I have to practice all the time anyway.
Gotta build up my legs.

708
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,572
Okay. Ready?

709
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:38,865
Um...

710
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,957
- This is my first time on a bike.
- Oh, boy. Just hold on.

711
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:52,128
Brace the bike with your foot
until 1 get her revved up. Let's go.

712
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,261
Okay.

713
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,808
Kick off. Now! Good!

714
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,190
- Should I get off?
- No.

715
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:40,593
Hey, look at that. Whoa.

716
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,391
Bye!

717
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:49,185
Lean your body to the inside
when we go around the curve.

718
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,311
Why?

719
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:52,855
Because otherwise
we're gonna have trouble turning.

720
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,566
Now.

721
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,947
Great. You're doing fine.

722
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,494
Now, put your weight into it again.
That's it!

723
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,329
We're quite a team.

724
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,583
All right. We're doing great.

725
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,465
Wow.

726
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,846
- That's the dirigible, right?
- Right.

727
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,773
We're flying.

728
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,068
Oh, my God!

729
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:44,991
Oh, boy!

730
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,093
What happened, Tombo?
Are you okay?

731
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:07,096
- Yeah. Are you?
- I'm okay.

732
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,854
What are you laughing at?

733
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,360
- Hmm?
- Your face.

734
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,536
Do I really look that funny?

735
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:36,709
I'm sorry, but when we flew up,
I was so scared.

736
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,089
Yeah, me, too.

737
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,967
Was it your magic
that made us stay up?

738
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:47,345
I'm not sure. Anything's possible.

739
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,056
Your bike's a real mess.

740
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,685
My propeller. I have to go get it, Kiki.

741
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,312
Will you keep an eye
on my bike for me?

742
01:11:56,395 --> 01:12:00,399
- Uh-huh. What went wrong?
- I think I pedaled too hard.

743
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,402
That's why it busted.
You wait here. I'll be right back.

744
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:29,345
How great would it be to go
around the world in a dirigible like that?

745
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,223
Of course, you were flying
since you were very young, huh?

746
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:35,142
Well, yes. Since I was a baby.

747
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:38,062
My mother used to take me with her.
She taught me never to be scared.

748
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:42,108
Gosh. You're so lucky, Kiki.
I wish I could fly.

749
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,735
People like you can just fly away
on a broomstick.

750
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,028
But me?

751
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,031
That's all I can do.

752
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:52,493
Flying used to be fun
until 1 started doing it for a living.

753
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,455
Hey, wait. You can't not enjoy flying.
You're a witch.

754
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,000
I know. I still feel that way though.

755
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:03,421
But I'm very glad I came with you today.
I feel much better sitting by the beach.

756
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,214
Why don't I bring you here
whenever you want

757
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,341
and train myself at the same time?

758
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:10,386
- You're a very nice person.
- Huh? You just found that out?

759
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,055
Sorry. But at first I thought
you were such a clown.

760
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,640
You know, my mom says
the same thing.

761
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,100
"Don't be such a clown.

762
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:19,061
"Quit looking up at the sky,
and get back to your books."

763
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,815
- Look at him.
- Tombo!

764
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,569
- Hey, Tombo!
- Huh?

765
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:30,072
- Guess what's up, Tombo?
- What?

766
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:33,868
Something really great.
You're gonna love it. Come on over.

767
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,120
I'll be back in a sec, okay?

768
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,793
We're all gonna get to go
for a ride in the blimp.

769
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,462
Really? Wow! That's great.

770
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,297
Hey, who's your friend?

771
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,007
That's Kiki. I'll get her to come over.

772
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,009
Hey, come over and meet the gang, Kiki.

773
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:53,346
We're all going for a tour
inside the Spirit of Freedom.

774
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,683
- Thanks, but I don't want to.
- Oh. Why not? It'll be fun.

775
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:01,187
She made a delivery
to my house on my birthday.

776
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,273
- You mean, she's working, at her age?
- Well, I'll be.

777
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,776
Come on.
I'll introduce you to everybody.

778
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:10,738
- No thanks. See you later.
- What's the matter?

779
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,200
Hey!

780
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,744
What are you so mad about?

781
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,455
I'm not mad at all, Tombo.
I have a lot on my mind.

782
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,874
So, please, just leave me alone.

783
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:23,459
Huh?

784
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:28,381
Forget her, Tombo. Come on.

785
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,189
And don't forget
that this summer, the hit music...

786
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:08,189
Jiji, 1 think something's wrong with me.

787
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:12,109
I meet a lot of people, and at first
everything seems to be going okay,

788
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:15,196
but then I start feeling like
such an outsider.

789
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,074
You should have seen
how Tombo's friends looked at me.

790
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,994
Hey, where are you going?

791
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,164
Oh.

792
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,374
Some friend you are.

793
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:43,390
Kiki's
Delivery Service

794
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:01,200
Hey! You know,
you can't be late for every meal

795
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,244
just because you have a new girlfriend.

796
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,329
And you can wash your plate yourself.

797
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,208
Why are you talking like a cat?

798
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,506
Huh?

799
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,425
Oh, my.

800
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:20,469
Oh, no. Talk to me, Jiji.

801
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,972
You mean you can't speak anymore?

802
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:27,726
Jiji?

803
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:29,770
What's going on with him?

804
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:32,148
I can't understand anything
he's trying to say.

805
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,860
What if it means... Oh, my goodness.

806
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,593
I'm losing my witch's powers.

807
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:03,280
What do you mean?
You haven't lost your magic, have you?

808
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:05,449
It's become very weak, so I...

809
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:08,494
Well, I think I've got to take
a break from my delivery work.

810
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,996
But I promise I'll be really good
with my work in the bakery,

811
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,998
so please let me stay
in the room upstairs.

812
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,209
Well, that's no problem.

813
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:18,379
I'll bet your powers come back
after you've had some rest.

814
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,632
I really don't know.
Maybe if I make a new broom.

815
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,721
Hey. Look at that.

816
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,634
Hi, Kiki. It's me, Tombo.
Did you see me today?

817
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,303
I was waving at you from the dirigible,

818
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,597
'cause the captain let me come into
the control cabin during the test run.

819
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,308
Boy, did I have a cool time.

820
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:16,687
- Hello? Kiki? Are you there?
- Please don't call me anymore.

821
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,981
What did you say?
I can barely hear you.

822
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,442
You know what the captain said...

823
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,819
What? Kiki? She hung up.

824
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,908
What's the matter, dear?
Is there anything I can do for you?

825
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,995
I'm still in training to become a witch.

826
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,790
If I lose my magic, that means
I've lost absolutely everything.

827
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,125
Kiki.

828
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:00,939
Uh-huh. It's right over there
across the street.

829
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:07,946
Kiki? Kiki?

830
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,157
Hey!

831
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,701
- Hi.
- Hi.

832
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,203
Well, since you didn't come
and visit me,

833
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,206
- I thought I'd come here and visit you.
- I'm sorry.

834
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,958
Well, that's sort of a white lie.
I need to do some shopping, too.

835
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,212
Come on in, 'cause I'm done now,
and I can take a break, okay?

836
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,631
You better believe I will.

837
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,719
Nice place you have.

838
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,055
Help yourself to some of these,
and I'll go make us some tea.

839
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,265
No tea, thanks,
but some milk if you have any.

840
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:36,475
Sure.

841
01:21:42,106 --> 01:21:44,233
Hey, there. Unbelievable.

842
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,402
You're the spitting image
of that stuffed cat.

843
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:49,696
I bet your name's Jiji, right?
Coming through.

844
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:53,158
So, how's the delivery biz?
You making any money?

845
01:21:57,204 --> 01:22:00,332
- That bad, huh?
- I'm not working much now.

846
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,793
Mmm-hmm.

847
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:13,262
Hmm. I kind of thought
you looked unhappy.

848
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:16,265
I didn't know things like that
happened to witches.

849
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:24,690
Hey! Why don't you come
and stay at my cabin?

850
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:26,066
Huh?

851
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:30,195
It'll probably make you feel better.
Your boss would let you have a break.

852
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:32,030
How about it, kitty-cat? Wanna come?

853
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,534
Hmm?

854
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,662
Rather be with your girlfriend, huh?

855
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:40,789
Come on, girl. Why not?
We'll leave now.

856
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:42,958
Uh-huh.

857
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:47,880
Come on.

858
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,886
Hurry. Hurry. The bus is leaving.

859
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:45,771
Okay, now I'm officially exhausted.

860
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:48,732
It's beautiful here.

861
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:00,077
What's the matter with you?

862
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,204
Must've been blinded by two
beautiful girls in front of him.

863
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:11,797
Hey!

864
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:28,146
Huh? You really thought I was a boy?

865
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,649
Well, it's the way you're dressed
and all.

866
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,152
Tell me. What kind of a boy
has these legs, mister?

867
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:46,081
- You get along with the crows.
- Yup. We've become real close friends.

868
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:49,418
- Wow!
- Hello, everybody. I'm home again.

869
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:52,379
Good afternoon. I wanna say I'm sorry.

870
01:24:57,509 --> 01:25:00,429
Why don't you go inside,
and I'll go get some water?

871
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:01,638
Okay.

872
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,820
- Like it?
- Yes.

873
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:01,907
I have to say I became inspired
after the first time we met.

874
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:05,452
But I really haven't got the face right.

875
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,665
I've been waiting for you to come back
so I can try again.

876
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:12,000
- You mean that's me?
- Sure is.

877
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:14,461
You'd make my life easier
if you'd model for me.

878
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:17,798
But I'm not very beautiful.
What do you want me to do that for?

879
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:24,221
Come on, Kiki.
You have got a great face.

880
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:25,681
You're very pretty.

881
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:28,767
Now, don't you be nervous.
Sit down over here.

882
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:37,609
Raise your chin up a little.
Look straight ahead. Now, don't move.

883
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,822
Painting and magical powers
seem very much the same.

884
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,782
Sometimes I'm unable to paint a thing.

885
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,660
You mean it?
Then what? What happens?

886
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:50,163
Kiki, please, don't move.
It's hard to draw a moving target.

887
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:55,043
Without even thinking about it,
I used to be able to fly.

888
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:58,797
Now I'm trying to look inside myself
to find out how I did it.

889
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,049
But I just can't figure it out.

890
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,885
You know, it could be
you're working at it too hard.

891
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:06,012
Maybe you should just take a break.

892
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,765
Yeah, but still, if I can't fly...

893
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:12,102
Then stop trying. Take long walks.
Look at the scenery.

894
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:15,147
Doze off at noon.
Don't even think about flying.

895
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,733
And then, pretty soon,
you'll be flying again.

896
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:21,778
- You think my problems will...
- Go away? That's right.

897
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:24,114
It's gonna be fine. I promise.

898
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:46,553
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to become an artist.

899
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:48,555
I loved to paint so much.

900
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:51,641
I'd paint all day until I fell asleep
right at my easel.

901
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:54,936
And then one day, for some reason,
I just couldn't paint anymore.

902
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:58,815
I tried and tried,
but nothing I did seemed any good.

903
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:03,695
They were copies of paintings
I'd seen somewhere before,

904
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,448
and not very good copies, either.

905
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,409
I just felt like I'd lost my ability.

906
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:11,787
That sounds like me.

907
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,792
It's exactly the same,
but then I found the answer.

908
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:20,128
You see, I hadn't figured out
what or why I wanted to paint.

909
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,297
I had to discover my own style.

910
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,467
When you fly, you rely on
what's inside of you, don't you?

911
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:28,261
Uh-huh. We fly with our spirit.

912
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,932
Trusting your spirit. Yes, yes!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

913
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:36,728
That same spirit is what makes me paint
and makes your friend bake.

914
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:40,482
But we each need to find
our own inspiration, Kiki.

915
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,734
Sometimes it's not easy.

916
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,322
I guess I never gave much thought
to why I wanted to do this.

917
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:51,034
I got so caught up
in all the training and stuff.

918
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:54,538
Maybe I have to find my own inspiration.

919
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:59,167
But am I ever going to find it?
And is it worth all the trouble?

920
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:01,503
Well, for example,
there were quite a few times

921
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:04,506
when I thought of painting
something over that painting.

922
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:07,342
But it ended up being so great.

923
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:08,802
So I guess it's worth it.

924
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:11,805
Today when I saw you,
I thought, "I wanna paint."

925
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:15,267
- You've got such a great face.
- That's why I came?

926
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,688
Hey, well, it's better than you
cleaning my floor again.

927
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:22,566
- Let's turn out the lights and go to sleep.
- Okay.

928
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,152
Sorry about taking your bed from you.

929
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:27,612
Ah, no problem.

930
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:33,577
- So you really think I'll fly again?
- Sure.

931
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,204
You'll just have to wait for
the right inspiration to come along.

932
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,498
- You understand?
- Uh-huh.

933
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:45,255
And there it is, folks,
the Spirit of Freedom.

934
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:46,590
Recently downed in a spectacular
forced landing...

935
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:50,510
...due to torrential rains
just outside the city limits.

936
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,721
Well, it's been repaired,
and is now in final preparation...

937
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,015
Yes?
Good Cooking Pan Bakery.

938
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,142
Kiki. How are you?

939
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,896
Well, you take plenty of time
coming home.

940
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:03,899
Oh, and by the way, that older woman
you made a delivery for?

941
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,901
- Uh-huh.
- She has another delivery for you.

942
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,485
I said I wasn't sure you could do it.

943
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:11,364
She was really very insistent.
What do you think, Kiki?

944
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:15,410
Great. Stop there
on your way back. Bye.

945
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,204
Thank you so much for everything.

946
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:38,892
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Well, well, we've been expecting you.

947
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,311
Thanks.

948
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:45,815
There are
less than five minutes to takeoff now.

949
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:49,569
Um. It's very nice
to see you again, ma'am.

950
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:52,948
I'm glad you came.
Please excuse me for not standing.

951
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,492
My legs are bothering me
more than usual.

952
01:30:55,575 --> 01:31:00,705
- Barsa, bring the package now.
- Gosh, I hope it hasn't taken off.

953
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:05,710
Not yet. Barsa is absolutely mad
about lighter-than-air travel.

954
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:08,129
- I'm the adventuresome type.
- Mmm-hmm.

955
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,715
Could you turn it down, please?

956
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:14,052
Would you do me a favor
and open the box?

957
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,553
Yup.

958
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:24,312
I don't get it.

959
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:27,607
Would you please bring this
to a young delivery girl?

960
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:29,651
She was kind to me
and a very big help.

961
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,695
It's my way of saying thank you.

962
01:31:31,778 --> 01:31:35,198
Ah, yes, and can you find out
when her next birthday is?

963
01:31:35,365 --> 01:31:37,701
Then I can bake her another one.

964
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:45,250
Kiki?

965
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:52,257
Of course, I will. And maybe the young
girl will want to know the lady's birthday,

966
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:55,343
because she'll be able
to give her a present to repay her.

967
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:56,845
You've got a deal.

968
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:14,946
- What happened?
- Oh, there's been a terrible accident.

969
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:28,084
Oh, darn this old thing.
And just when it was getting good.

970
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:31,463
Midsummer is always
when these winds come.

971
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,673
They'll be hitting us any minute.

972
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:37,135
Goodness. It's a strong one.

973
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:40,055
It'll pass quickly. Don't worry.

974
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:43,475
Oh, goody! It's back on. Look.

975
01:32:44,851 --> 01:32:47,854
Oh, look at that.
It's completely upside down.

976
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:49,647
Freak winds blowing in from the sea.

977
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:54,110
- It has broken loose from...
- My, my. How terrible.

978
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:56,321
A desperate
last-ditch effort is being made

979
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,073
to tie the dirigible to the ground

980
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,824
and keep it from drifting into the air.

981
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:03,620
But it's extremely doubtful whether
or not this can actually be done.

982
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,997
Oh, no, no. It's useless.

983
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:08,500
The tremendous lifting power
of the helium balloon

984
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,043
is lifting the police patrol car...

985
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:13,254
That's Tombo.
That's my friend hanging on that rope.

986
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:14,714
It's being lifted like a toy.

987
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:17,300
Oh, no, there's a young boy
hanging onto the cable.

988
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,761
He's being lifted away together
with the police car.

989
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,763
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

990
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,641
The dirigible
is being blown towards town.

991
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:29,771
- Are you sure it's your friend, my dear?
- I have to go.

992
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,524
- Be careful.
- Oh, dear. Oh! Oh!

993
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,370
- Come on. Over here.
- Over here.

994
01:33:57,298 --> 01:34:00,635
Hold on there, son.
Just hold your grip steady.

995
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,428
Release the helium from the tail. Quick!

996
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:34,085
All citizens
are kindly requested to remain calm.

997
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:41,050
Sir, is there any word about the boy?

998
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:44,804
All I know is that the radio said
that the police car dropped into a pool.

999
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:49,851
He's still up there.

1000
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,111
Stay out of the street.

1001
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:04,824
Get on the sidewalks. You there.
Young lady. Don't block the street.

1002
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,410
Do not block the street.

1003
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:09,746
Are you all right, young lady?

1004
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,878
Please, sir, may I use your broom
for a minute?

1005
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:19,547
- What?
- Please. I promise I'll bring it right back.

1006
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:21,466
Huh? I'm not gonna give you
my broom...

1007
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:23,218
- Thank you very much.
- Hey!

1008
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:00,838
Fly.

1009
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:07,011
Watch out!

1010
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:35,373
Come on, broom, fly for me.

1011
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:44,716
Ladies and gentlemen,
it appears that the blimp

1012
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,801
is heading directly for the clock tower.

1013
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:50,179
And look! The young boy is safe,
but he's clutching that rope for dear life.

1014
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:53,308
If the wind doesn't shift, the Spirit
of Freedom will smash into the tower!

1015
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:57,270
We gotta get up higher
or else we'll hit the tower, Captain.

1016
01:36:57,353 --> 01:37:01,399
There's not enough helium.
Jump onto the tower before we hit.

1017
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:03,109
Aye, aye, Captain.

1018
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:05,486
Hey, there. Over here. Come on.

1019
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,488
Get outta the way.
The blimp's gonna crash!

1020
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,365
Grab a hold of this.

1021
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:21,794
Go!

1022
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:27,050
Hurry up.

1023
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:34,599
Hey!

1024
01:37:43,816 --> 01:37:45,985
We are listening to the sound
of a helium gas leak.

1025
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:49,322
The condition of the boy is unknown,
but from where I'm standing...

1026
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:58,206
It's falling. Too much gas has escaped.
It's coming down!

1027
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:09,884
It's snagged on the building
across the street...

1028
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:12,345
Hey, look. Over there.

1029
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:13,471
It's a miracle.

1030
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,391
The young boy has somehow managed
to keep his hold on the rope.

1031
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,893
But how can anyone rescue him now?

1032
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:21,771
That brave young boy
is hanging on for dear life.

1033
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,357
He can't... Something just flew by.

1034
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:28,444
It's a bird? No, it's not a bird.
It's a young girl. No.

1035
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:31,406
It's a young witch soaring through
the sky, and she's riding...

1036
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:33,574
- Go, Kiki.
- Oh, my.

1037
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:35,034
She can fly again.

1038
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,911
Get him, Kiki.

1039
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,496
- Tombo.
- Kiki.

1040
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:40,456
Tombo.

1041
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:45,336
Come on. Be a good broom.
Hold on, Tombo.

1042
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:48,756
Hang in there, my good lad.

1043
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:55,847
- Kiki.
- Tombo.

1044
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:03,104
And she's trying to reach the boy!

1045
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:06,691
- You can do it. Yes.
- Don't give up now, sonny.

1046
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:09,026
Come on!

1047
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:11,737
Don't give up. Don't give up.

1048
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:14,991
Don't give up. Don't give up.
Don't give up.

1049
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:25,376
She got him. She saved the boy.
I've never seen anything so amazing.

1050
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:35,386
Congratulations, young lady.

1051
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:42,310
Now, she's bringing him
down to land, safe and sound.

1052
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:44,937
She actually caught the boy in midair.

1053
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:47,857
You saw it all live as she saved his life.

1054
01:39:48,524 --> 01:39:51,152
That broom she used was mine.
That was my broom, you know.

1055
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,362
Oh, Barsa. Oh, my.

1056
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:58,576
Kiki was so brave.
She really saved the day.

1057
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:03,956
Better call the hospital, honey.
I think it's time now.

1058
01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:13,799
Jiji.

1059
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:54,460
Hey!

1060
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:57,838
Listen, we just got a letter from Kiki.

1061
01:42:57,922 --> 01:42:58,964
Huh?

1062
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,636
"Dear Mother and Father,
How are you doing?

1063
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:06,889
"I'm happy to say that Jiji and I
are doing fine at the moment."

1064
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:09,475
My delivery service
is a big success.

1065
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:11,477
I've really started to gain
some confidence

1066
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,938
and everything is falling into place.

1067
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:17,316
There are still some times
when I feel a little homesick,

1068
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,111
but all in all, I sure love this city.
