1
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:21,813
I'll miss you,
Chihiro. Your best friend, Rumi.

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,859
Chihiro,
Chihiro, we're almost there.

3
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,988
This really is
in the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,783
I'm gonna have to go to
the next town to shop.

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,036
We'll just have to learn to like it.

6
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,456
Look, Chihiro, there's your new school.

7
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,125
Looks great, doesn't it?

8
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,045
It doesn't look so bad.

9
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,389
It's gonna stink, I liked my old school.

10
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,186
Mom! My flowers are dying.

11
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,022
I told you not to
smother them like that.

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,776
We'll put them in water
when we get to our new home.

13
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,821
1 finally get a bouquet,
and it's a goodbye present.

14
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:11,697
That's depressing.

15
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,907
Daddy bought you a
rose for your birthday.

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,200
Don't you remember?

17
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,412
Yeah, one. Just one
rose isn't a bouquet.

18
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,039
Hold on to your
card, I'm opening the window.

19
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,793
And quit whining, it's fun
to move to a new place.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,047
It's an adventure.

21
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,124
Wait. Did I take the wrong turn?

22
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,252
This can't be right.

23
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,255
- Look, there's our house.
- Huh?

24
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,591
It's that blue one on the end.

25
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,511
Oh, you're right, I must
have missed the turnoff.

26
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,013
This road should get us there.

27
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,389
Honey don't take a shortcut,

28
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,891
you always get us lost.

29
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,227
- Trust me, it's gonna work.
- What are those stones?

30
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,022
- They look like little houses.
- They're shrines.

31
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:30,776
Some people think little
spirits live there.

32
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,490
Dad, I think we're lost.

33
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,826
We're fine, I've got four-wheel drive.

34
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,081
Sit down, please, sweetie.

35
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,723
Honey, honey, honey!

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,185
Slow down! You're gonna kill us.

37
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,436
What's that?

38
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,455
- What's this old building?
- It looks like an entrance.

39
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,292
Honey, get back in the
car, we're going to be late.

40
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,210
Chihiro.

41
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,588
Oh, for heaven's sake.

42
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,091
This building's not old. It's fake.

43
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,344
These stones are just made of plaster.

44
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,355
<i>The wind's pulling us in.</i>

45
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,107
- What is it?
- Come on, let's go in.

46
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,192
I wanna see what's on the other side.

47
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,903
I'm not going. It gives me the creeps.

48
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,322
Don't be such a scaredy-cat, Chihiro.

49
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,949
Let's just take a look.

50
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,702
The movers will get to
our house before we do.

51
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,746
It's all right,
they've got the keys.

52
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,122
They can start without us.

53
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,376
- All right just a quick look.
- Forget it, I'm not going.

54
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,629
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here.

55
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,214
Come on, honey. It'll be fun.

56
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,674
I'm not going!

57
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,478
Chihiro, just wait in the car then.

58
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,646
But, Mom!

59
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,692
Wait for me!

60
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,408
Everybody, watch your step.

61
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,787
Chihiro, don't cling like
that, you'll make me trip.

62
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,611
What is this place?

63
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,655
Oh, do you hear that?

64
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,998
It sounds like a train.

65
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,750
We must be near a train station.

66
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,586
Come on. Let's go check it out.

67
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,624
What are those weird buildings?

68
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,750
I knew it.

69
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,546
It's an abandoned theme park. See?

70
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,842
They built them everywhere
in the early '90s.

71
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,804
Then the economy went bad,
and they all went bankrupt.

72
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,890
This must be one of them.

73
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,934
Where are you going, you
said just a quick look!

74
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,519
Now let's go back.

75
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,817
Hey!

76
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,995
Did you hear that
building, it was moaning.

77
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,622
It's just the wind.

78
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,624
Oh, what a beautiful place.

79
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,833
We should have brought our lunch.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,544
Then we could have had a picnic.

81
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,591
Look, they were planning
to put a river here.

82
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,508
Hmm?

83
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,138
Hey, you smell that?

84
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,225
- Something smells delicious.
- Yeah, and I'm starving.

85
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,354
Maybe this theme park's
still in business, let's go.

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,314
Chihiro, hurry it up.

87
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,732
Wait a minute.

88
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,755
Over there.

89
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,141
This way.

90
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,441
How strange. They're all restaurants.

91
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,276
Where is everybody?

92
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,571
Ah, there it is.

93
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,120
Hey, I found it!

94
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,050
Hey, you gotta see this, in here.

95
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,430
Ah, look at this.

96
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,599
Hello in there, does anybody work here?

97
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,560
Come in, Chihiro. It looks delicious.

98
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,394
Mm-mmm.

99
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,311
Anybody?

100
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,903
Don't worry, honey we can pay
the bill when they get back.

101
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,281
Good plan. Hey, that looks great.

102
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,950
I wonder what this is called.

103
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,580
Oh, it's delicious, Chihiro,
you have to taste this.

104
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,624
I don't want any, we're
gonna get in trouble.

105
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,126
Let's just get out of here.

106
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,254
Don't worry, you've got Daddy here.

107
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,882
He's got credit cards and cash.

108
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,971
Chihiro, you have to
try this it's so tender.

109
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:15,889
Mm-mmm.

110
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,267
- Mustard?
- Thank you.

111
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,363
Come on, you guys you can't!

112
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,976
That's weird.

113
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,488
It's a bathhouse.

114
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,883
There's the train.

115
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,770
You shouldn't be here,
get out of here now!

116
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,606
- What?
- It's almost night.

117
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,941
Leave, before it gets dark.

118
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,279
They're lighting the
lamps. Get out of here.

119
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,238
You've gotta get across the river.

120
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:41,451
Go, I'll distract them!

121
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,006
What's up with him?

122
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,682
Mom! Dad!

123
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,477
Come on! Quit eating!

124
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,395
Let's get out of here!

125
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,258
Mom, Dad, where are you?

126
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,602
Mommy!

127
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,376
Water?

128
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,599
What?

129
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,935
I'm dreaming! I'm dreaming!

130
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,023
Come on wake up, wake up!

131
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,358
Wake up.

132
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,660
It's just a dream, it's
just a dream, go away.

133
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,078
Away. Disappear.

134
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,048
I'm see-through!

135
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,428
It's just a bad dream.

136
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,166
Ah!

137
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,461
Oh!

138
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,429
You're thriving, ah, yes.

139
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,806
Looking forward
to a relaxing time.

140
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,182
Quite a long journey.

141
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,519
I hope they have something...

142
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,442
Don't be afraid, I just wanna help you.

143
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,610
No, no, no!

144
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,613
Open your mouth and eat this.

145
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,156
You have to eat some food from this world,

146
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,408
or else you'll disappear.

147
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,325
No!

148
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,291
Don't worry it won't
turn you into a pig.

149
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,044
Chew it and swallow.

150
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,097
There you go, you're all better.

151
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,598
See for yourself.

152
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,567
- I'm okay.
- You see?

153
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,404
- Now, come with me.
- Where are my mom and dad?

154
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,031
They, didn't really turn
into pigs, did they?

155
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,368
You can't see them now, but you will.

156
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't move.

157
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,060
That bird's looking for you,
you've gotta get out of here.

158
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,855
My legs! I can't stand up.

159
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,523
Help! What do I do?

160
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,276
Calm down, take a deep breath.

161
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,825
In the name of the wind and
water within thee, unbind her.

162
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:33,868
Get up.

163
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,611
Welcome. Welcome.

164
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,114
Always nice to see you, welcome back.

165
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,616
Welcome. Welcome.

166
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,744
Welcome back!

167
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,623
You have to hold your breath
while we cross the bridge.

168
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,334
Even the tiniest breath
will break the spell,

169
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,337
and then everyone will see you.

170
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,547
Wonderful to see you.

171
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,925
- Nice to see you.
- Welcome back.

172
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,385
I'm scared.

173
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,345
Now just stay calm.

174
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,973
Welcome, welcome always nice to see you.

175
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,017
Welcome back, welcome, welcome.

176
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,228
- I'm back from my mission.
- Ahh, welcome.

177
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,980
Welcome back, Master Haku.

178
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,815
Take a deep breath.

179
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,858
Hold it.

180
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,128
Welcome, welcome!

181
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,339
Welcome back, good to see you.

182
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,134
Hang on. Almost there.

183
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,385
Master Haku!

184
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,138
Where have you been?

185
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,432
Wha, a human?

186
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:25,062
Let's go!

187
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,655
Huh, hah, huh?

188
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,996
- Master Haku!
- Oh, Master Haku?

189
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,375
Hurry, boy, boy, boy,
it stinks up the place!

190
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,295
- They know you're here.
- I'm sorry, I took a breath.

191
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,714
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

192
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,175
Listen carefully to what ll tell you to do.

193
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,093
You can't stay here, they'll find you,

194
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,054
and you'll never get
to rescue your parents.

195
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,680
I'll create a diversion while you escape.

196
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,975
No don't leave me, I
don't wanna be alone.

197
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,352
You don't have any choice,

198
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,187
if you want to help your parents.

199
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,898
This is what you have to do.

200
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,276
They did turn into
pigs, I wasn't dreaming.

201
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,153
Don't worry.

202
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,324
Now, when things quiet down,
go out through the back gate.

203
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,617
Go all the way down the stairs

204
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,577
until you reach the boiler room,

205
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,913
where they stoke the fires.

206
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,416
There you'll find Kamaji, the boiler man.

207
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,294
Kamaji?

208
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,921
Tell him you want to work here.

209
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,132
Even if he refuses, you must insist.

210
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,636
If you don't get a job, Yubaba
will turn you into an animal.

211
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,471
Yubaba. Huh?

212
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,265
You'll see she's the witch
who rules the bathhouse.

213
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,975
Kamaji will try to turn you away

214
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,644
or trick you into leaving,

215
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,938
but just keep asking for work.

216
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,982
It'll be hard work, but
you'll be able to stay here.

217
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,276
Then, even Yubaba can't harm you.

218
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,571
- Master Haku?
- Master Haku, where are you?

219
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,492
I have to go and don't forget,
Chihiro, I'm your friend.

220
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,577
How did you know my name's Chihiro?

221
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,913
I've known you since
you were very small.

222
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,542
Good luck, and whatever
you do, don't make a sound.

223
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,878
- Master Haku?
- Calm down, I'm coming.

224
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,924
Master Haku,
Yubaba wants to see you.

225
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,845
I know, it's
about my mission, right?

226
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,816
There's a human
somewhere, we must find him.

227
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,443
Let's go this way.

228
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,156
Wait for me, wait for me, wait!

229
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,491
Come on, everything's fine.

230
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,135
Uh, hello, excuse me.

231
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:39,770
Uh, hello?

232
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,279
Uh, hello are you Kamaji?

233
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,197
Eh?

234
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,289
Haku told me to come
here and ask you for work.

235
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,959
Could you give me a job please?

236
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,049
Four bath tokens at once.

237
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,302
Come on get to work, you little runts.

238
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,180
Yeah, I'm Kamaji,

239
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,017
slave to the boiler that heats the baths.

240
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,602
Move it, ya stupid soot balls.

241
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,605
Please, I've gotta get a job here.

242
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,524
I don't need any help.

243
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,485
The place is full of soot,
ll just cast a spell on them

244
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,321
and I've got all the workers I need.

245
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:49,757
Oh sorry.

246
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,634
Wait, just a second.

247
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,024
Out of the way.

248
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,246
What should I do with this?

249
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,546
Should ll leave it here?

250
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,382
Finish what you started, human.

251
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:16,486
Hey, you runts, you wanna
turn back into soot?

252
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,073
And you, back off, you can't
just take someone else's job.

253
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,034
If they don't work, the spell wears off.

254
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,660
They turn back into soot.

255
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,873
There's no work for you here,
got it, try somewhere else!

256
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:40,093
You soot balls got a problem,
now get back to work!

257
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,931
Chow time, what's going on?

258
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,350
Are you guys fighting again?

259
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,852
Where's your other bowl?

260
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,021
- Oh, ahh.
- From yesterday?

261
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,066
I keep telling you to
leave it out, Kamaji.

262
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,193
Meal time take a break!

263
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,961
A human! You're in trouble.

264
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,798
You're the one everyone's looking for.

265
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:21,385
- She's my granddaughter.
- Granddaughter?

266
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,637
She said she wants to work here,

267
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,264
but I've got all the help I need.

268
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,767
Will you take her to see Yubaba
she's a tough little girl.

269
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,852
<i>! think she can handle it.</i>

270
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,647
No way, I'm not gonna risk my life.

271
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:37,401
What if I give you
this roasted newt, hmm?

272
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,404
It's a good one.

273
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,366
If you want a job, you'll have
to make a deal with Yubaba.

274
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,743
She's the head honcho here.

275
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,915
Give me that, come on little
girl, you better follow me.

276
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,132
Can't you even manage a
yes, ma'am or a thank you?

277
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:00,966
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,884
What a dope. Hurry up.

279
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,052
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,557
You don't need
your shoes or your socks.

281
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,059
- Just leave 'em.
- Yes, ma'am.

282
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,524
Thank the boiler man, you idiot.

283
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,778
You know, he's really
sticking his neck out for you.

284
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,656
Thank you, Mr. Boiler Man!

285
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,616
Good luck.

286
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,337
We have to go all the
way to the top floor.

287
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,589
That's where Yubaba lives.

288
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,312
Get over here.

289
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,111
You wanna lose your nose?

290
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,540
More appetizers.

291
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,086
They're not spicy enough.

292
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,845
We're halfway there just stay close.

293
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,763
Okay.

294
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,602
Here we go.

295
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,273
The Radish Spirit.

296
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,490
Sorry, sir this elevator
doesn't go any higher.

297
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,160
You'll have to take
another one, thank you.

298
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:17,060
- He's following us.
- Just don't look at him.

299
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,120
Step out to the right,
please, gentlemen.

300
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,957
ll don't
think they're big enough.

301
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,710
Your rooms are right this way.

302
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,379
Hmm, Lin?

303
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,297
What?

304
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,843
What's that smell?

305
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,053
It's human you smell just like a human.

306
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,722
Oh, really?

307
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:57,350
Where's it coming from, Lin, come on.

308
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,687
You're hiding something, aren't you?

309
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,439
Show it to me.

310
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,191
Is this what you smell?

311
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,609
Roasted... newt!

312
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,030
No way, frog, I'm saving
every last bite for myself.

313
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:14,242
Please, just a little
bit, just give me a leg.

314
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,120
If you wanna go up, pull
the lever on your right.

315
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:21,291
Gimme, gimme, gimme,
how could you be so cruel?

316
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,085
Can't you share?

317
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,673
Let me please suck on the tail, please!

318
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,925
Let me just...

319
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,395
Aren't you even going to knock?

320
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:09,649
You're the most pathetic
little girl I've ever seen.

321
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,909
Well, come in.

322
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:27,292
I said, come in.

323
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,904
Quiet down you're making a racket.

324
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,635
Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could give me a job?

325
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,188
I don't want to hear
such a stupid request.

326
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,858
You're just a stinking, useless weakling.

327
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,445
And this is certainly no place for humans.

328
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,616
It's a bathhouse for the spirits.

329
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:45,870
It's where they come to
replenish themselves.

330
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,666
And you humans always
make a mess of things.

331
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,960
Like your parents, who gobbled up the food

332
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,254
of the spirits like pigs.

333
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,508
They got what they deserved,
and you should be punished too.

334
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,009
Hmm.

335
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,058
You could be a piglet.

336
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,311
Or, maybe you'd prefer a lump of coal?

337
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,322
ll can see you shaking.

338
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,992
Actually, I'm impressed
you made it this far.

339
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,829
But I'm sure you didn't do it on your own.

340
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,331
Let's thank whoever helped you.

341
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,085
Just who was it dear,
why don't you tell me?

342
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,549
Please! Can't you give me a job?

343
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,969
- Don't start that again.
- Please, ll just want to work.

344
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,471
Don't say that!

345
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,482
Why in world do you think
ll should give you a job?

346
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:59,319
Anyone can see you're a
lazy, spoiled crybaby,

347
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:02,113
and you have no manners.

348
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,283
This is a high-class
place I'm running here.

349
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,119
So there's no job for you, now get out.

350
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,581
I've got all the lazy bums I need.

351
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,877
Or maybe I'll give you the
most difficult job I've got,

352
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:21,466
and work you until you
breathe your very last breath.

353
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,608
Oh, dear, you woke up the baby.

354
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,196
Mommy's here. Be a good boy now.

355
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,698
Why are you still here,
1 told you to leave.

356
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,826
I want you to give me a job, please!

357
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,995
Quiet down you're scaring the baby!

358
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,707
Hi, sweetie. Don't be angry.

359
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,545
That's a good boy.

360
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,297
I'm not leaving till you give me a job.

361
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,133
Okay okay, just be quiet.

362
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,554
Here comes Mommy, I'm coming to get you.

363
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,660
That's your contract.

364
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,748
Sign your name away, and
I'll put you to work.

365
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,918
If ll hear one little complaint out of you,

366
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,422
you'll be joining your
parents in the pigpen.

367
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,674
So I, do I sign my name here?

368
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:48,344
Just sign it, do you
want the job or not?

369
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,643
I can't believe I took that oath.

370
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,229
Give a job to anyone who asks.

371
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:03,776
Ridiculous, I hate being
so nice all the time!

372
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,446
Are you done yet?

373
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,996
- So, your name's Chihiro?
- Yes, ma'am.

374
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,873
What a pretty name.

375
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,844
And it belongs to me now.

376
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,306
From now on, your name
is Sen, you got that?

377
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,808
- Answer me, Sen!
- Yes, ma'am.

378
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,062
You called for me?

379
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:44,150
This girl signed a contract.
Set her up with a job.

380
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,402
Right, what's your name?

381
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,615
What, Chih, oh it's Sen.

382
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,076
Okay, Sen. Follow me.

383
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,544
Haku, uh...

384
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,799
Don't talk to me, and
address me as Master Haku.

385
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,526
I don't care if Yubaba
gets angry with us.

386
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,861
We're not taking humans.

387
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,488
She's already under contract.

388
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,322
What?

389
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,865
I promise to work very hard.

390
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,993
We are not gonna take
her in our department.

391
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,452
She'll
stink up the whole place.

392
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,370
We don't want her.

393
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,373
Three days of eating our food,
and her smell will go away.

394
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,210
If she doesn't work hard,
roast her, boil her,

395
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,962
do whatever you want.

396
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,589
Now get back to work, where is Lin?

397
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,217
What, don't you dump her on me.

398
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,844
You said you wanted an assistant.

399
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,137
That's perfect.

400
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,222
- Give the girl to Lin.
- Oh, great.

401
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,100
- Sen, get going.
- Right.

402
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,727
Why are you picking on me?

403
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,854
You owe me one, Haku. You hear me?

404
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,356
- Have a nice day.
- Hmph!

405
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,984
Come on.

406
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,911
I can't believe you pulled it off.

407
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:19,746
Huh?

408
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,664
You're such a dope,
ll was really worried.

409
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,375
Now, keep on your toes, and
if you need anything, ask me.

410
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,293
Okay?

411
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,629
- Okay.
- Hmm? What's wrong?

412
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,632
I don't feel so good.

413
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,432
So, this is our room.

414
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,519
A little food and some
sleep and you'll be fine.

415
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,730
Here's your apron.

416
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,148
You have to wash it yourself.

417
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,816
Your pants.

418
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,151
You're so puny.

419
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,029
Way too big.

420
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:58,242
- Lin, you know Haku?
- What about him?

421
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,369
There aren't two of him here, are there?

422
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,414
Two Hakus, I can barely stand one.

423
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,333
Too big.

424
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,377
He's Yubaba's henchman,
don't trust anything he says.

425
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,465
Let's see.

426
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:19,931
Ah, here we go...
wh- what's wrong with you?

427
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,350
Are you feeling okay?

428
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,561
Quiet down. What's your problem?

429
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,440
It's the new girl, she
doesn't feel so good.

430
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,866
Meet me at the bridge,

431
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,410
I'll take you to your parents.

432
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,289
My shoes are gone.

433
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:56,754
Huh?

434
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:04,929
Thank you.

435
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:14,999
Follow me.

436
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,218
We don't have much time.

437
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,473
If you're found here, you'll
be turned into a pig yourself.

438
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,103
You must never come here
without me, understand?

439
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,438
I understand.

440
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,877
Mom, Dad, are you all right?

441
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,922
It's me, Sen, hey, wake up!

442
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:04,715
Mom! Dad!

443
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,263
What's wrong with them, are they sick?

444
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,433
No they ate too much,
they're sleeping it off.

445
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,310
They don't remember being human.

446
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:17,144
So look hard.

447
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:21,148
It's up to you to remember
which ones they are.

448
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,694
Don't you worry, I promise
I'll get you out of here.

449
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:29,782
So just don't get any
fatter or they'll eat you!

450
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,126
Here are your clothes. Hide them.

451
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,629
I thought they'd been thrown away.

452
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,298
You'll need them to get home.

453
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,140
My goodbye card's still here.

454
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,893
Chihiro, Chihiro.

455
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,313
That's my name, isn't it?

456
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,316
That's how Yubaba controls
you, by stealing your name.

457
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,527
So hold on to that card, keep it hidden.

458
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,863
And while you're here, you
must call yourself Sen.

459
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,573
I can't believe I forgot my name.

460
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,908
She almost took it from me.

461
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,201
If you completely forget it,

462
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,329
you'll never find your way home.

463
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,957
I've tried everything to remember mine.

464
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,959
You can't remember your name?

465
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:25,629
No but for some
reason, I remember yours.

466
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,468
Here you go, eat this, you must be hungry.

467
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,385
No.

468
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:35,473
I put a spell on it so it'll
give you back your strength.

469
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,557
Just eat it.

470
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,930
Have some more, you'll be all right.

471
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,152
I've got to go now, I'll
be back to help you soon.

472
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,654
Just stay out of trouble.

473
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,990
Thank you Haku, you're a good friend.

474
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:49,964
Haku.

475
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,177
He's a dragon?

476
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,204
Huh?

477
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,670
Where were you Sen,
I was really worried.

478
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,213
I'm sorry.

479
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:26,143
Out of my way.

480
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,653
Gee, Sen!

481
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,948
Haven't you ever worked
a day in your life?

482
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,950
Lin and Sen, you get the big tub today.

483
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:42,785
What?

484
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,203
Hey, that's frog work.

485
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:48,457
Orders from the top,
so quit your complaining!

486
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:11,480
Hello, aren't you getting wet out there?

487
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,943
- Sen, hurry up.
- Coming.

488
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,905
I'll leave the door open for you.

489
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,016
Heard you got the big tub, Lin.

490
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,518
Leave me alone.

491
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,900
Those jerks, they haven't
cleaned this tub in months.

492
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,331
We only use this tub for
our really filthy guests.

493
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,250
Disgusting, this sludge is so caked on,

494
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,502
it'll take days to scrub off.

495
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,088
Lin, Sen, you've got
some customers on the way.

496
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,884
Wait! Give us a minute,
this is clearly harassment.

497
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,427
We'll have to soak it off.

498
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,512
Get an herbal soak token from the foreman.

499
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,847
A what?

500
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:32,478
- An herbal soak token.
- All right.

501
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,023
Hey, Lin, what's a foreman?

502
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,695
Hmm, something's coming, I wonder what?

503
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:55,667
What useless scum is
sleeking around in the rain?

504
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:23,987
I can't waste a token on
you. Relax, good morning.

505
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,532
Enjoy. Have a nice bath.

506
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:30,619
- For the Radish Spirit.
- One sulfur soak.

507
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:33,247
Why are you still standing
here, scrub it yourself.

508
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm not giving you a
token. Relax, good morning.

509
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,377
I said scrub it yourself.

510
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:41,713
But ll was told it has
to have an herbal soak.

511
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,882
Well, that's too bad.

512
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,718
Mugwort bath, relax and enjoy it.

513
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,728
Hmm?

514
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,481
Foreman speaking, oh, yes, what?

515
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,485
- Thank you very much.
- Get back here!

516
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,405
- Hey! Wait a minute.
- What's going on?

517
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,908
- Nothing, everything's fine.
- We have an intruder.

518
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:10,868
Is it a human?

519
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,327
I'm not quite sure.

520
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,204
Figure it out and report back.

521
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,832
Wow, Sen, you got a really good one.

522
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,084
Clip this on, then let go.

523
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:24,590
It goes straight to Kamaji,
then he sends us our water.

524
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:32,973
You pull on this to start the
water flowing, give it a try.

525
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,649
Uh, you're such a klutz.

526
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,860
Yuck! What's in this water?

527
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,696
Dried worm salt, it's
supposed to be good for you.

528
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,448
And with water this
murky, you can't see all

529
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:51,366
the sludge in the tub.

530
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,371
Yank it again when the
bath is full, it'll stop.

531
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,499
You can let go of the rope now,
I'll get us some breakfast.

532
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,417
Okay.

533
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:22,773
Ow!

534
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,240
Uh, sir the bath's not ready yet.

535
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:38,956
There's so many.

536
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,792
Uh, uh, uh...

537
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,919
What and they're all for me?

538
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,046
Uh, uh...

539
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:50,092
Thanks, but 1 don't need any more.

540
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,845
- Uh...
- No. 1 only need one.

541
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,279
- Oh, Yubaba.
- It's a stink spirit.

542
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,448
And apparently, it's
an extra smelly one.

543
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:17,619
He's headed
straight for the bridge.

544
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,705
No no, we're closed, go away!

545
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,581
No no, hey, we're not open.

546
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,669
- Go, please, go, leave us.
- There's no one here.

547
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,047
Hmm. Something's fishy.

548
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,800
That doesn't seem like
a stink spirit to me.

549
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,428
But we have no choice. Go greet him.

550
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,763
Just give him a bath
and get him out of here

551
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,849
as fast as you can.

552
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,059
Everybody go back to your rooms.

553
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:44,312
I repeat, back to your rooms.

554
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,606
Sen, Yubaba wants to see you.

555
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,816
Yes, sir.

556
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,277
Sen, don't mess this up.

557
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,488
Take this guest to the big
tub and take care of him.

558
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:54,322
But, but I--

559
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,658
No buts, or I'll turn you into coal.

560
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:59,077
- You hear me?
- Ah it's here.

561
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,799
Hands down, you'll insult our guest.

562
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:23,602
Look about you customer,
welcome to our baths.

563
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,191
Oh, it's money.

564
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,318
<i>Sen, take the nice customer's money.</i>

565
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:32,486
Yes, ma'am.

566
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:45,707
[Yubabal Don't make him
wait, get him to the bath.

567
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,042
This way.

568
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,144
Get out of my way!

569
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,062
Sen!

570
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:16,655
Our food!

571
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:18,740
Open your
windows, all of them!

572
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,575
Quickly!

573
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,286
What? Just a minute, sir.

574
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:11,626
Disgusting?

575
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,295
I don't think it's very funny.

576
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:16,047
Let's see what she'll do next.

577
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,720
Look she wants to refill the tub.

578
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:25,724
Oh dear she's gonna
waste all our good water!

579
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,863
Hmm, who gave her all the bath tokens?

580
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,698
Don't look at me, I didn't do it.

581
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:27,077
Oh, no that's our best herbal formula!

582
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,813
Sen! Sen, where are you?

583
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,897
Over here!

584
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,775
Don't worry, stay right where you are.

585
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,235
I'm coming to help you.

586
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,696
You're gonna be fine, I
won't let him hurt you.

587
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,448
I think he needs help, it
feels like there's a thorn

588
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,616
in his side.

589
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,411
- A thorn?
- It won't come out!

590
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:13,081
What's that, he has a thorn, hmm...

591
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:16,334
Get the staff down there, step on it!

592
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,296
Right, right, right
get downstairs, help her, you!

593
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,131
- All of you!
- Listen to me.

594
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:25,051
That's no stink spirit
we have on our hands...

595
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,555
- Grab onto this rope.
- Wait!

596
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,607
- Mmm. Hold on tight.
- Got it.

597
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,152
- Hurry up, now.
- Get in there!

598
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,487
Everyone get in there and help them.

599
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,489
We've got it tied on!

600
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:50,702
Everyone, ready on my command.

601
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:51,619
And...

602
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,539
Heave!

603
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:55,540
And, heave!

604
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,168
And, heave!

605
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:01,504
And, heave!

606
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,090
And heave!

607
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,263
A bicycle?

608
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,556
Thought so.

609
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:12,891
Get ready, now!

610
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,685
Heave!

611
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:49,969
Sen, Sen, where are you?

612
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,815
Well done.

613
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,515
Gold!

614
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,642
Hey, wait that's company property!

615
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,227
- Stop!
- Back off!

616
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:42,313
Our guest is still here, you idiots!

617
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:50,071
Sen, you're in our
guest's way, step aside.

618
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:50,905
Yes, sir.

619
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:53,658
Open the main gates! Make way!

620
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:23,229
Sen, you did great, we made so much money!

621
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,818
That spirit is rich and powerful,
everyone learn from Sen.

622
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,571
Sake's on the house tonight.

623
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:35,241
But first, hand over all
the gold you picked up.

624
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:39,287
- That's not fair!
- How stingy, that's no fair!

625
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,339
Here.

626
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:52,800
- I swiped a dumpling for you.
- Thank you.

627
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,385
What a day. Mmm.

628
01:06:56,971 --> 01:07:01,142
- Lin, have you seen Haku?
- Not Haku again.

629
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,603
He just disappears sometimes.

630
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:07,524
<i>Rumor has it he runs around
doing Yubaba's dirty work.</i>

631
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,485
- Does he really?
- Lights out, Lin.

632
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:11,653
Fine.

633
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,514
There's so much water,
it looks like a sea.

634
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:43,017
What'd you expect after all that rain?

635
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,312
I've gotta get out of this place.

636
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,315
Someday, I'm getting on that train.

637
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,159
Mmm...

638
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:13,965
What's wrong?

639
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,735
Ah!

640
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:38,906
Hmm. Uh-uh.

641
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,870
Huh? Ahh!

642
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,204
It's gold! Huh?

643
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,418
What do you think you're doing,
you're not allowed in there.

644
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,170
The bath's closed. Get out, you!

645
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,671
Get out of there!

646
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,179
Oh! More gold!

647
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:05,433
Are you, are you, are you,
are you giving them to me?

648
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,314
Wait, you can make gold?

649
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:12,231
Ahh.

650
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,235
Uh, gimme!

651
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,830
What's going on in there?

652
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,541
It's way past bedtime. Come on!

653
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,459
Wh...

654
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,589
Hey, boss, up here,
I'm hungry, starving!

655
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,341
And ll want you to serve me.

656
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,592
I know that voice.

657
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,636
Here, I'll pay you up front.

658
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:43,971
And ll wanna take a bath too.

659
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,641
Why don't you wake everyone up?

660
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,857
Mom, Dad, I got a gift
from the River Spirit!

661
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:58,528
Maybe if you eat it,
it'll break the spell.

662
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,158
Which ones are you?

663
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:06,077
Mom, Dad!

664
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,381
Bad dream.

665
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:20,800
Lin?

666
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:26,848
Where is everybody?

667
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,440
Wow. It really is a sea.

668
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:39,944
There's Mom and Dad's pigpen.

669
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:45,324
I sure hope they're doing
all right over there.

670
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,455
Kamaji lit the boiler already?

671
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,373
How long was I asleep?

672
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:59,088
Come on, he's starving,
can't you cook any faster?

673
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,591
Serve everything you've got
even leftovers if you have to.

674
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,676
Hurry up! He's starving!

675
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:07,305
- Hey, Sen.
- Oh, Lin.

676
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:10,057
I was just coming to wake you up, look.

677
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:12,977
It's real gold, there's a
new guest here who's loaded.

678
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:16,230
He's giving gold away by the handfuls!

679
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:30,453
Just keep the food coming,
I wanna eat everything!

680
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,416
Hmm. Who is the guest?

681
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:36,667
Oh, who cares?

682
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,420
Come on, before Yubaba wakes up.

683
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,547
I'm going to go look for Haku.

684
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,342
Oh would you quit worrying about Haku?

685
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,135
Come on, Sen. Let's go get some gold.

686
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,720
Come on, Lin! Let's go get some more!

687
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,306
- You bet!
- Hey, wait for me!

688
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,243
Where is Haku?

689
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:15,206
He better get here before I forget

690
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,583
what my parents look like.

691
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,837
I sure hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

692
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:34,475
Hmm?

693
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:39,939
Haku?

694
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,533
It's Haku! He's back!

695
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:56,914
Are birds chasing him?

696
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,552
Haku fight 'em, come on!

697
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,681
He's hurt!

698
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:15,057
Haku, this way!

699
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:17,768
Aah!

700
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,242
Huh? It's just paper.

701
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,273
Haku, you're bleeding.

702
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,075
Hold still, those paper
things are gone now.

703
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:16,577
You're going to be all right.

704
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,383
He went in that top window.

705
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:34,512
I've got to get there
before he bleeds to death!

706
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:42,770
Welcome the rich man

707
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,563
<i>53 He's hard for you to miss</i>

708
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,107
<i>73 His butt keeps getting bigger</i>

709
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:49,193
So there's plenty there to kiss, haha

710
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,487
Oh, hey, everybody, bow down.

711
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,531
Welcome, rich man.

712
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,617
<i>71 Beg for tips, this is time</i>

713
01:14:56,784 --> 01:15:00,705
Beg for tips, make yourselves a dime

714
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:05,960
Give me some gold, give me some tips!

715
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:10,923
I'll do anything for you,
just give me some tips!

716
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,052
Hey, what are you doing?

717
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,305
- Going upstairs.
- No, you're not.

718
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,557
Huh, ah blood!

719
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:27,773
Get out of the way our
guest is coming through here!

720
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,859
Thank you for helping me earlier.

721
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,902
Don't talk to him, you stinking hum...

722
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:32,820
Wow, hey!

723
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:57,011
I don't want any, but thanks.

724
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:02,391
I'm sorry, but I'm in a really big hurry.

725
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:16,363
Hey, there, hey, get back, get back now!

726
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,698
Everybody, out!

727
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,035
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir.

728
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:25,289
You'll have to excuse the
little girl she's just a human.

729
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,250
Wipe that smile off your face.

730
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,293
What?

731
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,171
- You're still smiling.
- No, I'm not.

732
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,432
It's Yubaba!

733
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,465
We're in a big mess.

734
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:23,884
I found out who our rich customer is.

735
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:25,177
He's a No-Face!

736
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,137
It's all your fault. You're so greedy.

737
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:31,183
You attract terrible guests,
all right, I'm on my way.

738
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:35,437
Don't let him eat anyone
else till I get down there.

739
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,482
Haku is bleeding all over the carpet.

740
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:42,486
Get him out of here.
He'll be dead soon anyway.

741
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,969
Hi sweetie hiding under
the cushions again?

742
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:14,768
Oh, I woke you, and you were sound asleep.

743
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:17,688
I'm sorry. Let me give you a kiss.

744
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:24,903
Go back to sleep, now.

745
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,099
Ow! Let go of me!

746
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,226
Wow, you're a big baby.

747
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:57,853
Would you mind letting go of me?

748
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,396
I'm in a really big hurry.

749
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,565
You came in here to make me sick.

750
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:02,399
Huh?

751
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:06,028
You're a bad germ from
outside, aren't you?

752
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:07,696
I'm not a germ, I'm a human.

753
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,907
Now, would you please let go of me?

754
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:12,451
You'll get sick if you go outside.

755
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:14,536
So stay here and play with me.

756
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,914
- You won't get sick.
- Yes, you will.

757
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:18,874
That's why I've never left this room.

758
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,752
Staying in this room
is what'll make you sick.

759
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:25,798
Listen, someone very important
to me is terribly hurt.

760
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,967
I've got to go right now,
so please let go of me.

761
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,720
If you go I'll cry,
and Mama will hear me,

762
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,181
and Mama will come in here and kill you.

763
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:36,058
Play with me, or I'll break your arm.

764
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,518
That hurts!

765
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,104
Please, I'll play with you later, okay?

766
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,106
No, I wanna play now!

767
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,986
Germs! I've got germs, see?

768
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,125
Haku!

769
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,292
What are you doing? Get away!

770
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,503
Get back! Haku, are you okay?

771
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,547
Can you hear me?

772
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,465
Shut your mouth! Haku!

773
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:15,639
Get back!

774
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,184
Stop it!

775
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,410
I'm not afraid of germs.

776
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:38,579
If you don't play with me, I'll cry.

777
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:40,831
Please don't cry. Just wait.

778
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:43,750
Right now, or I'll start crying.

779
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,421
Don't cry! Don't cry!

780
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,339
What a spoiled brat!

781
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,385
Shut your big mouth!

782
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:56,555
You're a bit of a porker, aren't you?

783
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:04,771
- Hmm, still see-through.
- Mama?

784
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,232
You pea-brain.

785
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:10,986
<i>Can't you even tell me
from your own mother?</i>

786
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:21,371
There, now your body matches your brain.

787
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:24,625
Let's see, what else can we mess with?

788
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,019
This is our little secret.

789
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:48,273
You tell anyone else, and
I'll rip your mouth out.

790
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,234
Who are you?

791
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,903
Zeniba. I'm Yubaba's twin sister.

792
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,696
It was nice of you to lead me straight to

793
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,782
this dragon's hiding place.

794
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,742
Now, hand him over to me.

795
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:01,703
What do you want with
Haku? He's badly hurt.

796
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,998
Too bad. He stole my solid gold seal.

797
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,960
It's magic and powerful,
and I want it back!

798
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:10,879
Haku wouldn't steal. He's a good person.

799
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:14,800
Ha, do you know why he
became my sister's apprentice?

800
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,927
To steal her magic secrets,

801
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:19,680
and now he's stolen my magic too.

802
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,515
He's a greedy little thief.

803
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,850
There's nothing good about him.

804
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:25,435
Step aside, little girl.

805
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,730
I'm going to take my seal back from him.

806
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,941
There's a spell on the seal,

807
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:34,611
and anyone who steals it will die.

808
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,029
No, you can't!

809
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:47,040
You idiots! What's your problem?

810
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:51,211
Keep quiet, I don't want
my sister coming up here.

811
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:57,926
Ow. A paper cut.

812
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,929
Haku, we're falling!

813
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:22,451
Haku!

814
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,439
- What's going on here?
- Haku!

815
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,775
Sen, be careful! Stay back!

816
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:57,861
Haku, are you okay, Haku!

817
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,492
What's wrong with you?

818
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,039
This looks serious.

819
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:12,876
Haku, don't give up!

820
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:14,753
What do we do? Is he dying?

821
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,714
It looks like he's
bleeding from the inside.

822
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:18,799
From the inside?

823
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:22,636
I think so, maybe he
swallowed something.

824
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:25,972
Haku, I got this gift
from the River Spirit.

825
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:28,141
Eat it. Maybe it'll help.

826
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,729
Come on! Open your mouth!

827
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,564
Please, Haku! Eat it!

828
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,485
See? It's okay.

829
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:41,697
Medicine from the River Spirit.

830
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:44,199
Open your mouth. That's it.

831
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:49,329
Got it.

832
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:51,373
Now swallow.

833
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:11,476
Sen, look there!

834
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:25,699
The gold seal!

835
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,033
Get that black slug! Over there!

836
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,035
Get it, get it, get it!

837
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:47,304
You killed it, those things are bad luck.

838
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:50,640
Hurry, before it rubs off on you!

839
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:53,393
Put your thumbs and forefingers together.

840
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,853
Evil, be gone!

841
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,106
Haku stole this seal
from Yubaba's sister.

842
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,234
Zeniba's solid gold monogrammed seal.

843
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,862
That's as powerful as it gets.

844
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,908
Look! He's changed back.

845
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,951
Help me. What do we do?

846
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,371
Haku, Haku, wake up!

847
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:18,668
Zeniba put a curse on the seal.

848
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:22,839
That's strong magic,
it's made him gravely ill.

849
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:35,435
That should make him more comfortable.

850
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:38,563
Poor Haku.

851
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:41,149
He's had it hard ever since he got here.

852
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:45,111
He just showed up out of
nowhere, just like you did.

853
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,447
But he got mixed up with Yubaba.

854
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,407
He took a job as her apprentice.

855
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,701
I warned him it was too dangerous.

856
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,454
"Just quit, go back home!”, I told him.

857
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:58,667
But he said for some reason
he had no home to return to.

858
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,794
Once Yubaba got control over him,

859
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:04,798
his face turned pale and
his eyes turned steely.

860
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:07,050
He's never been the same.

861
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:12,347
Kamaji, what if I take the
gold seal back to Zeniba?

862
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:16,059
I could give back the seal
and apologize to her for Haku.

863
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:18,311
Can you tell me where Zeniba lives?

864
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:20,522
You'd go to Zeniba's?

865
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:23,275
It might help, but she's
one dangerous witch.

866
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:24,484
Please?

867
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:28,697
Haku helped me before,
now I wanna help him.

868
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,448
Hmm.

869
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,868
I know how you can get there,

870
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,829
but you'll have to get back on your own.

871
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:36,746
Wait here.

872
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:43,670
Let's see now, I know it's
around here somewhere.

873
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:48,049
Everyone, I need my
shoes and clothes, please.

874
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:51,761
I guess my parents will have to wait.

875
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:58,435
Sen, I've looked everywhere for you.

876
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:03,189
- Lin!
- There's blood everywhere.

877
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:07,235
What's going on here, who are those guys?

878
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,113
I picked up some new friends, see?

879
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,866
Everyone's looking for
you, Yubaba is furious.

880
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:13,700
Huh?

881
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:15,118
The guy with all the
gold turned out to be

882
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,120
a monster called No-Face.

883
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:21,207
And he says that you let
him into the bathhouse.

884
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:25,503
I did let him in.

885
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:26,588
Are you serious?

886
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:28,798
Yeah, I thought he was a customer.

887
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:32,177
What? He's a monster, he's
already swallowed three people.

888
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,596
Found it! Here it is, Sen.

889
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:40,143
- Hey, we're busy, boiler man.
- You can use this.

890
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:41,811
You've got train tickets?

891
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,229
Uh, how did you get a hold of them?

892
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,941
I've been saving them for 40 years.

893
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:47,192
Now, listen carefully.

894
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:49,945
The train stop you want
is called Swamp Bottom.

895
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:52,364
- Swamp Bottom?
- That's where Zeniba lives.

896
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,324
- The sixth stop.
- Sixth stop.

897
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:55,951
Make sure you get it right.

898
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,827
The train used to run in both directions,

899
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,372
but these days it's a one-way ride.

900
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:02,791
You still wanna go?

901
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,753
Yep, I'll walk back along the tracks.

902
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:10,924
- Sen, what about No-Face?
- I'll take care of that now.

903
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:14,344
Haku, I'll be back soon, just hold on.

904
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,180
What's going on?

905
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:21,434
Something you wouldn't
recognize... it's called love.

906
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,776
He just keeps getting bigger!

907
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:30,652
I'm scared.

908
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:31,903
I don't wanna be eaten by it.

909
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:32,904
It's her.

910
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,330
Oh, Sen, thank goodness.

911
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,124
Yubaba can't hold him off much longer.

912
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,378
There's no need to get upset.

913
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:52,173
I'm sure they'll find Sen somewhere.

914
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,759
Where is Sen? I want Sen!

915
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,386
Hurry! This way!

916
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:05,145
- Madam, Sen is here now.
- Finally!

917
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:06,730
Sen has arrived, sir.

918
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:10,483
She'll be with you in just a few minutes.

919
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:14,112
He's destroying everything,
it's costing us a fortune.

920
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:18,366
So suck up to him and get every
last speck of gold he's...

921
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:19,492
Choo!

922
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:23,705
Eww, what's that dirty mouse doing here?

923
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,874
Huh? He's your...

924
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,542
He doesn't look familiar?

925
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:30,336
Familiar, don't be stupid.

926
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:31,921
Now, get in there.

927
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:34,257
Here's Sen.

928
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:39,054
Will Sen be all right
in there by herself?

929
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,472
You wanna take her place?

930
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:41,431
- Huh?
- Hmpf!

931
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,870
Try this. It's delicious.

932
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:11,086
Want some gold, I'm not
giving it to anybody else.

933
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:18,051
Come closer, Sen what would you like?

934
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:19,219
Just name it.

935
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,555
I would like to leave, sir.

936
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:26,810
I have some place I need to
go to right away, please.

937
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:30,021
You should go back to where you came from.

938
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:34,275
Yubaba doesn't want you in
the bathhouse any longer.

939
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:39,197
Where is your home, don't you
have any friends or family?

940
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:40,115
No. No!

941
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,868
I'm lonely, I'm lonely.

942
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:49,541
What is it that you want?

943
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,709
I want Sen, I want Sen!

944
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:55,964
Take the gold. Take it!

945
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:58,716
- Are you going to eat me?
- Take it!

946
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:11,104
If you want to eat me, eat this first.

947
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:13,231
I was saving this for my parents,

948
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,733
but I think you'd better have it.

949
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:36,963
Sen!

950
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:41,968
Sen, what did you do to me?

951
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:01,196
Enough, I don't care if he's rich!

952
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,698
This nonsense has gotta stop!

953
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:17,629
No-Face!

954
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:19,589
Over here!

955
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:29,515
Run for your life!

956
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,673
Now, that's an esophagus!

957
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:06,386
I'll get you for this, Sen!

958
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:10,181
Duck!

959
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,028
Excuse me.

960
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:25,446
Sen, this way!

961
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:44,549
Hey, over here!

962
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:46,884
Sen, don't call him over!

963
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:53,308
I think being in the
bathhouse makes him crazy.

964
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:54,642
He needs to get out of there.

965
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:57,687
- Yeah? And go where?
- I don't know.

966
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:59,689
You don't know?

967
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,483
Great. Now he's following us.

968
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,652
He won't hurt us.

969
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:20,877
You'll have to walk from here.

970
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:21,711
Okay.

971
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:23,963
The station's just down the tracks.

972
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:25,715
Thanks, Lin.

973
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:28,259
You better come back, you hear me?

974
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:29,177
1 will.

975
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:36,184
Sen, I'm sorry I
called you a dope before!

976
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:37,518
I take it back!

977
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:48,654
No-Face, if you put even
one scratch on that girl,

978
01:37:48,821 --> 01:37:50,573
you're in big trouble.

979
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:55,370
There's the station.

980
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:08,591
Here comes the train come on.

981
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:34,450
Oh we'd like to go to
Swamp Bottom, please.

982
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:40,081
Huh?

983
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:44,627
- Oh. You wanna come with us?
- Uh-huh.

984
01:38:44,794 --> 01:38:47,380
He'd like to come too, please.

985
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:29,213
Sit here, behave yourself, okay?

986
01:41:32,211 --> 01:41:34,297
- Kamaji, wake up.
- Hmm?

987
01:41:36,549 --> 01:41:39,051
Haku, you're all right.

988
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:41,137
I'm fine. Where is Sen?

989
01:41:41,304 --> 01:41:44,140
Did she go somewhere, can
you tell me what's going on?

990
01:41:44,307 --> 01:41:47,268
You blacked out, remember?

991
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:49,687
Yeah, ll remember being in darkness.

992
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:52,773
Then I could hear Sen's
voice calling out my name.

993
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,151
Sol followed her voice,
and the next thing I knew,

994
01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:57,153
ll was lying here feeling better than ever.

995
01:41:57,320 --> 01:42:00,990
Pure love, it broke Zeniba's spell.

996
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:04,076
Sen left to return the golden seal.

997
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:06,078
She did it to save you.

998
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:09,874
This gold doesn't even come close

999
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:13,294
to covering the damage
that stupid No-Face caused.

1000
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:16,756
Sen didn't get nearly enough,
she'll have to be punished.

1001
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:18,424
Madam, you see, Sen was the one

1002
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:19,717
that saved us from No-Face.

1003
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:20,635
Yes, yes.

1004
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:24,347
So what, this whole mess is her fault!

1005
01:42:24,513 --> 01:42:26,932
And now she's run away from here.

1006
01:42:27,099 --> 01:42:29,810
She's even abandoned her own parents!

1007
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:32,563
Those pigs must be ready to eat by now.

1008
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,440
Turn them into bacon.

1009
01:42:34,607 --> 01:42:35,858
Wait a minute.

1010
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:38,319
- Huh?
- Master Haku?

1011
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:41,906
You're still alive, what is it you want?

1012
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:44,784
You still haven't noticed
that something precious

1013
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,911
to you has been replaced.

1014
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:49,705
Don't get fresh with me, young man.

1015
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:53,668
Since when do you talk
that way to your master?

1016
01:42:57,672 --> 01:42:58,506
Huh.

1017
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:44,885
My baby!

1018
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:48,889
No!

1019
01:43:52,101 --> 01:43:53,686
My baby!

1020
01:43:53,853 --> 01:43:54,979
It's just dirt.

1021
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:56,564
Where's my baby?

1022
01:43:57,815 --> 01:43:59,734
Where are you, sweetie?

1023
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:04,989
Come out, please, come out!

1024
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,240
Where are you?

1025
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:11,871
Sweetie, sweetie pie!

1026
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:17,835
You!

1027
01:44:21,839 --> 01:44:22,840
Where is he?

1028
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:30,014
What did you do with my baby?

1029
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:34,185
He's with your sister.

1030
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:35,102
Zeniba?

1031
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:40,691
Uh...

1032
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:59,960
Very clever, Haku, I get it.

1033
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:05,132
You'll get my baby back
for me, but at a price.

1034
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:07,718
So, what do you want?

1035
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:09,970
Tear up Sen's contract.

1036
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:12,348
And then I want you to
return Sen and her mother

1037
01:45:12,515 --> 01:45:14,683
and father back to the human world.

1038
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:17,394
Fine, but on one condition.

1039
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:20,189
I get to give Sen one final test.

1040
01:45:20,356 --> 01:45:22,358
If she fails, she's mine.

1041
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:11,031
I hope this is the right stop.

1042
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:11,949
Let's go.

1043
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:42,813
You can ride on my
shoulder if you're tired.

1044
01:46:50,446 --> 01:46:51,280
Hmm?

1045
01:47:59,348 --> 01:48:00,933
Come in.

1046
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:07,064
Hello?

1047
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,569
Hurry up, ll don't have all day.

1048
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:13,487
Come on.

1049
01:48:17,366 --> 01:48:20,327
- So, you all made it.
- Hmm?

1050
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:23,747
Sit down, I'll make some tea.

1051
01:48:30,045 --> 01:48:32,631
Excuse me, ma'am,
Haku stole this from you.

1052
01:48:32,798 --> 01:48:35,050
I came to give it back.

1053
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:35,968
I see.

1054
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:39,972
Do you have any idea what this is?

1055
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:43,058
Yes it's the golden
seal you were looking for.

1056
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:47,312
I'm here to apologize
for Haku, I'm very sorry.

1057
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:51,066
He sliced me in two, you
know, and I'm still angry.

1058
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:52,776
- What?
- What!

1059
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:55,654
The protective spell is gone.

1060
01:48:55,821 --> 01:48:56,530
I'm sorry.

1061
01:48:56,697 --> 01:48:59,074
You mean that black slug
that was on your seal?

1062
01:48:59,241 --> 01:49:01,285
I think I squashed it with my foot.

1063
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:02,536
Squashed it?

1064
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:07,624
That wasn't my slug.

1065
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:11,879
My sister put that slug into
Haku so she could control him.

1066
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:13,464
You squashed it.

1067
01:49:16,508 --> 01:49:19,136
What happened to my spell?

1068
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:21,972
Only love can break it, come now.

1069
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:24,391
Can you please turn these two back

1070
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:26,643
into their normal forms?

1071
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:29,980
The spell on those
two wore off long ago.

1072
01:49:30,147 --> 01:49:32,066
Change back if you want.

1073
01:49:39,698 --> 01:49:41,617
I don't get along with my sister.

1074
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:43,786
She's so obnoxious.

1075
01:49:43,952 --> 01:49:46,288
You saw how tacky her home is.

1076
01:49:46,455 --> 01:49:49,917
We're identical twins,
yet exact opposites.

1077
01:49:53,378 --> 01:49:56,381
I'm sorry she turned
your parents into pigs.

1078
01:49:56,548 --> 01:50:00,135
But there's nothing ll can do,
it's just the way things are.

1079
01:50:00,302 --> 01:50:03,180
You'll have to help your
parents and Haku on your own.

1080
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:05,182
Use what you remember about them.

1081
01:50:05,349 --> 01:50:06,016
What?

1082
01:50:06,183 --> 01:50:08,685
Can't you please give me
more of a hint than that?

1083
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:12,481
It seems like I met Haku before,
but it was a long time ago.

1084
01:50:12,648 --> 01:50:14,441
That's a good start.

1085
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:18,237
Once you've met someone, you
never really forget them.

1086
01:50:18,403 --> 01:50:21,865
It just takes a while for
your memories to return.

1087
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:23,242
While you're thinking,

1088
01:50:23,408 --> 01:50:26,036
the boys and I are going
to make you something.

1089
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:30,082
And I want you to call
me Granny from now on.

1090
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:34,378
Ah, come on, keep at it.

1091
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:41,260
No-Face, where did you
learn to spin thread?

1092
01:50:41,426 --> 01:50:43,512
You're really good at this.

1093
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,682
Now let's weave the threads together.

1094
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:50,811
Knit one, pearl two, knit one, pearl two.

1095
01:50:50,978 --> 01:50:52,437
Knit one, that's right.

1096
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:55,816
Granny, ll can't remember anything at all.

1097
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:57,401
Haku could be dead already,

1098
01:50:57,568 --> 01:50:59,778
and I'm just sitting around here.

1099
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:03,699
My mom and dad could've
been eaten for dinner.

1100
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:08,162
Wait just a little bit longer.

1101
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:10,205
Ahh.There we go.

1102
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:12,708
Use it to tie back your hair.

1103
01:51:16,879 --> 01:51:18,297
It's beautiful.

1104
01:51:19,381 --> 01:51:20,799
It will protect you.

1105
01:51:20,966 --> 01:51:24,219
It's made from the threads
your friends wove together.

1106
01:51:24,386 --> 01:51:25,304
Thank you.

1107
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:37,774
What good timing
we've got another guest.

1108
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:40,194
- Will you let him in?
- Sure.

1109
01:51:53,165 --> 01:51:53,999
Haku!

1110
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:56,543
Haku.

1111
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,588
Thank goodness.

1112
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:03,800
You're alive, I can't believe
it, how did it happen?

1113
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:05,219
Ahh.

1114
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:06,970
That's love for you.

1115
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:10,265
Look Granny, Haku's alive!

1116
01:52:11,225 --> 01:52:15,229
Haku, 1 will forgive you
for stealing my precious seal.

1117
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:19,316
But in return, you must
take care of this girl.

1118
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:22,236
Okay, you two, it's time to go home.

1119
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:23,570
Come back soon.

1120
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:27,449
No-Face, why don't you stay with me?

1121
01:52:27,616 --> 01:52:28,951
I could use a good helper.

1122
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:30,452
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1123
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:33,038
Granny!

1124
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:35,415
Thank you so much, I'll miss you.

1125
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:38,877
Don't worry. You'll be all right, Sen.

1126
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:42,256
I want you to know my
real name. It's Chihiro.

1127
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:44,841
Chihiro. What a pretty name.

1128
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:47,594
- You take good care of it.
- 1 will.

1129
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:50,097
- Off you go.
- Okay. Bye.

1130
01:52:51,139 --> 01:52:54,559
Granny, take care, thanks for everything!

1131
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:44,735
Haku, listen.

1132
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:47,195
I just remembered something
from a long time ago.

1133
01:53:47,362 --> 01:53:48,989
I think it may help you.

1134
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:53,160
Once, when I was little, I
dropped my shoe into a river.

1135
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:56,246
And when I tried to
get it back, I fell in.

1136
01:53:56,413 --> 01:54:00,083
I thought I'd drown, but the
water carried me to shore.

1137
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:02,627
It finally came back to me.

1138
01:54:02,794 --> 01:54:05,797
The river's name was the Kohaku River.

1139
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:10,052
I think that was you, and your
real name is Kohaku River!

1140
01:54:31,156 --> 01:54:33,325
You did it, Chihiro, I remember.

1141
01:54:33,492 --> 01:54:35,827
I was the spirit of the Kohaku River.

1142
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:39,414
- A river spirit?
- My name is the Kohaku River.

1143
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:40,665
They filled in that river.

1144
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:42,376
It's all apartments now.

1145
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:45,045
That must be why I can't
find my way home, Chihiro.

1146
01:54:45,212 --> 01:54:46,963
I remember you falling into my river,

1147
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:49,007
and ll remember your little pink shoe.

1148
01:54:49,174 --> 01:54:52,052
So you're the one who carried
me back into shallow water.

1149
01:54:52,219 --> 01:54:55,555
You saved me, I knew you were good!

1150
01:55:28,046 --> 01:55:29,881
Hey, there they are!

1151
01:55:42,769 --> 01:55:46,189
I see you failed to bring my baby back.

1152
01:55:48,483 --> 01:55:50,777
- Mama!
- My baby!

1153
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:51,945
Are you traumatized?

1154
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:54,948
Did they do terrible things to you?

1155
01:55:55,115 --> 01:55:58,743
You're standing all by
yourself, when did that happen?

1156
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,787
Don't forget your promise.

1157
01:56:00,954 --> 01:56:04,749
You must return Chihiro and
her parents to the human world.

1158
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:07,377
Hmm, not so fast, Haku.

1159
01:56:07,544 --> 01:56:09,379
I get to give Sen one final test.

1160
01:56:11,131 --> 01:56:12,132
Shut up!

1161
01:56:12,299 --> 01:56:15,177
Stop it, Mama, leave her alone.

1162
01:56:15,343 --> 01:56:18,346
Sen and I had a really good time.

1163
01:56:18,513 --> 01:56:21,016
But a deal is a deal, sweetie.

1164
01:56:21,183 --> 01:56:23,685
I have to give Sen one final test.

1165
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:27,272
If you make Sen cry, I
won't like you anymore.

1166
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:29,024
- But?
Hey, Granny!</i>

1167
01:56:30,192 --> 01:56:31,234
Granny?

1168
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:33,987
You're right, a deal's a deal.

1169
01:56:44,873 --> 01:56:47,250
Okay, I'm ready, I'll take your test.

1170
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:49,294
Hmm. You've got guts.

1171
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:51,505
I've got your contract right here.

1172
01:56:51,671 --> 01:56:52,923
Come this way.

1173
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:55,842
This will only take a minute.

1174
01:56:56,009 --> 01:56:57,093
Don't worry.

1175
01:57:01,598 --> 01:57:03,558
See if you can tell which of these pigs

1176
01:57:03,725 --> 01:57:05,810
is your mother and father.

1177
01:57:14,986 --> 01:57:16,613
You get one try.

1178
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:20,116
If you get it right, you can all go home.

1179
01:57:31,002 --> 01:57:32,337
There must be a mistake.

1180
01:57:32,504 --> 01:57:34,881
None of these pigs are my mom or dad.

1181
01:57:35,048 --> 01:57:38,552
None of them, is that
really your answer?

1182
01:57:39,886 --> 01:57:41,304
Mm-hmm.

1183
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:42,264
Ah!

1184
01:57:43,932 --> 01:57:46,017
Oh, you got it!

1185
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,110
Thank you, everyone.

1186
01:57:55,277 --> 01:57:56,361
All right, you win.

1187
01:57:56,528 --> 01:57:58,655
Get out of my sight.

1188
01:57:58,822 --> 01:58:01,825
Thanks for everything, Granny, bye!

1189
01:58:03,368 --> 01:58:04,202
Thank you!

1190
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:07,247
- Haku!
- Let's go!

1191
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:09,666
Where are my mom and dad?

1192
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:10,917
When you passed the test,

1193
01:58:11,084 --> 01:58:13,169
they woke up on the
human side of the river.

1194
01:58:13,336 --> 01:58:16,923
They're there now, and
they're looking for you.

1195
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:18,216
There's no water here.

1196
01:58:18,383 --> 01:58:19,801
I can walk across now.

1197
01:58:19,968 --> 01:58:21,928
But I can't go any farther.

1198
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:23,972
Just go back the way you
came, you'll be fine.

1199
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:26,057
But you have to promise not to look back,

1200
01:58:26,224 --> 01:58:27,726
not until you've passed
through the tunnel.

1201
01:58:27,892 --> 01:58:29,936
What about you, what'll you do?

1202
01:58:30,103 --> 01:58:33,148
Don't worry, I'll go back
and have a talk with Yubaba.

1203
01:58:33,315 --> 01:58:35,900
I'll tell her I'm going to
quit being her apprentice.

1204
01:58:36,067 --> 01:58:38,194
I'm fine, I got my name back.

1205
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:39,613
Will we meet again sometime?

1206
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:40,614
Sure we will.

1207
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:42,449
- Promise?
- Promise!

1208
01:58:42,616 --> 01:58:45,452
Now go, and don't look back.

1209
01:59:07,349 --> 01:59:08,183
Chihiro!

1210
01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:11,895
Where have you been, hurry up!

1211
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:17,400
Mom, Dad!

1212
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:19,277
You shouldn't run off like that, honey.

1213
01:59:19,444 --> 01:59:21,404
You could get in big trouble.

1214
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:23,698
Are you guys sure you're all right?

1215
01:59:23,865 --> 01:59:27,952
Let's go, I
don't wanna miss the movers.

1216
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:38,672
Chihiro, hurry up.

1217
01:59:48,098 --> 01:59:50,517
Everybody, watch your step.

1218
01:59:50,684 --> 01:59:54,771
Chihiro, don't cling like
that, you'll make me trip.

1219
02:00:05,824 --> 02:00:08,868
We made it, hey what happened?

1220
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:10,036
What is it?

1221
02:00:11,037 --> 02:00:12,288
Look at that.

1222
02:00:14,124 --> 02:00:16,000
It's all dusty inside too.

1223
02:00:16,167 --> 02:00:18,086
Is this someone's idea of a joke?

1224
02:00:18,253 --> 02:00:19,045
Looks like it.

1225
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:23,133
ll told you we
shouldn't have stopped.

1226
02:00:27,178 --> 02:00:30,640
Come on, Chihiro, let's
get to our new home.

1227
02:00:30,807 --> 02:00:32,767

Don't be afraid, honey.

1229
02:00:33,935 --> 02:00:36,104
Everything's gonna be okay.

1230
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,119
A new home and a new school?

1231
02:00:51,286 --> 02:00:52,912
It is a bit scary.

1232
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:55,999
I think I can handle it.
