00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:14,333
[theme music]

2
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:39,371
OOI: Well, then, let's
begin tonight's meeting.

3
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,205
LIGHT: There's supposed
to be eight of them,

4
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:42,805
but only seven are present.

5
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:44,105
That must mean that--

6
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:46,138
L: They probably killed
one of their members.

7
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,471
-Hmm.

8
00:01:47,505 --> 00:01:49,905
OOI: In order to further the
growth of the Yotsuba Group

9
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:52,005
and best serve its
financial interests,

10
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:53,505
who should we kill next?

11
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:54,638
[gasp]

12
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,605
-You see?

13
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:56,771
It's just like I
told you last week.

14
00:01:56,805 --> 00:01:58,471
L: This is not good.

15
00:01:58,505 --> 00:01:59,738
At this rate--

16
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,371
OOI: But before we
get to that, there

17
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:04,105
are several topics that
we need to discuss.

18
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:06,838
First, there is the
issue of Hatori's death.

19
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,705
NAMIKAWA: That was unavoidable.

20
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:10,338
To be honest, in
a certain sense,

21
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:12,538
I'm relieved that
Hatori is dead.

22
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,205
Kira has demonstrated
that we must

23
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:16,138
be committed to these meetings.

24
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:18,971
We now know what will
happen if we try to leave.

25
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,271
-Hmm.

26
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:23,505
I think we all understand
what Hatori's death means

27
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:24,771
for the rest of us.

28
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:26,938
Let's not take it lightly.

29
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:30,438
Now, moving on, our next
topic is Eraldo Coil's report.

30
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:31,571
[gasp]

31
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,105
-One of their members
just died, and that's

32
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:36,305
all they're going to say?

33
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:39,505
-So did we really pay $5
million for this report?

34
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,138
I mean, come on.

35
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,338
Look at this.

36
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,305
He hasn't found out
anything important about L,

37
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:48,138
like his name or his face.

38
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:51,038
Is this Coil guy seriously
going to be of any use to us?

39
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,271
-Hold on a second.

40
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,405
There is something
very interesting

41
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:56,305
in the last part of this report.

42
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:58,205
Coil's warning us
that we can't afford

43
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:00,605
to take L's existence
too lightly.

44
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,038
In particular, it
says, the concentration

45
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,171
of killings that are
beneficial to Yotsuba

46
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:07,471
will likely be
noticed by L if they

47
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:09,105
continue on Fridays
and Saturdays.

48
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:16,205
-Sounds like this
Eraldo Coil has

49
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,771
figured out what
we've been up to.

50
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:19,971
I admit, it's quite impressive.

51
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:21,671
At any rate, I
personally think we

52
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:24,405
should stop killing
every weekend.

53
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,338
MATSUDA: This is unbelievable.

54
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:28,705
It's like they're trying
to confess to everything.

55
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:29,771
-Hmm.

56
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:31,538
As long as we have
this video as evidence,

57
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,005
we could probably arrest
all seven of them.

58
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:36,305
-This is not good.

59
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:39,038
-Kira hasn't been flexible
up till now, has he?

60
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:40,705
It would be nice if
he could spread out

61
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,805
his killings over
the whole week.

62
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:45,138
-The fact that Coil noticed
what we've been up to

63
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,738
makes it too
dangerous to continue

64
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:48,271
killing at our usual pace.

65
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:50,571
From now on, we have
to be even more careful

66
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,271
and make sure that
nobody else happens

67
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:54,338
to notice a trend
in these deaths.

68
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,938
-Now, onto the main topic.

69
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,271
Who should we kill?

70
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,938
-Hmm.

71
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:06,071
-I think we should
focus on ELF Insurance.

72
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:08,138
If they expand into
the Japanese market,

73
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:11,105
Yotsuba and many other companies
will lose valuable clients

74
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:12,105
to them.

75
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:13,471
-Agreed.

76
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:14,638
-All right.

77
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,638
Any objections to killing
these people from ELF

78
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:18,005
with accidental deaths?

79
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:19,405
EXECUTIVES: No objections.

80
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:20,038
-Oh.

81
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,305
-Is this for real?

82
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,638
How can they do this so easily?

83
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:26,438
OOI: Another potential
candidate is Santero Zenzai,

84
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,305
a member of the Kugisawa Group.

85
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:31,938
He's been protesting Yotsuba's
resort development plans.

86
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,038
Zenzai's known to have
high blood pressure,

87
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:35,571
so we can designate
a time for him

88
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:38,071
to suffer a stroke,
resulting in natural death.

89
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:38,871
Any objections?

90
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:39,938
EXECUTIVES: No objections.

91
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:40,738
[gasp]

92
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:41,738
-Kira?

93
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,938
Deaths by accident, by disease?

94
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:46,305
Designated times of death?

95
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:48,438
It's all just as we suspected.

96
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,105
We were right.

97
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:53,971
-Now, unfortunately, we
can only be completely sure

98
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,671
after those people
they've named are dead.

99
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:57,771
-Ah.

100
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,071
-We will continue to
monitor these meetings

101
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:01,338
and take note of what
they say, how they act,

102
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,938
and, most importantly, whether
the people they choose actually

103
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,205
die.

104
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,605
If we can confirm the
connection between their plans

105
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,938
and the deaths, then
we'll definitely

106
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:11,271
be able to catch Kira.

107
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:12,505
-(YELLING IN UNISON) Ryuzaki!

108
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:14,705
-Ah, mm-- what is it?

109
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:16,471
There's no need
to yell in unison.

110
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:19,405
-I can't carry on knowing
these people will die.

111
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:20,671
That's just immoral.

112
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:21,505
-Right.

113
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:22,871
-Here it comes.

114
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,638
I know you're
planning to catch Kira

115
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,071
by letting these guys actually
carry out these murders,

116
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:29,505
but we can't let that happen.

117
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,871
-That's right.

118
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:33,571
It's obvious that these seven
men are behind the killings.

119
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:36,771
With Matsuda's testimony and
this footage we've recorded,

120
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:39,238
we have all the evidence.

121
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:41,271
L: You're making this difficult.

122
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:44,238
If we were to take action
now, everything we've done

123
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:46,505
will go to waste.

124
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:49,805
OOI: So what do you say we take
care of the ELF in three weeks.

125
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:52,805
And as for Zenzai, we'll ask
Kira to kill him this weekend.

126
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:54,505
EXECUTIVES: No objections.

127
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,005
-If that's what
they're going to do,

128
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:58,405
then there's not much time left.

129
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:01,071
Light, we already know the phone
numbers of these board members,

130
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:01,938
don't we?

131
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:03,138
-Yeah.

132
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:04,738
-I don't care who we call.

133
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:06,538
I need to reach one
of these men and have

134
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:07,871
them stop these murders.

135
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,971
L: Please, hold on.

136
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,838
That will cause suspicion.

137
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,071
It would mean the investigation
caught up to them three days

138
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:18,171
after they were
contacted by Aiber.

139
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,638
Also, it would make
it far more unlikely

140
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,005
that we would be
able to discover

141
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:24,105
who the real Kira might be.

142
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:25,871
We can't afford
such a huge setback,

143
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,705
seeing how far we've come.

144
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:35,671
In order to catch Kira, we are
going to need some solid proof.

145
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:44,371
LIGHT: Ryuzaki, if one of these
seven men is in fact Kira,

146
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,105
would it be safe to say that
if I try calling one of them,

147
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:49,271
the odds of that person
actually being Kira

148
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:50,838
is going to be one in seven?

149
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:53,671
-I'm thinking there could be
more than one Kira among them,

150
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,271
a probability of two
in seven at most.

151
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:59,138
-If we're prepared to let them
know that the investigation is

152
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:03,105
catching up to them, let's
place our bets on these odds.

153
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:07,805
Ryuzaki, I'm going to pose as L.
Judging from their conversation

154
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:10,205
so far, the one least
likely to be Kira

155
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:12,205
but with the most influence is--

156
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:12,771
-Ooi!

157
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:14,171
-(BOTH) Namikawa.

158
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:15,438
-Uh--

159
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:17,871
-If you're going to make a
call, please use this phone.

160
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,871
It's set up so it can't
be traced or tapped.

161
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:24,905
-You know, this would all
go a lot faster if we'd--

162
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:26,005
[phone buzzing]

163
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:27,305
--kill off the execs
of our rival companies

164
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:28,438
and be done with it.

165
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:29,471
-Hmm.

166
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:30,538
That would be going
a little too far.

167
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:31,638
EXECUTIVE: Why?

168
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,038
We can kill them and
split their holdings.

169
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:34,771
DISTORTED VOICE (ON PHONE):
Is this Reiji Namikawa, head

170
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:36,871
of the Yotsuba Group's
marketing department?

171
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:38,238
-Hmm.

172
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:38,971
Yes.

173
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,138
And who is this?

174
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:41,538
DISTORTED VOICE (ON
PHONE): Listen carefully,

175
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:43,471
but don't draw
attention to yourself.

176
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,071
I am L.

177
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:48,505
[gasp]

178
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:51,705
I've placed cameras and wiretaps
throughout that meeting room.

179
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:55,538
Even as I speak, I'm recording
footage of your entire meeting.

180
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:58,838
The first thing you
discussed was Hatori's death.

181
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:01,105
Now you're debating
who to kill next.

182
00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:03,338
Am I correct?

183
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:05,605
NAMIKAWA (VOICEOVER): He's
been watching everything.

184
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,438
-If you're not Kira,
or if you are not

185
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:12,338
someone who can contact Kira
directly, let's make a deal.

186
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:13,271
-A deal?

187
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:14,671
DISTORTED VOICE
(ON PHONE): I need

188
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:18,605
you to delay the deaths of ELF's
president and Mr. Zenzai by one

189
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:19,938
month.

190
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:22,038
I doubt it will be difficult
for someone of your standing

191
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,271
to accomplish that.

192
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:24,171
-Yes.

193
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:25,305
Yes, I see.

194
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:25,805
Right.

195
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,505
Uh, go on.

196
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,971
-If you complete your end of
the deal and cooperate with

197
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:32,505
our requests from now on,
then your crimes-- no,

198
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:34,471
not just yours, but
everyone's crimes,

199
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:36,838
with the exception of
Kira's-- will be pardoned,

200
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:38,771
based on the premised
that Kira blackmailed you

201
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:41,005
into participating
in these meetings.

202
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,038
-I see.

203
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:43,105
OK.

204
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:45,671
(VOICEOVER) My only
option is to join L. No,

205
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,071
I'll be dead if Kira
manages to find out.

206
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:49,738
What should I do?

207
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:53,238
-If you tell the others about
this call, they will panic.

208
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,338
It would be of no
advantage to you.

209
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:57,571
Everyone would be
arrested immediately.

210
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,371
But that's not my intention.

211
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,471
I'm planning to go one
on one against Kira.

212
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:03,871
Listen.

213
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:06,471
If I win against Kira, you will
be acquitted of all charges.

214
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,838
If Kira wins, then you'll
be free to carry on

215
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:11,305
with your comfortable life.

216
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:13,205
Just play along
with both parties.

217
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:15,338
Staying on the
sidelines would be best.

218
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:18,271
You're not in a position to
lose anything, regardless

219
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:19,838
of who wins in the end.

220
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,405
You would only be at
a loss if I decided

221
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,971
to arrest you
right here and now.

222
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,171
NAMIKAWA (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

223
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:28,371
He already knew what
answer I would have given.

224
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:30,305
DISTORTED VOICE (ON
PHONE): That's all for now.

225
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:31,105
-Right.

226
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,205
I'll see you Monday then.

227
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:35,571
-What's going on, Namikawa?

228
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,005
Who was that?

229
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:38,838
-Oh, one of my men
screwed up again.

230
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,338
I'll have to fix it on Monday.

231
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,305
Anyway, sorry for
the interruption.

232
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:45,238
Let's get back on topic.

233
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:48,405
We were discussing when we
should kill Zenzai and the men

234
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:50,438
from ELF.

235
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:51,805
Here's what I'm thinking.

236
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:55,105
We'll give Coil one month
to reveal L's identity.

237
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:56,971
If he still hasn't
uncovered the information

238
00:09:57,005 --> 00:10:00,238
we need, then we can go ahead
and kill the targets randomly.

239
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,605
Then we'll give
him another month

240
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:04,671
to investigate and
repeat the process.

241
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,505
Once we get rid
of L permanently,

242
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:09,538
we can go back to killing
two or three people a week.

243
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:13,871
In other words, our top priority
should be the elimination of L.

244
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,271
-I see.

245
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:18,738
Once we kill L, there won't be
anything standing in our way.

246
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:20,771
But until then, we
need to be careful.

247
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:21,771
-Right.

248
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,505
Sounds like a
reasonable plan to me.

249
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:27,271
-We need to be extremely careful
if we don't want to get caught.

250
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:28,638
OOI: Then we're in agreement.

251
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,738
We'll give Coil one month.

252
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:32,205
EXECUTIVES: Agreed.

253
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:35,571
NAMIKAWA (VOICEOVER): L, this
should satisfy you for now.

254
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:38,171
OOI: We will still be
meeting on a weekly basis.

255
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:38,838
That is all.

256
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,371
-That went well.

257
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:41,871
-Yeah.

258
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:44,538
-You really are
quite amazing, Light.

259
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:47,271
Not only did you manage
to delay the killings,

260
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:50,571
but you also set up Namikawa
as a potential mole for us.

261
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:53,571
It sounded exactly like the
sort of thing I would do,

262
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:57,538
and you thought of it
quicker than I did.

263
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:02,271
At this rate, if I
end up dying somehow,

264
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:03,671
it's quite possible
that you would

265
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,705
be capable of succeeding me.

266
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:06,571
-What?

267
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,471
Why are you being so morbid?

268
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:09,838
There isn't time for that.

269
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:12,005
We only have a month to
figure out Kira's identity

270
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,905
and gather evidence
against him to prove it.

271
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:16,038
This is only the beginning.

272
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:18,938
L: Yes, but you were the
one who first noticed

273
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,538
the connection between
Yotsuba and Kira.

274
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:24,538
You actually might be
more capable than I am.

275
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,571
I honestly believe you
could take this on.

276
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:28,571
[gasp]

277
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,338
L: Tell me, If I
should die, would you

278
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:34,671
take over for me as L?

279
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:36,138
[gasp]

280
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,383
If I should die, would
you take over for me as L?

281
00:12:00,116 --> 00:12:02,449
(VOICEOVER) If he is Kira
and just playing innocent,

282
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:04,349
he's sure to say yes.

283
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,216
-What are you talking about?

284
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:07,983
As long as we're
joined by these,

285
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:09,316
we would die together anyway.

286
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,349
I see.

287
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:17,049
Ryuzaki, I'm sorry,
but I'm going

288
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,049
to have to tell everyone
what you're really

289
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,716
thinking right now.

290
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:22,683
He thinks that if
I am Kira, then

291
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:24,283
there are two possibilities.

292
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:26,849
Either I'm just pretending I'm
not him and putting on an act,

293
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:30,349
or Kira's power has passed
on from me to someone else,

294
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,616
and I have no memory that I was
ever Kira in the first place.

295
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,216
He's trying to determine
which, if either, is the truth.

296
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:40,416
The first theory-- if
I am putting on an act,

297
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:43,416
he will never remove
these handcuffs.

298
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,049
No, even if I wasn't
pretending to be innocent,

299
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,316
I'm sure he still
wouldn't take them off.

300
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,716
Ryuzaki still believes
that I'm Kira.

301
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:53,683
Even if that power had been
passed to someone else,

302
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:55,149
he thinks that I
would have planned

303
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:58,749
to have it return to my once
I'm safe from suspicion.

304
00:12:58,783 --> 00:13:02,483
In other words, I wasn't
being controlled at all.

305
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:05,416
He thinks it was a plan--
to pass on the power

306
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:08,316
and arrange for it to come back
to me once I've been cleared.

307
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:09,683
L (VOICEOVER): Impressive.

308
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:13,283
He figured out exactly what I'd
been thinking all this time.

309
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:16,616
LIGHT: Ryuzaki's theory is
that once I steal L's title,

310
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,916
I will become Kira again.

311
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,549
-Correct.

312
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,483
LIGHT: Taking on
the identity of L,

313
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:26,083
having the power to control
the police in every country

314
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:30,549
while being Kira in
secret-- it's ideal.

315
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,716
And you're thinking
I could do it.

316
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:34,549
No, that I would do it.

317
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,949
That's what you're
saying, isn't it?

318
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,383
-Yes.

319
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,516
-But what about now?

320
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,183
I told you, I don't
want your title.

321
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:43,716
That should prove even to you
that I'm not putting on an act,

322
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,116
shouldn't it?

323
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:47,383
L: If this is all
an act, and you

324
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,616
are trying to steal
my identity, there's

325
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:51,149
no chance you would
be foolish enough

326
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:53,216
to reveal your plan
in front of everyone.

327
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,183
Wouldn't you agree?

328
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:55,149
-Hmm.

329
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:57,916
Ryuzaki.

330
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:59,349
-Huh?

331
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:04,383
-Do you think that I'm actually
capable of becoming a murderer?

332
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,849
Kira?

333
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:07,783
Even after I help you catch him?

334
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:10,516
Do I seem like that
kind of person to you?

335
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,116
L: Yes, you do.

336
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,516
I've always thought so.

337
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:20,916
[gasp]

338
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:21,416
-Hmm.

339
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:27,716
-Gah, not again.

340
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,116
-OK, break it up!

341
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:30,483
Once is enough.

342
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:33,149
It was a draw, so let's just
leave it as an even match, OK?

343
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:35,049
-Yeah, you're right.

344
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,949
Anyway, let's focus on catching
the Kira that's in front of us

345
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:38,983
right now.

346
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:40,449
As long as I have
the handcuffs on,

347
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:41,983
you shouldn't have
any complaints.

348
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,316
-I suppose so.

349
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,716
We only have a month, so there's
no time to get distracted.

350
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,016
[sigh]

351
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:48,683
-Ryuzaki.

352
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:49,816
-Yes?

353
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,716
-We have plenty of
footage from this meeting.

354
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:53,949
Can we use that as evidence
against those seven men

355
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:56,216
and prevent the murders
of other criminals?

356
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:58,349
L (VOICEOVER): Here we go again.

357
00:14:58,383 --> 00:14:59,216
Unfortunately, no.

358
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:00,549
-But why?

359
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,983
-At the moment,
we're not certain

360
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,316
if Kira is among
those seven men.

361
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:06,516
If all they have is a
tenuous connection with him,

362
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:09,516
then Kira will kill them as
soon as they're arrested.

363
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:12,149
We have to be absolutely
sure that Kira is among them,

364
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:14,383
so there's no point
in detaining them now.

365
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,383
And even if it does turn
out to be one of them,

366
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,549
it will still be quite
difficult to determine

367
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,916
who the culprit is.

368
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:23,649
Mm, I believe it's still far too
early for us to make our move.

369
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:24,949
-Hold on.

370
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,916
At the same time, we can't
say that he's definitely not

371
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:27,983
among the seven.

372
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:29,483
That means there's a
chance the killings will

373
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:32,549
stop if we take this
opportunity to arrest them.

374
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,649
-I think Dad's right.

375
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,049
There is a chance.

376
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,783
We have to act on it.

377
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:39,516
L: Excuse me, but I
think from now on,

378
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:41,049
I should go after
Kira by myself.

379
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,383
-Huh?

380
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,649
L: You can use these
headquarters as you wish.

381
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:47,416
I'll also be here, but we
will be working independently.

382
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:49,149
You can conduct
your investigation

383
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:50,449
under your own direction.

384
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,683
Feel free to arrest
those men if you like.

385
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,883
I will be carrying on
my own investigation.

386
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,349
We'll only get into
arguments if we

387
00:15:56,383 --> 00:15:58,549
don't split up and act
separately at this point.

388
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,049
This is for the best.

389
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,783
-Are you saying you're
going to figure out

390
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:04,216
who Kira is by any
means necessary?

391
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:05,583
-Yes.

392
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:09,083
This case will never be solved
unless we capture Kira himself.

393
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,416
Don't get me wrong.

394
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:13,849
I wouldn't say that preventing
more deaths is pointless.

395
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:17,883
But if we don't uncover the
entire truth once and for all,

396
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,183
Kira will only appear again,
and the number of victims

397
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:22,316
will continue to increase.

398
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,016
That's why I believe it's
more important to find out

399
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:27,149
who Kira really is.

400
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:30,616
As I've been saying, I'm opposed
to arresting those seven men.

401
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:32,116
If you want to do
so, then you will

402
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:33,883
have to take
responsibility for them.

403
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,916
I will pursue Kira on my own.

404
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:39,083
We only have one month.

405
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,349
I wonder who will succeed?

406
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,783
-R-- Ryuzaki.

407
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:44,383
Where are you going?

408
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,683
-To Amane's room.

409
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:47,783
Sorry, I know you're on your
father's side in all this,

410
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:49,683
but I can't remove
these handcuffs.

411
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,083
I'm afraid you're going to
have to come along with me.

412
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,783
[humming]

413
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:02,616
-Light!

414
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,383
I didn't know we were
supposed to have a date.

415
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,849
Oh, right, I should have known.

416
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:07,516
-Misa Amane--

417
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:08,816
[shout]

418
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,649
Tell me, do you love Light
from the bottom of your heart?

419
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:11,516
-Huh?

420
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:12,816
Uh, yeah.

421
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,816
Of course I do.

422
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,316
-But you also worship
Kira, don't you?

423
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,683
-Well, yeah.

424
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:20,349
-So then, if you had to
choose between Light and Kira,

425
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,349
who would you pick?

426
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:21,916
-What?

427
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:22,749
That's obvious.

428
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:24,349
Of course it's gonna be Light.

429
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,916
I'm really grateful to Kira
and want to meet him someday

430
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,116
in person, but
that's not true love.

431
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,649
I'd definitely choose Light.

432
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,149
-But your precious Light
is planning to catch Kira.

433
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,616
Isn't that right?

434
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:37,116
-Well, yes, of course I am.

435
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:37,949
[shout]

436
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:39,316
-He says he wants to catch Kira.

437
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,949
Now what will you do?

438
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,416
-Well, if that's
what Light says,

439
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:44,916
then I'm gonna support
him no matter what.

440
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:45,883
-I see.

441
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,449
So if you were given
the opportunity

442
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,516
to work with Light on
this investigation,

443
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:50,516
would you take the offer?

444
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:51,049
-What?

445
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:51,816
Ryuzaki--

446
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,016
-Yeah, of course I would.

447
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:55,216
I'd do anything I
could to help Light.

448
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:56,283
-Wait, hold on a second.

449
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:57,816
Where are you going with this?

450
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,416
L: I'm planning to have Aiber
pose as Eraldo Coil again.

451
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:03,516
He'll tell the Yotsuba members
that while he was investigating

452
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,749
L, he discovered that Misa
Amane might know who he is.

453
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:08,949
He'll also tell them
that L brought her

454
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,516
in for questioning on suspicion
that she was the second Kira.

455
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,216
MISA: That part is true.

456
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:15,316
-If the Yotsuba Group
believe that Misa

457
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,116
could be their
lead to finding L,

458
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,749
then they'll say that
they want to meet

459
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:21,083
her to discuss their
advertising campagin.

460
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:23,783
They'll use that
opportunity to question her.

461
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:25,349
Thanks to Matsuda's
screwup, they

462
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:27,983
may already be considering
Misa as their new spokesperson,

463
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,283
so this could work.

464
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,683
-Yeah, right.

465
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:32,149
-We can't do that.

466
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:33,149
-Why not?

467
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:34,249
-This plan is too risky.

468
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:35,716
Who knows what
could happen to you?

469
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:36,783
-Oh, wow!

470
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,816
Does that mean you're
worried about me?

471
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:40,616
Yay!

472
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:41,916
But don't worry.

473
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:43,583
I won't mind doing
something like this

474
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,083
if it's for you, Light.

475
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:46,283
-Listen, Misa.

476
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:48,949
If they suspect that you
might know who L really is,

477
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,883
we don't know how far
they'll be willing to go

478
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,049
to get that information.

479
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,283
-No problemo.

480
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,883
I promise I won't say anything,
even if they torture me.

481
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,583
-I can attest to that.

482
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:00,316
-But Kira can control
his victims' actions

483
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:01,516
before their death.

484
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,983
There's a good
chance he might try

485
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,783
to manipulate her into
revealing what she knows

486
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:05,716
and then kill her.

487
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:07,849
Also, if he does
manage to kill L,

488
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:09,183
he won't have any use for Misa.

489
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:10,716
He'd kill her to
keep her silent.

490
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,849
-Uh, I don't like
the sound of that.

491
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:13,349
L: Light.

492
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:15,216
-Hmm?

493
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:18,349
-You forget that if we win
against Kira, Misa won't die.

494
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:21,049
Besides, as long as we're
handcuffed together,

495
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,316
you and I share the same fate.

496
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:27,283
If I die, so will you.

497
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:30,616
If that happens, Misa is the one
who would grieve most of all.

498
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:32,616
Either we lose and
both die together,

499
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,483
or we successfully catch Kira.

500
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:35,816
Which is it?

501
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,149
-We catch Kira!

502
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:39,183
I would never dream about
living in a world without Light.

503
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:40,483
-Yes, that would be dark.

504
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:41,349
-Cut it out!

505
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:42,849
This is just crazy.

506
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:45,816
-We're running out of time, and
I'm starting to get desperate.

507
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:48,649
As for Misa Amane,
I've turned to her

508
00:19:48,683 --> 00:19:52,849
because I know her bravery
and love for you is boundless.

509
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:55,149
-Do you really mean it?

510
00:19:55,183 --> 00:19:57,916
Oh no, I think I've
totally misunderstood you

511
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,116
all this time.

512
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:00,416
I even called you a pervert.

513
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,383
But you actually do understand
how I feel, don't you?

514
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,649
-Yes.

515
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:08,716
Misa is indisputably the
most perfect and worthy woman

516
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,283
for Light.

517
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:09,783
-Uh--

518
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:10,749
-Yay!

519
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:12,249
You're such a sweetie.

520
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:13,249
Thank you, Ryuzaki.

521
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:15,749
-I could actually fall for you.

522
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,649
MISA: Let's not go that far.

523
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,083
But you could maybe
be a friend of mine.

524
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:21,183
Would that be OK?

525
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:22,216
-Yes.

526
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:24,849
So now I've gained
yet another friend.

527
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:26,049
-Yeah.

528
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,849
Of course, any friend is
a friend of mine as well.

529
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:33,249
[laughing] Let's all
be friends together.

530
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,216
-(DEADPAN) Yay, fun, huh.

531
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:36,716
-And of course, I
would never think

532
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:38,216
of betraying any of my friends.

533
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:41,183
With our powers combined,
we'll arrest Kira.

534
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:44,316
-Unfortunately, Light's taking
a different investigative

535
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:45,816
approach from us
and will be working

536
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,349
with his father and the others.

537
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:48,449
-Hmm?

538
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,816
L: I'm afraid it will
just be you and I.

539
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:50,483
-Huh?

540
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:51,616
What's up with that?

541
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,916
-Come on, L. Now you're
just playing dirty.

542
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:56,583
You're leaving me with no
other choice but to join your--

543
00:20:56,616 --> 00:20:58,016
L: No, that's quite all right.

544
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,383
MISA: What are
you talking about?

545
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,016
Of course he'll be joining us.

546
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,049
-That's not it either.

547
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,749
I've been opposed to
this investigation

548
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:04,983
since the beginning.

549
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:06,616
It's too dangerous for her!

550
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:07,883
-Oh, Light.

551
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:08,783
You're so sweet.

552
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:10,649
Thank you for worrying about me.

553
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:12,049
But please let me do this.

554
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,716
I want to be useful
to you somehow.

555
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:18,683
If I can be useful, then maybe
you'll love me even more.

556
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:23,016
And besides, I would gladly
die if it were for you, Light.

557
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,383
-Figuring out the logistics
of arresting seven people

558
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,683
is going to be challenging.

559
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:29,754
I don't suppose you
two have any ideas.

560
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:30,645
Mogi?

561
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:32,085
Matsuda?

562
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,481
[theme music]

563
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:52,214
MISA (VOICEOVER):
Well, I am an actress.

564
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,947
Director Nishinaka, Light,
and the others, and now even

565
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:55,814
Shinigami.

566
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:57,314
They're all asking me to act.

567
00:22:57,347 --> 00:22:58,714
This is a lot of work.

568
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:03,514
I might land a commercial gig,
too. [giggle] I'm so popular.
