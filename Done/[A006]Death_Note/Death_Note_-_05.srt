00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:03,366
[music playing]

2
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:18,300
[music - nightmare, "the world"]

3
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,600
[bus idling]

4
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:45,731
[crowd murmuring]

5
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:54,542
RAYE PENBER: You there.

6
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:55,176
-Yeah?

7
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,376
-Listen carefully.

8
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,642
I cam to Japan as part of
a secret investigation,

9
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:03,809
so the local police can't
find out that, um, that I--

10
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:05,009
-I understand.

11
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,009
I promise I won't tell
anyone that I met you,

12
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:10,142
and of course that
includes my father.

13
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:12,042
-Well, then please excuse me.

14
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:17,642
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
It's just as I thought.

15
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:19,409
Anyway, I don't want
the police to know

16
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:22,676
that I've come into contact
with an FBI agent either.

17
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,976
If my father ever
found out, there's

18
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,976
no doubt he'd let L know.

19
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:29,809
It's obvious that he
doesn't suspect me.

20
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:32,209
And as for the police,
I'm sure they'll

21
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:34,442
treat this as just another
unfortunate accident.

22
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:49,109
[door opens]

23
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:51,476
-Hey, welcome back.

24
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,809
RAYE PENBER: [sighs] What a day.

25
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,209
-Raye, what's the matter?

26
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,809
Something happened, didn't it?

27
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:00,009
I've never heard
you sigh like that.

28
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:01,842
-Yeah.

29
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:04,342
The bus I was on got hijacked,
if you can believe it.

30
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,376
-A bus-jacking?

31
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,609
-Some junkie robbed
a bank two days ago

32
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:10,876
and I guess he wanted to
try taking on a bus today.

33
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:14,742
I didn't think this kind
of thing happened here.

34
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:18,176
-So you were already riding the
bus when the hijacker got on?

35
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,476
RAYE PENBER: Yeah.

36
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,109
And in the end, the guy freaked
out, jumped off the bus,

37
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:24,776
and got hit by a car.

38
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:27,509
-Did he die?

39
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,876
-Yeah, probably.

40
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,576
I couldn't really stick around
to see what happened to him.

41
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:32,542
-You know--

42
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:33,609
-Hm?

43
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:34,742
-It's a little hard
to believe that that

44
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,842
was all a coincidence,
don't you think?

45
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:38,276
-What do you mean?

46
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:39,242
-Think about it.

47
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:40,609
You got on that bus
because you were

48
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:41,809
investigating someone, right?

49
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,642
And now you're telling
me that this criminal

50
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:44,842
is most likely dead.

51
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:46,442
Doesn't that suggest that you--

52
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:46,942
RAYE PENBER: That's enough.

53
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,942
-Uh--

54
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:49,442
-Look, darling,
you and I know you

55
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,876
used to be one of the
best agents in the FBI.

56
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:53,376
But now you're my fiance now.

57
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:55,042
We talked about this.

58
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:58,209
You're not an agent anymore,
so just leave it alone.

59
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:00,209
-But--

60
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:02,542
-You wouldn't get involved
with the Kira case

61
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,676
and you wouldn't do
anything dangerous.

62
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,542
That's what you
promised when we decided

63
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:09,209
you'd come with me so I could
meet your parents in Japan.

64
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:11,076
You do remember that, don't you?

65
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:12,842
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

66
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:14,309
It's just force of habit.

67
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:15,909
Sorry about that.

68
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:17,809
-No, I should be sorry.

69
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:19,542
Let's forget about it.

70
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,776
Anyway, once we have a
few kids running around,

71
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:23,142
you'll probably
be so busy you'll

72
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,076
forget you were ever an agent.

73
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:29,076
Your mind'll be occupied
with better things, too.

74
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:31,009
More importantly, tell
me how I can convince

75
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,609
your dad I'm worthy
of his daughter.

76
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:36,842
Kira doesn't scare me
half as much as he does.

77
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,109
RYUK: Oh, let me guess.

78
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:41,909
You're about to write down the
name of that agent, aren't you?

79
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:42,976
The one from the bus.

80
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,242
-Not yet.

81
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:46,809
I'm going to wait one week
before writing his name.

82
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:48,542
If he dies right
after meeting me,

83
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,442
I'll only draw
attention to myself.

84
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:52,442
I'll write his name in
here once I've given them

85
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:55,076
time to investigate more
people with ties to the police.

86
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:56,776
It will be less
obvious that way.

87
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,209
In the meantime,
I think I'll use

88
00:04:58,242 --> 00:04:59,842
some of those inmates
I've been keeping

89
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:01,909
alive to play around
with L a little more.

90
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,076
[beeping]

91
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:03,842
WATARI (ON COMM): L.

92
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:05,376
-Hm?

93
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:06,776
WATARI (ON COMM):
Another victim.

94
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:10,076
This one left what appears
to be a suicide note.

95
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,309
-Please, send it to me.

96
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,709
L (VOICEOVER): Gods of death.

97
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,742
L, do you know?

98
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,509
Gods of death.

99
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:25,242
Is he trying to tell us
that gods of death exist?

100
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:29,142
-Listen, Watari, tell the police
to monitor prison populations

101
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:31,009
closely for the next few days.

102
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:34,242
Kira may use other suicide
notes to communicate with us.

103
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:35,442
WATARI (ON COMM): Understood.

104
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:47,909
RYUK: This place is
crawling with humans.

105
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:50,009
Are you gonna do it here?

106
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,442
-Let's just say
you're about to see

107
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,509
the results of all the
research and experiments

108
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:55,542
I've been doing over
the last few days.

109
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:56,509
RYUK: Experiments?

110
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:57,909
-Yeah.

111
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,109
I've been using known criminals
who live in this part of town

112
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,742
to test out different
killing methods,

113
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:04,942
and I've learned a lot
about the Death note.

114
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:07,042
For example, if I
write a cause of death

115
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,842
and the circumstances
leading up to it,

116
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:11,509
I can add a name afterwards
and it'll still happen.

117
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:12,509
RYUK (VOICEOVER): Oooh.

118
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,509
Even I didn't know that one.

119
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,942
-He's here.

120
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:18,976
Right on time.

121
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,742
Mr. Raye Pember.

122
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:28,876
Turn around and you're dead.

123
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:29,842
I am Kira.

124
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:34,773
That's right.

125
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:36,473
Don't turn around or put
your hands in your pockets.

126
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:38,673
I won't hesitate
to kill you here.

127
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:41,244
RAYE (VOICEOVER):
It-- it couldn't be.

128
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:44,211
His voice, I've
heard it somewhere.

129
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:47,611
-But first I'm gonna prove
to you that I'm Kira.

130
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:51,144
Do you see the man working
over there at the coffee shop?

131
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,978
That's right, the one
sweeping the floor.

132
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,778
I'm gonna kill him just for you.

133
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:56,778
-But-- but how?

134
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:57,978
Don't do it.

135
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:01,444
[strangled cry]

136
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:03,378
[thud]

137
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,611
-I'm afraid I had no
choice but to kill him.

138
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:07,744
I figured if I didn't
kill at least one person,

139
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,311
you wouldn't believe him.

140
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:11,178
Although that man has
been repeatedly charged

141
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:14,144
with sexual assault, he's
managed to avoid conviction

142
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:16,011
every time due to
lack of evidence.

143
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,644
He was a menace to society.

144
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:19,711
He got what he deserved.

145
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:23,578
I can only assume that L has
already informed you of this.

146
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,844
I can't kill someone
who I haven't seen.

147
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,344
I have to know their face.

148
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:30,744
Which means, of course, I could
easily kill all these people

149
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:32,544
right now if I wanted to.

150
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,378
Go ahead and choose
someone if you want.

151
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:35,011
-D-don't do it.

152
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:35,911
I believe you.

153
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:39,178
You're Kira.

154
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:41,511
-But I'm sure you care
more about your loved ones

155
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,811
than any of these people here.

156
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:44,344
Imagine how you'd
feel if one of them

157
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:47,244
was killed just because
you refused to cooperate.

158
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:50,044
I think you should consider
them the real hostages

159
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,911
at the moment.

160
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:53,611
-How do you know about her?

161
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:57,011
-[laughs] You seem surprised.

162
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,311
I've been investigating you.

163
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:03,011
And if you don't do exactly
as I say, she will die,

164
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:06,144
and so will the rest of
your family, including you.

165
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:07,711
And that's a promise.

166
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,678
-I-- I understand.

167
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:11,411
Just tell me what
you need me to do.

168
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:13,878
-I see you've got
your laptop with you.

169
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:17,078
I want the files containing
the identities of all the FBI

170
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:18,778
agents who came to Japan.

171
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:21,078
RAYE PENBER: I do have
my laptop with me.

172
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:22,411
It's the one I use for work.

173
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:25,444
But I don't have the
files you're looking for.

174
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:27,644
LIGHT: All right, then
take this envelope.

175
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:29,611
-Huh?

176
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,644
-First, take the transceiver
out of the envelope.

177
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,444
Then put the earpiece in
and await my instructions.

178
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:36,878
RAYE (VOICEOVER):
The transceiver?

179
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:38,778
This thing looks like a toy.

180
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,944
But there'll be no record of
this transmission anywhere.

181
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:44,344
And it allows us to converse
from a close distance,

182
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:46,111
even underground.

183
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:48,244
He really thought this through.

184
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,744
LIGHT (OVER
TRANSCEIVER): All right,

185
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:51,611
now get on the Yamanote Line.

186
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:53,478
Inner or outer
route-- it doesn't

187
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,378
matter which direction you take.

188
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,011
I'll be close by
at all times, which

189
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:02,578
means I'll be watching
your every move.

190
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,178
When you get on the train,
pick a spot in front of you

191
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,878
and don't take your eyes off it.

192
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,411
If I see you looking
around, I will kill you.

193
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:11,478
Once you've boarded,
I want you to take

194
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:12,911
the seat closest to the door.

195
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:16,044
If it's occupied,
wait until it's free.

196
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:17,944
[horn blares]

197
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:27,911
[brakes squealing]

198
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:34,711
LIGHT (OVER TRANSCEIVER): Now
I'm going to ask you something.

199
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:37,311
If I have even the slightest
suspicion that you're not

200
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,878
being honest, your girlfriend
is as good as dead.

201
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:43,711
How many FBI agents
are currently in Japan?

202
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:45,444
Speak quietly into
the transceiver

203
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:46,844
and don't make it obvious.

204
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,911
-(QUIETLY) I believe it's four
teams, three agents per team,

205
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:51,178
for a total of 12.

206
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,344
LIGHT (OVER TRANSCEIVER): OK.

207
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:56,778
Now take the papers
out of the envelope.

208
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:57,278
-Huh?

209
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,511
What is this?

210
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:05,978
LIGHT (OVER TRANSCEIVER): Of
those 12 agents you mentioned,

211
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,311
I want you to write down
the name of your superior,

212
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:10,144
the one who's heading
up this investigation,

213
00:10:10,178 --> 00:10:13,478
in the space at the
very top of the page.

214
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:15,378
RAYE (VOICEOVER): What
is the meaning of this?

215
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:16,911
What is he after?

216
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:19,511
Let's face it -- he hasn't
really left me any choice.

217
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:21,361
Besides, it's not
like he can kill

218
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:22,661
them using just their names.

219
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:24,795
LIGHT (OVER TRANSCEIVER):
Next take out your laptop

220
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:25,761
and turn it on.

221
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:27,228
Any minute now,
your boss is going

222
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,561
to send you a message
with a file attachment.

223
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,328
It contains the names
and photos of all the FBI

224
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,528
agents currently
active in Japan.

225
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:37,595
-But this-- this is--

226
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:39,328
LIGHT (OVER TRANSCEIVER):
Now one by one,

227
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:40,995
you're going to
look at each photo

228
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:43,695
and then write that agent's
name in the space provided.

229
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:47,295
You're going to do
this for each agent.

230
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:49,095
RAYE (VOICEOVER): It
doesn't make sense.

231
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:52,661
If he's got the names
already, why use me?

232
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,228
What's he planning
to do with them?

233
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,161
LIGHT (OVER TRANSCEIVER): Good.

234
00:10:58,195 --> 00:10:59,561
Looks like you're done.

235
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:01,328
Now put the transceiver
and all the papers

236
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,995
back into the original envelope
and place them on the rack

237
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:05,795
directly above your head.

238
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:07,761
After that, you're going
to stay in your seat

239
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:10,195
and ride the train for at
least another 30 minutes.

240
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,828
When you are absolutely
certain that nobody will notice

241
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:14,195
you leaving without
the envelope,

242
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:15,528
you can get off the train.

243
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:22,395
RAYE (VOICEOVER):
I know that voice.

244
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:27,328
Why on Earth can't' I
remember who it belongs to?

245
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:31,328
[brakes squealing]

246
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:38,061
RAYE (VOICEOVER):
Kira, who are you?

247
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:39,528
[gasp]

248
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:42,461
[one heartbeat]

249
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:46,828
[strangled cry]

250
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:50,728
[breathing jaggedly]

251
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:56,095
[struggling to breathe]

252
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:59,728
RAYE (VOICEOVER): Light Yagami.

253
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,495
-Farewell, Raye Pember.

254
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,595
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Raye Pember
wrote all of those names

255
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,861
on pages taken from
the Death Note.

256
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:15,228
Ironic.

257
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:17,678
Without even realizing
it, he was actually

258
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:19,978
signing a death warrant
for all of his colleagues.

259
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:23,112
As for Pember's boss, he
died of a heart attack

260
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:25,878
after sending all
his agents a file.

261
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,712
And the other 11 investigators?

262
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:29,778
[chuckles] They
all died of heart

263
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:31,912
attacks after receiving
the same file.

264
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:49,470
WATARI (ON COMM):
L, you have a call

265
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,161
from the director of the FBI.

266
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:54,770
STEVE MASON: It's me.

267
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:57,003
I've got a report in front
of me right now stating

268
00:12:57,037 --> 00:13:00,203
that all of our agents
in Japan are dead.

269
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,503
All 12 died of heart attacks.

270
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:06,270
I can only assume that
Kira is behind this.

271
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:09,537
Look, I'm sorry, but
it's already decided.

272
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,437
We're calling off
our investigation.

273
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,803
[beeping]

274
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:16,403
WATARI (ON COMM): I have
Chief Yagami on the line.

275
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,237
SOICHIRO YAGAMI (ON
COMM): L, I just got off

276
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,737
the phone with the
director of the FBI.

277
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,437
According to him it seems
that you arranged for the FBI

278
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,637
to come to Japan and investigate
everyone here associated

279
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,070
with the task force.

280
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:29,370
L: Yes, I did.

281
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:31,603
SOICHIRO YAGAMI (ON COMM):
So how do you explain this?

282
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:34,703
Are we now suspects in
our own investigation?

283
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:38,670
L: I felt that it was necessary
to uncover Kira's identity.

284
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:40,303
-(ANGRILY) I cannot accept that!

285
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:42,037
I find it unbelievable
that you would

286
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,437
spy on us, the very people
working with you on this case.

287
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,670
-Hear that?

288
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:48,770
Well, I knew all along we
couldn't trust that guy.

289
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:52,570
-More importantly, Kira killed
those FBI agents, didn't he?

290
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:54,803
-It's obvious he'll kill
anyone who gets in his way,

291
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:56,470
whether they're
criminals or not.

292
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,403
So much for his
sense of justice.

293
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,270
He's a murderer.

294
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:00,703
[beeping]

295
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:02,403
WATARI (ON COMM): We
have another victim.

296
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:05,670
A note was found at the scene.

297
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:12,070
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): L, do
you know gods of death?

298
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,403
-Hum?

299
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,837
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Love apples.

300
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,303
L (VOICEOVER): Damn you, Kira.

301
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:25,637
-(TEARFULLY) He's dead?

302
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,070
Raye's dead?

303
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:31,503
No, he was-- he was
murdered by Kira.

304
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:39,837
SAYU: Um, so what's with
the family meeting, Dad?

305
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,737
-I figured you're going to
find out sooner or later,

306
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,903
so I might as well tell you now.

307
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:46,403
I don't want you to be alarmed.

308
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,603
I'm sure you've heard of
this Kira investigation.

309
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,203
Well, I'm currently
in charge of it.

310
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:50,770
-What?

311
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:51,903
Are you serious?

312
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:53,570
That's totally awesome, Dad.

313
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:55,303
You're the best cop ever!

314
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:57,537
-That's not quite the
point I'm trying to make.

315
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,603
-Oh?

316
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:03,203
-You see, the truth is the
FBI sent 12 of their agents

317
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:07,170
to Japan to assist us in
finding Kira, and all of them

318
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:08,270
died yesterday.

319
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:10,237
-Does that mean they
were all killed by Kira?

320
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,670
-What?

321
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,337
-What I'm saying is there's a
chance that Kira will actually

322
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,437
try to kill anyone
who comes after him.

323
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,170
His crimes are ruthless and
more frightening than anything

324
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:20,103
we've seen.

325
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:22,137
Many detectives
have already quit.

326
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,803
-Dad, you should quit, too.

327
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:24,837
I don't want you to die.

328
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,703
What if he gets you?

329
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:27,903
-That's right.

330
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:30,170
Your life is so much more
important than some job.

331
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:31,470
-I can't.

332
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:33,970
I could never forgive myself
if I walked away from this.

333
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:36,570
I will not sit back
and let evil triumph.

334
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,303
-But Dad, you--

335
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,303
-Please, dear.

336
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:43,670
-I think it's
honorable of you, Dad.

337
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:46,770
I'm proud to be able
to call you my father.

338
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:48,803
And if anything should
ever happen to you,

339
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:52,370
I'm going to find Kira-- and
make sure he gets executed.

340
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:00,137
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: We now
know that Kira doesn't just

341
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,270
target criminals.

342
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:03,037
He'll kill anyone
who opposes him.

343
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,037
It's quite possible that we
may all be killed by Kira.

344
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,337
Think of your own lives, your
families and all the others

345
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,270
you'd be leaving behind.

346
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:16,270
If anyone wants to leave this
investigation, now is the time.

347
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:18,337
You won't be demoted if
you choose not to stay.

348
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,003
You have my word.

349
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:24,437
But if you're not absolutely
sure, then we don't need you.

350
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,570
You have to be willing
to fight against him,

351
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:29,970
even if that means making
the ultimate sacrifice.

352
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,970
That is all.

353
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:33,437
POLICEMAN: So what
are you gonna do?

354
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,770
POLICEMAN: I'm not sure.

355
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:37,503
BUS DRIVER: Oh, yeah,
that's him all right.

356
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:39,137
There's no doubt about it.

357
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,303
I remember him because
he told us to get down.

358
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:45,037
But I don't really remember
any of the other passengers.

359
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,503
NAOMI: I see.

360
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:48,870
Well, thanks for
talking with me anyway.

361
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:49,803
I appreciate it.

362
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:54,837
NAOMI (VOICEOVER): It's
a bit of a long shot,

363
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,770
but if what I'm
thinking is right,

364
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:59,470
Kira could have been one of the
passengers on the bus that day.

365
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:02,303
And if that is the
case, then I know

366
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,770
that he's close enough
to use this bus route.

367
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,770
-Five men, huh?

368
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,903
Well, six, including myself.

369
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:19,803
Still, I'm grateful to see
that there are as many as five

370
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:22,170
of you willing to risk
your lives to face evil.

371
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:23,637
L (OVER COMM): The
fact that you've

372
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,003
chosen to stay means you have
a strong sense of justice.

373
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,803
I trust all of you.

374
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:28,803
-Huh?

375
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:30,903
Uh, hold on a second.

376
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:33,670
L just said that he's
decided to trust us now.

377
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:36,670
But honestly, what reason
do we have to trust him?

378
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:38,537
HIDEKI IDE: Look,
L, all of us have

379
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,803
agreed to put our lives at
risk to bring Kira to justice,

380
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:43,970
so I hope you understand
what this means.

381
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:45,770
We're really sticking
our necks out here.

382
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:48,303
SHUICHI AIZAWA: But you never
have to show your face, do you?

383
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:50,370
You just give the orders.

384
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,770
I don't see how
you can expect us

385
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,637
to work alongside you
under those conditions.

386
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,403
-L, if all of us are
going to work together

387
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:02,637
on this investigation,
and if you truly

388
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,837
meant what you said about
trusting the six of us,

389
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,637
could you come here so we
can all meet in person?

390
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,770
L (OVER COMM): The thought
had already crossed my mind.

391
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:14,870
After all, I did say that
I trusted all of you.

392
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:21,703
-Huh?

393
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,037
HIDEKI IDE: Why is he
seeking our help now?

394
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,470
There's only six of us.

395
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:45,503
He solved all these difficult
cases by himself in the past,

396
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:47,270
so what makes this
one so different?

397
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:49,370
The way L's been
conducting things so far,

398
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:51,770
odds are he's going to
send a stand-in or a proxy

399
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:54,370
of some kind to meet us
instead of coming himself.

400
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:56,137
It's not like we'd ever know.

401
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,937
-A proxy, huh?

402
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,370
Well, it is possible.

403
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:01,970
-I believe L. I think
we can trust him.

404
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:03,737
And besides, I
don't really see how

405
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,537
we can solve this
case without his help.

406
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,803
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: I agree.

407
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:11,770
From the beginning he's been
very upfront about the fact

408
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:15,037
that he would need the help
of the police on this case.

409
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,937
Perhaps we should
think of it like he's

410
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,837
been waiting for this
to happen all along.

411
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,803
-Why would he do
something like that?

412
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:24,837
-There were a number of
people on the task force

413
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,837
who distrusted L before
this investigation began.

414
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,770
And once we got started,
we had detectives

415
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,803
resigning left and right.

416
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,770
Following that, classified
information was leaked,

417
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:37,003
so I'm not surprised
that he didn't trust us.

418
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:39,070
-In other words, he was
waiting for the task force

419
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:41,337
to get narrowed down to
only those investigators he

420
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,337
could trust.

421
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,037
And to do that, he
needed to weed out

422
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,337
anyone who wasn't
totally committed.

423
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,570
-Hm.

424
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,721
--[frustrated sigh] If
we're working with that guy

425
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,321
I'm leaving the task force.

426
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:53,554
You don't have to worry.

427
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:54,754
I won't try to follow you.

428
00:19:54,787 --> 00:20:00,087
I'm not interested in finding L.

429
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:01,887
-Well, I think we
can trust L, so I'd

430
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:04,354
be willing to cooperate with
him on this investigation.

431
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,254
-Count me in.

432
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,887
L (OVER COMM): I'm staying
in a suite at the Teito Hotel

433
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:15,387
at the moment, but I'll be
switching hotels every few days

434
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:16,854
from this point on.

435
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:18,587
I want you to think
of these hotel rooms

436
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:21,687
as the de facto headquarters
of this investigation.

437
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,387
If this arrangement is
acceptable to all of you,

438
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,221
then split into two groups
and stagger your arrivals

439
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:30,187
so you come 30 minutes apart.

440
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:33,021
Please arrange it so you're
all here at midnight.

441
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,821
L (VOICEOVER): Kira.

442
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:40,921
It seems we're getting closer
to each other in equal steps.

443
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:44,654
It's only a matter of
time before we collide.

444
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:46,221
So be it.

445
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:47,821
I'm ready to show my face.

446
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:50,121
I'll make my first
public appearance

447
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:53,354
as L. If you ever
manage to find out

448
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:55,621
about these secret
meetings, I'm sure you'd

449
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,054
feel compelled to move in.

450
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,287
That's what I'm counting on.

451
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:02,987
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I've been quite active

452
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:05,087
over these last few days.

453
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:05,987
Think carefully.

454
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:07,987
Was there anything I missed?

455
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,554
And what comes next?

456
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:12,221
There are endless possibilities.

457
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:17,172
The real battle is
only just beginning, L.

458
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:24,687
[knock]

459
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:25,687
L: It's unlocked.

460
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:27,859
Please let yourselves in.

461
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:28,690
-Mm.

462
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:44,890
[music - nightmare, "alumina"]

463
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:59,089
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): This woman,
If she had spoken to the police

464
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:02,089
before I met her--
but it seems there's

465
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:07,456
a god on my side after all,
and not just a god of death.
