[theme music]

2
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:51,335
-How many seconds has it
been since you wrote down

3
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:54,568
the first name?

4
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:56,602
-35.

5
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:57,868
36.

6
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,068
37.

7
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,468
38.

8
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,635
39.

9
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:05,002
-Well, Near, look like I win.

10
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:05,502
-40.

11
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:33,035
-We're still alive.

12
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:35,702
-It's been over a minute
and we haven't died.

13
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:41,935
-Didn't I already tell you all
that no one was going to die?

14
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:45,468
-But-- but why?

15
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:48,102
Why won't they die?

16
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:51,935
God, I did everything
you told me.

17
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,868
-Rester, Gevanni, take him now.

18
00:02:56,868 --> 00:03:00,768
[screaming]

19
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:02,368
-Gevanni, the notebook please.

20
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:07,468
If you didn't
believe me earlier,

21
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:08,502
then see for yourselves.

22
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:14,368
I can confirm that the first
four names are definitely

23
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,668
the real names of
the SPK members.

24
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:19,068
The second four are
the names of your team.

25
00:03:19,102 --> 00:03:24,468
The only name that hasn't been
written down is Light Yagami.

26
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:27,935
If that weren't enough, Mikami
also addressed you as God,

27
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:30,835
and said he did what
you asked him to.

28
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:31,535
It's settled.

29
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:37,102
-It's a trap!

30
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,468
This whole thing is a set up!

31
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:41,202
This is all part of
Near's plan to frame me.

32
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:42,868
Isn't it a little
odd that no one

33
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:45,802
died after having their name
written in the notebook?

34
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:47,302
This proves it's a trap.

35
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,302
-I believe I already told
you that no one would

36
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,568
die because I
modified the notebook.

37
00:03:57,602 --> 00:04:01,568
-No, you-- that-- that can't be.

38
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:05,768
This is a set up.

39
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:06,668
I don't know this guy.

40
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,335
-Light, it's too
late to deny it.

41
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:16,035
You know Near has won.

42
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:19,568
Just a moment ago, you were
saying, "it looks like I win."

43
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:21,468
How much more of a
confession do we need?

44
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:27,068
-Light.

45
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:31,902
Why?

46
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:40,835
-Stop it.

47
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:53,402
-Light Yagami.

48
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:57,335
L. Kira.

49
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:58,035
It's over.

50
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:58,868
You've lost the game.

51
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,102
Just a moment ago, you
proclaimed your victory,

52
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:07,302
expecting us all to die.

53
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:10,535
And to tell the truth, you
might have actually won,

54
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:13,268
and I would've lost.

55
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:16,268
We ended up doing exactly
what you expected us to,

56
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:18,802
and altered the fake notebook
in Mikuni's possession.

57
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,435
However, when I said before that
we had modified the notebook,

58
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:26,902
I was, in fact, referring to
the real notebook as well as

59
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:29,668
the fake.

60
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:32,068
We only switched part
of the fake notebook.

61
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:35,968
But as for the real one, we
replaced the entire thing.

62
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,802
This notebook here is
actually the real one.

63
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:40,502
-No.

64
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:41,968
Impossible!

65
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,835
-We used the same kind
of pen that Mikami

66
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:46,168
used, copied his handwriting
perfectly, and made

67
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:48,235
both the inside and
the outside of our fake

68
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:50,702
look exactly like the original.

69
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,035
Gevanni was able to do
it in a single night.

70
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:59,202
Of course, since I had
touched the real notebook

71
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:04,902
before coming, I've been able
to see the Shinigami as well.

72
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:07,602
It's a pleasure to meet
you, Mr. Shinigami.

73
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,935
I'm Near.

74
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,602
-Nice to meet you too.

75
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,235
My name is Ryuk.

76
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,202
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
He can talk to Ryuk.

77
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:19,268
He can see him, so that
means it must be true.

78
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:22,002
-Some of the edges of this
notebook's pages are torn.

79
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:24,235
Tell me, if someone's name
was written on a ripped

80
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:26,468
off piece of paper,
would they still die?

81
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,435
-Oh yeah, of course they would.

82
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:29,668
-I thought so.

83
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:33,435
I bet you were able to use
that to your advantage.

84
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:36,202
I wonder how many times
you deceived us with this,

85
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:39,668
and how many people you killed.

86
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:42,602
Light Yagami, you are Kira.

87
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:49,902
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Thi--
this has got to be a trick.

88
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:52,435
Or could it be that Mikami's
betrayed me somehow.

89
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:54,602
-You're mistaken.

90
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:57,302
This was all thanks to Mello.

91
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:58,802
I believe if I
explain this much,

92
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,535
you'll begin to understand.

93
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:01,535
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): What?

94
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,735
Mello?

95
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,735
-Please take a look at
this page of the notebook.

96
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:10,368
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Takada's
name is in the notebook.

97
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:12,368
I was the one who killed
her, but her death

98
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:14,935
was written there
just one minute later.

99
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,068
Did that mean Mikami did
the same thing I did?

100
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:22,135
-God, you told me you
couldn't move freely.

101
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:24,735
I had to make sure
Takada was taken care of.

102
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:26,302
Wasn't that my duty to you?

103
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:27,668
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): You idiot!

104
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:30,335
I gave you strict orders not to
make any unnecessary movements

105
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:31,768
until today.

106
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:33,168
-It's all true.

107
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,635
On the 26th, right after
Takada's kidnapping

108
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:39,835
was broadcast on the news,
Mikami went to the bank.

109
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:42,202
-I'd been trailing him.

110
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:45,702
I knew he went to the bank
every month on the 25th.

111
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:48,502
So it was odd for
someone so methodical

112
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,235
to go to the bank
twice in two days.

113
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:54,068
I followed Mikami to the bank as
he headed for the safe deposit

114
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:55,202
boxes.

115
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:57,402
It was only at this time
that he seemed concerned

116
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,702
whether someone was
following him or not.

117
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:02,968
I got into his safe deposit box.

118
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:05,235
Inside was the real notebook.

119
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:10,735
Sure enough, Takada's name had
already been written inside it.

120
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:12,935
-Do you understand
now, Light Yagami?

121
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:15,402
You didn't realize that
Mikami made a move on his own

122
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:17,135
and wrote Takada's
name in his notebook,

123
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:18,535
because you had
already killed her

124
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:21,168
using a notebook
clipping yourself.

125
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:22,835
This was the event
that made me consider

126
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:25,102
the possibility of
a fake notebook.

127
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:28,268
We were able to stop you thanks
to the efforts of one person--

128
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:32,202
it was Mello who did it all.

129
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:36,202
-Mello probably knew what was
going to happen all along.

130
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:37,702
MELLO (ON PHONE):
It can be resolved

131
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:40,002
by having a name
written in the notebook?

132
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:43,002
-That's right.

133
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:47,368
-Well then, if I don't do it--

134
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:51,535
-I bet Mello knew in his heart
that working by ourselves,

135
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,768
neither of us would be
able to attain our goal

136
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:59,735
and surpass our mentor L.
But together-- together,

137
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:03,768
we can stand with L.
Together, we can surpass L.

138
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:07,368
And now, acting as one, we
face the Kira who defeated L.

139
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:12,768
And with solid evidence,
beat him at his own game.

140
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,168
Let's see you try and talk
your way out of this one,

141
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:16,935
if you can.

142
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:31,202
[laughing]

143
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:52,268
-That's right.

144
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:56,468
I am Kira.

145
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,126
-That's right.

146
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,326
I am Kira.

147
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:21,059
And what can you do?

148
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,159
Kill me right here?

149
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,759
Hear this.

150
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:35,692
I'm not only Kira, but I am
also God of the new world.

151
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:39,159
Kira has become law in
the world we now live.

152
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:41,926
He's the one who's
maintaining order.

153
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,359
I have become justice,
the only hope for mankind.

154
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:49,859
Kill me?

155
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:52,259
Is that really the
right thing to do?

156
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:58,092
Since Kira's appearance six
years ago, wars have stopped,

157
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:02,092
and global crime rates have
been reduced by over 70%.

158
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:03,692
But it's not enough.

159
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:07,792
This world is still rotten
with too many rotten people.

160
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:13,959
Somebody has to do this.

161
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:17,059
And when I first got that
notebook all those years ago,

162
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:19,459
I knew I had to do it.

163
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:20,326
No.

164
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:24,392
I was the only one who could.

165
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:28,359
I understood that killing
people was a crime.

166
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:29,992
There was no other way.

167
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:32,392
The world had to be fixed.

168
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:36,026
A purpose given to me.

169
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,492
Only I could do it.

170
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:43,459
Who else could have done
it and come this far?

171
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:44,992
Would they have kept going?

172
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:54,326
The only one who can
create a new world is me.

173
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:02,626
-No.

174
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,826
You're just a
murderer, Light Yagami.

175
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:07,159
And this notebook is
the deadliest weapon

176
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:11,526
of mass murder in the
history of mankind.

177
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:14,159
You yielded to the power of
the Shinigami and the notebook.

178
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,359
And you have confused
yourself with a god.

179
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:20,792
In the end, you're nothing more
than a crazy serial killer.

180
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:23,592
That's all you are.

181
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,759
Nothing more and nothing less.

182
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,692
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Useless fools.

183
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:45,392
As if they could
ever understand.

184
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:05,392
-Near, here's some
food for thought.

185
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,026
That notebook you
have and the one

186
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:09,059
that Aizawa brought from
the Japanese task force

187
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:13,092
headquarters-- are
they both real?

188
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,559
NEAR (VOICEOVER):
What is he up to?

189
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:17,192
Is he bluffing?

190
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:19,926
-At the moment, only I know
where the real notebook is.

191
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,826
If you truly want
to defeat Kira,

192
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:29,492
as well as test the notebook
that Aizawa was carrying,

193
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,526
I guess you're going to have
to write down either my name

194
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,026
or Mikami's.

195
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:45,326
It's the only way to see
if it's real, or fake.

196
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,026
-He's hidden a piece
of the notebook.

197
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,959
[gunshot]

198
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:50,459
-Matsuda.

199
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:56,792
-Matsuda!

200
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:58,226
You idiot!

201
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,626
Who the hell do you
think you're shooting at?

202
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:05,226
Don't screw with me!

203
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,959
-What was it all for then?

204
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,326
What about your dad?

205
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,759
What the hell did he die for?

206
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:14,592
-My dad?

207
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:16,926
You mean Soichiro Yagami?

208
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,292
That's right, Matsuda, in this
world, all those earnest people

209
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,292
like him who fight for
justice-- they don't lose.

210
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,226
You want a world where people
like that are made to be fools?

211
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:29,659
I know you understand,
so kill the others.

212
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:32,926
Shoot them!

213
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,559
-You led your own
father to his death.

214
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:37,859
And now that he's gone,
you call him a fool?

215
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,026
-His blood!

216
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:52,526
-I'll kill him.

217
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,859
I'll kill him.

218
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,926
He has to die!

219
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,426
-Matsuda!

220
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,226
[whimpering]

221
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,892
-Damn you.

222
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:22,259
What the hell is this?

223
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:31,159
Mikami, what are
you waiting for?

224
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:32,592
Write down their names!

225
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:35,792
Write them down!

226
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:37,159
Kill them now!

227
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,592
-It's finally over,
isn't it, Near?

228
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:46,059
-Yes.

229
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:49,126
[gasping]

230
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,159
-Where are you, Misa?

231
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,026
Where's Takada?

232
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,292
Someone.

233
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,626
What do I do now?

234
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,426
[screaming]

235
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:23,259
-What the-- Mikami!

236
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:28,192
-Quick, stop the bleeding.

237
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:29,826
-It's already too late.

238
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,459
He'll be dead in a few seconds.

239
00:16:47,726 --> 00:16:48,426
-Wait, Light!

240
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,159
-He's getting away.

241
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:52,692
Light!

242
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:55,092
-Mr. Aizawa.

243
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:58,026
It's unlikely he has anymore
pieces of the notebook.

244
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,659
And with those wounds,
he's not going to go far.

245
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:04,559
He'll stop running soon,
even if we leave him alone.

246
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:05,859
-Hmph.

247
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:10,726
Near, I'm not going
to follow your orders.

248
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,059
-Very well then.

249
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,792
I'll leave it up to you.

250
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:23,759
[panting]

251
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,826
RYUK (VOICEOVER): Well, Light,
it looks like you've lost.

252
00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:00,192
Remember how, in the
beginning when we first met,

253
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:02,259
I told you that I'd
be the one writing

254
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,492
your name in my notebook.

255
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:10,992
That is part of the
agreement between a Shinigami

256
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:15,159
who brings a notebook to the
human world and the first human

257
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:16,159
who picks it up.

258
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,859
If they put you in prison,
who knows when you'd die.

259
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:26,792
And I don't want to
lie around waiting.

260
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:32,592
So it's all over.

261
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:33,792
You'll die here.

262
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,526
It was good while it lasted.

263
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,892
We eased each other's
boredom for quite a while.

264
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:54,992
Well, Light, it's
been interesting.

265
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:25,826
[theme music]
