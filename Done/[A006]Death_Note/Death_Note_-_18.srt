[beep]

3
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:14,502
-Huh?

4
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:20,202
[sigh] Ah, OK, maybe the belt.

00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:22,535
[beep]

6
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:23,035
Huh?

7
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:25,868
What now?

8
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:27,802
-Well, looks like
this system's going

9
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:30,068
to take some getting used to.

10
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:31,935
AIZAWA: Fine.

11
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,302
How's this?

12
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:36,168
Huh?

13
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:37,468
Good morning.

14
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:40,468
-Eh?

15
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:41,835
-What's wrong?

16
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:43,068
Did you get hurt?

17
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:44,102
-Oh, this?

18
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:45,268
Kind of.

19
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:47,502
[laugh] I had a little
fight with my wife,

20
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,902
and-- it's just that my
daughter's still young,

21
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:53,035
and I'm hardly ever
at home as it is, so--

22
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,268
-Ah, yes.

23
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:56,502
It's probably best
if you sleep at home.

24
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:58,402
-Well, you're going
to be missing out.

25
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,468
The rooms in this
place are amazing.

26
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:02,868
If I were you, I'd just move
the whole family in here.

27
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:04,202
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:06,702
That's easy for you
to say as a bachelor.

29
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:08,002
Where are they?

30
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:09,335
-Oh, they're on a date.

31
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,735
Last we checked, all of them
were up in Misa-Misa's room.

32
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:14,002
-Hmm.

33
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:15,768
AIZAWA: Surveillance
cameras, huh?

34
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:17,902
Well, since we know
Misa has some connection

35
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:20,435
to the second Kira, I
guess it does make sense.

36
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:22,402
But for god's sake,
Matsuda, would you

37
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,368
stop with this Misa-Misa crap?

38
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,802
MATSUDA: Uh, yeah, sure.

39
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:30,468
-Man, this has gotta be the
lamest date I've ever been on.

40
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,368
-No, no, no, please, just
pretend I'm not even here, OK?

41
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:36,235
By the way, are you going
to eat that piece of cake?

42
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:37,435
MISA: Cake makes you fat.

43
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:38,835
I'm not gonna eat any.

44
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:41,168
-Actually, I find that you don't
gain any weight as long as you

45
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:42,702
burn calories by
using your brain.

46
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:43,535
-Hmph!

47
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:45,002
So now you're calling me stupid?

48
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,068
Fine, then.

49
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:47,502
I'll give you the
piece of cake as long

50
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:49,468
as you agree to leave
me and Light alone.

51
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:50,935
-Even if I leave
you two alone, I'm

52
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:53,102
still going to be watching
on surveillance cameras.

53
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:54,568
So it wouldn't make
any difference.

54
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:55,635
-You pervert!

55
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,968
Can't you stop it with
your creepy hobby?

56
00:03:58,002 --> 00:03:59,435
-You can call me
whatever you like.

57
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:01,135
Last chance for cake.

58
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:02,368
-OK, then.

59
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:04,968
I'll just close the curtains
and turn off the lights.

60
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:07,102
L: We have infrared
cameras in here as well.

61
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:08,168
[grumbling]

62
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:09,602
-What's wrong with you?

63
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:12,102
I thought moving here was
supposed to help us catch Kira.

64
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,568
But since we've
been here, you don't

65
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:16,168
seem all that motivated to me.

66
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:19,035
L: Not motivated?

67
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,668
You're right.

68
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,335
Actually, I'm depressed.

69
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:22,835
-Depressed?

70
00:04:22,868 --> 00:04:24,335
What for?

71
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:27,835
-Well, truthfully,
all this time, I

72
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,935
thought that you were
Kira, and my entire case

73
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,568
hinged on that fact.

74
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:33,502
I guess I just can't
get past the fact

75
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:36,002
that my deduction was wrong.

76
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:39,535
Although having said that,
I'm still suspicious of you.

77
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:41,735
That's why we're wearing these.

78
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:45,902
And we also know that Kira can
control people's actions, which

79
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,435
means it's highly likely
that Kira was controlling

80
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:51,535
your actions so that
I would suspect you.

81
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:55,802
If I assume both you and Misa
were being controlled by him,

82
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,768
then everything
we've observed so far

83
00:04:57,802 --> 00:05:00,268
makes a lot more sense to me.

84
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:02,435
-If that's what you
think, Misa and I

85
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,135
were both Kira during
the time that we

86
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:06,102
were being controlled, right?

87
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:07,335
L: Yes.

88
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:08,835
I don't think I could have
been wrong about that.

89
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:11,602
The two of you are Kira.

90
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:14,368
-Hmm.

91
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,368
L: If what I'm
thinking is correct,

92
00:05:16,402 --> 00:05:19,068
when your confinement
began, you were Kira.

93
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,135
I don't believe it's
coincidence that as soon

94
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:23,935
as you were imprisoned,
all the killings stopped.

95
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:27,435
Until then, everything
pointed to you being Kira.

96
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:30,835
But after two weeks, criminals
actually began dying again.

97
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:35,568
Based on that
evidence, I can only

98
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:41,568
conclude that Kira's power
passes between people.

99
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:42,902
-That's an interesting idea.

100
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:45,068
But if it's true, it'll
be nearly impossible

101
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,802
for us to catch Kira.

102
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:47,668
-Yes.

103
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:50,035
That's why I'm overwhelmed.

104
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:52,268
Even if we catch
someone under control,

105
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:55,168
they'll likely lose their powers
and any memory of their crimes.

106
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:58,835
So in the end, pursuing
them becomes futile.

107
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,235
-But at this point,
we have no way

108
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:01,702
of knowing if that's the case.

109
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,635
Cheer up, would you?

110
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:04,702
-Cheer up?

111
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:06,368
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

112
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:10,602
It's probably better if I
just stop trying so hard.

113
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:12,768
By chasing Kira so
desperately, we're

114
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:15,168
just putting our lives
at risk or nothing.

115
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:17,402
Yes, it's just a waste of time.

116
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:21,468
-Ryuzaki.

117
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:22,902
-Huh?

118
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:24,768
[shout]

119
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:31,968
[scream]

120
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:33,368
-Eh?

121
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:33,835
Eww.

122
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:39,102
-You know, that really hurt.

123
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:40,168
-That's enough.

124
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:41,968
You don't feel like
doing anything,

125
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,202
just because your genius
deduction was wrong,

126
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,335
and I'm not Kira?

127
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:47,368
-Fine.

128
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:48,735
Perhaps I phrased
that the wrong way.

129
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:51,102
I meant it would be pointless
for us to make a move,

130
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,268
so we shouldn't even bother.

131
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:54,468
-If we don't chase Kira,
he'll never be caught.

132
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:55,568
Is that what you want?

133
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:57,002
If you were just
going to give up,

134
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:59,502
then why did you involve
all those innocent people?

135
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,002
More importantly,
what was the point

136
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:03,235
of putting Misa
and me behind bars?

137
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:05,735
-I understand.

138
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:16,402
But still, whatever the reason--
an eye for an eye, my friend.

139
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,735
[shout]

140
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:31,068
It's not my deduction
that was wrong.

141
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:34,468
The fact is, I can say
that Light Yagami is Kira

142
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,468
and Misa Amane is
the second Kira,

143
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:39,235
but it won't be enough
to solve the case.

144
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:41,302
And that's why I'm
a little depressed.

145
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,135
Is that so unreasonable?

146
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:43,935
-Yes.

147
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:44,902
Yes, it is.

148
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,135
Besides, you should
hear yourself.

149
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:49,502
It's as if you won't be
satisfied unless I am Kira.

150
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,968
-I-- I won't be satisfied
unless you're Kira.

151
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:57,302
Well, there may be
some truth to that.

152
00:07:57,335 --> 00:07:59,735
In fact, now that you
mention it, you're right.

153
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:03,135
I think I wanted you to be Kira.

154
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:06,735
[shout]

155
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:09,835
As I said before,
an eye for an eye.

156
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:15,435
I'm a lot stronger
than I look, you know.

157
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:17,835
-We've got to call the
room and stop them.

158
00:08:17,868 --> 00:08:19,802
[phone ringing]

159
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:20,802
-Huh?

160
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,002
Yes?

161
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,302
MATSUDA (ON PHONE):
Ryuzaki, I've got good news.

162
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,268
Misa-Misa's number one
in "Eighteen" magazine's

163
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:27,335
reader popularity poll.

164
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:28,635
L (ON PHONE): Oh, I see.

165
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:30,002
MATSUDA (ON PHONE):
And get this,

166
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:33,468
she's going to get a lead
role in Ishinaka's next movie.

167
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:35,302
-What was that?

168
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,535
-Matsuda's acting stupid again.

169
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:38,335
LIGHT: Hmm.

170
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:41,035
Well, that is his specialty.

171
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:43,235
-I can hear you, you know.

172
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:54,602
-Ryuzaki, I know you're
not feeling up to it,

173
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,968
but come over here for a second.

174
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,668
Take a close look at this.

175
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,035
It can't be coincidence.

176
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:01,602
-Huh?

177
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:03,835
-All of the more prominent
Japanese businessmen,

178
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:06,935
CEOs whose companies are leaders
in their respective industries,

179
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:10,368
in just over a month, they
all died of heart attacks.

180
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:12,968
As expected, there's been a
general downturn in the market,

181
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,168
with the exception of Yotsuba.

182
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:19,335
In other words, their deaths
have worked in Yotsuba's favor.

183
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:21,935
Looking back, there have
been 13 similar deaths

184
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:24,035
in the past three months.

185
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:25,135
-Your thoughts?

186
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:26,935
-Based on this, I
can only conclude

187
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:28,835
that Kira is supporting Yotsuba.

188
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,568
-Hmm, could be.

189
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:32,068
But if what you're
saying is true,

190
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:34,102
we can assume that
punishing criminals is not

191
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:36,235
this Kira's real intent.

192
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,335
-Right.

193
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,268
Punishing criminals is
a diversion for him.

194
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:41,935
It obscures the fact that
he's actually killing people

195
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:44,502
for the benefit of his company.

196
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:45,602
Hmm.

197
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:47,968
Are you feeling a bit
more motivated now?

198
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:03,333
EXECUTIVE: It's funny.

199
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,600
This is starting
to feel too easy.

200
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:08,400
Look at all we've done, and
no one suspects a thing.

201
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,933
-Our stock continues
to increase,

202
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,033
but we've kept it
below the radar.

203
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:14,133
-Indeed, everything
appears to be

204
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:17,200
proceeding according to plan.

205
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,433
-That's true.

206
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:21,367
However, there is one thing
that has me concerned.

207
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,500
Those three we had killed
last week, why did all of them

208
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:25,900
die of heart attacks?

209
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:28,800
I thought we agreed one
would be accidental.

210
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,667
-You're quite right.

211
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,067
We did.

212
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,133
The problem was that we named
a specific location in Japan.

213
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,900
You see, he wasn't
even here when he died.

214
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:39,433
I hear he and his mistress
were in Italy at the time.

215
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:40,600
-Makes sense.

216
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:43,767
If our request is physically
impossible, then--

217
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,967
-Kira will kill that person
using his default method,

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,300
a heart attack.

219
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,767
-It's just like I was
saying last week, if you

220
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,567
want it to look believable,
request accidental death

221
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,100
or disease, and Kira will
always find the quickest way

222
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,267
to make it happen.

223
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,500
-Anyway, given Kira's
history, the police

224
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,267
are probably still focused
on the dying criminals.

225
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
Quite frankly, if
someone was able to trace

226
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,933
the deaths of these
people back to us,

227
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,933
then he'd have to be a god.

228
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:12,667
Besides, we've
taken precautions.

229
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,667
-Uh-- hey, chief.

230
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,200
Oh, you too, Mogi.

231
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,833
I've got some great news.

232
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,133
This is amazing.

233
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,867
I'm not even sure how
we figured it out,

234
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,767
but Light has a theory
that Kira is somehow

235
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,100
involved with the Yotsuba Group.

236
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,467
Can you believe it?

237
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,833
-Yotsuba?

238
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:29,167
-Uh, yes.

239
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,500
-That's probably it.

240
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,067
Good work.

241
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,800
-Huh?

242
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,400
-We just spoke
with the director,

243
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:35,933
and it seems Kira
has offered bribes

244
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,067
to a number of politicians.

245
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,633
-Kira made an offer.

246
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,633
As long as the NPA agrees
not to pursue him anymore,

247
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,367
he won't lay a hand
on any politicians.

248
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,233
-So that's that.

249
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:51,767
The police caved in to him.

250
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,633
-Huh?

251
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,933
-Huh?

252
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:57,500
-Mogi and I have already
made up our minds on this.

253
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:01,367
Aizawa, Matsuda, if you wish
to continue working this case,

254
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,533
you'll have to hand in
your letter of resignation

255
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:06,333
to the NPA, just as Mogi
and I are going to do.

256
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:07,733
[gasp]

257
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:10,200
Like it or not, you cannot
pursue Kira as a member

258
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:12,033
of the police force any more.

259
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:14,067
-Hold-- hold on a second, Chief.

260
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,967
-They made it quite clear.

261
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,733
If you continue to work
with L, you'll be fired.

262
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,633
That's all there is to it.

263
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,367
-So then, Chief, you're gonna--

264
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,767
-In a few hours, I'm no
longer going to be your chief.

265
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,033
However, we all
have our own lives.

266
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,133
So think it over carefully.

267
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:34,633
-That's true, Chief,
especially if you've

268
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,633
got a family to support.

269
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,700
L: If you want my opinion,
you'd be better off

270
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,100
as police officers.

271
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:45,800
I was alone when I
started this case.

272
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,500
And although I'm
grateful to all of you

273
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,267
for staying with me
as long as you have,

274
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,700
I know that I can
do this by myself.

275
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,533
I'll be sure to visit
you at the department

276
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,067
and bring you Kira's
head as a reward for all

277
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,133
that you've sacrificed.

278
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:03,100
-Ryuzaki, as long as I'm alive,
you won't be working alone.

279
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,733
You have my word on that.

280
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:07,133
L: Hmm, that's right.

281
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,733
I'll have Light working
with me until I catch Kira,

282
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,767
so I won't be alone after all.

283
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,633
But as I said, I
think the rest of you

284
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,767
should remain as
police officers.

285
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,433
-But when you
first contacted us,

286
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,567
you said that you would
need the help of the police

287
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,867
in order to solve this case.

288
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,967
-That's because the
police as an organization

289
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,300
were still hoping
to arrest Kira.

290
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,467
They weren't bowing to him.

291
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,233
Besides, with all
due respect, there's

292
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,700
a big difference between the
help of two or three civilians

293
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33,067
and the police as
an organization.

294
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,800
As you said, the police have
made their position clear.

295
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,733
They don't want to catch Kira,
so let's just leave it at that.

296
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:42,167
-Well, I suppose what
you're saying makes sense.

297
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,033
If we're not police
officers anymore,

298
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,200
we won't be of much use to you.

299
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:49,000
However, we're all
personally involved in this.

300
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:51,733
All of us have risked
our lives to catch Kira.

301
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:55,200
Doesn't that give us the right
to decide whether we stay here

302
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:57,133
or return to the police force?

303
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,900
-Ah, good point.

304
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:02,533
Then by all means, please,
make your decision.

305
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:03,800
-But Chief, wait.

306
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,800
If you quit your job
with the police force,

307
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,467
you'll be unemployed.

308
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,633
Even if we do catch Kira, what
are you going to do after that?

309
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:15,600
-After that, I hadn't
really thought of it.

310
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:20,167
But I suppose after
we catch Kira,

311
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,333
I'll have to dust off my resume.

312
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:24,633
-Count me in!

313
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,367
I'm going to quit the police
and chase Kira too, Chief!

314
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,000
And I still have my job
as Misa-Misa's manager.

315
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,000
Besides, if I stayed
on as a police officer,

316
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:33,500
I'd feel like a total loser.

317
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:36,400
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: Think before
you open your mouth, Matsuda.

318
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:36,900
-Uh--

319
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:46,733
--[stammering] Is there any
way I could still keep my job

320
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,800
and help you in my spare time?

321
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,433
-There isn't.

322
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:52,033
If you remain a
police officer, then

323
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,233
please don't come back here.

324
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,300
-But you know I won't
leak any information.

325
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,600
-I won't be sharing
any of our information.

326
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:00,867
[gasp]

327
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,233
You're free to pursue Kira
on your own, if you want to.

328
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:06,233
But I don't think it's
fair to your families

329
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,400
to burden them by giving
up your livelihood just

330
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,400
to continue this.

331
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:13,367
I can't see how
that's a good idea.

332
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,367
-It's as Ryuzaki says.

333
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,700
No one here is going to
blame you for quitting.

334
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,100
-Yeah, right.

335
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,467
We all understand why
you've got to do this.

336
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,533
-But the chief has a family too.

337
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:29,267
-Our situations are
completely different.

338
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,400
-Damn it.

339
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,367
To leave now, after all
we've been through-- I

340
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,300
said I was prepared
to die if that's

341
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,000
what it took to catch
him, and I meant it.

342
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:42,033
What kind of friend would I
be to Ukita if I quit now?

343
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,600
I became a detective so I
could catch the bad guys,

344
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,767
not run away!

345
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,167
[beep]

346
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,667
WATARI (ON COMPUTER): Ryuzaki,
early on in the investigation,

347
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,233
you specifically told me that
if a task force member were

348
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,867
to lose their job under
any circumstances,

349
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,200
I should make preparations
to ensure that their family's

350
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,133
financial future was secure.

351
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:04,200
If you recall, a trust was set
aside for that very purpose.

352
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm a little curious
as to why you're

353
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,367
withholding this information.

354
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
[gasp]

355
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,533
-This is not the time
or place, Watari.

356
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,300
WATARI (ON COMPUTER):
I am sorry.

357
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,433
-No way!

358
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,400
So all this time, we had
nothing to worry about?

359
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,600
I can't believe you did that.

360
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:17,500
There you go, Aizawa.

361
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,200
Isn't that great news?

362
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:19,674
Huh?

363
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:27,541
-Ryuzaki, I assume that
was some kind of test

364
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:29,941
to determine how committed
I was to this task force.

365
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:32,141
-It-- it's not
like that, Aizawa.

366
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:34,508
Ryuzaki's just not the type
to say things directly.

367
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,208
You should know that by now.

368
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,308
-Yeah, that's right.

369
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:38,208
L: No.

370
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:40,374
-Huh?

371
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:41,508
-I was testing you.

372
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,874
I wanted to see which
one you would choose.

373
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:45,408
-Ryuzaki.

374
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,274
-Fine, then.

375
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:54,274
If I wasn't sure
before, I am now.

376
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:56,241
-But Aizawa--

377
00:16:56,274 --> 00:16:57,441
-Let's face it.

378
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,108
I wasn't able to decide
right away like you guys.

379
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:02,841
I was leaning towards
going back to the police.

380
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:03,808
-Come on, Aizawa.

381
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:04,674
Don't be so stubborn.

382
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,408
-No, I quit.

383
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,874
Now I know this for sure.

384
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:10,374
I've always hated Ryuzaki.

385
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:15,241
I hate him and his
way of doing things!

386
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:17,608
L: That's too bad, because
I like you, Aizawa.

387
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,608
-I also hate the
way you've always

388
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:24,741
gotta have the last word!

389
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:26,741
You insult me, now you
say something like that?

390
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:27,441
That's it.

391
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:29,108
I'm outta here.

392
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:30,241
-Thank you for everything.

393
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:46,308
-I just found another one,
a general manager of a bank,

394
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:48,141
Yotsuba's biggest competitor.

395
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:50,674
On September 7, he slipped
and fell on the front steps

396
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,274
of his house and died instantly.

397
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:55,741
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: September the
7th was a Friday, wasn't it?

398
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,974
-Hmm?

399
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:59,274
-After going over this
again, I noticed something.

400
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:01,208
All the deaths which are
beneficial to Yotsuba

401
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:03,274
are concentrated
around the weekends.

402
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:03,841
-Huh?

403
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,341
On the weekends?

404
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:07,741
-With the first few
victims, the time of death

405
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:09,141
appears to have been random.

406
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:10,774
More recently,
they all take place

407
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:13,708
between Friday night
and Saturday afternoon.

408
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,908
-I'm amazed that you
even noticed that, Chief.

409
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:18,608
-Matsuda, I thought I told
you to stop calling me chief.

410
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:21,908
-I'm sorry, but you'll
always be the chief to me.

411
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,741
-This is a really
important clue, Dad.

412
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:24,674
Nice work.

413
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,408
-Well, you know,
I can't let myself

414
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,574
fall behind you and Ryuzaki.

415
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,074
After all, the last thing I
want is to be dead weight.

416
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:32,274
-Ah?

417
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:33,208
Dead weight?

418
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:35,241
L: Is Kira someone from Yotsuba?

419
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:37,774
Or is Kira simply using Yotsuba?

420
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:39,474
I haven't figured that
out yet, but we'll

421
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:43,308
proceed under the assumption
that this is Kira's doing.

422
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:46,974
We will focus on Yotsuba.

423
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:49,941
-This is all of the
Yotsuba Group's employees.

424
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:50,941
Here.

425
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:52,508
-Thank you very much.

426
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,108
-That's 300,000 people.

427
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:56,708
How did you put this
together so quickly?

428
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,641
That's amazing, Mogi.

429
00:18:58,674 --> 00:19:01,308
L: He's been incredibly
efficient from the start.

430
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,441
-Ryuzaki, please
tell me, is there

431
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:05,674
anything I can do to help
with the investigation,

432
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,974
besides the manager thing?

433
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:09,941
-So you really
want to be useful?

434
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:11,708
-Yes.

435
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:13,774
-Then could you get me
another cup of coffee?

436
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,441
-Uh--

437
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:17,574
-And for our guests
over there as well.

438
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:20,074
-Uh?

439
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:21,008
Who are they?

440
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:21,808
-Hold on a sec.

441
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:23,641
Who let them in?

442
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:26,341
-Those two are the newest
members of the task force.

443
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:30,674
-The name's Aiber.

444
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,241
I'm a con man.

445
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:33,474
How's it going?

446
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,641
-I'm Wedy.

447
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,608
And I'm a thief by trade.

448
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,608
-Oh, a con man and a thief.

449
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:40,874
-That's right.

450
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:43,108
Aiber is a lifelong con man.

451
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,708
His unparalleled social skills
allow him to befriend and gain

452
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,341
the trust of any target.

453
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:50,241
We'll use him for infiltration.

454
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,841
As for Wedy, she's a
thief who specializes

455
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:54,741
in cracking high-end
security systems.

456
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:57,041
As proof of how that, she was
able to enter the building

457
00:19:57,074 --> 00:20:00,208
without setting
off a single alarm.

458
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,508
-You expect us to
work with criminals?

459
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,041
-Yes, that is correct.

460
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:05,974
However, these two have
never once been caught,

461
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:08,508
so it's unlikely they'll
be killed by Kira.

462
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,574
Think of them as professionals
of the underworld.

463
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:12,808
-I understand.

464
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:14,208
To investigate
Yotsuba, we're going

465
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:17,374
to need the help of
people like this.

466
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,841
Let's all do our part
and make this happen, OK?

467
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:20,708
-Yeah.

468
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:21,708
-(RELUCTANTLY) Uh, yeah.

469
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,674
[laughing]

470
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,674
-Huh?

471
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,574
Daddy?

472
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:38,274
-Huh?

473
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:41,074
-[laughing] Daddy!

474
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:42,541
-Yumi.

475
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,541
Eriko.

476
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:44,941
-What are you doing here?

477
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:46,541
Shouldn't you be
at work right now?

478
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:49,241
You need to tell me if you're
planning to be home for dinner.

479
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:51,674
I just went shopping, and I
only bought for me and Yumi.

480
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,874
-You can eat my dinner, and
I'll have dessert instead.

481
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:55,874
-Sorry.

482
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:57,541
It was sort of a
last minute decision,

483
00:20:57,574 --> 00:20:59,041
but they just gave
me some time off.

484
00:20:59,074 --> 00:20:59,874
-Huh?

485
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:02,341
Is a time off a vacation, Daddy?

486
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:03,708
-Yeah, that's right.

487
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:05,441
-Yippee!

488
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:08,041
-(VOICE CATCHING) From now on,
I can have a break every single

489
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:09,308
week.

490
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:13,041
Now I can go with
you to the park.

491
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:18,308
Maybe we can go to the zoo
together or the amusement park.

492
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:20,674
[crying]

493
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,941
-Oh?

494
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:22,674
What's wrong, Dad?

495
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:27,874
Mommy, why is Daddy crying?

496
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,800
[theme music]

497
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:54,200
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER):
Confidential meetings?

498
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:57,467
And from the sound of it, they
have one every Friday night.

499
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,133
This is it!

500
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,333
I'm on a roll today.
