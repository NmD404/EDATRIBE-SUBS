REM (VOICEOVER):
You will continue

4
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:44,245
to kill criminals whose
names are broadcast.

5
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,045
Outside of that,
you're free to use

6
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,112
the Death Note however you wish.

7
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:50,645
That's the only condition.

8
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:53,478
If everything happens
as Light Yagami planned.

9
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:55,978
This should help save Misa.

10
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:58,445
Do as I say and you'll
get what you want.

11
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,178
In the end it works out
well for both of us.

12
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:03,012
I suppose for someone
in your position

13
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:04,278
you'd call this good business.

00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,178
NARRATOR: Mister Yagami,
are you all right?

15
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:16,745
There's no reason for you to
keep doing this to yourself.

16
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,545
YAGAMI (VOICEOVER):
It's been over a month

17
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:21,278
since Kira started
killing criminals again.

18
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,345
And as far as I'm
concerned, that's

19
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:27,245
all the proof I need to be
sure that my son isn't Kira.

20
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:31,245
So then all that's left
is for you to be sure.

21
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:33,845
One way or another,
when I get out of here,

22
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:36,812
it will be with my son.

23
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:40,178
-Wow, the Chief can
be pretty stubborn.

24
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:43,112
-Light, how are you
feeling right now?

25
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:44,978
-I'm OK.

26
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:48,178
Ryuzaki, I know that in the
time I've been in prison,

27
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,245
no new criminals have died.

28
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:52,478
However that suggests
to me that Kira

29
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:55,012
must be someone who's intimately
familiar with my situation.

30
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,012
And if that's the case--

31
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:56,912
-No, Light.

32
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,412
The reason criminals
have stopped

33
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,512
dying is because you are Kira.

34
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:02,278
-No, I'm not Kira!

35
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:04,978
How many times do
I have to say it?

36
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:06,378
L (VOICEOVER): If
Light were Kira,

37
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:09,512
he'd know that I was bluffing,
so why is he getting so upset?

38
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:11,945
He honestly seems clueless.

39
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:13,412
-This is just cruel.

40
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:14,912
I don't care if he is a suspect.

41
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,912
Light still has a right
to know that criminals

42
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:19,278
are being killed again.

43
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:20,745
-Amane?

44
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:21,712
-Yes?

45
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:22,978
-Are you OK?

46
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:24,345
You seem tired.

47
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:26,445
-Is that supposed to be funny?

48
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:28,145
How were you
expecting me to look

49
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:31,345
after being tied up and
questioned for this many days.

50
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:31,878
-Hm.

51
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,078
That's true.

52
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,978
-Please just let me go.

53
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,412
I want to see Light.

54
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:38,878
Please?

55
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:40,345
Light?

56
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:40,812
Let me.

57
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:46,112
-I'm not sure how much more
of this the three of them

58
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:47,512
can take.

59
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,878
-Ryuzaki, you have no reason to
keep Light locked up anymore.

60
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:51,278
Do the right thing
and let him go.

61
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,312
Then we can get
the Chief out too.

62
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:54,678
Criminals are
still being killed,

63
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,112
even though Misa
and Light haven't

64
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,678
access to any of
that information.

65
00:03:57,712 --> 00:04:00,978
We know that much already,
so what are you waiting for?

66
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:01,912
-Not true.

67
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:03,245
All we really know
at this point is

68
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:05,712
that Amane harbors an
unnaturally strong devotion

69
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,378
for Light Yagami.

70
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:10,545
-Ryuzaki, I'm sorry, but
with all due respect,

71
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:12,178
from where I'm
standing, it's starting

72
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:14,145
to look like you're only doing
this because you don't want

73
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:16,012
to admit that you were
wrong about Light.

74
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,478
-Yes, I figured you'd say that.

75
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:19,845
-OK, fine.

76
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:22,712
But we do know that Kira killed
Lind L. Tailor and those FBI

77
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:23,778
agents, right?

78
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:25,678
As Light said, if
Kira could kill while

79
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:28,445
under surveillance and
without access to information,

80
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:29,978
there would have been no need.

81
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:31,545
If they didn't pose
a threat to him,

82
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:33,412
then why would he
bother killing them?

83
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,012
Kira doesn't kill
without good reason,

84
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:37,378
I've heard you say so yourself
on more than one occasion.

85
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:38,578
-Oh, I see.

86
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,445
If he was able to kill
under these circumstances,

87
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,978
then he wouldn't have been
concerned about those FBI

88
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:45,545
agents in the first place.

89
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:47,345
-It's already been 50 days.

90
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:50,345
There's no point
to this anymore.

91
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:53,478
-Ryuzaki, it's time to start
looking for the real killer.

92
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:54,112
[music playing]

93
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:13,478
-Yes, I understand.

94
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:14,578
L (VOICEOVER): Mr. Yagami?

95
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:16,545
-Yes, what is it?

96
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,345
L (VOICEOVER): Would
you be willing to come

97
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:20,278
to headquarters, just once?

98
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:21,978
I'd like to discuss
my thoughts with you,

99
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:23,878
but it must be done in person.

100
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:26,045
However, above all else,
I need to talk to you

101
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:28,745
as Light's father.

102
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:29,745
-All right.

103
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:31,245
I'll come.

104
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:32,245
[music playing]

105
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:55,412
-Honestly, all this time
I never pictured you

106
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,145
as an old man, Mr. Stalker.

107
00:05:57,178 --> 00:06:00,945
-I am not your stalker, I'm
a detective with the MPA.

108
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:01,445
-What?

109
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:01,978
Hey, wait.

110
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,278
I remember now.

111
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:05,178
You told me I was being
arrested for being arrested

112
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:06,545
for being the second Kira.

113
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:08,945
You mean that was for real?

114
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:09,578
No.

115
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:10,945
You're a stalker.

116
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,478
There's no way the police
would blindfold me and tie me

117
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:14,645
up all fetishy like that.

118
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,278
Anyways, it's kind of weird that
you have my hands and feet all

119
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:19,378
tied up, even though you're
planning to let me go.

120
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,545
-Please, just keep quiet.

121
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:22,512
[music playing]

122
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:34,945
-Light!

123
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:35,878
-Misa?

124
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:36,945
-Oh, I missed you
so much, Light.

125
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:37,645
-Dad, tell me.

126
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:38,612
What's all this about?

127
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:39,778
-He's your dad?

128
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:42,278
Oh my God, I totally
called your dad a stalker

129
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:44,745
and said he was old and all
kinds of other rude stuff.

130
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:45,878
Pleased to meet you.

131
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:46,812
My name's Misa Amane,
I'm Light's girlfriend

132
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:47,578
and I'd like to--

133
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:48,845
-They're all yours, Cheif.

134
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,212
-Let's go.

135
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:54,045
Get in the car.

136
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,845
-I was starting to think
I'd never get out there.

137
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:04,078
But it feels good to
finally be cleared.

138
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,412
-No.

139
00:07:05,445 --> 00:07:11,178
I'm afraid you two are being
taken to your execution.

140
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:14,178
I wanted to be the one to escort
you to the execution site.

141
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:16,445
It was secretly built in
an underground facility

142
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,245
not far from here.

143
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:18,778
-What?

144
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:19,345
-Execution?

145
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:20,345
-Is this a joke?

146
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:21,045
-What the hell are
you talking about?

147
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:22,112
-We didn't do anything!

148
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:23,312
-L is convinced that
you are Kira, Light.

149
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:25,245
And that Misa Amane
is the second Kira.

150
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,512
Here he is convinced
that the only way

151
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:30,845
we can prevent the murders
is to execute the two of you.

152
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:31,812
-I don't understand.

153
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,245
The killings have
already stopped.

154
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,312
-No, they never stopped.

155
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:38,045
-They never-- That's
not what he told me.

156
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:39,312
So he was lying?

157
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:41,778
-L was trying to get a
confession out of you, Light.

158
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:42,945
He would have said anything.

159
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:46,045
But at this point,
that's not the problem.

160
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:47,178
It's political now.

161
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:49,045
You see, L's suggestion
that the killings would

162
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:51,878
stop if you two were
eliminated was unanimously

163
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:55,945
accepted by top officials in the
UN and the Japanese government.

164
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:57,712
They want Kira to disappear.

165
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:59,712
No trial, no publicity.

166
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,212
-But that's completely insane.

167
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:01,878
Please, dad.

168
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:02,578
I'm not Kira.

169
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:03,578
-That's right.

170
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:05,045
What kind of a father
are you, anyway?

171
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:06,778
This is your own son
you're talking about.

172
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:08,712
-L made this decision, not me.

173
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:11,145
And his word is absolute.

174
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:13,878
Over the years he's tackled
the most difficult cases,

175
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:15,145
solving all of them.

176
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,812
He's never been wrong.

177
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:20,478
-You trust L more than you
trust me, your own son?

178
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:24,012
-L went so far as to stake
his life on this theory.

179
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:28,545
If the killings don't stop,
then he, too, will be executed.

180
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:29,712
-L said that?

181
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:31,545
What could he be thinking?

182
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,412
I know that given
the material evidence

183
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,345
this might seem like the
only logical solution.

184
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:38,045
But he's making a mistake.

185
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:41,012
How could L come
to this conclusion?

186
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,612
Something's not right here.

187
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:45,312
It's just, it's
not like L at all.

188
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:48,112
The L I know would
rely on hard evidence.

189
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,845
He has to have the truth.

190
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:52,012
Is he really trying
to end it like this?

191
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,145
-All right, we're almost there.

192
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:55,112
[car engine]

193
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:14,212
-Where are we right now,
and why did you bring us out

194
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:15,278
to the middle of nowhere?

195
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:16,212
What is this?

196
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:17,312
-Wait a sec.

197
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:19,678
I bet he brought us
out here to let us go.

198
00:09:19,712 --> 00:09:20,978
-This will do.

199
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:23,378
It looks like there's nobody
around to see us out here.

200
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:26,045
I decided it would be better
for us if I brought you here,

201
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:29,478
instead of the execution site.

202
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:32,212
Listen to me.

203
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:35,312
I'm going to kill you
here, and then kill myself.

204
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:36,445
-What?

205
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:38,345
What are you talking about, dad?

206
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,345
You can't, that's crazy!

207
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,245
-How can you say that?

208
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:41,712
You'd kill your only son for L?

209
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:44,012
If you want to die so bad,
why don't you kill yourself?

210
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:46,478
If you do this, you're
not different than Kira.

211
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:48,445
-I'm nothing like Kira.

212
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:51,012
I am bound by my
responsibilities as a parent,

213
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:53,412
and as Chief of the MPA.

214
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:54,378
-Dad, come on.

215
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:55,478
She's right.

216
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,678
Think about it.

217
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:58,612
If we die here, the truth
will never be revealed.

218
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,178
Please dad, you have
to let us escape.

219
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:01,645
-It's too late.

220
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:04,012
Either way, you
will be executed.

221
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:09,112
At least with this, I'll
be the one to do it.

222
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:09,845
-Please, stop dad!

223
00:10:09,878 --> 00:10:11,312
I'm not Kira!

224
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:14,245
If I die here, Kira wins.

225
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:16,412
Can't you see?

226
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,512
-Amane, I'm going to
die here with my son.

227
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:19,945
But I have no
reason to kill you.

228
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:22,545
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

229
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:24,378
It's only a matter of
time before the police

230
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:25,578
locate this car.

231
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,845
Then they'll transport
you to the original site,

232
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,078
and execute you there.

233
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,478
Light, my son.

234
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:38,545
From murderer to another,
I'll see you in hell.

235
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:39,045
-No, dad!

236
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:45,145
-No, stop it!

237
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,145
[gunshot]

238
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:03,496
-Light, my son.

239
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,730
From one murderer to another,
I'll see you in hell.

240
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:07,730
-No, dad!

241
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:08,696
[gunshot]

242
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,363
[gasping]

243
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,930
-You used a blank?

244
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:33,830
-Thank goodness.

245
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:35,863
-Thank goodness?

246
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:36,763
What's going on?

247
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,930
I don't understand.

248
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,996
-Please, forgive me, you two.

249
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,996
I know that was
hard on you, but it

250
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,063
was the only way I could
get you out of prison.

251
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:46,463
You must understand.

252
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,563
I only agreed to
do this because I

253
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:51,063
believe in your
innocence, Light.

254
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:53,063
Were you watching, Ryuzaki?

255
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:54,530
I did exactly as you said.

256
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:58,030
And as you can see,
I'm still alive.

257
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,930
L (VOICEOVER): Yes, it was
a convincing performance.

258
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:03,463
If Amane were the
second Kira, who

259
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:05,996
only need to see a
person's face to kill them,

260
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,796
there is no doubt you
would have killed you

261
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,230
before you had the chance
to fire your weapon.

262
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,663
Also, if Light was in
fact Kira, the Kira I know

263
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:17,030
wouldn't hesitate to kill even
his own father to save himself.

264
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:19,696
With Light in particular I
cannot rule out the possibility

265
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,596
that he may have seen through
our act at some point.

266
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,363
However, as we agreed, I
will end their confinement

267
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:26,696
immediately.

268
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,030
And as we discussed, Amane
will remain under surveillance

269
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,396
until Kira is apprehended.

270
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,130
Although she insists the
tapes we found were just

271
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:37,096
occult videos, the
physical evidence

272
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,463
we have, plus her confession,
suggest otherwise.

273
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:40,163
-Hey, no fair!

274
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,563
You still suspect me?

275
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,496
-If I were you, I
wouldn't complain.

276
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,030
You get to go back
to your normal life.

277
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:49,563
Organisms the surveillance
shouldn't be a threat to you.

278
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:52,163
Think of it as complimentary
police protection.

279
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:53,230
-Oh, I get it.

280
00:12:53,263 --> 00:12:55,530
Since I'm not the
second Kira, it'll

281
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:58,563
be kind of like having my
very own private bodyguards.

282
00:12:58,596 --> 00:13:01,163
L (VOICEOVER): As for your
part in this agreement, Light.

283
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:04,263
You and I will be together 24/7.

284
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:07,163
And that's how we'll remain
until we've brought Kira

285
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:07,730
to justice.

286
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:08,596
[music playing]

287
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:15,630
-Fine by me.

288
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:16,496
We'll catch Kira.

289
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,396
Together.

290
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,863
L (VOICEOVER): Yes, I look
forward to working with you.

291
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:28,863
-Are you sure this is
necessary, Ryuzaki?

292
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:31,730
-This is as difficult
for me as it is for you.

293
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:33,763
-So is this what you
meant by being together

294
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,396
24 hours a day with him?

295
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,163
Looking at you, I never
would have guessed.

296
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:39,730
Are you on that side
of the fence, Ryuzaki?

297
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:42,696
-I told you, I'm not doing
this because I want to, OK?

298
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,963
-But Light belongs to me.

299
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,363
I don't want to
share him with you.

300
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:47,163
If you're with
him 24/7, then how

301
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:49,230
are we supposed to
go on dates together?

302
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,696
-Oh, you can still go on dates.

303
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,330
But it will have to
be the three of us.

304
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:53,530
-No way.

305
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:55,196
Are you telling me we have
to kiss in front of you,

306
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,130
and stuff?

307
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:57,496
-I'm not telling
you to do anything.

308
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,696
But yes, I suppose
I would be watching.

309
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,663
-That's so gross.

310
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:02,630
You really are a
pervert, aren't you?

311
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:05,796
-Light, please make
Misa stop talking now.

312
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,830
-Listen, Misa, that's enough.

313
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,296
The police have
already established

314
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,996
that it was you who
sent those tapes,

315
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,030
so you're lucky to
even be here right now.

316
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:15,063
They have every right
to keep you in prison.

317
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:15,996
-Huh?

318
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,096
How could you even
say that, Light?

319
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,730
In case you forgot,
I'm your girlfriend.

320
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:20,863
Don't you trust
your own soul mate?

321
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,130
-What do you mean, soul mate?

322
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:24,130
You're the one who said
you fell in love with me

323
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,796
at first sight, Misa.

324
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,163
-Huh?

325
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:27,896
So why would you kiss me if you
didn't have feelings for me?

326
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,663
You took advantage of me?

327
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:30,163
Stupid!

328
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:30,630
Stupid!

329
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:31,096
Stupid!

330
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:31,563
Stupid!

331
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:32,063
Stupid!

332
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:32,563
Stupid!

333
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:34,463
Stupid!

334
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:36,196
-About this love
at first sight, it

335
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,563
happened in Oyama on
May 22nd, didn't it?

336
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:40,663
-So what?

337
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,963
-Why did you choose
that day to go to Oyama?

338
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:44,696
And do you remember
what you wore?

339
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,596
-It's like I told you.

340
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,930
I just happened to go there.

341
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:49,863
I don't know why, I don't
remember how I felt,

342
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:52,130
and I don't even know
what I was wearing.

343
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:54,763
Anyway, since when do I need
a reason to hang out in Oyama,

344
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,130
huh?

345
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,296
-And somehow, when you
came back from Oyama,

346
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,430
you knew you that you were
in love with some guy,

347
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:01,196
and that his name was Light.

348
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,196
-Yes.

349
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,863
-And yet you yourself
have no idea how

350
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,030
you came to know his name.

351
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:06,030
-Yeah, so what?

352
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:07,996
-Tell me, what if
light was Kira?

353
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,130
How would it make you feel?

354
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:10,030
-Huh?

355
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:11,996
How would I feel
if Light was Kira?

356
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,196
-That's right.

357
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,463
-That'd be wonderful.

358
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:19,663
I mean, I've always been
grateful to Kira for punishing

359
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,863
the men who murdered my
parents, so if I found out

360
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:23,563
that Light was actually Kira?

361
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:24,963
That would be like
a bonus for me.

362
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:26,963
If anything, it would make
me love him even more.

363
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:28,863
Even though it's like,
practically impossible

364
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,596
to love him more
than I already do.

365
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,563
-It's Kira, though.

366
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:32,896
You'd love him
even more for that?

367
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,263
I mean, wouldn't you be afraid?

368
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:35,796
What if he tried to kill you?

369
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,596
-You're talking about
Light being Kira?

370
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,663
He wouldn't be scary at all.

371
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:43,063
I'm a supporter of Kira, so if I
found out my Light was actually

372
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:46,663
him, I'd think of how
I could be helpful.

373
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,863
-That's very generous
of you, but I'm

374
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:51,730
pretty sure Kira
doesn't your help.

375
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:53,863
Well, Misa, based on
what you just told me,

376
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:56,063
there can be no mistake that
you are the second Kira.

377
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:59,196
But you've made it so painfully
obvious that I don't really

378
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,196
want to believe it.

379
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,530
-Whatever.

380
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:04,796
It's not believable, because
I'm not the second Kira, OK?

381
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,530
-Anyway, for the
time being, you'll

382
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:07,863
remain under surveillance.

383
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:09,463
When you do go out,
if needed, you'll

384
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:11,996
be able to contact us using
this room's extension.

385
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,896
For the most, your life
will return to normal.

386
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,863
But from now on, for all private
and work related affairs,

387
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,396
Mr. Matsuda will
be accompanying you

388
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,296
as your new manager, Matsui.

389
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,363
-Matsui here!

390
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:22,630
-Your agency's been
paid to keep quiet,

391
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:23,930
and the police don't know.

392
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:24,796
Don't blow his cover.

393
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,030
-This old guy's my manager?

394
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:27,763
Oh you can't be serious.

395
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:28,596
-Oh, come on!

396
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,396
What's wrong with me, Misa Misa?

397
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,096
Is it the tie?

398
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,830
Because I can get a--

399
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:35,996
-Would you cut it out with
all this dating, kissing,

400
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,963
and Misa Misa talk all ready?

401
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,496
This is the Kida investigation.

402
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,296
Stop messing around.

403
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,663
-Sorry about that, Ayuzawa.

404
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:44,963
-No, it's all right.

405
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:48,663
I just figured out
what the problem is.

406
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:51,530
Misa Amane, it's time for
you to go to your room.

407
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:52,430
-Why?

408
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:53,530
-Out you go!

409
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:54,996
-Don't, no!

410
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:00,130
Hey Light, let's go on a date,
even if it is the three of us.

411
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:02,996
-So Light, are you
serious about her?

412
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,196
-No way.

413
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,063
Like I told you earlier,
it's completely one-sided.

414
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:08,196
-Then could you at least
pretend to be serious,

415
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,896
for the sake of
the investigation?

416
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,130
There are two things I
know about Amane for sure.

417
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:14,130
One, that she's
involved in this.

418
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:17,563
Two, she's in love with you.

419
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:19,563
-You want me to become
intimate with her

420
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:21,930
to gather information
about the second Kira?

421
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:23,863
-Yes, I think you could
do it without arousing

422
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:25,030
her suspicions.

423
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:26,996
And Amane would definitely
be a valuable source

424
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,230
of information for us.

425
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:30,163
Not to mention this
is the main reason why

426
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:33,063
I agreed to release
the two of you.

427
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:37,363
-Ryuzaki, as much as I want
to help you, and as important

428
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:39,096
as the Kira cases
is to me, I can't

429
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,863
manipulate a woman's
feelings like that.

430
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,263
Please try to understand.

431
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:48,063
To me, exploiting other person's
feelings for personal gain

432
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:51,996
is unforgivable, and I won't
allow myself to stoop that low.

433
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,363
L (VOICEOVER): There's something
wrong with this picture.

434
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:57,363
It's as if he's a
different person now.

435
00:17:57,396 --> 00:17:59,963
Is it possible this is an act?

436
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,630
If this is genuine,
it not only implies

437
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:07,763
that Amane was being controlled
by Kira, by Light Yagami, too.

438
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,530
-What's wrong, Ryuzaki?

439
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:10,396
-Nothing.

440
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,830
I suppose you're
right after all.

441
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:14,430
However, considering Misa
will have a lot of contact

442
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,230
with the public,
it would be helpful

443
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,963
if you could make sure she
doesn't leak information.

444
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:20,996
-By the way, do you
think we could come up

445
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,330
with some kind of alternative
to this system of moving

446
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,696
from hotel to hotel
every few days?

447
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,930
-Yes.

448
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:28,563
In fact, I had that very
same thought some time ago.

449
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:32,563
And so I arranged for
a facility to be built.

450
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,830
Construction started right
after my first meeting

451
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,763
with Mr. Yagami and the others.

452
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:39,296
It should be finished
in a few days.

453
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,663
Where is it?

454
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:43,096
Here it is.

455
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,630
23 floors above
ground, and 2 below.

456
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:48,830
Although it's impossible
to see it from the outside,

457
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:51,030
there are two helicopters
hidden on the roof.

458
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:51,596
-What?

459
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,763
That's amazing.

460
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:55,896
-Ideally I want all of
us to spend as much time

461
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,230
here as possible.

462
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:58,696
If the investigation
team grows, we

463
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,063
can accommodate up to 60 people.

464
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,896
Misa shouldn't have
any complaints.

465
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,463
And she'll have her own floor.

466
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:07,430
-This is truly impressive.

467
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:09,330
But to go to such lengths.

468
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:10,596
-Hold on a second.

469
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,096
Where did you find the
finances to build this thing?

470
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,196
-As you can see,
it is my intention

471
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,663
to solve this case, no
matter what it takes.

472
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:19,130
That's how it is.

473
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,996
-I'm sorry, but how
is that an answer?

474
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,396
-No, he's right.

475
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,263
The mass killings are
bad enough already.

476
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,563
But personally, I will never
forgive Kira for putting my dad

477
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:29,896
and I thought this.

478
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,763
I want to solve this,
no matter what it takes.

479
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,230
-If you're serious
about that, you

480
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:35,130
should try to get close
to Misa and find out

481
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:36,063
about the second book.

482
00:19:36,096 --> 00:19:36,896
-I can't.

483
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,263
That goes against my principles.

484
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:38,863
-Right.

485
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:39,763
You said that.

486
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:42,796
And what a shame.

487
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,563
-Hm?

488
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:44,796
-Nothing.

489
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,496
I'm just feeling really
motivated right now, Chief.

490
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,930
Ryuzaki, Chief Yagami,
Light, let's get out of here

491
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:52,063
and bring Kira to justice.

492
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:55,896
-Excuse me, I couldn't help
but notice you missed my name.

493
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,896
[traffic sounds]

494
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:07,296
-Well.

495
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,930
This looks like all of us.

496
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:10,996
Let's get started, shall we?

497
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,630
We're all here to further the
growth of the of the Yotsuba

498
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:15,996
group by reducing competition.

499
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,063
So the question is,
who is going to die?

500
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:23,363
-I'm not thrilled that wee have
to do this every single week.

501
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,363
This may be irrelevant,
but I have to wonder,

502
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:27,696
what prompted Kira to start
killing business people,

503
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,896
in addition to the usual
criminals and such?

504
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,396
-Come on now, haven't
you figured this out yet,

505
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:32,896
Takahashi?

506
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,596
-Hm?

507
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,996
-This is the most advantageous
course of action for Kira.

508
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,463
-Advantageous?

509
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:42,230
He's basically started a
killing service, Higuchi.

510
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:45,396
-You have a lot to say,
considering how stupid you are.

511
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,596
I'd hate to see you get
killed because of it.

512
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,963
-Despite the fact that we're
all relatively young, all of us

513
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:55,396
are now front-runners to
become Yotsuba's next CEO.

514
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,196
Not to mention, our
salaries have virtually

515
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,363
eclipsed those of the other
employees in the company.

516
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:05,896
-It's unlikely he would choose
to back a particular company,

517
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,563
no matter how you look at it.

518
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:10,763
One of the people in
this room has to be Kira.

519
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,796
-So, back to business.

520
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,630
Does anyone have a proposal?

521
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:25,763
Who should we have Kira
eliminate this week, gentleman?

522
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:28,496
-Human beings are truly
disgusting creatures.

523
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,396
[theme music]

524
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:41,290
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): It's no good.

525
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:42,990
It's obvious from
thee way you talk

526
