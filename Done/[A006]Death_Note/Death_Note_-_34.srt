00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,766
[theme music]

2
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,196
-I'm going to announce
my engagement to Light

3
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,929
at the pop music festival.

4
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:43,296
I used to really like Kira
too, but I know for sure

5
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,129
that Light is gonna
catch him soon.

6
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:48,996
And as for you, you'll
probably be executed.

7
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:50,596
TAKADA: You are to
send me a fan latter

8
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,796
that I'll be able to
recognize as yours.

9
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,529
You will also enclose
something else in the envelope.

10
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:57,696
Five blank pages
from the notebook.

11
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,996
Carry on with your judgments
and killings as usual

12
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,129
until I received the
letter and the pages.

13
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,029
-And how after you receive them?

14
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:06,329
-Make a notebook that looks
as close to the original as

15
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:08,996
possible, and act as if
you're killing people

16
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:12,463
by using this decoy.

17
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:14,929
-I mean, wearing a short
skirt like that in the winter.

18
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:15,963
-Please, someone.

19
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:22,929
-Delete.

20
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:24,496
-He's getting off the train.

21
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:27,429
[screaming]

22
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:38,196
-A man who was on the same
train as Mikami just collapsed.

23
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,829
He was harrassing a young woman
and suddenly fell to the floor.

24
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,363
It all happened
about a half a minute

25
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,096
after he wrote something
in the notebook.

26
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,396
That's gotta be it.

27
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:48,563
-Well, now we know for sure.

28
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:49,896
-Yes.

29
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,496
Our next order of
business is to get

30
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:54,096
as close as possible to Mikami.

31
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:55,863
But before we rush
in blindly, there's

32
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:57,863
something we need
to be careful of,

33
00:02:57,896 --> 00:03:01,263
and that is the being
known as the Shinigami.

34
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:02,929
The Shinigami will
be loyal to Mikami,

35
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:07,429
and it will warn him if it
discovers we're following him.

36
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:08,963
-But the Shinigami
can only be seen

37
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:11,396
by those people who have
touched the notebook.

38
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:13,029
It's going to be
pretty difficult to be

39
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:15,663
careful of something
we can't even see.

40
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:19,629
-We're going to try, no
matter how difficult.

41
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:20,196
-Right.

42
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,963
Understood, sir.

43
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:30,996
AIZAWA: Light's having another
one of his meetings with Takada

44
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:32,663
this evening.

45
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:35,029
Right after they started
having these encounters,

46
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:37,063
Takada got a phone
call from Kira,

47
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:40,663
and all the surveillance
cameras had to be removed.

48
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,529
The first thing
that came to my mind

49
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:44,663
was that they'd be able
to communicate secretly

50
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:46,596
by writing messages.

51
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,763
-Everything checks out in here.

52
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,329
I've gone over the entire room,
and there's nothing in it.

53
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,929
There's only the wiretap on me.

54
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:54,896
-Uh, right.

55
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,263
Then all that's left
is the bathroom.

56
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:03,596
Why does Light care
so much about checking

57
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,829
for cameras and wiretaps?

58
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:08,729
Never mind that, why is
Kira allowing these meetings

59
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:10,196
in the first place?

60
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,763
Something just doesn't add up.

61
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,796
If they really are writing
notes to each other,

62
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,896
there's only one
way to prove it.

63
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:29,829
-Light.

64
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:31,163
I thought you should know.

65
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:34,963
I had a private chat with
Ms. Misa Amane yesterday.

66
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:35,663
-About what?

67
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:36,496
-Whoa.

68
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:38,763
Oh boy, Light's in trouble now.

69
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:39,963
-Matsuda.

70
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,629
Is there some reason
you're so happy about this?

71
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:44,096
-She told me that she's planning
to announce her engagement

72
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,296
to you during her appearance
at the pop music festival.

73
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:48,829
-Whoa.

74
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:49,596
He's busted.

75
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:51,029
Light's in the dog house!

76
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:52,896
-Shut up, Matsuda!

77
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:54,029
-No.

78
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:55,296
She thinks we're together
because I haven't

79
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,829
been able to break
it to her yet,

80
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,229
but she means nothing to me.

81
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,129
Misa, you idiot.

82
00:05:01,163 --> 00:05:02,663
Why pull a stunt like that?

83
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:03,163
No.

84
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:03,829
Takada.

85
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:04,796
you're just as bad.

86
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:07,763
Why are women like this?

87
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:09,529
-Nothing, you say?

88
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:10,696
Why should I believe you?

89
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:14,329
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
She was in charge

90
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:18,396
of killing before T. Somehow
she gained the same power as I

91
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:21,096
had and found out
that I was Kira.

92
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,863
In the end, I had no choice
but to take her as my partner.

93
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,429
It's the only
reason I would ever

94
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:29,329
choose such an impulsive girl.

95
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,863
KIYOMI (VOICEOVER): So, Misa
was doing Kira's killings.

96
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,963
But right now, I'm the
one doing it for him.

97
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:37,629
Light had no choice
with Misa, but he

98
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,929
chose me specially to help him.

99
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:42,263
-Believe me.

100
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:43,529
She's nothing.

101
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:45,463
You're the only one for me.

102
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:47,229
-You're the only one for me?

103
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,896
Is that supposed to be serious?

104
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:50,429
I expected better
from you, Light.

105
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,796
IDE: She does have a point.

106
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:54,363
I mean, that's a really cheesy
line, especially for Light.

107
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,296
MATSUDA: So which one
do you think he'll pick?

108
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,629
Amane or Takada?

109
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:59,863
IDE: Well, he could
keep two timing them.

110
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:00,896
MATSUDA: Are you serious?

111
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:03,129
You don't see any
problem with that?

112
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,963
-Hey, I'm not the one who--

113
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:08,663
-Will you two shut up?

114
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:11,296
-You're going to have to prove
yourself from now on, Light,

115
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,129
but I will trust you.

116
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,396
Of course, if I find
out that you're lying,

117
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:17,029
you'll pay dearly.

118
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:21,596
In fact, I'll tell
Kira about it.

119
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:23,329
-Kira, huh?

120
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:25,596
You know, I understand that
the world really needs Kira

121
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,863
right now, but I just
can't help but wonder.

122
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:33,529
Will the day ever come when
you and I can be together?

123
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:36,396
I can't help but hate Kira for
choosing you as a spokesperson,

124
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,829
because it keeps us apart.

125
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:39,263
I don't mind if he
kills criminals,

126
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:42,196
but we've done nothing wrong.

127
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,429
We have the right to lead
happy lives, don't we?

128
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,229
-Yes.

129
00:06:49,263 --> 00:06:51,729
I want to be happy
together with you.

130
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:57,229
But that could only happen
if Kira wasn't around.

131
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:58,196
-You're right.

132
00:06:58,229 --> 00:06:59,763
If only Kira wasn't around.

133
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:04,629
-Kira should be arrested.

134
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,563
It's true.

135
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:14,096
If you and I are ever going to
have a chance at being happy

136
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,129
together, Kira
needs to be caught.

137
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:19,163
-W-- Wait a minute, Kiyomi.

138
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:20,896
Do you seriously mean that?

139
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:22,263
-Yes.

140
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:24,063
LIGHT (ON RADIO): All right,
but if I'm going to arrest him,

141
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:25,763
I'll need your help.

142
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:27,696
You'll be putting
yourself in danger.

143
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,496
After all, I'll be
defying the police,

144
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:34,096
and you'll be going against Kira
and the entire world as well.

145
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,796
Are you sure that's OK?

146
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:46,796
-That's a long pause.

147
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,229
-All right.

148
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,429
If cooperating with you means
that we can be together,

149
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:57,863
then I'm prepared to make
that sacrifice, Light.

150
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:59,296
-What a turn around.

151
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,129
Just like you'd
expect from our guy!

152
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:02,629
He was able to move
the conversation

153
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:05,496
from cheating on Misa Misa
to getting Taki to help him.

154
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:10,829
-Mikami's talking to himself.

155
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:11,963
-What's going on?

156
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:13,963
-He was too far away for
me to pick up his voice,

157
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:17,496
but I recorded video
of his lips moving.

158
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,396
I'm sending you the
footage I was able to get.

159
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:22,629
It's of Mikami during
his lunch break.

160
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:23,629
This is it right here.

161
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:24,929
He's saying something.

162
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,029
RESTER: Show it to us one
more time in slow motion.

163
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:41,329
Is that you, Shinigami,
is what he said.

164
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,629
GIOVANNI: He seems to have
reacted to the scrap of paper

165
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:44,563
at his feet.

166
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:47,129
RESTER: He just
gave a small sigh.

167
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:49,663
GIOVANNI: At this point, he
talks to himself a little more.

168
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,229
I'm gonna zoom in on his lips.

169
00:08:53,263 --> 00:08:54,629
RESTER: That Shinigami.

170
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:11,529
Ever since he handed me the
notebook, he hasn't reappeared.

171
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:13,129
That Shinigami.

172
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:15,863
Ever since he handed me the
notebook, he hasn't reappeared.

173
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:23,296
-Mikami was given the notebook
by one of the Shinigami,

174
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,363
but it seems that Shinigami
hasn't been following him.

175
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,529
So that's how it is.

176
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:37,529
-I guess that's all for today.

177
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:38,796
See you next time.

178
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:39,296
-Of course.

179
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:43,929
-It's finally over.

180
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:46,163
Man, things got pretty intense
today, don't you think?

181
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:48,763
It's tough to do this
for hours on end.

182
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,763
-Yeah.

183
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:51,929
You really look like
you're suffering.

184
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:52,929
-All right.

185
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:54,729
I'm gonna wrap things
up at the hotel.

186
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,263
-OK, thanks for
all your hard work.

187
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,196
You know, I feel kind
of bad that Aizawa

188
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:01,163
is stuck with booking the hotel
and checking out every time.

189
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:27,796
-It's gone.

190
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:29,596
The mark I left is gone.

191
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:42,096
I left four marks.

192
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,596
Two of them are gone.

193
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:46,829
The room's been
left just as it was.

194
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:49,896
Housekeeping hasn't come in yet.

195
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,729
Then how and why
would anyone switch

196
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:54,729
these two notepads for new ones?

197
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:57,029
That settles it.

198
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:58,863
They're writing notes.

199
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:03,429
[phone ringing]

200
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:03,929
-Yes?

201
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:08,429
What's that?

202
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:10,529
You want to meet and
talk with Near in person?

203
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,896
-Mr. Aizawa.

204
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,829
It's been a while.

205
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:23,696
And it's a pleasure to meet you.

206
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:25,396
-That's very nice
of you, but kind of

207
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,629
hard to accept while
I'm blindfolded.

208
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:30,163
-He doesn't have any
weapons or cameras on him.

209
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:32,396
-In that case, you're free
to take off your blindfold.

210
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:35,763
-Huh?

211
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:44,363
Near, I believe what
you said earlier.

212
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:47,196
L was been meeting Takada
almost every single night.

213
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:49,629
-I know.

214
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:50,829
-Well, then what about this?

215
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:52,896
They are passing
notes to each other.

216
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,896
I confirmed it.

217
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,163
-Mr. Aizawa, please don't
take any unnecessary actions

218
00:11:58,196 --> 00:11:59,463
on your own.

219
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:01,329
-Unnecessary actions?

220
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:04,763
-Yes This is not the point
where we bring up evidence Kira

221
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,729
and openly confront him.

222
00:12:06,763 --> 00:12:08,829
I must corner him in
a dead end with a plan

223
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,629
that would guarantee his defeat.

224
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,829
This is what it will take
to stop him for good.

225
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,429
Mr. Aizawa, I'm going
to be blunt with you.

226
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:17,929
You and the rest
of the task force

227
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,263
are already out of the picture.

228
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:25,763
However, if you still want to
help capture Kira, you can.

229
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,729
All I want you to do
is keep an eye on him,

230
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:29,396
as you've been doing.

231
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:30,496
-That's it?

232
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,796
Keep an eye on him?

233
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,029
-Yes.

234
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:35,296
Of course, there
certainly is a purpose

235
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,596
in watching over L. In
fact, I've already taken it

236
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,729
into account as part of my plan.

237
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:43,196
That's why I'm hoping you
can help me in that respect.

238
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:47,396
I want you to watch him, in
order to win against Kira.

239
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:52,263
And after that, I want you to
be a witness to the end of Kira.

240
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:14,497
TAKADA: This has been a
year of breathroughs for me,

241
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,997
and I'm sure for
many others as well.

242
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,930
And what better way to bring
this year to an exciting close

243
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:22,764
than with the East-West
Pop Music festival?

244
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:25,497
I'm your host for this
evening, Kiyomi Takada.

245
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,797
We hope you all enjoy the show.

246
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,530
-All right, the pop music
festival's about to begin!

247
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:32,330
-Matsuda, shouldn't
you be checking

248
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:34,130
over the reports
on Kira's killings?

249
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:34,664
-Yeah.

250
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:35,497
In a minute.

251
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,464
But after Misa Misa performs.

252
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:38,097
She's the opening act this year.

253
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,164
We got to cheer her on.

254
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:39,730
Yeah!

255
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:48,330
-Can we help you?

256
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:49,664
-Hm?

257
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:50,764
-Pardon me.

258
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,164
We're from the SPK.

259
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,764
We'll need you to come with us.

260
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,997
-Before we continue,
I'm afraid I

261
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,097
must apologize on behalf
of the staff of NHN.

262
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,064
It's very unfortunate, but it
seems that this year's opening

263
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:08,497
act, Ms. Misa Amane, has not
entered the concert hall yet.

264
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:08,997
-Huh?

265
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,997
-What?

266
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,930
-Of course, many
unexpected things can--

267
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:12,997
-What's going on?

268
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,497
Mogi didn't tell us
anything about this.

269
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,964
MISA: Take me back
to NHN right now!

270
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:21,997
What is this?

271
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,330
Are you trying to
ruin my reputation?

272
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,964
-Misa Misa, you've got
to try and stay calm.

273
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,864
-Motchi, why should I?

274
00:14:29,897 --> 00:14:31,664
-We need to do this in
order to catch Kira.

275
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:34,230
MISA: But that has
nothing to do with me.

276
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:35,597
-You should know
that I was going

277
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,930
to take you at gunpoint
as a last resort.

278
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,497
But you didn't resist.

279
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,397
That was a great help.

280
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,897
Thank you, Mr. Mogi.

281
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,397
-I probably would
have resisted if I

282
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,230
hadn't listen to
what Aizawa told me.

283
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:50,964
But after hearing
about the notepads,

284
00:14:50,997 --> 00:14:52,130
there's no doubt in my mind.

285
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,230
-(VOICEOVER) What's going on?

286
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,330
-Near.

287
00:14:59,364 --> 00:14:59,897
NEAR: Yes?

288
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,830
What is it, L?

289
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:02,264
-We have a problem.

290
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:04,630
Mogi and Misa Amane
have gone missing.

291
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:06,397
NEAR: I'm already aware of that.

292
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,030
I was the one who took
them into custody.

293
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:09,697
-He what?

294
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,897
-For what reason?

295
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,030
-Oh, just in case.

296
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:19,864
-Near, kidnapping is a
blatant criminal act.

297
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:21,664
You have to stop this now.

298
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:24,597
NEAR: Actually, Mr. Mogi and
Amane both came here willingly.

299
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,164
You can even ask them yourself.

300
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,130
I'll put them on the line now.

301
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:29,064
Here they are.

302
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:34,130
LIGHT: Mogi.

303
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:35,064
Misa.

304
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:36,930
This is L speaking.

305
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:38,097
-(VOICEOVER) Light!

306
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,530
-I'm told that Near
is detaining you.

307
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,297
He said that you
both agreed to it.

308
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,130
Is that true?

309
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,664
-It is.

310
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,130
-Mogi.

311
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:52,597
-Actually, I was
against the whole thing.

312
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,464
But Motchi said it would be best
if I just went along quietly.

313
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:59,030
He told me we would have
both been killed if I didn't.

314
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:00,230
-All right.

315
00:16:00,264 --> 00:16:02,597
It's fine, as long as you
both consented to this.

316
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,030
-So now I've removed
Misa Amane, the one who

317
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:12,397
might be the second
Kira from the equation.

318
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,097
Light Yagami, I'm sure the
significance of this move

319
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,397
isn't lost on you.

320
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,764
-Hey, no way!

321
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:23,164
You're planning to end this
without Misa Misa performing?

322
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:24,464
-God, what a ripoff!

323
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:26,330
-It looks like Lidner and
the others were successful.

324
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:29,697
It's past 9:00.

325
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,297
All right.

326
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:30,830
It's my turn.

327
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,330
Mikami leaves work at almost
the same time every day,

328
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:07,197
with only slight variations.

329
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,330
He leads a completely scheduled
life, for the most part.

330
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,697
-So, he always goes
to that particular gym

331
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,997
every Monday and
Thursday at around 9:00.

332
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,497
Is that correct?

333
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,630
-Yes.

334
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:19,797
He's kept that routine
for the past four years,

335
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,230
ever since he joined.

336
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:23,164
He didn't even skip
New Year's Day.

337
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:27,130
I became a member and made a few
inquiries to confirm it myself.

338
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:28,530
-Good.

339
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:31,630
So then we can assume that he'll
be there on Monday the 31st as

340
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:32,230
well?

341
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:33,430
-Yes.

342
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:34,864
If he's the type of man
who would go on holidays,

343
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:38,230
then he'll certainly
go on New Year's Eve.

344
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:40,330
-Giovanni, would it
be possible for you

345
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:43,830
to touch the notebook
on the 31st at the gym?

346
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,797
-Huh?

347
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,164
Yes.

348
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:49,797
I've already done a thorough
check of the hotel's security.

349
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,897
The locker room is
definitely free of any kind

350
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,164
of surveillance.

351
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,330
NEAR: Then I'll leave it to you.

352
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:58,830
-Sir, if there is a
Shinigami with him,

353
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:01,764
there's a distinct possibility
that I will die, isn't there?

354
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:03,130
NEAR: Yes.

355
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:06,064
Part of The reason you're doing
this is to test that theory.

356
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:08,664
Even if you don't see any
Shinigami after first touching

357
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:11,030
the notebook, I want you
to continue watching Mikami

358
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:13,297
for a while longer before
we conclude whether or not

359
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,264
he has one following him.

360
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:21,130
I can have Rester do it
if you're too scared.

361
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:21,697
-No.

362
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,764
I understand.

363
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:23,697
I'll do it.

364
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:40,330
Hm?

365
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:46,664
If there's a
Shinigami around-- no.

366
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:48,230
If there was one, I'd be dead.

367
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:50,197
It's too late to turn back now.

368
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,264
I have to touch it.

369
00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:23,764
Sir, I've succeeded in
touching the notebook.

370
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:28,130
I can't confirm the existence
of any Shinigami at this time.

371
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:29,930
-Commander Rester,
please connect me

372
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:32,564
with Mr. Mogi for a moment.

373
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:33,897
-Hm?

374
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,597
-Mr. Mogi, according to your
investigation and the rules

375
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,364
of the notebook, how
long can a person be

376
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:41,364
controlled before their death?

377
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,697
-Based on the data we got
from Yotsuba's experiments,

378
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,497
it's 23 days.

379
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,997
NEAR: Are you sure?

380
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,030
-Yes.

381
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:50,097
I'd say that the
killings done by Yotsuba

382
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,897
were more than
enough to prove it.

383
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,997
-Thank you for your assistance.

384
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,364
We have to consider
the possibility

385
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,564
that Giovanni is already
being controlled.

386
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,030
In that case, they
could be making

387
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:03,264
him say that there
is no Shinigami.

388
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:07,630
That means I need to confront
L in exactly 24 days,

389
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,130
if Giovanni is still
alive until then.

390
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:16,997
-LIGHT: Kiyomi.

391
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,497
I saw you had some trouble
at the pop music festival.

392
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,897
-Yes.

393
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,797
I never imagined that
Ms. Amane would missing.

394
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,164
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Give T an
order to contact you and let

395
00:20:26,197 --> 00:20:28,864
you know as soon as he's
confirmed everything.

396
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:31,697
Once you hear from him, I want
you to send me a text message

397
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,997
or call me with the
following message.

398
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,564
I want to see you
as soon as possible.

399
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:42,997
GIOVANNI (VOICEOVER):
Photographs?

400
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,330
-Yes.

401
00:20:44,364 --> 00:20:48,097
I want to see exactly what
he wrote in the notebook.

402
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,930
I want to see the pattern
in how Mikami writes,

403
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:54,797
if there are any habits, and
what kind of notebook it is.

404
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,230
I want to see it all.

405
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:58,764
Everything in detail
with my own eyes.

406
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,030
RESTER: What do you think, Near?

407
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:17,097
NEAR: Perfect.

408
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,564
Giovanni has done
an excellent job.

409
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:21,464
The handwriting matches
that of the records

410
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:23,530
Mikami keeps as prosecutor.

411
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:25,164
There's absolutely no doubt.

412
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:26,964
This is his handwriting.

413
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:28,297
-I agree.

414
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,330
-With this, we can do it.

415
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:42,652
[theme music]

416
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:52,809
LIGHT: The escort team
has been attacked.

417
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:55,076
Ms. Takada, are you all right?

418
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,776
Is this Near's work again?

419
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,976
No.

420
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,542
This isn't his style.

421
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:02,476
It's more like Mello!
