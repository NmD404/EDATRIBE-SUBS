[theme music]

2
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,661
-The second L and
the person I think

3
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,927
is Kira can only be one man.

4
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:40,461
Light Yagami.

5
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:42,694
-This is Kiyomi
Takada from News 6.

6
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,061
I have an announcement that
comes directly from Kira.

7
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:47,327
His words are to become
the new law of the world.

8
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:48,827
-I just had an idea.

9
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:52,261
I think we can make
use of Kiyomi Takada.

10
00:01:52,294 --> 00:01:55,027
-Please excuse me.

11
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:55,927
Kira!

12
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,894
-He's removing the bugs?

13
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:59,161
-We don't have a choice.

14
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:01,894
-Listen, Kiyomi.

15
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:02,861
I am the real Kira.

16
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:07,094
KIYOMI (VOICEOVER):
Light is Kira?

17
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:15,727
NEAR (VOICEOVER): All the
pieces have fallen into place.

18
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,661
Now that things
have come this far,

19
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:21,327
it's my turn to go to Japan.

20
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:23,027
Commander Rester.

21
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,361
-Yes.

22
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,527
-I'm afraid I need you to
return to New York immediately.

23
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:27,427
-Right now?

24
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,261
-Yes.

25
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:29,827
I'm intending to go to Japan.

26
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:31,194
-All right.

27
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:33,327
So you would like me to stay
in New York while you're gone?

28
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,594
-Not at all.

29
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:37,261
RESTER: Then what's the point
of me coming back there?

30
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:39,894
-Truth is, I've never
made travel arrangements

31
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,161
or boarded a flight
on my own before.

32
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:43,861
That's why I need
you to come back.

33
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,727
So you can escort me.

34
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:46,227
-Understood.

35
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:57,194
MAN: We got him.

36
00:02:57,227 --> 00:03:00,294
Both Yoshida Productions and NHN
are practically begging us now.

37
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:03,527
The great Misa Misa comeback
plan is a huge success.

38
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:05,661
-These days, it's nearly
impossible for anyone

39
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:09,094
to get into NHN, but this
will get us full access.

40
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:10,594
-Yeah, that's right.

41
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:12,894
Mogi will be gaining
entry as Misa's manager.

42
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,394
It'll definitely
be to our advantage

43
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,427
to have someone who can
go in and out freely.

44
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,761
In the meantime, I'll
continue investigating Takada.

45
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:22,327
NEAR (ON SPEAKER): This is Near.

46
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:24,094
I want to speak to L.

47
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,694
-This is L. What is
you want from us?

48
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:29,861
I'm following through with
my goal to arrest Kira.

49
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:32,294
And that's why I'm Japan now.

50
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,661
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
He's in Japan?

51
00:03:33,694 --> 00:03:34,861
Why tell me?

52
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:36,894
He's up to something.

53
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,827
NEAR (ON SPEAKER): L. I presume
you've already contacted Takada

54
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:42,994
for the purposes of
your own investigation.

55
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,261
-That's right.

56
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:46,727
In fact, I'm investigating
her myself at the moment.

57
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:47,994
-I see.

58
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,827
For the time being,
it's a given that, if we

59
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:51,794
want to get any closer
to capturing Kira,

60
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:54,427
we'll have to keep an eye
on Kiyomi Takada and NHN

61
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:56,761
in general.

62
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,294
I want you to pass on a message.

63
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:01,294
Inform her that, as of
now, several SPK members

64
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:05,094
have entered Japan in order
to catch and arrest Kira.

65
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,361
-But why do that?

66
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:09,594
-To lure Kira out of hiding.

67
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:11,627
I also want you to mention
the following to her

68
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:13,161
so she'll relay it to Kira.

69
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:16,094
In total, there are only four
active members of the SPK.

70
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:18,761
That includes myself.

71
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:21,561
Kira won't be able to
resist such an opportunity.

72
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,861
Knowing him, he won't run.

73
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,294
Instead, he'll try to kill
us before we get too close.

74
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,494
That's where I'll beat
him at his own game.

75
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,527
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Beat
me at my own game, huh?

76
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:34,094
All right, Near.

77
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:37,461
If that's how you want it,
I'll accept your challenge.

78
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:40,094
-I am in Japan as we speak.

79
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,427
-I am in Japan as well.

80
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:44,461
Then we'll be quite
close to each other.

81
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:45,694
Who knows?

82
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:48,027
We might even have the
chance to meet face to face.

83
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,194
-I hope so.

84
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:53,161
-Well, that'll be something
to look forward to.

85
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:54,394
-Yes.

86
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,861
-When that time comes, we'll
finish this Kira matter

87
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:57,694
once and for all.

88
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,194
-Definitely.

89
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,994
It's all becoming clear to me.

90
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:06,361
From the very
beginning, and even now,

91
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:08,627
it's been a one on
one fight against L.

92
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:11,227
And even though he's
dead, the battle's

93
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,394
just shifted to his heirs.

94
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:14,861
Very well, Near.

95
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:15,794
Fine.

96
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,294
I'll come out to
play if you will.

97
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,261
It's only fair, after all.

98
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:23,661
And when we meet, we'll find out
which of us is truly prepared

99
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:26,594
to win, and whose
wits will prevail.

100
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:30,127
When that happens, this
long battle will end

101
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:34,927
and I can finally begin
my reign at the top.

102
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:38,427
-First, let's review
what we know so far.

103
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:43,327
L is Light Yagami,
and he's also Kira.

104
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,794
For now, we'll call him L Kira.

105
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:47,127
There's also another one.

106
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:49,961
Someone who has the notebook
and is currently using it.

107
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:52,494
We'll call him X Kira.

108
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:54,694
Judging by the pattern
of X Kira's killings,

109
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:57,594
he has definitely made the
deal and acquired the Shinigami

110
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:58,727
eyes.

111
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:00,927
L Kira and X Kira can't
communicate directly.

112
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,527
They must be planning
to communicate

113
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,794
using Takada as a go between.

114
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:08,127
So, given the situation
as it now stands,

115
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:10,627
there are two ways
to win against Kira.

116
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:14,094
One, the simple way.

117
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,994
We arrange to kill
both L Kira and X Kira

118
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:19,361
and confiscate the notebook.

119
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:21,061
However, no matter
what might happen,

120
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:23,127
we will never resort to that.

121
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:24,227
-Why not?

122
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,961
NEAR: That's not the
way we work, Commander.

123
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:28,661
-We, sir?

124
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:30,027
-Yes, that's right.

125
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,094
We kill those two
and the murders stop.

126
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:35,761
Such ex post facto justification
will not be tolerated.

127
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:38,594
That's not the way
L and I do things,

128
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:41,327
because that would be an insult.

129
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:43,594
Don't forget, L
entrusted this case

130
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:44,927
to those who came after him.

131
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:00,994
LIGHT: So, Kiyomi.

132
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:02,594
I heard on the
news the other day

133
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:05,694
that you receive an enormous
amount of fan mail every day.

134
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,827
-Yes.

135
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:10,327
I'm told on average it's
about 200 letters a day.

136
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:11,861
LIGHT (ON RADIO): 200 letters?

137
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:13,927
Wow, I'm a little jealous.

138
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:16,494
-Man, this is kind of boring
listening to audio only

139
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,227
without any video feed.

140
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:20,727
-I think you should look through
them, even if they are just

141
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:22,827
letters from fans.

142
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:25,194
-You're right.

143
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,627
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Keep calm as you

144
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,394
read this note and
the ones that follow.

145
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,994
Make sure not to let the people
listening to this conversation

146
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:31,827
hear your reactions.

147
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,327
The SPK has started
to make its move.

148
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,294
You have to start thinking
about your safety.

149
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,794
Instead of accepting
messages from Kira,

150
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:47,861
maybe you should consider making
a few demands of your own.

151
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:49,794
-Light's getting
down to business.

152
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,961
-You shouldn't only
be a spokesperson.

153
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:54,127
Your voice should
be heard as well.

154
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:55,261
Reach out to Kira.

155
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:57,327
Tell him what you
think he needs to know.

156
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:05,661
I have a different
job for T. In order

157
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,694
to create the perfect world
that Kira has envisioned,

158
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:12,427
I want you to begin judging
and punishing people as Kira.

159
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,827
-It's all right, Kiyomi.

160
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:19,461
I have faith in you.

161
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,694
It's going to be OK.

162
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:23,527
If you can do this,
I'm sure you'll

163
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:26,094
be able to send Kira
information that you

164
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:27,927
don't want the
SPK to know about.

165
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:33,627
-All right.

166
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:35,027
I'll do it.

167
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,494
-We nailed it.

168
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:37,961
-That's our Light for you.

169
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:38,461
-He's good.

170
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:44,394
-Delete.

171
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:45,661
Delete.

172
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:46,527
Delete.

173
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:49,127
[phone ringing]

174
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,161
MIKAMI: Kiyomi Takada.

175
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:54,127
Hm.

176
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:55,094
Yes?

177
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:57,294
-I have an important
message for you.

178
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:58,994
You are to send me a
fan letter that I'll

179
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:00,894
be able to recognize as yours.

180
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,727
You will also enclose
something else in the envelope.

181
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:06,927
Five blank pages
from the notebook.

182
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,194
Carry on with your judgements
and killings as usual

183
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:11,994
until I receive the
letter and the pages.

184
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:13,827
-And how about after
you receive them?

185
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:16,327
-You have to stop using
the real notebook.

186
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,161
However, you must
continue entering names

187
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:19,694
in a fake notebook.

188
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,794
MIKAMI (ON PHONE): A fake?

189
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,094
-That's right.

190
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,294
Make a notebook that looks
as close to the original as

191
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:27,194
possible, and act as if
you're killing people

192
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:29,827
by using this decoy.

193
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,794
-I understand.

194
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:34,527
God.

195
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,461
What are you planning?

196
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:37,394
No.

197
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:38,927
It's not my place
to question God.

198
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,061
His will is absolute.

199
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:45,094
My job is to do what god wishes.

200
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:08,983
-Huh?

201
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,349
What's this?

202
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,083
-It's a replacement
for Kira's Kingdom.

203
00:10:12,116 --> 00:10:15,049
-God, what's wrong
with these people?

204
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,449
MAN: Welcome to the show.

205
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,249
Today, Ms. Takada will introduce
her four new female bodyguards,

206
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:22,549
who were selected after a
rigorous screening process.

207
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,983
The first is the winner
of the 22nd World Karate

208
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:27,716
Championships,
Miss Tatsumi Oyama.

209
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:31,783
The second is a former CIA
agent, Ms. Halle Lidner.

210
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,316
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
If there is an SPK

211
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,116
member among these
bodyguards, it

212
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,283
would have to be Halle Lidner.

213
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:41,116
Looks like Near's conducting
his own investigation of Takada.

214
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,483
MAN: A phantom
killer who stabbed

215
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,816
six people in Shinjuku's busy
quarters was apprehended--

216
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:47,549
NEAR (VOICEOVER): Who
I chose to be X Kira?

217
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,983
Out of all the
people in the world?

218
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,649
KIYOMI (ON TV):
--educating our children

219
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:54,816
about the existence of Kira and
the meaning of his teachings

220
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:56,349
must be made mandatory.

221
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,783
Above all, we must teach our
children that Kira is good.

222
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,983
-(VOICEOVER) Takada was
chosen because she's a strong

223
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:03,549
supporter of Kira.

224
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:08,016
So, that means X
Kira must be someone

225
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:10,749
who knew they Takada
was a Kira worshipper.

226
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:13,516
Someone who had a close,
intimate relationship with her

227
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,316
before her selection.

228
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:18,949
-Also, Kira will not forgive
any crime, no matter how small.

229
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:20,549
From this point
onwards, you should

230
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,949
assume that any person
alive is a viable target.

231
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:38,416
-I'd like to hear Kira's voice.

232
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,249
I want to hear his
thoughts once again.

233
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,849
We should follow his teachings,
exactly as Kira ordered.

234
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:46,816
To me, it's obviously
the quickest path

235
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:48,283
to lasting world peace.

236
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,183
Youth have a responsibility.

237
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:51,949
I think it is of
the most importance

238
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,449
that young people do all
they can to contribute.

239
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:57,349
It's our duty to
improve our society.

240
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,083
If there are no words
or orders from Kira,

241
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,849
then we have only one choice.

242
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:02,916
We need to think for ourselves.

243
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:05,083
We need to consider
what Kira has taught us,

244
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:07,849
determine what he wants most,
and make our own decisions

245
00:12:07,883 --> 00:12:08,883
from there.

246
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,049
-L Kira is Light Yagami.

247
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,016
Could X Kira be Teru Mikami?

248
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,849
[whispers]

249
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:25,483
-Everything seems
to fit into place.

250
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,383
MISA: That's what
I've been asking.

251
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,116
So tell me why I'm
not the headliner.

252
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,983
You said I was supposed to be
the highlight of the East-West

253
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:34,116
Pop Music Festival.

254
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:36,116
-Well, it's true that
you're the highlight,

255
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:37,683
but when it comes
to the headliner,

256
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,483
it's a little harder
to secure that spot.

257
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:40,649
-Huh?

258
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:41,149
-Huh?

259
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:45,316
-That's why we should
be taking precautions.

260
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:52,149
-Kiyomi Takada.

261
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:53,216
What an idiot.

262
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:55,283
She doesn't even realize
that Light's just

263
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,949
using her for his investigation.

264
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:58,183
-Don't say that.

265
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:59,816
You might end up dead
if she hears you.

266
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,249
-Duh, I know that.

267
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:04,616
That's why I
whispered it quietly.

268
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:06,083
Hey!

269
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,516
She snickered at me!

270
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,949
I'm gonna go kick her!

271
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:11,616
-Hang on!

272
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:19,183
-What were you trying to do?

273
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,716
-What was I doing?

274
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:21,683
What about you?

275
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:26,516
Grr.

276
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,916
-Lidner, that young
lady is actually

277
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:30,649
a very good friend of mine.

278
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:33,416
Please, you shouldn't
be so rough with her.

279
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:34,216
-Hmph!

280
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:35,983
-Of course, Miss Takada.

281
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,316
Please, excuse me.

282
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:43,449
-Misa Misa, are you all right?

283
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:47,216
-That was so frustrating!

284
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,083
NEAR: L, this is Near.

285
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:50,949
I have a small request.

286
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:53,449
If Mr. Aizawa is there,
would it be possible

287
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:55,616
for me to speak to
him for a moment?

288
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,049
-Near, this is Aizawa.

289
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,349
What is it?

290
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,149
NEAR: I have a question
regarding surveillance for L

291
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:01,616
and Takada's meetings.

292
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,716
Are you recording both
audio and video feed

293
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,049
to their conversations?

294
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:05,983
-Uh, no.

295
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:07,983
Only an audio feed right now.

296
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,183
NEAR: I see.

297
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,916
Only wiretaps at the moment.

298
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,183
How interesting.

299
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:14,816
Thank you very much.

300
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:17,049
-If they're only using
wiretaps, then it's

301
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,016
safe to assume that L Kira
and X Kira have found a way

302
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,116
to contact each
other through Takada.

303
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:25,016
Seems like Lidner could be in
more danger than we realize.

304
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,249
-We knew the risks
getting into this.

305
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,249
To be blunt, what's
important is that L

306
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:31,883
starts focusing his attention
on Lidner and Takada.

307
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,616
In the meantime, we'll
use the opportunity

308
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,749
to investigate Mikami further.

309
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:37,016
-Hm.

310
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,516
How are things, Giovanni?

311
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,616
-Well, about Mikami.

312
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:40,949
It's strange.

313
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:43,049
It's ridiculously
easy to trail him.

314
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,649
He's not trying to
hide, or anything.

315
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,116
He's lived at the same
place the past four years.

316
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:49,149
There's nothing
unusual about him.

317
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:51,316
He also seems to be totally
dedicated to his career

318
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,716
as a prosecutor.

319
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:55,083
I'm beginning to think
he can't be X Kira.

320
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:56,349
-No.

321
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:58,616
There is a very high probability
that Mikami is X Kira.

322
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,716
Please be very careful.

323
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:01,916
Don't enter his room yet.

324
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:03,783
Just keep watch
over him for now.

325
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:04,283
-Gotcha.

326
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:10,016
MISA: Man, how many meetings
do I need to have with NHN,

327
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,583
for crying out loud?

328
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:14,016
-And seriously, how many
times do these people

329
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:16,483
have to tell me, be
careful about what you say?

330
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,883
What's with that?

331
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,583
-Yes.

332
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:19,283
Yes, of course.

333
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:20,716
I'll ask her right now.

334
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:22,183
Uh, listen.

335
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:24,683
Misa Misa, Takada would
like to have dinner

336
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,583
with you this evening.

337
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:26,983
Just the two of you.

338
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:28,583
-Huh?

339
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:29,883
(VOICEOVER) That Kiyomi.

340
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,749
What's she up to?

341
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:33,949
-Good idea.

342
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,816
The music festival's
MC should have

343
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:39,183
dinner with the main
performer at least once.

344
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:41,049
Tell her OK.

345
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,416
-Hm.

346
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,349
Hello?

347
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,516
-Miss Takada?

348
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,216
She's accepted.

349
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:47,983
-Great.

350
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,849
I'm looking forward to it.

351
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,049
Oh, and Lidner?

352
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,516
Please book a nice,
private room for us.

353
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:56,616
And also, I'd like you to
attend the dinner as well.

354
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:57,683
-Huh?

355
00:15:57,716 --> 00:15:58,183
Yes.

356
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,483
TAKADA: Misa, I'm sorry
to have to invite you

357
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,083
to dinner so late at night.

358
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,749
I'm afraid it had to
wait until after the 9:00

359
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,016
news was finished

360
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:27,716
MISA: No problem.

361
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:28,849
I don't mind at all.

362
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:30,449
I'm a night owl, anyway.

363
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,916
Well, what is it?

364
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:46,083
-I'm not really sure how to
answer a question like that.

365
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:48,349
So, Light must be pretty busy.

366
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,883
How do you two manage?

367
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,116
(VOICEOVER) Why, you-- she knows
that I can't see him that much,

368
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,049
while she can be with
him all the time.

369
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,549
How dare she?

370
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,416
Things are great between us.

371
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,283
Light is way more
affectionate than he looks.

372
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:02,816
At least with me.

373
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:04,349
In fact, he starts
clinging to me

374
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,316
as soon as he gets in
the door every night.

375
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:06,783
-Ah.

376
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:08,049
I see.

377
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,749
It sounds like
you're doing well.

378
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:11,716
Thank goodness.

379
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:13,083
-Yes.

380
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:17,049
Actually, I should probably
tell you, since you are the MC.

381
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,883
I'm going to announce
my engagement to Light

382
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,949
at the Pop Music Festival.

383
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,349
-Does he know about this?

384
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:28,716
-Of course he does.

385
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:29,816
It's an engagement.

386
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,383
It's not as if I can
get engaged to myself.

387
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,149
He proposed to me
more than a month ago.

388
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:35,383
It was so romantic.

389
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,316
Don't you think it'd be
exciting to announce it

390
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,149
at the Pop Music
Festival, Miss MC?

391
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:50,749
-Why not?

392
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:52,083
If you're able to, that is.

393
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,116
-What do you mean,
if I'm able to?

394
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:56,583
What, are you not going
to let me announce it?

395
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,749
Or maybe it's something else.

396
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,983
Maybe you're going to
get Kira to kill me.

397
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:04,949
-Of course not.

398
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,949
Only Kira can decide who
he's going to punish.

399
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:10,283
I have nothing to do
with his decisions.

400
00:18:10,316 --> 00:18:13,183
Besides, I've always thought
of you as a good friend, Misa.

401
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,483
You shouldn't say
such terrible things.

402
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:18,416
Anyway, I don't have any
intention of killing anyone,

403
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:22,216
no matter how horrible
they might be.

404
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:24,049
-Well, whatever.

405
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,449
I used to really like
Kira too, you know?

406
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:29,316
But I know for sure that
Light's going to catch him soon.

407
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,016
Oh, yeah.

408
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:37,516
Once he gets caught, it'll be
nothing but bad news for him.

409
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,316
And as for you, you'll
probably be executed.

410
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:44,549
[coughing]

411
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,883
-Miss Takada?

412
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,583
Are you all right?

413
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:48,783
-Huh?

414
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:52,449
[laughter]

415
00:18:55,683 --> 00:18:57,683
-Listen, Kiyomi.

416
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,749
I am the real Kira.

417
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:02,649
Please, join me,
Kiyomi, and you will

418
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,116
be the goddess of the new world.

419
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,883
-Miss Amane?

420
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,249
-Yes?

421
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:14,849
-I find this unpleasant.

422
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:15,349
-Hmph!

423
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:15,916
Oh, yeah?

424
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:17,716
I feel the same!

425
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:19,716
-Obviously, this was a bad idea.

426
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:21,716
I should've waited until
you grew up and learned

427
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:23,816
a few minutes before I
invited you to dinner.

428
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:25,349
I suppose I'll know
better next time.

429
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:26,149
Goodbye.

430
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,116
-Oh?

431
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:29,449
I'm older than you, Kiyomi.

432
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,616
And anyways, you're
being childish

433
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,349
for storming out in
the middle of diner

434
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:35,049
over a silly little comment!

435
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,516
Ha ha ha ha ha!

436
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:53,349
Hey, Motchi!

437
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:54,916
Thanks for waiting, Motchi!

438
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:55,883
How are you?

439
00:19:58,483 --> 00:19:59,916
MOGI: A-A-- Are you OK?

440
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,349
MISA: Of course I am.

441
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:03,216
I won, after all.

442
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:04,049
MOGI: Won?

443
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:04,583
MISA: Yeah.

444
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:07,983
It was easy.

445
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:10,783
-About tonight's meeting
between Takada and Amane.

446
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:12,883
They just talked
about Light Yagami.

447
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,449
If you read between
the lines, they

448
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:17,716
were arguing over which
one was his lover.

449
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,749
-Your thoughts?

450
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:21,683
-All I can determine is this.

451
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:24,283
Light Yagami is popular
with the ladies,

452
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:27,883
and we know that Takada
and Amane both adore him.

453
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,383
-Near, please be
serious about this.

454
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,583
NEAR: It is serious if they're
both truly in love with him.

455
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:34,916
They will not easily betray him.

456
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:37,283
In fact, they'll likely
do whatever he asks.

457
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:50,749
WOMAN: Please stop.

458
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,883
-Aw, come on now, lady.

459
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,883
I mean, wearing a short skirt
like that in the winter?

460
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:56,916
It's an invitation.

461
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:57,416
-Please.

462
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:57,916
Someone!

463
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,816
-Hm?

464
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:04,483
Cell phone?

465
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,683
Mikami's just taken
out a notebook.

466
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:15,649
-Delete.

467
00:21:15,683 --> 00:21:16,883
-He's writing something in it.

468
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,583
Could that be it?

469
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:21,383
He's getting off the train.

470
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,949
[screaming]

471
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,398
[theme music]

472
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:52,926
GIOVANNI: Mikami started
talking to himself.

473
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:55,392
He seems to have reacted to
the scrap of paper at his feet.

474
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:57,326
He's gone into the gym.

475
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,759
I've entered the locker room.

476
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,026
I'm opening the lock
on his briefcase.

477
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:03,559
I'm going to touch the notebook.
