1
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,912
[music playing]

2
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,103
-That was footage from
surveillance cameras

3
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:42,503
at the station.

4
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,803
The death of one of the FBI
agents is captured on here.

5
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,403
-Let's see the
following scenes again--

6
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:50,536
Raye Penber passing the
ticket gate on his way in,

7
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,570
then him boarding the
train, and finally the part

8
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:54,136
where he dies on the platform.

9
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,403
OK.

10
00:01:55,436 --> 00:01:56,803
Let's see.

11
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:59,036
-I think it's next to that.

12
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,570
-Oh, here it is.

13
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,903
-Um, so based on the
records I have here,

14
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:04,670
Ray Penber comes through
the west entrance

15
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:08,036
of Shinjuku Station at 3:11 PM.

16
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,103
Then at 3:13, he boards a
train on the Yamanote line.

17
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:13,503
But even if he was following
someone at that time,

18
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:15,436
I think it's going to
be very difficult for us

19
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,570
to draw any real conclusions
from this blurry video.

20
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:24,036
Then at exactly 4:42 PM-- oh,
thank you very much, Watari.

21
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,770
Um, and at 4:42 PM, he exits
a train at Tokyo station

22
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:30,536
and dies on the platform.

23
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,970
-It's quite strange,
don't you think?

24
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,336
-I'm sorry, what do
you find strange?

25
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,403
-Yeah, what is it?

26
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,703
Did you notice something?

27
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:39,770
-Mmm.

28
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:41,670
We know that Raye
Penber got on the train,

29
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,170
and then an hour
and a half later he

30
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:44,836
got off and died
on the platform.

31
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,603
But the Yamanote line
only takes an hour

32
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:47,736
to complete its circuit.

33
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,970
And more importantly,
there's the envelope.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,003
-Uh, what do you mean?

35
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,970
L: He's holding what looks
like an envelope when

36
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:58,336
he passes through
the ticket gate.

37
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,203
-You're right!

38
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:00,870
It's there, under his arm.

39
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:04,670
But in the footage right
before his death, it's gone.

40
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:07,370
I can't believe you
actually caught that.

41
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:09,470
-Well, I don't see an
envelope on this list

42
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,203
of his personal effects.

43
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:13,936
L: Which means it was
left on the train.

44
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,103
And if you watch closely
at the very end here,

45
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:20,603
it seems like he's straining
to look inside the train

46
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:21,570
before the doors close.

47
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,070
You can see right here.

48
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,470
-If that's the case, do you
think it could mean something?

49
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:28,503
-Wouldn't it be interesting
if Kira was on that train.

50
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:29,703
-That's impossible.

51
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:32,970
-I admit, I find it hard
to believe, as well.

52
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:34,370
There's no reason
for Kira to come

53
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:35,803
to the scene of
his own crime when

54
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,570
he can kill from a distance.

55
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:41,636
Well, maybe he was counting
on us to make that assumption

56
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,536
and figured he could get
away with such a bold move.

57
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,036
Mmm.

58
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,370
-Mmm.

59
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:54,303
RYUK: What's going
on with you, Light?

60
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,803
You haven't stopped writing
criminals' names in the death

61
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,236
note for four days straight.

62
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,970
So what are you trying to prove?

63
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:03,036
I don't see the point in writing
these names weeks in advance.

64
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,236
I've never seen the death
note used like this.

65
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,736
-Consider it insurance.

66
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,736
Suppose the son of the detective
superintendent of the NPA

67
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,870
was hospitalized.

68
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:13,003
If criminals stopped
dying at the same time,

69
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:15,070
it wouldn't be difficult
to connect the two.

70
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,836
-So that's what this is.

71
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,470
-Are you sure that
I can use any date

72
00:04:18,503 --> 00:04:20,870
as long as it's before the end
of a person's predetermined

73
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,103
lifespan?

74
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,003
-Well, I can't guarantee
it because we Shinigami

75
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:26,636
don't normally work that way.

76
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,803
But I suppose any time before
the end of their lifespan

77
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,070
should work.

78
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,103
-I really can't
count on you, can I?

79
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,903
-You got that right.

80
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:36,403
WATARI: Yes?

81
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:37,303
Yes.

82
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:38,370
Would you please
hold for a moment?

83
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,136
Ryuzaki, it's Ukita at the NPA.

84
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,803
He says he's on the
phone with someone

85
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:46,203
from the tip line who
has information for us.

86
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:48,803
-Right, then give Ukita
the number for line five

87
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:50,236
and ask him to
have the informant

88
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,636
call that line instead.

89
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,203
It'll be safer that way.

90
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:57,103
-Mr. Matsuda, it's OK for you
to turn on your cell phone now.

91
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:58,836
Actually, please turn
it on right away.

92
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,970
-Uh, sure.

93
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:07,036
-Yes, this is Suzuki, head of
Kira's investigation public

94
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,370
information division.

95
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:11,770
Raye Penber's fiancee?

96
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:14,136
Naomi Misora.

97
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,603
I've heard that name before.

98
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,836
So it's her.

99
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,936
She's from the Los
Angeles BB Murder Case.

100
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,336
That's right.

101
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,170
She was working under me.

102
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,670
I guess she must have come
to Japan with her fiance.

103
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:35,870
Well, apparently she's
been missing since the day

104
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,670
after her fiance died.

105
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,236
-I'm sure that anyone
in her situation

106
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,070
would be pretty depressed.

107
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:42,303
Was it--

108
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:44,103
-Suicide.

109
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,036
-No.

110
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,270
The Naomi Misora
I knew was strong.

111
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:50,336
Not to mention, she was
also an excellent FBI agent.

112
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,536
If anything, it's more likely
she'd be trying to catch Kira.

113
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,203
It appears she came
to Japan with Penber.

114
00:05:57,236 --> 00:06:00,136
It's possible that she
may have found a lead.

115
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,236
If that's the case, did Kira
manage to get her first?

116
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,870
Everyone, at this point I'd
like to focus our investigation

117
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:11,003
on only those people who
Raye Penber was tailing.

118
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:14,570
In particular, he was assigned
to two police officers

119
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:16,370
and those closest to them.

120
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:18,136
-Very well, who are
these two individuals

121
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,070
he was investigating?

122
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:25,036
-Deputy Director Kitamura, along
with Detective Superintendent

123
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,736
Yagami and their families.

124
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,936
At this stage, I'd like to
place wiretaps and surveillance

125
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,203
cameras in both households.

126
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:36,836
-I have to make sure there's no
evidence left on this computer,

127
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,370
just in case someone
goes through it.

128
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,036
Now I just have to
hide these clippings

129
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,270
from the death note in here.

130
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:49,336
RYUK: It seems like you're
pretty skilled with your hands.

131
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,870
I bet you're pretty popular
with the girls, aren't you?

132
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,770
LIGHT: Skill has
nothing to do with it.

133
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:55,970
It's your looks that count.

134
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:58,636
I'm guessing you're not
that popular, are you?

135
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,103
Huh?

136
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,236
-Surveillance cameras?

137
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:02,881
Ryuzaki.

138
00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:05,081
I don't see how you
could even consider this.

139
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:06,781
If this got out, we'd
have a civil rights

140
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:07,714
scandal on our hands.

141
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:08,781
We'd all lose our jobs.

142
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:10,481
-You told me you'd
be willing to risk

143
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,981
your lives for
this investigation,

144
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,481
but you wouldn't risk your jobs?

145
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,681
-Ryuzaki, what are
the odds that Kira's

146
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:19,548
in one of those households?

147
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,548
-Maybe 10%.

148
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,714
No, it's closer to 5%.

149
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:24,814
-Seriously?

150
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,448
I'm sorry, but it's
not worth the risk.

151
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:26,998
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: No.

152
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:29,064
Of all the people we've
investigated so far,

153
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:32,198
not one of them seemed even
the least bit suspicious.

154
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:33,998
Even if there's
only a 1% chance,

155
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:35,664
we simply can't
afford to ignore it.

156
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:37,031
SHUICHI AIZAWA: Chief?

157
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:38,631
-I don't have to
tell you how offended

158
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:41,398
I am to learn my family
is under suspicion.

159
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,869
Having said that,
just go ahead with it.

160
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:46,702
And make sure you
install them everywhere.

161
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:48,469
I don't want any blind
spots in the house,

162
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,736
and that includes the bathroom.

163
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,269
-Thank you very much.

164
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:53,402
That was my intention.

165
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,169
-Come on, Chief.

166
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,569
You don't have to agree to this.

167
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:56,769
-Yes, he's right!

168
00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:57,969
Think about your family.

169
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:00,069
You have a wife and
daughter at home, don't you?

170
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,969
-Yes, I'm well
aware of that fact.

171
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:04,294
But there is no point
in doing any of this

172
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:05,361
if we can't be thorough.

173
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:07,161
Now I suggest you keep quiet!

174
00:08:10,894 --> 00:08:11,894
-I'm sorry.

175
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:14,294
-No, it's OK.

176
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,528
Excuse me.

177
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,961
-As a courtesy to the
chief and his family,

178
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:23,728
only he and I will conduct
surveillance of their home.

179
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,861
Watari, how long will
it take to prepare

180
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:28,694
the wiretaps and
cameras we need?

181
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:31,794
-Well, starting tomorrow I
can set them up at any time

182
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:34,128
provided we know when
both houses will be empty.

183
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:39,161
-See you later, Light.

184
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:40,228
-Yeah, see you tomorrow.

185
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,194
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): What?

186
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:45,928
No one's home yet.

187
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:55,994
I'm home.

188
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:07,928
Huh?

189
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:08,428
Hmm.

190
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:13,528
RYUK: How's it going?

191
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,694
I don't think anyone else
is in the house right no.

192
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:19,628
Do you want to play
some video games?

193
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:22,528
Come on, it's been a while.

194
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,128
You listening?

195
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:29,094
Hey, Light.

196
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,661
-I don't believe it.

197
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:39,761
I never knew he went
to such great lengths.

198
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,528
What could he be
hiding in there that he

199
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,461
doesn't want anyone else to see?

200
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:45,161
-For a 17-year-old
kid, I wouldn't

201
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:48,594
say this kind of behavior
is particularly abnormal.

202
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:51,128
When I was his age, I
did strange things, too.

203
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,661
Have you ever talked to your
son about the investigation?

204
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:54,794
-Of course not.

205
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,694
I've never once revealed
classified information

206
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:57,994
to my family.

207
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:01,028
Besides, I don't get to see
them too often these days.

208
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:04,528
And usually as soon as I get
home, all I can do is sleep.

209
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,728
-I understand.

210
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:08,228
-Where exactly are we going?

211
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:15,361
Light, don't ignore me when I'm
talking to you or I'll get mad.

212
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:16,294
Huh?

213
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,728
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
It doesn't look

214
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:19,228
like these clothes
have been bugged.

215
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,261
RYUK: Hello?

216
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:20,735
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I think we're safe.

217
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:21,769
-Yoohoo.

218
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:22,735
-Listen to me.

219
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:24,469
There's a very
strong possibility

220
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:26,069
that there are
wiretaps and maybe

221
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:28,902
surveillance cameras
hidden throughout my house.

222
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:30,269
-Really?

223
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,735
But that piece of paper was
still in your door, wasn't it?

224
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:35,769
-That's true, but I left the
paper in the door in a way

225
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,035
that it would be obvious to
anyone entering the room.

226
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:39,802
The real test is the handle.

227
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:40,902
-It is?

228
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:42,402
-When that door is
closed, the door

229
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:44,869
handle automatically returns
to a horizontal position,

230
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:46,635
and it won't go any
higher than that.

231
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:49,602
But whenever I close the
door, I adjust it slightly.

232
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,235
Instead of letting
it sit horizontally,

233
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:53,702
I lower it by about
five millimeters.

234
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,802
When I get home and I
try to open the door,

235
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,302
if the handle is
all the way up, I

236
00:10:57,335 --> 00:11:00,535
can be fairly certain that
someone was in my room.

237
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:02,069
But that method
alone doesn't tell me

238
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:04,069
if my door was actually opened.

239
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:07,235
So I put a mechanical pencil
lead in place, as well.

240
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,002
-So what you do with it?

241
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,735
-It goes on the hinge.

242
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,202
After I close the door, I take
the pencil lead and rest it

243
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:14,602
on the hinge in
such a way that it

244
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:17,335
will break if the door happens
to be opened by anyone.

245
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:20,502
Normally, I take it out
myself when I get back home.

246
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,035
When I got home
from school today,

247
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,269
I noticed that the
pencil lead was broken.

248
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,969
-Now that you mention
it, I do remember that.

249
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:29,302
-First the door
handle, then the lead.

250
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:31,535
I know someone was
in there today.

251
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:33,102
-Maybe it was your mother.

252
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,669
-My family wouldn't have
noticed the piece of paper.

253
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:37,735
What's suspicious is that
someone took the time

254
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:39,835
to put it back in the door.

255
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:41,802
BOOKSTORE MERCHANT: Hi
there, can I help you?

256
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,102
-What's this all about?

257
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,302
Are you buying a book about
wiretaps and surveillance

258
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:49,035
so you can figure this mess out?

259
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:51,935
-By the way, Ryuk,
what about your apples?

260
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,402
-Apples?

261
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:54,869
Huh?

262
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:57,135
That's right,
surveillance cameras!

263
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:59,769
Once the apple's in my
mouth, no one can see it.

264
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,502
But while I'm holding it,
it looks like it's floating.

265
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:03,735
-I thought so.

266
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,235
You told me that
Shinigami can't die.

267
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,035
So I guess it won't kill you to
stop eating apples for a while.

268
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,069
-Uh, don't you think
that's a bit much?

269
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:12,169
Come on.

270
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,269
I never told you this,
but apples are to me

271
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:16,902
what cigarettes and
alcohol are to humans.

272
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:18,302
Do you see what I'm saying?

273
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,502
I even get withdrawal symptoms.

274
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:21,735
LIGHT: Oh yeah?

275
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:23,069
What kind of symptoms?

276
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,469
-My body gets all twisted.

277
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:25,135
I do handstands.

278
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,369
It's not pretty!

279
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:28,169
-I don't need to see that.

280
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:29,069
-I know.

281
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:30,902
-OK, here's the thing.

282
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:32,569
Unfortunately, I
already gave L the hint

283
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:33,902
that Shinigami love apples.

284
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:35,969
So I just can't afford
to take the risk.

285
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,769
-When did you--

286
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:42,135
-If it's so important
for you to eat apples,

287
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:45,102
you'll have to find out where
all the cameras are hidden.

288
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,335
If you're lucky, you
might find a blind spot

289
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:50,035
where you can eat them
without being seen.

290
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,635
All right, let's go.

291
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:55,102
-Yeah, a camera search!

292
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,889
Sounds so interesting.

293
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,522
[music playing]

294
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,491
-Oh.

295
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:23,842
Oh, uh, I have to
find the cameras.

296
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,813
-I can't believe my son is
looking at those magazines.

297
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:30,113
-It's normal for a 17-year-old.

298
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:33,170
But it seems contrived.

299
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,770
It's too obvious.

300
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:36,836
The only reason he didn't
want anyone in his room

301
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,270
is because he had
these magazines?

302
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:39,936
That's what he
wants us to think.

303
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,336
-Hey, that's my son
you're talking about.

304
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,970
Are you honestly telling
me that you suspect him?

305
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:46,436
-I do suspect him.

306
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,970
That's why I placed wiretaps
and surveillance cameras

307
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:52,036
in your house and the
deputy director's house.

308
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,403
-Huh?

309
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:55,570
I found a camera in
the air conditioner.

310
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:56,870
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Hmm.

311
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,870
So they really put
cameras in here.

312
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:01,403
They must have bugged
the place, as well.

313
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:03,203
Even if this is the
Kira case, I didn't

314
00:14:03,236 --> 00:14:05,603
think the Japanese police
would ever go this far.

315
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,036
This must be L's
idea, which means

316
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,303
they've narrowed down
their list of suspects.

317
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:11,670
By now they must
have figured out

318
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:13,736
that it was someone who Raye
Penber was investigating

319
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,703
or they wouldn't have
gone to all this trouble.

320
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,236
-Man, these covers
mislead you all the time.

321
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,470
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): No.

322
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:26,403
Given the situation,
it's safer if I just

323
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:29,270
assume I'm their prime
suspect and the only one being

324
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,303
launched.

325
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,136
It'll be OK.

326
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,136
Luckily, I prepared for
this kind of situation.

327
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:40,670
-Oh, Light.

328
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:42,470
-Hey, Light.

329
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:43,970
Come on, dinner's ready.

330
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,270
-I love you always.

331
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:56,603
-Hideki Ryuga!

332
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,370
I swear he's perfect!

333
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:01,103
How come no one in my
class is like that?

334
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:03,903
-Sayu, just eat your dinner.

335
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,536
SAYU: I'll eat later.

336
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,603
-Hello, Mr. Aizawa?

337
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:09,470
Are the Kitamuras
watching television now?

338
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:10,403
-Yes.

339
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:11,670
He's not home,
but the other four

340
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,670
are watching while
they eat dinner.

341
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:16,103
It's channel four.

342
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:18,470
-Watari, please contact
the broadcasters

343
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:20,070
and tell them to
play our message.

344
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:20,803
WATARI: Very well.

345
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,336
Understood.

346
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,270
SAYU: Huh?

347
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:25,536
What's this?

348
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,103
ICPO?

349
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,270
They're saying that in
response to the Kira murders,

350
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,803
Interpol has decided to dispatch
a force of 1,500 investigators

351
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:34,036
to Japan.

352
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,736
The investigators were drawn
from the law enforcement

353
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,136
agencies of its member nations.

354
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,336
1,500 investigators?

355
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,503
Woah.

356
00:15:41,536 --> 00:15:43,070
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Chances are they've

357
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,536
got cameras in the
living room, as well.

358
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,670
Regardless of whether
this news is real or not,

359
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:52,070
it's obvious they're just trying
to evoke a reaction from me.

360
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:55,736
This is the exact same
trick he used last time.

361
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,436
LIGHT: The ICPO sure is stupid.

362
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,003
-Huh?

363
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:01,370
-I mean, there's no point
in making this announcement.

364
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:03,270
If they're going to send
all these people here

365
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:06,236
to investigate, shouldn't
they keep it a secret?

366
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,836
Even the FBI agents who
were secretly investigating

367
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,936
were killed by Kira.

368
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,803
Why would this be any different?

369
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,336
If you ask me, this is nothing
more than a desperate attempt

370
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,036
to shock Kira in the hopes that
he'll reveal himself somehow.

371
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,603
Quite frankly, I
wouldn't be surprised

372
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:21,236
if Kira sees right through this.

373
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,136
-Hmm.

374
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,970
Your son's clever, isn't he?

375
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:25,936
-Huh.

376
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,470
Well, yes.

377
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,136
LIGHT: Thanks for dinner, Mom.

378
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:29,970
SACHIKO YAGAMI: Huh?

379
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,670
You're eating a bag of chips?

380
00:16:31,703 --> 00:16:32,736
You just had dinner.

381
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,236
Your good looks are
going to go down

382
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,503
the drain if you keep that up.

383
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,436
LIGHT: It's a late-night
snack for studying.

384
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,570
-I think that's it, Light.

385
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:45,536
I found every camera
they put in the house.

386
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,303
I guess Shinigami get
tired when they work hard.

387
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:51,270
Now let me explain
where they all are.

388
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,703
It's a little bit
complicated, so listen up.

389
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:57,303
There's nothing I hate more
than explaining something twice.

390
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:58,236
-All right.

391
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,270
It's time for me
to hit the books.

392
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:02,703
RYUK: There sure are a lot
of cameras in this room.

393
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:05,336
I counted 64 in total.

394
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,170
I guess whoever put
them here expected

395
00:17:07,203 --> 00:17:09,236
you to at least
find some of them.

396
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,736
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
It has to be L.

397
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,836
He had no qualms about putting
a death row inmate in his place

398
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,636
when he declared war on me.

399
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,170
It's pretty clear he
doesn't know any limits.

400
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,236
-Ah, what I want
to know is how am I

401
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,536
going to be able to eat apples?

402
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,703
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Obviously,
that's impossible now,

403
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:24,203
isn't it?

404
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:25,136
-Oh, yeah.

405
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,503
I guess you can't talk in here.

406
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:30,303
But we'd better discuss
this outside tomorrow.

407
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:31,403
-OK.

408
00:17:31,436 --> 00:17:33,370
I think I'm getting
the hang of this now.

409
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,503
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Judging
by the number of cameras

410
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:37,636
he's planted, he's
planning to make a decision

411
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,803
within a short period of time.

412
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:42,703
Any normal person would slip
under these circumstances.

413
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:44,614
But it won't be
that easy with me,

414
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,847
L. This is the closest you get!

415
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,214
I've set things up so that
criminals will continue

416
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,314
to die over the
next three weeks.

417
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:08,380
L is aware by now
that Kira can control

418
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:10,380
the times of death
of his victims.

419
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:12,780
Therefore, to avoid
suspicion he'll

420
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:15,280
need to see the criminals
whose names are being broadcast

421
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:19,047
continue to die while I have
no access to that information.

422
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
-Oh!

423
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:22,680
The symptoms are starting!

424
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:25,080
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I'm gonna show you, L.

425
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:29,814
[music playing]

426
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:33,014
With Ryuk's information
and my preparations,

427
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:36,014
I can continue to kill criminals
whose names are broadcast

428
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:39,114
on the news while masquerading
as a typical high school

429
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:42,714
student studying for
his entrance exams.

430
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,314
Just watch me, L. I'll solve
equations with my right hand

431
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:50,247
and write names with my left.

432
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,014
I'll take a potato
chip and eat it!

433
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:56,947
[music playing]

434
00:19:05,214 --> 00:19:06,780
-After dinner, your
son just goes back

435
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:10,114
to studying without turning
on the TV or his computer?

436
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:13,180
-It's because the entrance
exams are five days away.

437
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,780
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Now, a criminal

438
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:26,414
who I should have
no knowledge of will

439
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:29,514
die of a heart
attack in 40 seconds.

440
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:32,580
And the witness to my
alibi is L himself.

441
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:38,714
-All right.

442
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:39,914
Just a little bit longer.

443
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:46,947
-Ryuzaki.

444
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,614
-Yes?

445
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:49,080
What is it, Watari?

446
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:51,480
-A few minutes ago, a bank
clerk being questioned

447
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:54,014
on suspicion of embezzlement
and a purse-snatcher being

448
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:57,480
held in a detention center
were broadcast on the news.

449
00:19:57,514 --> 00:20:01,680
They both just died of sudden,
inexplicable heart attacks.

450
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:03,480
-It's him again.

451
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:05,714
-While all that was
happening at your home,

452
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,547
your wife and daughter
were watching television.

453
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,447
When that was over,
they turned the TV off

454
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,047
and didn't want
anything afterwards.

455
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,714
From just about 7:30
until now, 11 o'clock,

456
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,880
your son's done
nothing but study.

457
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,914
Kira needs a name and a face.

458
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:21,980
Without those, he can't kill.

459
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,014
So I suppose anyone who
didn't watch the news

460
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,280
can't be Kira, right?

461
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:27,414
-You said it yourself.

462
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,414
That means my family
has been cleared.

463
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:32,914
It doesn't make sense that Kira
would kill two petty criminals

464
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:36,647
right after their
identities were broadcast.

465
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,980
I know it's only the first
day after the cameras were

466
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:40,680
installed, but the
Yagami household

467
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:42,880
seems almost too innocent to me.

468
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:43,380
Hmm.

469
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:50,047
SACHIKO YAGAMI:
Light, are you up yet?

470
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,114
-Yeah, I'm awake.

471
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:53,947
-Today's garbage day,
so if you've got any,

472
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,147
bring it down with you, OK?

473
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,047
-What a pain.

474
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,947
SACHIKO YAGAMI: What
are you talking about?

475
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,580
You usually say, there's
no need to remind me, Mom.

476
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:04,347
-Yeah, yeah.

477
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:11,180
Another beautiful day.

478
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:14,314
-Well, I can't say for sure
whether you are extremely

479
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:19,114
generous or just a spoiled brat,
but didn't that mini LCD TV

480
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:19,780
cost you $400?

481
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:24,614
-Good morning.

482
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,980
[music playing]

483
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:57,672
LIGHT: Perfect.

484
00:22:57,705 --> 00:22:59,638
There's no reason
for me to be worried.

485
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:03,000
After all, this is proof that
they don't have anything on me yet.

486
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:06,111
So this whole thing is nothing
more than a contest between L

487
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:08,811
and I, a battle of wits.
