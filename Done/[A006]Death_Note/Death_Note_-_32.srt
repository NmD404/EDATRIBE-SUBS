00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:38,837
-Delete.

3
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,304
Delete!

4
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:41,778
Delete!

NARRATOR: The average
Japanese adult

6
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:54,304
would say that Teru
Mikami was a child

7
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:56,570
with a strong sense of justice.

8
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:58,970
He was able to distinguish
right from wrong better

9
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:00,937
than any of his peers.

10
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,704
And compared to the
average Japanese person,

11
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:06,904
Teru had been through and
seen far worse miseries,

12
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:08,370
and even witnessed death.

Get it.

17
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:04,904
MIKAMI (VOICEOVER):
In this world,

18
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:07,170
there is only good and evil.

19
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:09,137
That was one of the
first universal truths

20
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,304
I grasped from observing
the world around me

21
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:13,104
when I was a child.

22
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:15,170
Every human being,
without exception,

23
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:17,837
ends up falling into one
category or the other.

24
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:23,637
Even those in innocent years
of elementary school, one

25
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,637
could not escape that fact.

26
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,370
As class president, I strived
to achieve great things

27
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:32,137
for my fellow students, but
there were always enemies.

28
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,370
Good against evil.

29
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,537
-No!

30
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,237
Stop!

31
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,470
Let go of me, please!

32
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,670
MIKAMI (VOICEOVER): Evil
has to be confronted.

33
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:43,937
-What do you want, nerd?

34
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:48,270
MIKAMI (VOICEOVER):
There were times

35
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:52,104
when it seemed evil
would triumph over good.

36
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:54,070
But no matter what
happened to me,

37
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:56,904
I felt happy for one reason.

38
00:03:56,937 --> 00:04:00,170
-Thank you, Teru.

39
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:02,337
MIKAMI (VOICEOVER): Hearing
those words of gratitude

40
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,737
from the victims made me want
to save them again and again.

41
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,270
For that reason, I
never spared any effort.

42
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:13,937
And in the end, I
was able to stand up

43
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,237
for my sense of justice.

44
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,604
[snickering]

45
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:21,104
-Does this bug you?

46
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,004
MIKAMI (VOICEOVER):
But that was only true

47
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,037
in the world of children.

48
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:42,070
Middle school was
another matter entirely.

49
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:46,004
The more I confronted evil,
the more enemies I had to face.

50
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:50,537
Victims would
become participants,

51
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,504
and even the people watching
would be influenced by evil

52
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:55,070
and become enemies themselves.

53
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:02,604
But for justice to triumph,
it requires action.

54
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:07,804
So I realized, to serve
justice, I had to delete evil.

55
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:11,737
The only person who understood
my hopes and remained my ally

56
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,537
was the woman who
raised me on her own.

57
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,504
My mother.

58
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:17,404
No.

59
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:19,704
Rather, it used to be my mother.

60
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,304
WOMAN: Teru, not
everything in the world

61
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:28,404
is going to work the
way you want it to.

62
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:29,904
You have to stop doing this.

63
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:31,370
There's no reason
for you to suffer

64
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:32,870
so much for your beliefs.

65
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:36,404
What do you think you're
proving getting hurt like this?

66
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,304
This is plain foolishness.

67
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,304
You have to do

68
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:41,970
MIKAMI (VOICEOVER):
My mother was wrong.

69
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:45,237
She didn't side with justice.

70
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,137
She was one of those who
deserved to be deleted.

71
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,070
That was when the
miracle happened.

72
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:56,570
Four of the worst
delinquents from my school

73
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:59,637
lost control of their car
while they were joyriding.

74
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,037
They died instantly.

75
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,570
One bystander was
killed as well.

76
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:07,604
That bystander was my mother.

77
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,104
In one fell swoop, all
the people I resented

78
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,970
had been deleted.

79
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,404
At first, I was terrified.

80
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:17,004
I couldn't stop shivering.

81
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:19,437
But then it hit me.

82
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,304
With these people
out of the picture,

83
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:24,070
how many others would
benefit as a result?

84
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:26,570
Clearly their victims
were relieved.

85
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:27,937
But beyond that.

86
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,770
Would'nt everyone in my class
be happier now that they were

87
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:32,004
gone?

88
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,137
And sure enough, I was right.

89
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,370
Our classroom became a
peaceful, joyful place.

90
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:42,204
There will always
consequences f evil deeds.

91
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:44,404
That is the way the world is.

92
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,304
The way it should be.

93
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:51,704
Evil must be deleted.

94
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:53,670
Now then, let's see.

95
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,804
Are there any more problems
with these records?

96
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:56,937
-No, they're fine.

97
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,404
MIKAMI (VOICEOVER):
With every passing year,

98
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:01,037
my commitment to justice
only grew stronger.

99
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,937
I saw that there
will always be those

100
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,270
who have no reason to exist.

101
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:09,337
Those whose very existence
is a threat to society.

102
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,370
And the closer they grew to
adulthood, the less likely

103
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:15,004
was that they would ever reform.

104
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:16,504
They could only be deleted.

105
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,670
Mysteriously, every time
I judged someone as evil,

106
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:28,670
they would soon
be taken care of.

107
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:30,170
Was it coincidence?

108
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:32,270
Was I special somehow?

109
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:35,304
In the end, it didn't matter.

110
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:38,070
Divine judgment must
be brought up evil.

111
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:41,237
And if it isn't, then someone
must take it upon themselves

112
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,904
to punish evil.

113
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:46,137
That's why I became
a prosecutor.

114
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,037
It is the role of
the prosecutor to see

115
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,970
that evil is brought to justice.

116
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:53,570
It was an ideal job for me.

117
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:58,804
And then God came before me.

118
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:01,104
Everything that had
been happening around me

119
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:03,104
wasn't coincidence.

120
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:04,804
It was divine justice.

121
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,504
God had been watching me.

122
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,870
God had seen how I did
not surrender to evil.

123
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:17,770
He reached out his
hand and punished

124
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:20,004
the evil people for me.

125
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:22,704
Once I realized that, I
started to frequent places

126
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,904
where God was bound
to be watching.

127
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:25,770
And then it happened.

128
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:34,837
God recognized me as
I had always hoped!

129
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,704
Not only that, but he found
me worthy of sharing his power

130
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:38,804
to eliminate evil!

131
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:45,870
With this, it doesn't matter
if I can't hear his voice.

132
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:50,437
I shall figure out what Kira
wants and carry out his will.

133
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,837
Delete.

134
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,970
Delete.

135
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:54,204
Delete.

136
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:55,170
Delete.

137
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:56,604
Delete.

138
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:57,104
Delete.

139
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,070
Delete.

140
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,004
Delete.

141
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:01,404
Delete.

142
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:01,904
Delete.

143
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,304
Delete.

144
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,183
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Mikami made the choice

145
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:24,083
to kill Demegawa himself.

146
00:09:24,116 --> 00:09:25,550
I never requested it.

147
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,483
An understandable move, but
now there's no spokesperson.

148
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,383
Kira needs a voice.

149
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,516
At the moment, I can't
make any moves myself.

150
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,216
What will he do?

151
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,283
-Kira isn't saying anything.

152
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:40,816
He must be in a situation
where he can't move freely.

153
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,883
But this is an
important time for him.

154
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,550
We need a spokesperson to
spread his word to the people.

155
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,883
Then I will take the initiative.

156
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,350
-Extra, extra!

157
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,416
There's a new development
in the Kira case.

158
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,616
He's chosen a new spokesperson
to take Demegawa's place.

159
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,150
Take a look.

160
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:03,716
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): That woman.

161
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:09,616
Kiyomi Takada

162
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,450
-Good evening.

163
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:13,550
This is Kiyomi
Takada from News 6.

164
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,650
Starting today, it will be my
duty to spread the word of Kira

165
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:17,983
accurately and quickly.

166
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,716
From now on, NHN will fairly--

167
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,383
MATSUDA: So he picked
NHN's star newscaster, huh?

168
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,650
Kira's got good taste.

169
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:28,283
Choosing Taki was a good idea.

170
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,816
-(VOICEOVER) There's
no mistaking it.

171
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,016
That's the girl that
Light dated in university.

172
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,516
KIYOMI: --but also his liaison
with the people of the world.

173
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,450
-You've moved quickly, Mikami.

174
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:38,150
However, it won't
take them long to find

175
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:41,283
the connection between us,
which could be a problem.

176
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,350
No.

177
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:44,083
On second thought,
she's not a bad choice.

178
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:46,383
It's one I never would have
considered, since I already

179
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,483
knew her.

180
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,716
But this could actually
make things easier.

181
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,483
I can definitely
use her, but I'll

182
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:54,683
have to find a way
to contact her soon.

183
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:55,783
(VOICEOVER) Kiyomi Takada.

184
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,716
I had a chance to meet her when
I was part of a debate program

185
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,183
she was hosting.

186
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:04,016
She was a shrewd and fair
host for the most part,

187
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,483
but her attitude
changed suddenly

188
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:07,216
when Kira's name was mentioned.

189
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,683
She had a uniquely
rigid sense of justice

190
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:11,450
that I could identify with.

191
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,816
She hates crimes and social
evils with a passion.

192
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,650
I talked with her privately
several times after that.

193
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:19,483
She clearly supports Kira.

194
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:21,450
But it's more than that.

195
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:23,583
She thinks like Kira.

196
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,650
That makes her the
broadcaster most worthy

197
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:28,216
of being the new voice of Kira.

198
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,283
-(VOICEOVER) Kiyomi Takada.

199
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:36,950
It'd to be too
suspicious for Kira

200
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,483
to choose an ex-girlfriend
as his representative.

201
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:43,216
And there's been no sign of
Light sending her any messages.

202
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,883
Maybe I'm thinking
about this too much.

203
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,750
-Everyone, I just had an idea.

204
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,983
I was thinking we could
make use of Kiyomi Takada.

205
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:54,683
To be honest, I know her.

206
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:56,883
Back in university,
she and I were actually

207
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,316
dating for a little while.

208
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,183
-Whoa.

209
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:00,450
-(VOICEOVER) So he admits it.

210
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:02,950
He has no intention to
hide the connection.

211
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,883
-If she's acting as
his spokesperson,

212
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,283
she must be receiving
orders from him.

213
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:09,283
She's in contact
with Kira somehow.

214
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:11,216
I think our best bet is
to use that connection

215
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,883
to find a way to
Kira through her.

216
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:13,916
[growl]

217
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,083
MATSUDA: But Taki's
probably doing it

218
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:16,783
because Kira's
threatening her, right?

219
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,816
She might be too scared to help
us out with her investigation.

220
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,350
IDE: That's a good point.

221
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:23,283
-I'm not too worried about that.

222
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:24,916
I know her current
cell phone number.

223
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,983
I'm pretty sure that I'll
be able to convince her

224
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:27,950
once we get talking.

225
00:12:27,983 --> 00:12:30,116
She'll meet with
me if I ask her to.

226
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,883
-Ha ha.

227
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,650
Wow.

228
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:32,916
Listen to this guy.

229
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,450
You're the man, Light.

230
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,650
-Talking to her will be
easy, but the real challenge

231
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,550
will be to get her to help
us find and arrest Kira.

232
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,483
We used to talk about a
lot of different topics

233
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:44,883
while we were in college,
and one thing was clear.

234
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,250
She worships Kira.

235
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:52,183
But we might be able to
use that to our advantage.

236
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:54,850
The police claim they
support Kira, but aren't

237
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:56,883
doing anything one
way or the other.

238
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,683
So I'll reveal that
I've joined the police,

239
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,250
and ask her what we can
do to help Kira further.

240
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:04,450
To her, it'll sound
like a good idea.

241
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,516
We can convince her to
assist us as long as we

242
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,250
pretend it's for Kira's benefit.

243
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,116
-Do you think
that'll go over well?

244
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,350
-I'm not entirely sure.

245
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:13,950
But it's worth a try, at least.

246
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:15,216
-I agree.

247
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,350
It'd be foolish for us to
pass up a lead like this.

248
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:20,050
-In that case, I'll
call her tonight.

249
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,650
AIZAWA: Light.

250
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,216
If you don't mind,
I'd like to listen

251
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,883
in on your conversation
with Ms. Takada.

252
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,116
-Of course.

253
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,516
That's fine with me.

254
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,183
Actually, it's better if you do.

255
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,750
If she lets slip
something about Kira,

256
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:33,750
it would be best if more
than one of us was listening.

257
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,183
-Uh-- yeah.

258
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:43,850
[phone ringing]

259
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:44,950
-Yes, Hello?

260
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:45,650
LIGHT: Kiyomi?

261
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:47,416
This is Light Yagami.

262
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,483
-Light?

263
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:49,116
Hi.

264
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,183
It's been a while.

265
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:51,383
What's going on?

266
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,750
-Kiyomi, I have something
important to tell you.

267
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:56,516
Could we meet somewhere?

268
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,350
I have a favor to ask you.

269
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,250
KIYOMI: A favor?

270
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:01,116
-Yeah.

271
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,750
I know my timing is pretty bad.

272
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:05,416
I mean, you're the woman the
whole world is watching right

273
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,283
now, so it might
not be possible.

274
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:10,383
-Don't play innocent and
humble with me, Light.

275
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,950
You wouldn't have
called if you didn't

276
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:14,283
think it was possible to see me.

277
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:16,483
LIGHT: You're right.

278
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:19,483
Ever since we graduated, I
wanted to talk to you again,

279
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:21,483
but I never had the chance.

280
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:24,583
And now it looks like our
jobs have brought us together.

281
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:27,516
After so much time, our paths
are about to cross again.

282
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,016
Call me crazy, but I
feel like this is fate.

283
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,083
-What do you mean, our jobs?

284
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:34,750
LIGHT: I'm working
with the police now.

285
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:37,183
That was part of what I
wanted to talk to you about.

286
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:38,750
In person.

287
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:40,283
-The police aren't
doing anything

288
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:43,650
to defy Kira at this point.

289
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,616
All right.

290
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,050
I may be able to
help you, depending

291
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,550
on what you're asking for.

292
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,950
-I appreciate it.

293
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:52,550
At the very least, I just want
you to hear what I have to say.

294
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,050
Anywhere.

295
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:54,950
Just us two.

296
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,450
-Well, OK then.

297
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,983
After tonight's
broadcast is finished.

298
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:02,983
-That sounds perfect.

299
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:05,783
I'll book a hotel room for us.

300
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:07,016
KIYOMI: A hotel room?

301
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,650
Are you sure?

302
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:12,716
The last I heard, you were
still living with Miss Amane.

303
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,483
Are things not going to
well on the home front?

304
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:18,150
LIGHT: Well, to
be honest, Misa's

305
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:22,383
just not intelligent
enough to be my partner.

306
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,016
MISA: Motchi.

307
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,850
-Yes?

308
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,083
-Your cooking is really good.

309
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:28,816
And I appreciate that you're
doing everything for me,

310
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,083
but it's been five days now.

311
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:31,450
-Right.

312
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:33,016
-Light doesn't know about you
hanging around all the time,

313
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,083
does he?

314
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,716
I'm beginning to get
a really bad feeling

315
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,816
about this whole thing.

316
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,016
-Uh-huh.

317
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,483
MISA: I mean, I know that
Light trusts me totally,

318
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:41,016
but don't you think
most people would

319
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,383
start saying I'm
cheating on him?

320
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,450
Oh, he'd be so jealous.

321
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:47,283
-Near and the others
told me that this woman

322
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,050
is supposed to be
the second Kira.

323
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,016
But it could really be this
unbelievably stupid girl?

324
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:59,150
-It seems that Kira still
hasn't tried to contact me yet.

325
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:00,850
If he's in a
situation where he's

326
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:03,316
unable to contact me
even if he wants to,

327
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,183
then the next best
thing would be for him

328
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:06,683
to contact Takada instead.

329
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,083
-Good evening, this
is the 9:00 news.

330
00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:15,883
First, I have an announcement
that comes directly from Kira.

331
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,650
His words are to become
the new law of the world.

332
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:20,150
Kira will never
forgive those people

333
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:22,550
whose existence is
a threat to justice.

334
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,483
But he will also
not forgive those

335
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,950
who live wastefully, and
refuse to use their abilities

336
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:29,583
to contribute to the
betterment of society.

337
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:30,650
-What?

338
00:16:30,683 --> 00:16:32,883
So Kira's going to
kill lazy people now?

339
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,250
-You're kidding me.

340
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:36,450
-(VOICEOVER) You're taking
this too far, Mikami.

341
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:38,816
It's too early to be making
those kinds of statements.

342
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,950
I've got to get a
hold of him soon.

343
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,950
-Matsuda, how is it?

344
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:44,950
-Good.

345
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:47,883
Audio and video
online, no blind spots.

346
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:48,716
-Until next time--

347
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,516
-The 9:00 news is just saying.

348
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,516
-Everything's in order.

349
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,850
I'll head back to HQ.

350
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:53,350
-OK.

351
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:06,683
[knocking]

352
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,816
-I missed you.

353
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,316
-Huh?

354
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,616
LIGHT: Um, I'm sorry.

355
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,916
It's just-- anyway,
please, sit down.

356
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:43,216
To be honest, it
doesn't seem like that

357
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,983
long since we last
saw each other.

358
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:00,383
-What the hell is Light doing?

359
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,050
He's not saying anything.

360
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,583
If he just stays silent,
she'll get suspicious.

361
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,850
-Come on.

362
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,950
Don't tell me you've never
been in love before, Ide.

363
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:08,550
-What?

364
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,850
-How's it going?

365
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:11,016
-The mood's perfect.

366
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,083
-That's not what I meant.

367
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:12,916
[buzzing]

368
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,250
-Huh?

369
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:16,550
[buzzing]

370
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,916
-Please excuse me.

371
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,416
Kira.

372
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,850
(VOICEOVER) Is it Mikami?

373
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:25,816
-She just said it's Kira.

374
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,750
-Kira's contacting her directly?

375
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,250
-You should answer it.

376
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,916
-Um, right.

377
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,150
Hello.

378
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:36,050
No, I'm with a friend right now.

379
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,450
Yes, we're alone.

380
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,883
-(VOICEOVER) If
luck is on my side,

381
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,750
I can get on the phone myself.

382
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:43,516
Well, Mikami, can
you make it happen?

383
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,916
TAKADA: He wanted to
meet me all of a sudden.

384
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,250
-(VOICEOVER) Someone who
requests a private meeting with

385
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:50,350
Kira's spokesperson.

386
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:52,650
I'd like to speak
with him, if I may.

387
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:54,883
[gasp]

388
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,150
-He said the he wants
to speak to you.

389
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:58,350
-(VOICEOVER) Perfect.

390
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:02,316
I was right to
choose you, Mikami.

391
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,016
-She's passed the
phone to Light.

392
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,883
-It could be dangerous
if he's the real thing.

393
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:07,383
-Yes?

394
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,516
Hello?

395
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,683
MIKAMI (MODIFIED VOICE):
Who am I speaking to?

396
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:13,683
-Five pages on November 26th?

397
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:14,916
I don't get it.

398
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,750
What do you mean?

399
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,183
-You're God!

400
00:19:19,216 --> 00:19:21,316
-(VOICEOVER) You're
doing well, Mikami.

401
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,150
Let's just see how much
you can figure out.

402
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:24,483
MIKAMI (MODIFIED VOICE): Got it.

403
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:26,383
You're not free to
speak right now.

404
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,750
-Yes.

405
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:28,916
MIKAMI (MODIFIED VOICE): You're
being watched at the moment.

406
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,016
-Yes.

407
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,850
But how can I trust
you're the real Kira?

408
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:35,483
MIKAMI (VOICEOVER): Is he asking
me to judge someone right now?

409
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:36,616
Turn to Sakura TV!

410
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,516
-What's that?

411
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,483
Sakura TV?

412
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:39,150
-Quick.

413
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:41,216
Let's check it out.

414
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,416
-We'll invite Kira back to our
program no matter what it might

415
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,150
take--

416
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:47,550
-He died!

417
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,616
IDE: This is bad.

418
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,516
He's the real thing.

419
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,583
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Mikami.

420
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:52,316
You're even better
than I expected.

421
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:55,783
MATSUDA: What?

422
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:57,916
He's removing the bugs?

423
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,883
-We don't have a choice.

424
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,183
-I don't understand.

425
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:05,683
What's going on?

426
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,016
-Now I can talk without
any constraints.

427
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,516
-What?

428
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,016
-Listen, Kiyomi.

429
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,716
I am the real Kira.

430
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,850
That's right.

431
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,283
I'm Kira.

432
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,083
That's what I
wanted to tell you.

433
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:23,950
KIYOMI (VOICEOVER):
Light is Kira?

434
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:24,983
-Listen.

435
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,950
I won't allow you to
ask Kiyomi who I am.

436
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,383
You don't need to
know my identity.

437
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,283
-Yes.

438
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:33,583
I'll leave the rest to you, God.

439
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:34,883
-Do you understand?

440
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,616
I am Kira.

441
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,216
The man who was on the
phone is one of my followers

442
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,683
who I've shared my power with.

443
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:44,583
-I-- I can't believe it's you.

444
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:47,083
You were the only man
I ever really admired.

445
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:50,950
To be honest, the only man I
ever felt a connection with.

446
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:54,516
And now to find you're
Kira-- it's incredible.

447
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,216
-Please, join me,
Kiyomi, and you

448
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,316
will be the goddess
of the New World.

449
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,316
-Oh, Light.

450
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,583
[phone ringing]

451
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:15,416
-Light, are you OK?

452
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,583
-Yeah.

453
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:19,216
Kiyomi was able to work
things out with Kira.

454
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,850
I've decided that
from now on, I'm

455
00:21:20,883 --> 00:21:22,750
going to pretend
to be dating her.

456
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,683
We might be able to
find Kira that way.

457
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:27,150
-Delete.

458
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:28,183
Delete.

459
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:29,083
Delete.

460
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:31,850
Delete Delete.

461
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:32,350
Delete!

462
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:42,748
[theme music]

463
00:22:50,617 --> 00:22:52,583
LIGHT: Come to think
of it, it's always

464
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:54,450
been a one on one
battle between myself

465
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:56,398
and L. It's been going
on since the beginning.

466
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:57,465
Alright, Near.

467
00:22:57,498 --> 00:22:58,298
Fine.

468
00:22:58,331 --> 00:23:00,065
I'll come out if you come out.

469
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:02,431
I'll accept your challenge.
