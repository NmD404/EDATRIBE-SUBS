[theme music]

2
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:51,461
INVESTIGATOR: Regarding
Naomi Misura's disappearance,

3
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:53,627
shouldn't we open an
investigation into this matter?

4
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:55,727
L: If we do, it should
be coordinated separately

5
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:56,894
from the Kira case.

6
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:58,961
Also, we'll have to use
police sketches instead

7
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,894
of actual photos.

8
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,027
-We're talking
about someone who's

9
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:02,661
been missing for
four months already.

10
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:05,461
Chances are, she's
probably dead.

11
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:07,394
-If you're right about
that, I find it odd

12
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,627
that we haven't
found her body yet.

13
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,861
If we did, it might provide
us with some much needed

14
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:12,594
physical evidence.

15
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:13,661
[knocking]

16
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:14,694
WATARI: Ryuzaki.

17
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:15,827
-Hmm?

18
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:19,227
-Something seems to be
happening on Sakura TV.

19
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,427
-In other words, all of
the reporters and staff

20
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:22,994
here are Kira's hostages.

21
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:25,194
Aside from that, we have
a professional obligation

22
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:26,894
to share this message with you.

23
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,694
I assure you that
this is not a hoax

24
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:31,027
and that Sakura TV is
not airing this tape

25
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:33,294
for the purposes
of sensationalism.

26
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:34,694
INVESTIGATOR: Kira's hostages?

27
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:36,227
What is this?

28
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:38,227
ANCHOR (TV): Four days
ago, our program director

29
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:40,994
here at Sakura TV
received four tapes.

30
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,561
After a thorough
examination, there

31
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:45,027
could be no doubt that
they are from Kira himself.

32
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,394
DIRECTOR (VOICEOVER):
Our audience

33
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:50,461
ratings should go up 60--
no, more like 70% after this.

34
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:52,061
ANCHOR (TV): The
first tape we received

35
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,927
contained a prediction regarding
the time of death of two

36
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,761
suspected criminals who'd
recently been arrested.

37
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:01,194
And as predicted, at the exact
time that Kira had specified,

38
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:03,394
both men died suddenly of
heart attacks yesterday.

39
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:05,494
L (VOICEOVER): If what
they're saying is true,

40
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,327
it's clearly something
that only Kira could do.

41
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:09,794
ANCHOR (TV): Kira
has instructed us

42
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:13,894
to air this second tape
today at exactly 5:59 PM.

43
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,361
And we do intend to
comply with his demands.

44
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:18,294
This tape should offer
proof of his powers

45
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:20,394
by predicting yet another death.

46
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:22,761
Beyond that, we understand
that it contains a message

47
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:24,694
to all the people of
the world from Kira.

48
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:27,527
--[gasp] Th--this has to be
another fake, don't you think?

49
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:28,861
-I doubt it.

50
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:31,994
I'm pretty sure even Sakura
TV wouldn't stoop that low.

51
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:33,294
ANCHOR (TV): And now, the video.

52
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:42,461
DISTORTED VOICE (TV):
[clearing throat] I am Kira.

53
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:46,527
If this video was being aired
on April 18 at exactly 5:59

54
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:54,427
PM as I requested, then the
time now is 5:59:47, 48, 49.

55
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:56,761
Please change the
channel to Taiyou TV.

56
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,994
The news anchor,
Mr. Kazuhi Kohibima,

57
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:01,627
will die of a heart attack
at exactly 6 o'clock.

58
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,127
[gasp]

59
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:02,661
-What?

60
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:04,961
-Change it.

61
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,927
[gasp]

62
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:07,761
INVESTIGATOR: It can't be.

63
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:08,361
-What happened?

64
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:09,361
-He's not moving.

65
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:11,761
-How could he?

66
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,261
-Change the channel back.

67
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,361
[beep]

68
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:16,527
And I need you to bring
us another TV, Watari.

69
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:17,994
No, make it two.

70
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:18,927
WATARI: Yes.

71
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:19,994
DISTORTED VOICE
(TV): --punishment.

72
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,094
I will present you
with another victim.

73
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:25,161
My next target is NHN
TV commentator Mr. Saeji

74
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:28,894
Komaizumi, who is scheduled
to appear in a live broadcast.

75
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:30,927
He too has dared to defy Kira.

76
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:31,861
INVESTIGATOR: Ryuzaki?

77
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:34,394
-Change it to channel 24.

78
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:35,061
[gasp]

79
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:35,994
-Someone help him!

80
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,794
L: Please change it back.

81
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:40,394
DISTORTED VOICE (TV): Now that
you've seen proof of my powers,

82
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:43,461
you should have no trouble
believing that I am Kira.

83
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:44,961
L (VOICEOVER): Kira
said that he was

84
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:47,627
going to send a message to
the people of the world.

85
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:49,694
[gasp] Stop this broadcast!

86
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:52,327
We can't let him finish!

87
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,161
-Get Sakura TV on the line!

88
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,361
-It's no good.

89
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:58,361
I'm trying, but none of
my contacts at the station

90
00:04:58,394 --> 00:04:59,494
have their phones on.

91
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,161
-And nobody's picking
up at reception, either.

92
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:02,994
-Damn it!

93
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:03,761
And

94
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:05,094
-Ah, Ukita--

95
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:08,427
-I'll stop this broadcast
myself if that's what it takes.

96
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:11,694
DISTORTED VOICE (TV): People of
the world, please listen to me.

97
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,461
The last thing I want to
do is kill the innocent.

98
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,861
I hate evil and love justice.

99
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:19,427
I've always thought of
the police as allies,

100
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:20,594
not as enemies.

101
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:24,894
L (VOICEOVER): Damn you, Kira.

102
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:26,561
DISTORTED VOICE (TV):
I intend to create

103
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,494
a new world, a perfect world
that is free from evil.

104
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:31,061
If you agree to join
me in my mission,

105
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:33,227
I know we can make it happen.

106
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:35,627
And as long as no one
tries to catch me,

107
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,627
I promise that the
innocent will not die.

108
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:38,927
-Come on!

109
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:41,527
DISTORTED VOICE (TV): Even
if you don't agree with me,

110
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,261
all I ask is that
you not publicize

111
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:44,327
your views in the media.

112
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:47,361
If you can do that,
you will be spared.

113
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:50,527
All you have to do
now is be patient.

114
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:54,194
I will create a better
world that we can all enjoy.

115
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:56,894
Say goodbye to the
world as you know it.

116
00:05:56,927 --> 00:06:00,394
Soon, we'll have a new world
ruled by benevolence, inhabited

117
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,694
with kind-hearted,
honest people.

118
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:06,427
Try to imagine it, a world
where the police and I--

119
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:09,394
-Hmm?

120
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:09,894
Sachiko.

121
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:16,394
-Darling, this can't be
good for your health.

122
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:17,461
Please, you have to rest.

123
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,061
-Sachiko, like it
or not, I am still

124
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:27,794
in charge of the
Kira task force.

125
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:29,761
[sigh]

126
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:40,261
-Damn, it's locked!

127
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:42,161
This is the police!

128
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,861
Open up!

129
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,561
Ah, you-- you idiots!

130
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:50,561
[groaning, hearteat]

131
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,794
-Hello?

132
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:09,761
REPORTER (TV): We interrupt
this program to bring you live--

133
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:10,761
-Damn, I'm still
not getting through.

134
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:11,827
REPORTER (TV):
--Sakura TV studios.

135
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:13,661
-[gasp] Aizawa, look!

136
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:14,161
-Huh?

137
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:19,694
[gasp]

138
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,061
REPORTER (TV): As
you can see, someone

139
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:22,994
has collapsed just
outside the door.

140
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:26,894
Again, we're coming to you live
from the Sakura TV building.

141
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:31,161
AIZAWA: Ukita-- damn
it, Kira did this.

142
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:34,827
-[grumble] Mr. Aizawa.

143
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,827
Where are you going?

144
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:37,694
-Where do you think?

145
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,027
I've got to go there.

146
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:39,994
-You can't.

147
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,094
Please, think about
this rationally.

148
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:45,127
-(ANGRILY) What, you want me
to just sit here and watch TV?

149
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,927
-If this truly is
the work of Kira,

150
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,827
you'll just meet the same
fate if you go there.

151
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:53,061
-You told us that Kira
couldn't kill without a name.

152
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:55,094
So how could this happen?

153
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,894
The aliases and fake
police IDs are worthless.

154
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,194
What are we going to do, L?

155
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,961
You don't think Kira has all
our names already, do you?

156
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:04,694
-That's a definite possibility.

157
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,127
However, if that's
the case, you'd

158
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,861
think it would be easier for
him to kill off the entire task

159
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:10,694
force before making a move.

160
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:13,727
Initially, I deduced that Kira
needed both a name and a face

161
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,694
to kill.

162
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,461
But from what we've
just seen, I'd

163
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:18,227
say it's not entirely
impossible that Kira

164
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:21,527
can kill with only a face.

165
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:25,027
All I know for sure is that Kira
is either in that TV station,

166
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:27,761
or he's somewhere close
by, in a place where

167
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:30,127
he can watch everyone
who enters the building.

168
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,227
Perhaps he's in an--

169
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,361
-If Kira is in the area,
then isn't that why

170
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:35,094
we should get down there?

171
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:37,661
L: For all we know, he could
have just placed surveillance

172
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:38,861
cameras in the area.

173
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,894
If we rush down there
unprepared, all of us

174
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:42,227
will be killed.

175
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:44,227
-Wasn't it you who said we'd
have to risk our lives to catch

176
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:45,561
Kira?

177
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:48,961
-I meant what I said, but
risking my life to catch Kira

178
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,194
and doing something that I
know will cost me my life

179
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:52,827
are two entirely
different things.

180
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:53,494
-Oh yeah?

181
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:00,327
-Please control yourself.

182
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,627
We've lost Ukita.

183
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:04,627
I understand you
want to go there,

184
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:06,594
but if something was to
happen to you as well--

185
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:13,161
-I now await a response
from the police.

186
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:14,794
They must decide
whether or not they'll

187
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:17,094
help me create a better
world for all of us.

188
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:19,394
Please announce your decision
on the 6 o'clock news

189
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:20,794
in four days.

190
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,027
I've prepared two
videos, one to be

191
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:27,494
aired if the answer is yes and
another if the answer is no.

192
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:28,994
[sigh]

193
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,461
[gasp]

194
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:35,961
[growl]

195
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:36,461
-Huh?

196
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:44,427
[scream]

197
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:50,594
What the hell's going on?

198
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:53,894
Hey, step out of the vehicle!

199
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,294
Huh?

200
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:56,694
-The Kira video.

201
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:59,261
Show me which studio they're
broadcasting it from.

202
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:00,627
REPORTER (TV): A
vehicle has just

203
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,861
driven through the front
doors of the station.

204
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,194
-Well, that's one way
to get into the building

205
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:07,661
without being seen by Kira.

206
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:10,361
INVESTIGATOR: But who would--

207
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:11,394
-This is the police.

208
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:12,727
Stop this broadcast immediately.

209
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,461
-Who are you?

210
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:15,894
-Hand those tapes over to me.

211
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:16,894
Do you understand?

212
00:10:16,927 --> 00:10:17,761
-Hold on, officer.

213
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:19,127
It's not that simple.

214
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,661
My hands are tied here.

215
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:23,761
If we stop this broadcast,
he'll kill all of us.

216
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:24,894
-Shut up.

217
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,527
You're going to be
killed right here and now

218
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,394
if you don't give
those tapes to me.

219
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,594
-What?

220
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:31,161
Come on, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

221
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:32,094
This is crazy.

222
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,310
-This is happening because you
chose to make Kira a celebrity.

223
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,710
You're getting exactly
what you deserve.

224
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:53,977
I want every single
copy you have,

225
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,510
and don't make me ask you again.

226
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,110
-I-I got it.

227
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:58,377
I'll give them to you.

228
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,444
No problem.

229
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:01,377
Just please, stop
waving that gun around.

230
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,710
You're acting like a madman.

231
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:06,577
REPORTER (TV): We're
still outside Sakura TV.

232
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,910
As you can see, a police
car has just arrived.

233
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:10,644
-So we're not alone.

234
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:12,310
There are still other
officers out there

235
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:14,077
who are willing to
stand up to Kira.

236
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,677
L: Mr. Aizawa.

237
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,310
-Huh?

238
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:18,610
-You know Deputy Director
Kitamura's cell phone number,

239
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,477
right?

240
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,377
[phone ringing]

241
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,777
-Aizawa, I told you not
to call me on this phone.

242
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,777
L (ON PHONE): This is L.

243
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,044
[gasp]

244
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:30,677
L (ON PHONE): There's something
I need you to do for me.

245
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,977
There may be police officers
who will see this broadcast

246
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,677
and feel moved to take action
in the name of justice.

247
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,377
If you don't take control
of this situation quickly,

248
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,910
there will be a disaster.

249
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:41,877
-But technically,
we're not supposed

250
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,810
to be involved in this case.

251
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,744
Huh?

252
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:48,010
REPORTER (TV): [gasp] Two
police officers have just

253
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:49,077
collapsed on the sidewalk.

254
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,610
I-- I think we may be in danger.

255
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,310
We're moving away
from the scene.

256
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:57,810
-I understand, L. I
see your point now.

257
00:11:57,844 --> 00:11:59,277
Tell me what I should do.

258
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,044
[phone ringing]

259
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:04,944
-Detective
Superintendent Yagami.

260
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:07,677
L: Call him back immediately
and give me the phone.

261
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,077
-I need to speak with Ryuzaki.

262
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,244
-Yes, it's me.

263
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:12,544
Mr. Yagami.

264
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:14,577
So you're the one
driving the police van.

265
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,677
-That's right.

266
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,810
I couldn't just sit and watch.

267
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:19,977
I've confiscated
all of the tapes.

268
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,210
I'm bringing them to you.

269
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:22,910
But what about your condition?

270
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:24,010
Are you all right?

271
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,510
-I'm feeling just fine.

272
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,044
To be honest with
you, I don't think

273
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:29,144
I've ever felt more alive.

274
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:31,344
So what do you think
I should do now?

275
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,677
I'd say going out the front
will be too dangerous,

276
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,044
but I could always use
the police van again.

277
00:12:36,077 --> 00:12:38,177
-Please hold the
line for a second.

278
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,577
Deputy Director Kitamura,
it was Chief Yagami

279
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,110
who just drove
into the building.

280
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,644
Are your preparations complete?

281
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:46,144
-It's done, as you requested.

282
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:48,177
-Mr. Yagami, listen carefully.

283
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,677
In exactly five
minutes, I want you

284
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,977
to come out the front entrance.

285
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,977
-You want me to exit
through the front entrance?

286
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:14,544
[gasp]

287
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:22,344
POLICE OFFICER (ON BULLHORN):
Make sure there are no gaps.

288
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,744
Do not reveal your faces.

289
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:26,777
We know that Kira is
not in the building.

290
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,544
He is outside.

291
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:41,910
-Thank you.

292
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:43,710
I'll drive myself.

293
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:44,677
IDE: I understand.

294
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,444
POLICE OFFICER (ON
BULLHORN): Listen up.

295
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:55,844
There is a very good
chance that Kira is still

296
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,110
in the vicinity of the station.

297
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:59,710
As you move out,
proceed with caution.

298
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:03,610
You are not to
remove your helmets.

299
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:05,277
KOKI TANAKABARA (TV):
There you have it.

300
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,310
The police refuse to
cooperate with Kira.

301
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,544
Instead, they are
preparing to fight.

302
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:12,944
And, as much as I fear for
my own life in saying so,

303
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,277
this is right.

304
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,310
And it must be done.

305
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,944
Kira has become a threat
to our very constitution.

306
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:23,877
And as citizens,
we must fight back.

307
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,910
I am NHN's Golden news
anchor, Koki Tanakabara.

308
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:30,477
-Mm?

309
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,410
Chief Yagami!

310
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:33,877
AIZAWA: Welcome back, Chief.

311
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,344
-Mm.

312
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:39,377
Ryuzaki, I apologize for taking
matters into my own hands.

313
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,110
I have to admit, I got a
little bit carried away.

314
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:43,310
-No.

315
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,877
-Here, these are all of
the tapes in an envelope.

316
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,544
Everything Kira sent to
the station is in here.

317
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:50,110
L: I can't thank you enough.

318
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:52,810
-Ah, I think I'd better
rest for a minute.

319
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:55,977
[groan]

320
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,044
L (VOICEOVER): Mr. Yagami,
this won't go to waste.

321
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:04,610
The postmark is from Osaka, but
Kira can control his victims

322
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:07,510
before they die, so he could
have delivered it from Osaka

323
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:10,810
without going there himself.

324
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,310
Mr. Aizawa, can you please
take this to the crime lab

325
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:14,477
right away?

326
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,510
-I still have a couple
of friends down there.

327
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:18,477
I'll make sure they go
over every inch of this.

328
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,010
-That's good.

329
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:19,944
Please do so.

330
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:21,310
While you're doing
that, I'm going

331
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:23,410
to watch these tapes to see
if they can tell us anything.

332
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,844
CHIEF YAGAMI: Well, what
do you make of these?

333
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:32,344
-They were definitely
interesting.

334
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,844
If the police had said yes and
agreed to cooperate with Kira,

335
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:38,010
tape number three was
supposed to be aired.

336
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:41,010
Tape four if the answer was no.

337
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:43,077
Tape three covers the
terms of cooperation.

338
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,744
Put simply, he's
requesting that we

339
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,277
broadcast the names
of more criminals.

340
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,944
He seems particularly interested
in those who have assaulted

341
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:52,277
others or those who have
somehow hurt or taken

342
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,144
advantage of the
weak and defenseless.

343
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:59,344
Of course, Kira would play the
role of judge in all of this.

344
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:00,977
Furthermore, as
proof that the police

345
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,077
are willing to cooperate, he
wants police officials and L

346
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,210
to appear on TV, to make a
public announcement that we

347
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:09,177
plan to cooperate with him.

348
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,777
-Huh?

349
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,777
-He needs us to
reveal our faces.

350
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,044
That way, he can kill us if the
police do anything suspicious.

351
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:18,577
In other words, he'll hold
our lives as insurance.

352
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,044
-I see.

353
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:21,844
So what about the content
of the fourth video

354
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:23,344
if we were to answer no?

355
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:25,744
-The wording was different,
but he more or less

356
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,644
says the same thing.

357
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:31,044
Mr. Yagami, it should go without
saying that the answer is no.

358
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:34,277
Please have someone take tape
numer four over to Sakura TV

359
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,544
and authorize them
to broadcast it.

360
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:38,110
DISTORTED VOICE
(TV): I can only say

361
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:40,077
it's a shame that
your answer is no.

362
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,377
It's clear that the
police wish to oppose me.

363
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,244
This will not go unpunished.

364
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:49,144
So I'll start by taking the life
of either the director-general

365
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:52,377
of the NPA or the detective
known as L, who is currently

366
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,077
leading the
investigation against me.

367
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,877
The director-general or L?

368
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,710
Who will pay the
price for your refusal

369
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:01,577
to cooperate in the creation
of a peaceful world?

370
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,577
You have four days to decide.

371
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,744
[laughing]

372
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:13,644
-Hmm.

373
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:16,777
It looks like I've even
got God on my side now.

374
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:21,110
Well, I suppose it's
actually a god of death.

375
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:23,210
-Heh, seems like it.

376
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:25,177
-It would appear that
another Shinigami

377
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,110
has come to the human world.

378
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:29,410
And somehow, that
Shinigami's Death Note

379
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:32,744
has fallen into the hands of
someone who agrees with Kira.

380
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:36,410
And this person most likely
has the Shinigami eyes,

381
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:38,444
which makes him very deadly.

382
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:41,010
His power to kill
surpasses even mine.

383
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:42,477
One thing is for certain.

384
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,444
If I leave things,
I'm pretty sure that L

385
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,644
will be finished off
within the next four days.

386
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:50,477
However, I can't
forgive this impostor

387
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,010
for the way he's
tarnishing Kira's

388
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:54,510
image with these
senseless killings.

389
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:56,577
Not to mention, if he
slips up and gets caught,

390
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,044
the Death Note
could be discovered.

391
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,544
And that, I cannot allow.

392
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:02,510
I can't afford to leave
him alone for much longer.

393
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:04,877
[laughing]

394
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,544
Therefore, what needs
to happen very soon

395
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:10,910
is for me to join
the task force.

396
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:14,444
It'll allow me to keep track
of L and this fake Kira.

397
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:21,577
-Ryuzaki, I'm afraid
it's as you thought.

398
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,977
Several of our member
countries have weighed in,

399
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,777
and it seems they are
in favor of having

400
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,010
the real L appear on TV.

401
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:32,177
-I think that's the most
appropriate choice, given

402
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,377
the options.

403
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,877
Well, we still have three
days before it happens.

404
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,144
Maybe we can find
some countermeasure.

405
00:18:38,177 --> 00:18:41,577
After all this, it would
really annoy me-- [slurp]

406
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,444
--mm-- if I'm killed
by the first person

407
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:44,977
to jump on the Kira bandwagon.

408
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,010
[gasp]

409
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,910
-Ryuzaki, what do
you mean by that?

410
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:50,344
-That there's a
strong possibility

411
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,977
that this Kira's a fake.

412
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,977
No, we should think of
him more as a second Kira.

413
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,810
-A second Kira?

414
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:59,710
-I-- I don't understand.

415
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:01,610
Why do you think
there's a copycat?

416
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:04,210
How did you come
to that conclusion?

417
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,577
L: I looked at the victims
he used for his predictions

418
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,044
on tape number one.

419
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:10,710
Their purpose was to
prove to Sakura TV staff

420
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:12,610
that he is Kira.

421
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:14,210
Both their names
were only reported

422
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:16,210
in tabloids and
daytime talk shows,

423
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:18,444
so they weren't exactly
hardened criminals.

424
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:20,810
The real Kira has no
need to prove himself

425
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:22,677
using such
insignificant criminals.

426
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,210
But from the
perspective Kira, he'd

427
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:29,544
want to make absolutely
certain that he didn't predict

428
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,910
the death of a
criminal who could

429
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:32,577
be killed by the
real Kira first.

430
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,777
-Hmm.

431
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,510
Ryuzaki, if you had to
put a number on it, what's

432
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:39,444
the probability
of a second Kira?

433
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,544
-This time, I'd say
it's more than 70%.

434
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:42,677
-[gasp]

435
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,310
-I really don't like
the way he operates.

436
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:47,110
It's not like Kira.

437
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,710
-Not like him?

438
00:19:48,744 --> 00:19:50,410
L: In the past, he
has traditionally

439
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:53,177
avoided killing innocent people,
with the exception of those

440
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,677
who were trying to catch him.

441
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,177
Anyway, if we can
capture one Kira,

442
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,277
I think that will provide
us with a lot of insight

443
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,377
into how we can
find the other one.

444
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,944
Mr. Yagami, I'd
like your permission

445
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:07,777
to ask your son to cooperate
with us on this investigation.

446
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,177
-Huh?

447
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,277
-If you want my son to
join the task force,

448
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,444
does this mean you no
longer suspect him?

449
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:16,477
-Well, I can't say that he's
been completely cleared,

450
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,877
but his deductive abilities
would be invaluable to us

451
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,210
right now.

452
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:22,777
CHIEF YAGAMI (VOICEOVER)
So that's what it means.

453
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,444
If my son wants to
cooperate with you,

454
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:26,577
then I have no
reason to prevent it.

455
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,110
-I appreciate that.

456
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,244
However, please don't
tell him that we

457
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,310
think this latest
Kira might be a fake.

458
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:35,310
I don't want him
to know that yet.

459
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,577
We want to make it appear
to him that we're still

460
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,144
chasing the same Kira.

461
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:39,644
-Hmm.

462
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,344
REM: Misa, I gave that
Death Note to you.

463
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:51,144
So why not use it for yourself?

464
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,510
-I am using it for
myself because I

465
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:58,610
believe in what Kira is doing.

466
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:01,310
I want to know what
kind of person Kira is.

467
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,644
I want to meet him
and talk to him.

468
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:06,377
That's the only reason I sent
all those videos to that TV

469
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,510
station.

470
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:11,110
I had to find some way
to make Kira notice me.

471
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,610
And I'd say that probably
got his attention.

472
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:14,444
Don't you think?

473
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:15,477
[giggle]

474
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,677
-It's a dangerous
game you're playing.

475
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,610
There's a chance
you could be killed.

476
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:21,144
Do you understand?

477
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:22,410
-It's all right.

478
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:24,644
I'm sure that Kira is kind
to those with pure hearts.

479
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:27,477
And if it came down to
that, I'm still stronger

480
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,444
than he is because
I have the eyes.

481
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:42,285
[theme music]

482
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:52,151
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I need to figure out

483
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:53,885
what this other
Kira is all about

484
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:56,918
before someone else on the
task force beats me to it.

485
00:22:56,951 --> 00:23:01,851
I wonder, what kind of
person are you, impostor?
