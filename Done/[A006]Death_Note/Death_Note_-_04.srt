[music - nightmare,"the world"]

3
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:35,367
SOICHIRO: What?

4
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,334
[strangled cry]

5
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:37,667
SOICHIRO: I don't believe this.

6
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,101
Another 23 victims yesterday?

7
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:40,334
Are these confirmed?

8
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,701
L: As soon as we
began to suspect

9
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,901
that Kira might be a student,
the pacing of the killings

10
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:47,367
changed, as if to
contradict that theory.

11
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:50,067
This can only mean that Kira has
access to police information.

12
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,234
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): When L
discovers that I'm somehow

13
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,634
getting confidential
information,

14
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:56,501
he'll be obligated to start
investigating the police

15
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,267
to find the source of the leak.

16
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:00,134
-You're being followed
by another human.

17
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,234
He's watching you right now.

18
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:03,734
LIGHT: That's a problem.

19
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:07,401
I'll have to get rid of
him as soon as possible.

20
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,034
-Because through a
Shinigami's eyes,

21
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,667
a human's name can be
seen above their head.

22
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:14,434
Not only that-- we see
their lifespan as well.

23
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,867
However, if a Shinigami
drops his Death Note

24
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:20,067
and a human picks it up,
he can grant that human

25
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,401
the eyes of a Shinigami.

26
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,934
The price for having
a Shinigami's eyes

27
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:27,367
is half of that person's
remaining lifespan.

28
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:30,501
That's all it is.

29
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,834
So what'll it be, Light?

30
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,234
Is it a deal?

31
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:40,167
-Has anyone seen
Ryuk around lately?

32
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,967
-Maybe he was serious about
losing his Death Note.

33
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,034
SHINIGAMI: It was probably
picked up by some human

34
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,301
before he could get to it.

35
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,667
-No way.

36
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,634
Then he'd be stuck there till
the end of that human's life

37
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,501
or until the Death
Note was destroyed.

38
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:53,034
That could take a while.

39
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,201
-Yeah.

40
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:56,867
I can't picture Ryuk
doing something so boring.

41
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,201
SHINIGAMI: But do you know what?

42
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:01,134
I actually heard he was
carrying two Death Notes.

43
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:02,034
SHINIGAMI: Seriously?

44
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:04,201
Why would he need two?

45
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,001
-Beats me.

46
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:08,067
I'll never understand that guy.

47
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,834
LIGHT: So the
price for receiving

48
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:12,201
the eyes of a Shinigami
is no more than half

49
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,901
of my remaining lifespan?

50
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:16,367
That's it, right?

51
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:17,334
RYUK: Yes.

52
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:21,601
Well then, do we
have a deal or not?

53
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:27,767
-Ryuk, this deal is
out of the question.

54
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:28,267
-Huh?

55
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:37,234
[dog barking in distance]

56
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,434
LIGHT: Let's get this straight.

57
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,801
My plan is to create
an ideal new world

58
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:45,801
free from evil
and all criminals,

59
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,467
and I intend to reign as a
god in that world for a very

60
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:49,901
long time.

61
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:52,101
I might consider the deal
if it lengthened my life,

62
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:55,034
but not if I'd die sooner.

63
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,501
I figured you of
all people should

64
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:58,234
know I wouldn't take this deal.

65
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,501
RYUK: Yeah.

66
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,501
I still felt I should tell
you that the deal existed,

67
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:03,267
just in case.

68
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:04,501
Anyway, I've done my part.

69
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:06,434
I don't need you complaining
I didn't tell you

70
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,267
this earlier on.

71
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:11,034
LIGHT: This is what you
call telling me early on?

72
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,901
Don't you think
you're a little late?

73
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:16,101
I don't see why you couldn't
have told me this when we met.

74
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:18,201
Or better yet, you could
have simply included it

75
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:19,901
in the instructions
for the Death Note.

76
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:22,234
-Uh, good point.

77
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,801
(VOICEOVER) He's not
the slightest bit

78
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:26,167
daunted by the fact
that I'm a Shinigami.

79
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,134
He doesn't suck up
to me and he seems

80
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,134
to have no problem
giving me a hard time.

81
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,101
LIGHT: Well?

82
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,001
You sure there's nothing else
you want to tell me ahead

83
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:42,801
of time, Shinigami?

84
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:43,601
-No.

85
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:44,801
Nothing else.

86
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,201
(VOICEOVER) Probably.

87
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,301
-Really?

88
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,567
That's too bad.

89
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:49,967
RYUK: What do you mean?

90
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:52,234
-You know, Ryuk, I might have
seriously considered the deal

91
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:54,267
if you'd offered me
wings instead of eyes.

92
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:56,767
Just the idea of flying
round freely in the sky

93
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,401
sounds very godlike.

94
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,401
After all, it's
been mankind's dream

95
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,201
since antiquity
to be able to fly.

96
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:06,334
-You'd stand out if you
sprouted wings and flew around.

97
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:09,601
Not to mention, the police would
have no trouble finding you.

98
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,567
-I was only joking.

99
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:14,367
Anyway, if I keep bargaining
for eyes and wings

100
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,967
and whatever else,
next thing you know,

101
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:19,734
I'm going to end up
becoming a real Shinigami.

102
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,767
Though who knows?

103
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:22,967
I bet that could be
pretty interesting.

104
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,334
-I wouldn't worry.

105
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,367
Even without the
eyes and the wings,

106
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:28,601
you're already a
worthy Shinigami.

107
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:34,101
The Shinigami Realm
is slowly rotting.

108
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:37,467
We lead meaningless
and empty lives.

109
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,501
And the only reason we
still take human lives

110
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:42,867
is because we're afraid
to die ourselves.

111
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:45,067
The truth of the matter
is that we no longer even

112
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:46,767
know why we exist.

113
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:49,167
In fact, I doubt
there's any reason

114
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:52,634
for our existence at all.

115
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,901
What I'm saying is
compared to that,

116
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:58,167
you're becoming a much
more impressive Shinigami.

117
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:59,267
-I don't know about that.

118
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,567
I mean, from what
you're telling me,

119
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:02,834
it sounds like I'm doing a
lot more work than they are.

120
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:06,667
But I don't want to be
compared to a Shinigami.

121
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,534
I'm a human using
this Death Note

122
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,601
to make the world a better
place for other humans.

123
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:16,301
But I wouldn't necessarily
say that the Shinigami Realm

124
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,101
is meaningless to
humans, either.

125
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:19,601
-Huh?

126
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:20,734
Why do you say that?

127
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,567
-Well, just think about it.

128
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,267
Whenever a Shinigami
like you comes

129
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,534
to the human world, once every
100-- no, more like every 1,000

130
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,167
years, the human world
changes dramatically.

131
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:34,101
The existence of the Shinigami
Realm is extremely significant.

132
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:35,801
-Really?

133
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:38,772
-You told me just now that
the Shinigami Realm is slowly

134
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:39,867
rotting, right?

135
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,467
Well, when you return
from this world,

136
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,967
why not use what
you've learned here

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,634
to try and change
it for the better?

138
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:49,200
-Well, Light, I'm not sure why
I never noticed this until now,

139
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,667
but you're quite the
positive thinker.

140
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,634
-[laughs] Yeah, of course I am.

141
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:57,434
That's why I'm using the Death
Note to create a better world.

142
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,034
You have to be a
positive thinker

143
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,534
to even attempt
something like this.

144
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:06,234
That's it.

145
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,767
I got it.

146
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,834
-Got what?

147
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:09,567
What's this about?

148
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,734
[buzz and hum]

149
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,234
-I think I just
figured out how find

150
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,600
the name the guy who
was following me today.

151
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:18,000
-How are you going to do that?

152
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,434
-I'm going to use the rules of
the Death Note to my advantage.

153
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:22,667
I already know that if I
write down a cause of death,

154
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,367
I've got six minutes
and 40 seconds

155
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,734
to record the conditions
and exact time of death.

156
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,734
First, I need to
know exactly how

157
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,400
far I can go in
terms of specifying

158
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:32,967
the details of death.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,834
This should be interesting.

160
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:40,234
[phone ringing]

161
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:43,267
-Yeah, it's me.

162
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,267
Another six inmates were
found dead last night?

163
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,500
All were heart attacks?

164
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,434
It's him.

165
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:51,700
What?

166
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:53,534
Bizarre behavior
before they died?

167
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,967
Could you be more specific?

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,400
What do you mean?

169
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,934
So they didn't just
die from heart attacks.

170
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:01,367
No, what I'm saying is they
all died of heart attacks,

171
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
but it wasn't quite that simple.

172
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,300
Before one of them died,
he drew a pentagram

173
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,667
on the wall of this cell
using his own blood.

174
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,200
Another left a
letter, but it doesn't

175
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:11,134
seem to be a will or
anything meaningful.

176
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,634
And as for the third victim,
he escaped from his cell

177
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,134
and ran all the way to the
staff bathrooms before he died.

178
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,067
[beeping]

179
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,997
L: What is it, Watari?

180
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:25,731
-Three more heart
attack victims.

181
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:27,297
But the circumstances
of their deaths

182
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:29,431
are different from what
we've seen thus far.

183
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:31,564
-What do mean by different?

184
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:33,197
-I'm sending you a
copy of a letter,

185
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:35,397
as well as pictures
taken at the scene.

186
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:35,897
-OK.

187
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:40,131
L (VOICEOVER): It sounds
like he was afraid

188
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:42,764
that Kira would find him.

189
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:45,164
It's believable that our victim
might have been genuinely

190
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:47,964
afraid and wrote
this, but we know

191
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,697
Kira can control
the time of death.

192
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,531
What if he can also
determine the actions

193
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,997
in the moments
leading up to death?

194
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,431
In which case--

195
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:56,631
L (ON COMM): Chief.

196
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:58,464
-Hm?

197
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,897
L (ON COMM): We can't release
details of these men's deaths

198
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,264
to the media.

199
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:04,797
As far as they're concerned,
these are just heart attacks.

200
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:05,797
-Oh.

201
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:07,297
L (ON COMM): I have
reason to believe

202
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:09,197
that Kira was performing
some kind of test

203
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:10,464
using these criminals.

204
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:11,864
And if that's the
case, we'd only

205
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:13,997
be giving him the results
of this information if we

206
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,531
took it public.

207
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:16,164
SOICHIRO: Right.

208
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:18,697
I understand.

209
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:21,297
-So now he's experimenting
on his victims?

210
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:22,231
-Horrible.

211
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,831
-He's playing with
people's lives,

212
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,764
as if all this was just a game.

213
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:26,631
It's unforgivable.

214
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:31,964
L (VOICEOVER): If Kira
is really using criminals

215
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:37,664
as test subjects, what
is he trying to achieve?

216
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:38,164
It's

217
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:41,997
[clicking]

218
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,397
[beep]

219
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:45,197
-Look at this, Ryuk.

220
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:46,331
I think we're in luck.

221
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:48,131
The results of
yesterday's little test

222
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:50,331
have already been downloaded
onto my dad's computer.

223
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:52,731
And these results are
just as I expected.

224
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:55,064
The Death Note will work
for what I have in mind.

225
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:56,731
-What do you mean by that?

226
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,631
-One of them escaped and
ran into the bathroom

227
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,764
I had specified
in the Death Note.

228
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:03,131
Another one drew the same
symbol I had drawn in the Death

229
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:04,331
Note before he died.

230
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:06,864
And finally, a third
wrote the same letter

231
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,897
I had written in the
Death Note word for word.

232
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:14,331
All three did exactly what
I intended them to do.

233
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,331
For the other three
inmates, I purposely

234
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:18,831
wrote conditions that
were virtually impossible.

235
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:20,031
-Huh?

236
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:21,631
-With the first
one, I wrote that he

237
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,531
would die in front of the
Eiffel Tower in one hour.

238
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:27,297
However, everyone knows that
it's physically impossible

239
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:30,864
to go from a prison in Japan to
Paris, France in only one hour.

240
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,497
Since this couldn't happen, he
simply died of a heart attack

241
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:34,253
in prison.

242
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,798
The next was supposed to draw
an exact picture of L's face

243
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:38,298
on the prison wall.

244
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:39,465
This also didn't happen.

245
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:42,665
You can't draw someone
you've never seen, right?

246
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:44,132
RYUK: Makes sense.

247
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,532
LIGHT: With the
last one, I tried

248
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:46,798
something slightly different.

249
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:48,665
I specified that he
would write a note that

250
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,498
read, "I know that
L is suspicious

251
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,698
of the Japanese police."

252
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,198
To be honest, I actually
expected this one to work,

253
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:57,132
but it didn't end
up happening-- which

254
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:59,665
means it's impossible
to make someone write

255
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:01,365
what they don't already know.

256
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,665
Or at the very least, it
has to be the kind of thing

257
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:05,398
that they could come
up with on their own.

258
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,798
Basically, even the Death
Note can't do the impossible.

259
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:11,798
But as long as it's within
the realistic limits of what

260
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:14,465
that person might do,
I can control them

261
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:17,465
as much as I want
before they die.

262
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:18,965
-That's very clever.

263
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:21,859
But what's all this leading to?

264
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:23,292
What's the point?

265
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,592
-These latest
victims will no doubt

266
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,792
keep L and the police guessing.

267
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:30,125
Even as we speak
he's probably trying

268
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,859
to decipher all the clues
I left for him, especially

269
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,192
that little note.

270
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:37,125
That absolutely
meaningless dying message.

271
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:41,992
L (VOICEOVER): If Kira
used those criminals

272
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,959
to conduct an
experiment of some sort,

273
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:46,725
it means he's about
to start something.

274
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,792
If he moves now,
there's a good chance

275
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:52,992
that the FBI will notice
someone acting suspiciously.

276
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:57,425
But perhaps he has a different
goal in mind altogether.

277
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:01,925
Could the pentagram and this
letter be some kind of message?

278
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,592
[gasp]

279
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,792
L (VOICEOVER): Is this it?

280
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,425
LIGHT: All right, time
for the real thing.

281
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:09,592
-Real thing?

282
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,059
-Yesterday on the
news, they said

283
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:14,025
this drug addict tried to rob
a bank but was unsuccessful.

284
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:16,459
He attacked a few people and
then ran away empty-handed.

285
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,459
I'll use him.

286
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:21,625
It's kind of last minute, but
I'm sure I can find someone.

287
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,392
I got a few people in mind.

288
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:24,825
-A few people?

289
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:25,559
For what?

290
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:26,925
-You'll see.

291
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,192
Believe it or not, I'm actually
a rather popular guy, Ryuk.

292
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:35,625
[phone ringing]

293
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:39,725
[mumbles sleepily]

294
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,992
-Hello?

295
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:41,992
Uh-huh?

296
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:42,959
Light?

297
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:43,759
Oh, morning.

298
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:11,838
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): He's
still following me.

299
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:13,071
Perfect.

300
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:15,238
This whole thing would
just be a waste of time

301
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:16,571
if he wasn't tailing me.

302
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,838
-Light!

303
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,071
-A date?

304
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,171
-Yeah.

305
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:29,304
It's a date no matter
how you look at it.

306
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:32,738
And I'm sure even my stalker
will see it that way.

307
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,004
-But this isn't
just a date, is it?

308
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:36,638
You said that you'd
figured out a way

309
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:38,471
to find your stalker's name.

310
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:40,938
So tell me, what do
you plan on doing?

311
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:41,438
-Huh?

312
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:42,704
Come on.

313
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,604
Didn't you see what I
wrote in the Death Note?

314
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:46,704
I explained it in great detail.

315
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:47,804
-No.

316
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:49,804
Doing that would take
all the fun out of it.

317
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:54,938
-In that case, just be patient
and watch what happens.

318
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,271
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?

319
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:58,038
-No, not at all.

320
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,938
Anyway, I haven't been to
Spaceland since junior high.

321
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:03,604
I'm so excited.

322
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:06,104
And the best part is I
have you all to myself.

323
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,404
-Uh, yeah.

324
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:09,771
RAYE (VOICEOVER):
During the week

325
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:12,804
he goes to school and
crams school at night.

326
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:14,471
Dates on his day off.

327
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:17,904
A normal kid, just a hardworking
senior in high school.

328
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:20,871
Chief Yagami's
son, Light Yagami.

329
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:23,438
No cause for suspicion.

330
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:27,771
[bus idling]

331
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,338
RAYE (VOICEOVER):
At any rate, I'll

332
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:32,204
be done with my surveillance
today, and that'll be it.

333
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:38,304
YURI: I don't get it, Light.

334
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:40,038
Didn't you say you
weren't going out

335
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:41,804
until entrance exams were over?

336
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:44,471
-That was before I scored number
one on the national practice

337
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:45,471
exams.

338
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:48,004
-Ooh, you're such
a nerd. [giggles]

339
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:52,671
[music playing]

340
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:21,838
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): It's him.

341
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:22,404
He's here.

342
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,271
Seven passengers excluding him.

343
00:15:27,304 --> 00:15:28,304
No one's in the way.

344
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:30,404
Everything should go smoothly.

345
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:32,704
[gun cocks]

346
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:33,971
-Aahh!

347
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:35,938
(SHOUTING) Stay in your
seats unless you want to die!

348
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:37,538
YURI: [whimpering]

349
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,404
RAYE (VOICEOVER): A bus-jacking?

350
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,771
You gotta be kidding me.

351
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:42,038
-Everybody shut up!

352
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:45,471
If anybody moves, I'm putting
a bullet in their head.

353
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:47,671
All right, driver,
you listen to me.

354
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:50,338
I know you've got the number
for Spaceland's office on you.

355
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:50,971
Call 'em!

356
00:15:51,004 --> 00:15:52,471
-OK.

357
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:55,904
This-- this is Sasaki
calling from bus 174.

358
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,838
-Tell 'em what's going
on-- and no tricks, either.

359
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:02,538
-M-my bus has been hijacked and
he's holding a gun to my head.

360
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:03,671
HIJACKER: Give me that.

361
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:04,938
You heard what he said.

362
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,471
Now you listen up.

363
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:09,138
Have a female staff member
bring all of Spaceland's cash

364
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:10,271
from yesterday.

365
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,438
I know it's there.

366
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,471
Have her meet us two
bus stops from the park,

367
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:14,871
and don't make me wait.

368
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:17,871
If you mess with me at all or
try to get the police involved,

369
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:20,271
I swear I'll kill every
one of these passengers.

370
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:21,804
Hunnh!

371
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:23,771
[crunch]

372
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:26,271
-[whimpering]

373
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:30,971
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Yuri, don't be scared.

374
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:32,804
As soon as he turns
around I'm going

375
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,371
to grab the gun out of his hand.

376
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,171
-Don't be stupid.

377
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,271
That's risky.

378
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:40,504
If it comes to that,
I'll take care of it.

379
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:41,638
It's OK.

380
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:43,204
We don't have to pass
notes back and forth.

381
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:44,704
As long as we keep
it down, he won't

382
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,871
be able to hear our voices
over the sound of the engine.

383
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:51,938
-Do you have any proof that
you're not his accomplice?

384
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:54,104
Why should we trust you?

385
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,338
-Accomplice?

386
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:56,838
-Yes, I've read
about this before.

387
00:16:56,871 --> 00:17:00,004
The first hijacker comes
in like he's working alone.

388
00:17:00,038 --> 00:17:02,804
Meanwhile, a second one pretends
to be a hostage and stays

389
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:05,438
in the very back, just in
case something goes wrong.

390
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:07,071
What's the matter?

391
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:09,438
-You-- you really
think he is one?

392
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,938
RAYE (VOICEOVER):
I-- I have no choice.

393
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:13,771
I'm sure Light
Yagami isn't Kira.

394
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:18,071
If he was, he could just kill
this guy with a heart attack.

395
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,004
-Here's my proof.

396
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,404
Take a look.

397
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:22,371
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): FBI?

398
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:23,871
I see.

399
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:27,304
L needed an outsider so he got
the FBI to investigate anyone

400
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,471
connected to the
Japanese police.

401
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:31,304
His name is Raye Penber.

402
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:36,371
-I trust you.

403
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:38,104
And I guess for
the time being, I

404
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:40,171
won't bother asking
what an FBI agent is

405
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:41,871
doing on the bus
in the first place.

406
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:42,604
Do you have a gun?

407
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:44,038
RAYE: Yeah, I've got one.

408
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:47,238
-So if it comes down to it,
I can rely on you, right?

409
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:48,438
RAYE: Yes.

410
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:49,938
HIJACKER: (SHOUTING) Get
the hell up, you old hag!

411
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:52,604
You want me to
shoot you right now?

412
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,338
RAYE (VOICEOVER):
That's right, this guy.

413
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:56,838
His face was all over the
local news just a few days ago.

414
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:57,471
-(SHOUTING) Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

415
00:17:57,504 --> 00:17:58,471
RAYE: Some junkie.

416
00:17:58,504 --> 00:17:59,538
He tried to rob a
bank and ended up

417
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:02,138
killing three people
before he got away.

418
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:03,904
He's extremely dangerous.

419
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:05,171
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): We're safe.

420
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:06,238
He won't shoot us.

421
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:10,138
In fact, he's not
going to do anything.

422
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:11,204
-Aaah!

423
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:12,638
-(SHOUTING) Don't
move, you little punk!

424
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:17,038
What the hell is that?

425
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:18,571
Ah, smart-ass.

426
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:20,904
You guys were planning something
back here, weren't you?

427
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:21,838
RAYE: Damn it.

428
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:22,871
If he sees that
note from before,

429
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:23,971
he'll find out that
Light was planning

430
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:25,404
to jump him and
take his gun away.

431
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:31,438
HIJACKER: [scoffs]
Plans for a date, huh?

432
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,704
Stupid kid.

433
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,771
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Gotcha.

434
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:42,704
-Huh?

435
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:45,438
[gasps with fear] Who--
who the hell are you?

436
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:48,138
You in the very back, what
do you think you're doing?

437
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:51,004
D-- don't mess with me!

438
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,771
How long you been
hiding back there?

439
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:55,038
-What's this?

440
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:57,104
You're talking to me?

441
00:18:57,138 --> 00:19:00,038
So you mean you can
actually see me right now?

442
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:00,604
-Ahhh!

443
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:01,604
Stay there, you!

444
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:03,038
You keep away from
me, you freak.

445
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:04,438
RAYE (VOICEOVER):
This isn't good.

446
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:05,938
He's hallucinating.

447
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:07,338
-(SHOUTING) Everyone get down!

448
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:10,238
[passengers cry out]

449
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:11,871
-Oh, I get it.

450
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:15,271
That little note that,
like, accidentally dropped

451
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:18,504
was actually torn from the
pages of the Death Note itself.

452
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:21,038
Since he tricked this guy
into touching the paper,

453
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:23,938
he's the only other one
in the bus who can see me.

454
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,704
That's so smart.

455
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:26,571

-Sorry, pal.

I'm a Shinigami, so I'm
afraid your bullets aren't

462
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,004

I have to stay till the
death Note is finished

472
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:53,471
or I see you die,
whichever comes first.

473
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:56,771
And the Shinigami can't
die from being shot.

00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:59,404
I've said all these things
at one time or another.

Well, he is the top-ranked
student in the country.

476
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:04,571
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

477
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,538
He even used this
hijacking as a way

478
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:11,004
to get the guy following him
to willingly give up his name.

-(PANTING) Stop the bus.

Terrified, he flees the bus.

Immediately
afterwards, at 11:45,

495
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:11,138
