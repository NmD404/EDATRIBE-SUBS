[theme music]

2
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:39,318
-Near, if you don't
mind me asking,

3
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,684
what do you make of all this?

4
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:43,218
I'm interested to hear what
your thoughts are on this case.

5
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:45,184
-The current Kira is
foolish and overconfident.

6
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:48,051
Not to mention
unusually cooperative

7
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:49,551
with the task force.

8
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:52,251
So much so that I suspect he's
working hand in hand with them.

9
00:01:52,284 --> 00:01:53,484
-You think so?

10
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:56,384
-That would make the
second L and Kira one

11
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:57,884
in the same person.

12
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,851
-What?

13
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:00,551
That can't be.

14
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:01,884
Are-- Are you serious?

15
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,284
-Yes, I am.

16
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:08,051
Having said that, I'll admit
that I'm only 7% certain.

17
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:09,718
Don't worry, Commander Rester.

18
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,551
Making assumptions is
part of any investigation.

19
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:14,884
If we're wrong, all
it'll cost is an apology.

20
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,351
WOMAN: There have been
less crimes lately

21
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:26,484
in Japan, and around the world.

22
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:27,618
It's because of Kira.

23
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:29,418
My daddy told mee that,
if you do something bad,

24
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:31,684
your name will be
written on the internet--

25
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,518
-Your name, please?

26
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,684
WOMAN: --and Kira will kill you.

27
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:34,384
-Come on.

28
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:35,718
I don't have all day.

29
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,351
How am I supposed to file
this report without your name?

30
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:38,584
-Will you give me a break?

31
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,284
Please, not my name!

32
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,418
Leave me alone or I'll put
your names on the internet.

33
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:12,551
MAN: I will proclaim
this right here and now,

34
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:14,184
to all the people of the Earth.

35
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:15,918
Kira is true justice!

36
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,451
Good evening.

37
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:26,318
It is my honor to be appointed
by Kira as his spokesman.

38
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,318
This is not a hoax.

39
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:28,884
It's the absolute truth.

40
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:31,184
I realize that there
will be many people who

41
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:33,384
might try to have me killed now.

42
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:36,851
But, I'm prepared
to risk by life--

43
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,318
-Kira's Kingdom, huh?

44
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,218
What a horrible title.

45
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,518
-This is insanity.

46
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,151
- --can hear Kira's voice.

47
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:45,284
Trying to capture Kira
is an unforgivable crime.

48
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:46,618
If you happen to know--

49
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:49,384
-If anybody deserves to be
killed by Kira, it's this guy.

50
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:51,884
MAN: --a criminal,
or a regular citizen.

51
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,551
-Switch it back to
the press conference.

52
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:56,784
The president's about to start.

53
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:58,418
I wonder what it's about.

54
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,884
All they said was
that it was going

55
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:02,351
to be some sort of
international announcement.

56
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:04,484
-You don't do anything
but watch TV, do you?

57
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:07,018
-Wha--

58
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:07,884
-Good morning.

59
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:09,484
I'm gonna try to
keep this brief.

60
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:15,818
-No way.

61
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:19,218
-The United States will
no longer oppose Kira.

62
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,584
-Those cowards!

63
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:27,551
I've done it.

64
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:30,718
I've even been brought
America to its knees.

65
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:32,551
-What the hell is
he talking about?

66
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,218
-Have they been
threatened or something?

67
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,884
-Are you saying that
Kira is justice?

68
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:40,851
-Justice?

69
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:42,884
No, no, I never said that.

70
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:46,284
But because if Kira, war and
conflict have ceased to exist.

71
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:48,684
Criminal organizations
are in a state of ruin,

72
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:51,818
not only in the United States,
but in all free nations.

73
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,351
Anyone who defies Kira
head on will be killed.

74
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:55,584
That is a fact.

75
00:04:55,618 --> 00:04:58,184
We are not acknowledging
Kira as a symbol of justice.

76
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:00,618
We are simply saying
that, as a country,

77
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:03,084
we will not take any
actions against him.

78
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:04,484
MAN: How is that any different?

79
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:06,384
-You're saying that
you accept Kira?

80
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:07,818
Explain yourself!

81
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,818
-You call yourself a
representative of our country?

82
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:11,718
-I can't believe it.

83
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:12,818
This is America.

84
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:14,851
How can their government
do something so cowardly

85
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:15,851
like this?

86
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:16,984
-Uh.

87
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,951
Do you guys mind if I
ask a serious question?

88
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:19,651
-Oh, boy.

89
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:20,784
What is it this time?

90
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:23,251
-Are you telling us
you're not always serious?

91
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:25,318
-Do you guys ever
think that maybe Kira

92
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,618
isn't completely evil?

93
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,684
-What?

94
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,718
-What kind of question
is that, Matsuda?

95
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:32,184
-I've been thinking
about it, and part of me

96
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:34,218
just doesn't believe that he is.

97
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,451
-So now you think
Kira is justice too?

98
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,418
-I don't really know.

99
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:41,784
But I think that Kira's trying
to fight evil and change

100
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:44,184
the world in his
own way and, well,

101
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,918
the world's become a
good place for people

102
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:48,051
who live honest
lives, so maybe--

103
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:49,584
-You're wrong, Matsuda!

104
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:52,618
People are only afraid of
losing their own lives.

105
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,118
How can you think
that's real peace?

106
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:55,151
-I understand that.

107
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:57,151
Believe me, I know
that as well as you.

108
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:59,484
It's just that I can also
understand the other side.

109
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,918
I can see why all those
people call Kira a savior.

110
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:03,551
I'm not like you.

111
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:05,384
When it comes down
to it, I've always

112
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:06,951
been a really weak person.

113
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:08,651
But I'm also a detective.

114
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:10,551
I can't accept Kira.

115
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,318
I know it's my
duty to catch him.

116
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,784
No, I want to catch him.

117
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:17,551
It's just that I can't
completely hate him either.

118
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:21,651
I guess I must be crazy
or something, huh?

119
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:22,918
-No, you're not crazy.

120
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:24,851
You're normal.

121
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,851
-You too, Light?

122
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:28,118
What are you talking about?

123
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:30,651
-I'm sure that, on some
level, Kira probably

124
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:33,284
knows that what
he's doing is evil,

125
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:36,084
but he'll try to change the
world, even as a martyr,

126
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:37,784
at the cost of his soul.

127
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:40,284
That's his brand of justice.

128
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:43,518
I bet that's what's going
through Kira's mind.

129
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,884
Anyway, we shouldn't
be arguing about it.

130
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:48,418
Good or evil, it's not our call.

131
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,751
All we have to think
about is catching him.

132
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:54,018
If Kira gets caught,
then that makes him evil.

133
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,618
But if he wins and
rules the world,

134
00:06:55,651 --> 00:06:56,718
then I guess he's justice.

135
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:05,551
But from now on, the world will
start leaning in favor of Kira.

136
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,818
It's only a matter of time.

137
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,418
Kira will be justice.

138
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:14,318
-What's going to
happen to us now?

139
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,851
-It looks like we've
been disbanded,

140
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:18,184
thanks to that chicken
of a president.

141
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:19,084
No.

142
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:21,451
He's not even a chicken.

143
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,651
He's less than a maggot.

144
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:27,251
You've got to be kidding.

145
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:29,818
There's no way accepting Kira
will lead to anything good.

146
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,018
-Huh?

147
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:55,918
Huh?

148
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:00,884
So you're alive.

149
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,684
-Near.

150
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:07,184
-Hm?

151
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:11,384
-What should we do?

152
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:12,384
-Let him in.

153
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:25,051
Mello, welcome.

154
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,084
-Drop your weapon!

155
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:34,618
-Everyone, please
put away your guns.

156
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:37,718
Having a shoot out here
would achieve nothing.

157
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,284
Sir, with all due respect.

158
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,318
Mello's the one who
killed our partners.

159
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:43,584
-Please don't make
me say it again.

160
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:45,484
Remember that our primary
objective is still

161
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:46,718
to catch Kira.

162
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,351
Killing Mello right
now will do nothing

163
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:49,584
to benefit our investigation.

164
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:53,251
-All right.

165
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:57,751
-It seems like things
have been going

166
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:59,818
just as you planned, Near.

167
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,051
NEAR: Yes.

168
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:02,951
I take it you've already
heard all about the second L

169
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:04,618
from Lidner by now.

170
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:06,551
I've pretty much
figured out who Kira is,

171
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:08,584
and it's mostly thanks to
everything you've done.

172
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,984
-Shut up, Near!

173
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:15,851
I'm not just a tool
for you to use in order

174
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:18,418
to solve your puzzles, you know.

175
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,751
-Mello.

176
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,451
If you really want to shoot
me, then go ahead and do it.

177
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:27,884
-Stop.

178
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,018
If you shoot him,
then the rest of us

179
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:31,018
will have no choice
but to shoot you too.

180
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,351
What will it solve
if both of you die?

181
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:34,984
That's just what Kira wants.

182
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:40,184
-You have a good point.

183
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:42,084
Anyway, I'm only
here for one thing.

184
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:44,351
I came to take back that
photograph you have.

185
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,318
-Of course.

186
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,518
I got it from the orphanage.

187
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:49,584
There was only one and
no copies have been made.

188
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:51,084
I've already gone
ahead and dealt

189
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:52,984
with everyone who knows
your face, both inside

190
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:54,551
and outside Wammy's house.

191
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:56,318
they'll keep quiet.

192
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:59,484
I can't say 100% for certain,
but it shouldn't be possible

193
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:03,251
for you to be killed
by the notebook.

194
00:10:03,284 --> 00:10:05,651
Is that the only business
you had with me, Mello?

195
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:09,984
-Near.

196
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,551
Let's get one thing straight.

197
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:25,684
I have no intention of working
together with you on this.

198
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:27,051
-Yes, I know.

199
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,518
-At the same time, I can't
just take my photo and leave.

200
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:30,451
That wouldn't be right.

201
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:33,784
So I'll settle my debt.

202
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:34,618
The killer notebook.

203
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:37,084
It belongs to a Shinigami.

204
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:41,284
Whoever touches it is able
to see a god of death.

205
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:42,518
-That's crazy.

206
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:44,084
-Who the hell would believe
in something like that?

207
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:45,018
NEAR: I would.

208
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:46,518
I believe him completely.

209
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:48,851
What good would it do for
him to tell an outrageous lie

210
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:49,818
like that?

211
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,151
Even if he had
something to gain,

212
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,284
he could at least come up
with a more believable story.

213
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:56,618
Therefore, these gods
of death must exist.

214
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:58,551
-The notebook I
obtained had previously

215
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:02,118
belonged to another Shinigami,
perhaps even Kira himself.

216
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:06,118
Also, some of the rules written
inside are actually fake.

217
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:08,018
That's all I can
tell you for now.

218
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:22,851
Near.

219
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:23,351
-Mello?

220
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:31,918
-Which of us is going to
reach Kira first, I wonder?

221
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:34,051
-The race is on.

222
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,651
-We're both headed towards
the same destination.

223
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:39,118
I'll be waiting for you.

224
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:39,618
-Right.

225
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,007
Fake rules.

226
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,574
There's no doubt
that the notebook can

227
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:13,107
cause heart attacks and control
its victims to a degree.

228
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,174
As for burning it
or tearing it up,

229
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,907
the notebook still
exists, and there's

230
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,774
no way to confirm the
rule one way or the other.

231
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:29,240
That means-- the
false rule must be

232
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:30,740
the one that states
a person will

233
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:33,374
die if he doesn't write
a name within 13 days.

234
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,974
Giovanni.

235
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,874
Please set up a connection to L.

236
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:41,474
-Yes, sir.

237
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,707
-It's Near.

238
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,040
Yes?

239
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:49,774
-NEAR: L, I thought you should
know that we caught Mello.

240
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:50,640
-Huh?

241
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:53,840
-But he escaped soon afterwards.

242
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,840
We were able to interrogate
him for a while.

243
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,507
-He didn't really
escape, did he?

244
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,507
You let him get away.

245
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,440
Am I right?

246
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,640
-No.

247
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:03,540
We tried to restrain him,
but he was too quick.

248
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,940
Anyway, Mello
mentioned that there

249
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:08,274
was some sort of Shinigami
attached to the notebook.

250
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,640
Have you been able to
confirm the existence of such

251
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,107
a creature?

252
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,274
-Yes.

253
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:15,274
I can tell you for a fact
that Shinigami do exist.

254
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:17,640
I didn't share that information
with you at the beginning

255
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:20,374
because I was certain you
would never believe me.

256
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:24,040
NEAR: I would like to ask the
Shinigami a few questions.

257
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:24,707
-Forget it.

258
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,940
I'm not up for that.

259
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:28,107
-The thing that's bothering
me the most about this

260
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,274
is the issue of those rules
written in the notebook.

261
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:32,840
I have reason to believe
that one of them is fake.

262
00:13:32,874 --> 00:13:33,774
-Huh?

263
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:35,307
-A fake rule?

264
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,540
NEAR: Yes.

265
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:39,274
L, I'd be interested to
hear your thoughts on this.

266
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:41,574
Out of all the rules, which
do you think is the fake?

267
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:45,040
I'd like to know.

268
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,240
-By process of elimination,
the obvious choice

269
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:49,440
would be the one stating
that the owner of a notebook

270
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:52,574
will die if they don't write a
new name in it every 13 days.

271
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:53,974
I don't believe that.

272
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,607
NEAR: I thought
you might say so.

273
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,974
I've reached the
same conclusion.

274
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:03,140
-Shinigami, you know the
rules of the notebook rule.

275
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,007
Tell us, are any of them false?

276
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,640
-No.

277
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:08,474
They are all real.

278
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,440
-I see.

279
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,740
You have a Shinigami
there with you?

280
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:12,974
-Yes.

281
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,140
-Is that so?

282
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:17,740
I think I'm beginning
to get the picture.

283
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,774
In other words, Kira
is there in the room,

284
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:23,174
and he's making the
Shinigami lie on his behalf.

285
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:24,840
RYUK (VOICEOVER):
Whoa, this guy's good.

286
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:26,540
He nailed it.

287
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,874
-I don't get what he means.

288
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:30,674
So what if the Shinigami is
lying, and the rule's fake?

289
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:32,507
It doesn't really change
anything, does it?

290
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,474
-Yes, it does.

291
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,107
It means that
Light's incarceration

292
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,474
would be meaningless.

293
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:39,040
The rule says you die if you
don't continue writing names.

294
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:42,140
But if that's false, being
alive after more than 13 days

295
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:46,174
in confinement wouldn't
really prove anything.

296
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,807
-But even if that's true,
it doesn't mean he's guilty.

297
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,974
Besides, there's no way
that Light can be Kira.

298
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:52,807
Before he passed away,
the deputy director

299
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,807
himself was able to confirm
that he didn't have a notebook.

300
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,840
NEAR: If there's a
problem, I suggest

301
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:07,774
we verify the rule this way.

302
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,907
I will volunteer to write
down Mello's real name

303
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,540
in the notebook.

304
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:13,340
Of course, that means he'll die.

305
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:17,240
If I also die 13 days later,
well, then I guess Kira wins.

306
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:20,007
Either way, it's a gamble
I'm quite willing to make.

307
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,840
-What?

308
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:23,274
So this is just a game to him?

309
00:15:23,307 --> 00:15:25,307
-Testing and confirming
the 13 day rule

310
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,340
can only benefit the
Kira investigation.

311
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,140
And other than my
possible death,

312
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:30,907
there would be no drawbacks.

313
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,474
I'm willing to put
my life on the line

314
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:34,374
if it will help
us solve the case.

315
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:36,974
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): If I answer
him based on my feelings alone,

316
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:38,940
it will only make me
look worse to everyone.

317
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,840
Could you please
wait for a moment?

318
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,207
We need to discuss
your suggestion.

319
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,074
OK.

320
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:46,874
What are your thoughts?

321
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:49,740
We can say that we
must respect human life

322
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:53,974
and deny this request,
but I can't suggest that.

323
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,074
I'm the one under suspicion.

324
00:15:56,107 --> 00:15:57,274
-It's a tough call.

325
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:59,140
Mello killed the
deputy director.

326
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:01,374
If Near is willing,
I wouldn't stop him.

327
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,407
-I'm against the idea, myself.

328
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,240
I don't believe that
Kira is hiding among us.

329
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:09,307
We can't use the notebook,
no matter what happens.

330
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,607
-We should respect the deputy
director's wishes to the end.

331
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
-I feel the same.

332
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:15,274
I'm opposed to the test.

333
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,740
-Hm.

334
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,307
Near, we've talked
it over, and we

335
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,807
can't allow you to use
the notebook like that.

336
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,540
-I had a feeling
you might say so.

337
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:24,607
No matter.

338
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,074
Just one last
question before I go.

339
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:29,574
To the members of the
Japanese task force,

340
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:32,040
was there ever a point in
the investigation where

341
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,007
the second L was
suspected to be Kira,

342
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,807
even if the suspicions
were later dropped?

343
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,074
If you've been listening
to our conversation so far

344
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:41,174
and have any intention of
helping my investigation

345
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,440
in taking down Kira,
then call the number

346
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:44,974
I'm about to give you.

347
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:46,974
Day or not, I will answer.

348
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,974
The choice is up to you.

349
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,974
(VOICEOVER) There's no way
that Light could be Kira.

350
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:54,874
No, it's more like I don't
want to believe he's Kira.

351
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:58,374
But if the 13 day rule
is fake, then we really

352
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:00,507
can't say for sure
that he's innocent.

353
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,507
This could change everything.

354
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,274
[laughter]

355
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:08,640
-(VOICEOVER) Near.

356
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:10,140
I have to kill him.

357
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:17,740
[phone ringing]

358
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:18,707
-Yes?

359
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,807
Hello?

360
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,007
MODIFIED VOICE: This is Kira.

361
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,940
-Is this a joke?

362
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:24,074
MODIFIED VOICE:
If you want proof,

363
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:25,807
I can read out a list
of people that I'm

364
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,107
going to punish tomorrow.

365
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,540
That way you can check it
and make your final decision

366
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:30,707
afterwards.

367
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,540
Mr. President, I am
very grateful that you

368
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,807
and your country have
sympathized with me,

369
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,740
but I'm afraid even
that much isn't enough.

370
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:40,674
The SPK is still
trying to catch me,

371
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,774
despite your recent
announcement.

372
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,774
I want you to stop them
immediately, and formally

373
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:48,274
disband them.

374
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:52,107
At the same time, I want you
to use the American police,

375
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,307
the CIA, the FBI, and all other
law enforcement organizations

376
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,107
at your disposal to find out
where the SPK members are

377
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,307
currently hiding.

378
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,607
As soon as you've found
their base of operations,

379
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,507
I want you to forward that
information to a third party.

380
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,240
I will give you this
contact shortly.

381
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:11,574
Mr. President, whether you
live a long life or not

382
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,107
is up to you.

383
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,307
Don't forget that.

384
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,307
-I understand.

385
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,040
MAN: Mr. Demegawa,
please wait a moment.

386
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:26,307
-Why are you going to New York?

387
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,107
-We are going to crush
an organization that

388
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,574
dares to defy Kira.

389
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,007
it will be on live TV.

390
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,340
This is a direct
order from Kira,

391
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:36,507
and it came through the
President of the United States

392
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,374
himself.

393
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,674
-Huh?

394
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,374
-I don't know what's going
to happen when we get there.

395
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:42,440
Hell, I don't even know
what I'm saying anymore,

396
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:43,674
and I don't really care.

397
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,474
Sakura TV's ratings are
gonna rocket to 100-- no,

398
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:48,774
120% for this special.

399
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:50,674
Ha ha ha ha ha!

400
00:18:50,707 --> 00:18:52,440
Come on, everyone!

401
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:55,140
The new age of Kira
is about to arrive!

402
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:07,240
-(VOICEOVER) The previous
L was suspicious of Light.

403
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,574
But if Light is Kira, and
I just come out and say

404
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,640
we should investigate again,
then I'll probably end up dead,

405
00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:15,607
just like L. That
won't solve anything.

406
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,007
The 13 day rule, huh?

407
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,974
IDE: Aizawa.

408
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:20,874
-Huh?

409
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:22,440
-We have a long history.

410
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:24,407
I can tell exactly what
you're thinking about,

411
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,940
and what's bothering you.

412
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,574
Between you and me,
you should go ahead

413
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,674
and do what you think is right.

414
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:31,374
I didn't trust L to begin with.

415
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:33,040
I never did, to be honest.

416
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,907
I didn't sign up to
join the Kira task

417
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,774
force because Light
was running it.

418
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,307
I joined because I
wanted to work with you.

419
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,774
-Ide.

420
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:42,140
All right.

421
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:45,474
I'll see if I can contact Near
without letting Light know.

422
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:46,674
IDE: OK.

423
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,107
I'll make sure that no one
knows what you're doing.

424
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,140
You can count on me.

425
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:14,040
-(VOICEOVER) Light, I really
want to believe that you're not

426
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:14,540
Kira.

427
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:21,440
-This is really bad.

428
00:20:21,474 --> 00:20:22,240
Turn on the TV.

429
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:22,807
It's Demegawa!

430
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,307
-Huh?

431
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,974
-This is Demegawa live.

432
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:30,974
My comrades and I have
finally pinpointed the hideout

433
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:33,307
of the evil organization
bent on trying

434
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,840
to catch our beloved god Kira.

435
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:37,674
We now have the building
completely surrounded!

436
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:38,607
MAN: Come on out!

437
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,807
Break down the door!

438
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,407
DEMEGAWA: Right now
our enemies appear

439
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,774
to be hiding within
the building,

440
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:47,140
but they won't be able
to hide from us for long.

441
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:49,207
Behold the power of the people!

442
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,174
The power of justice!

443
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:56,474
MISA (VOICEOVER): As
soon as Near escapes, I'm

444
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,440
gonna write his name
in the notebook.

445
00:20:58,474 --> 00:20:59,374
Don't worry, Light.

446
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:01,440
I won't let you down.

447
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:03,874
-At this rate, we'll be dragged
outside unless we stop them

448
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:04,340
somehow.

449
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,607
NEAR (VOICEOVER): L.

450
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,474
-What's going on, Near?

451
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:12,574
Could it be that this is
some sort of plot by Mello

452
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:14,474
to finish off the SPK?

453
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,807
No.

454
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,474
Surely it couldn't be that
the SPK's security was so lax

455
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:22,207
that even a normal citizen could
find out where it was located.

456
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,640
NEAR (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

457
00:21:23,674 --> 00:21:27,607
He's lying through his teeth.

458
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,458
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I win, Near.

459
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:42,513
[theme music]

460
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,763
LIGHT: I can definitely
use this man.

461
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:55,130
He worships Kira from
the bottom of his heart.

462
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:56,796
He understands
that he was chosen

463
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,430
the moment he took
possession of the notebook.

464
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:02,263
There was no mistake
in my selection.
