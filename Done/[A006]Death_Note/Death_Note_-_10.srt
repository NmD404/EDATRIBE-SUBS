00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:15,642
[music playing]

2
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,943
-I have to admit I
was surprised, Ryuga.

3
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,843
I never thought you'd
asked me to play tennis

4
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:52,676
as a way to get to
know each other.

5
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,543
-Is it a problem for you?

6
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:55,643
-Not at all.

7
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:57,609
But when you first
invited me to play,

8
00:01:57,643 --> 00:01:59,476
did you know how good I was?

9
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,309
-Yes.

10
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:01,709
I'll be fine, though.

11
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:03,509
It's been a while,
but at one time

12
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:05,576
I was actually the
British junior champion.

13
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,576
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): If I
ask him if he's British,

14
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:09,776
would he think I'm trying
to find out more about him

15
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:11,109
because I'm Kira?

16
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:13,576
Oh well, can't hurt to try.

17
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:16,076
-Ryuga, were you
raised in the UK?

18
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:18,843
-I lived in England for about
five years when I was younger,

19
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:21,176
but save your breath.

20
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,943
Nothing in that story would
reveal L's true identity,

21
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,309
I promise you.

22
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:27,976
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Oh, is that so?

23
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:29,476
L: Well, since it's
out first match,

24
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:30,976
why don't we just
play a single set.

25
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:32,509
First one to six?

26
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:33,576
LIGHT: That's fine by me.

27
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,143
L (VOICEOVER): This is just
a friendly game of tennis,

28
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:43,543
nothing more.

29
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:46,543
In an of itself, it won't
determine if Light is Kira.

30
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:49,476
I'm But I know
Kira hates to lose.

31
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:00,643
L: 15-love.

32
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:02,109
-Woah, Ryuga.

33
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:03,776
You sure don't mess around.

34
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,209
-He who strikes first wins.

35
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:08,843
What do you mean you're
not at liberty to say?

36
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:11,476
-I'm very sorry, sir.

37
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:14,409
We're under orders from L not
to discuss the case with anyone,

38
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:15,743
including you.

39
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:17,943
-I'm not asking for details
here, just what you're doing

40
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:18,843
and where.

41
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:21,243
-I'm very sorry, sir.

42
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:21,743
-Hmm.

43
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:27,843
You know, Yagami, it's been
four months since this case came

44
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:30,576
to the public's attention,
and they want results.

45
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,109
People are saying that
the NPA is incompetent,

46
00:03:33,143 --> 00:03:34,409
that L is incompetent.

47
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:37,543
-With all due respect, sir,
the rest of the department

48
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,409
runs away with their
tails between their legs

49
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:40,643
and we're incompetent?

50
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,409
Do you have any
idea how many people

51
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:45,309
are left at task force
headquarters these days?

52
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:47,009
If you're concerned
with public opinion,

53
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:48,309
then you'll want to
suppress the fact

54
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:49,909
that most of our
detectives would rather

55
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:54,576
let a serial killer roam
free than risk their lives.

56
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,509
Please excuse me.

57
00:03:57,543 --> 00:04:01,109
-Yagami, what about
this L character.

58
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:02,043
Can he be trusted?

59
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:07,543
-In my opinion, he's a lot
more capable than we are.

60
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:11,276
Right now, even as we speak,
he's risking his life.

61
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,443
-Are these two really amateurs?

62
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:19,876
Who are they, anyway?

63
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:22,643
-I think their names are
Light Yagami and Hideki Ryuga.

64
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:26,743
These are the same two guys
who scored perfect on the exam.

65
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,476
L (VOICEOVER): Relax,
I'd While it's true

66
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,343
that Kira hates
losing, it's also true

67
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:32,176
that most people would
rather win than lose.

68
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,876
It's human nature.

69
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,509
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Is he going to think

70
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,309
that I'm Kira if
I go for the win?

71
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,443
I suppose I could
just lose on purpose.

72
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:41,076
But if I do, it could
work against me.

73
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:43,109
Since he'd expect
Kira to want to win,

74
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:46,909
he might also expect me to throw
the match to avoid suspicion.

75
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:49,043
I don't see any way
that he can profile me

76
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,643
based on a tennis match.

77
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:56,243
So I have to assume he has
some other goal in mind.

78
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:59,309
Either way, I'm not
going to let him win.

79
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,743
L (VOICEOVER): Look at that.

80
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:07,876
He's going for the win.

81
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,409
-That's four games all.

82
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,543
Light Yagami to serve.

83
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:17,209
-And just like that, we've got
an umpire and a line judge.

84
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,576
-You won't believe this.

85
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,809
I thought I'd heard the name
Light Yagami somewhere before,

86
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:22,009
so I checked.

87
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:24,676
He was the '02-'03 junior
high tennis champion.

88
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,076
Apparently, during the
third year awards ceremony,

89
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,043
he announced that he was
hanging up his racket.

90
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:31,576
And I guess he hasn't
played competitively since.

91
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:32,476
-Hey, hey.

92
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:33,776
What about my Ryuga.

93
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,809
Don't tell me you haven't
noticed him holding his own

94
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:39,443
against this former
junior high champ.

95
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:41,876
L (VOICEOVER): I can see the
wheels turning, Light Yagami.

96
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,576
I'm already in your head.

97
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,943
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
There's no way

98
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,909
this tennis match will
deepen our friendship.

99
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:49,476
This is a token gesture,
an elaborate act

100
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,776
we'll go through so we
can say we're closer.

101
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,109
L (VOICEOVER): Because I
wanted to play tennis with you,

102
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:56,809
you'll assume that I'm preparing
to take a step closer, laying

103
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:59,776
the groundwork to get
to know you better.

104
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:02,243
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): And then
you're going to try and trap me

105
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:04,676
by getting me to say something
that only Kira would know.

106
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,643
L (VOICEOVER): However,
I'm sure you'll tell me

107
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:08,476
you need to know if
you can trust me first.

108
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,343
And of course, the only
way to win your trust

109
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:13,043
will be to share what
I know about Kira.

110
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:15,509
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): If you want
me to discuss Kira with you,

111
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,976
it only makes sense that I'd
want to ask for proof that you

112
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,476
are in charge of
the investigation

113
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,109
and, more importantly,
that you are really L,

114
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:23,176
as you say you are.

115
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,576
L (VOICEOVER): So it
goes without saying

116
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:27,776
that the first thing you're
going to want from me is--

117
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,843
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Some
kind of confirmation

118
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:33,143
from a third party that you
really are L. Which means--

119
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,609
LIGHT AND L
(VOICEOVER): We'll have

120
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:36,776
to go to task
force headquarters.

121
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,143
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
In all things,

122
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:40,343
one cannot win
with defense alone.

123
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:42,209
To win, you must attack!

124
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:48,343
-Game and set won
by Light Yagami!

125
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:49,776
Six games to four.

126
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,943
[applause]

127
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,476
-Just as I expected,
you beat me.

128
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,109
-It's been a while since
I had to play that hard.

129
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,876
I'm feeling kind
of thirsty, plus

130
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:06,143
there's something I
wanted to ask you about.

131
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,709
You want to go
somewhere for drink?

132
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,809
-You humored me
with a tennis match.

133
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:12,809
The least I can do is answer
some of your questions.

134
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:15,276
But before this conversation
goes any further,

135
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,876
there's something
I must tell you.

136
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:19,043
-What's that?

137
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:23,043
-I suspect that you, Light
Yagami, are in fact Kira.

138
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,943
Now, if you still want
to ask me something,

139
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:25,876
then please go ahead.

140
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,843
-You think I'm Kira?

141
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:36,643
-Well, when I say I suspect
you, it's only a 1% possibility.

142
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:39,276
But that aside, I don't mind
telling you that once I'm sure

143
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,276
you aren't Kira and I can verify
that your deductive skills are

144
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:43,876
as strong as I
think they are, I'd

145
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,309
like nothing more
than to have you

146
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:46,709
work with me on
this investigation.

147
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,476
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): 1%, huh?

148
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,943
That was well worded
because no matter

149
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,876
how little he says
he suspects me,

150
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,709
it means he has
grounds to prevent me

151
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:01,009
from meeting anyone
on the task force.

152
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:03,576
It's quite the preemptive
move on his part.

153
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,543
He got me.

154
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:11,209
-This coffee shop is one of
my favorites in the area.

155
00:08:11,243 --> 00:08:13,009
And if we sit here,
there's no chance

156
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:14,943
of anyone overhearing us.

157
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,476
-Thanks for showing
me this place.

158
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:18,076
I can see why you like it.

159
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:19,943
-Not to mention we're
so out of the way here,

160
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:21,543
no one's going to
give you a hard time

161
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:22,743
about the way you sit.

162
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:24,809
-I don't sit like this
because I want to.

163
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:26,209
I have to sit like this.

164
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:27,643
You see, if I were
to sit normally,

165
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,176
my deductive skills
would immediately

166
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,076
be reduced by roughly 40%.

167
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:34,509
So what was it you
wanted to ask me?

168
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:35,509
LIGHT: Right.

169
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:37,009
I'm sure that can
wait until you're

170
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,643
convinced that I'm not Kira.

171
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:41,976
So please, let's talk
about whatever you want to.

172
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:43,743
-You're under no
obligation to do this,

173
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:45,443
but would you mind
submitting yourself

174
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:48,309
to a test of your
deductive reasoning skills?

175
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:49,843
-Sure, why not?

176
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,376
Sounds like fun.

177
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,576
-All right, then.

178
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,543
We can begin by taking
a look at these.

179
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:59,943
Photographs of three notes
written by prison inmates

180
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:02,676
while under Kira's control
just prior to their deaths.

181
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,609
None of this information
has been made public.

182
00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:07,776
You can take as long as
you want to look them over.

183
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:11,443
Please let me know
what you think.

184
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,276
-Very interesting.

185
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:15,309
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Come
on, this is child's plays.

186
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:16,743
There's a print
number on the back

187
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:19,109
of each of these photographs.

188
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,843
If I ignore this fact and
was still able to come up

189
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:25,043
with the phrase, "L do you know
gods of death love apples?"

190
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,809
what would that mean?

191
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:29,009
Clearly, if I read it
the way Kira intended

192
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:32,076
on my first attempt, I'd
only look more suspicious.

193
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:34,276
But the fact that I'm able
to solve this silly code

194
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:37,843
isn't enough on its own
to prove that I'm Kira.

195
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:40,676
-It would be quite amazing to
learn that not only could Kira

196
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:44,143
kill others but could also
control his victim's actions.

197
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,676
I think Kira wrote
these, and it seems

198
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,243
he's encoded a message for
you, as well, almost as if he's

199
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:49,743
mocking you.

200
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:52,509
If you line these notes up
side-by-side and take a look

201
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:55,276
at the first letter of every
line, it reveals a message.

202
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:59,409
Rearranging it like
this gives you,

203
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:04,543
"L, do you know gods
of death love apples."

204
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:06,376
But there are
obvious print numbers

205
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:08,243
on the back of all
these photographs.

206
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:11,343
Arrange it in that
order, we get,

207
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:16,209
"L, do you know love
apples gods of death."

208
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:17,809
That doesn't sound right.

209
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:19,443
And based on that,
it's hard to believe

210
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:21,943
that Kira would have wanted
you to read it this way.

211
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,076
-That's incorrect.

212
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:24,876
-Huh?

213
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:27,976
-The thing is, there are
actually four photographs.

214
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,809
When we add this
one, it reads, "L,

215
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:36,409
do you know gods of death who
love apples have red hands."

216
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:37,843
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): It's a fake.

217
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,709
I never made any
criminal write the letter

218
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,176
in this fourth picture.

219
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:43,376
Is he stupid?

220
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,743
-But seeing as I only had
three photographs to work with,

221
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,076
my deduction was perfect.

222
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:48,409
-No, it wasn't.

223
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:50,543
The truth is there
were four of them.

224
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:54,209
If you'd figured that out,
it would've been perfect.

225
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:56,243
Even though you knew the
message was incomplete,

226
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:59,376
you decided that there
were only three notes.

227
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,743
You never even considered
that there might be a fourth.

228
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:03,543
What do you make of that?

229
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:04,943
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Damn him.

230
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,909
This wasn't just about gauging
my deductive reasoning skills.

231
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:09,709
He wanted to see what
my reaction would be.

232
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:11,443
If I keep falling
for his tricks,

233
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:14,309
I'll be playing
right into his hands.

234
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:15,709
-Hmm.

235
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:16,809
Well, you got me there.

236
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,209
I didn't think of that.

237
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,843
In any case, the likelihood this
message will lead you to Kira

238
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,176
is not very great.

239
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,643
Besides, we all know gods
of death don't exist.

240
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:27,509
-If you were me, faced with
someone who might be Kira,

241
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,843
how would you go about
establishing this person's

242
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:30,943
innocence or guilt?

243
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:33,143
You need to be absolutely sure.

244
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:34,576
-I would probably
try to get them

245
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,076
to say something
that was never made

246
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:39,409
public in any way, something
that only Kira could know.

247
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:41,876
Kind of like what you
were doing just now.

248
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,909
-Truly amazing.

249
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:46,709
What's incredible is that I've
asked countless detectives

250
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:48,776
that same question, and
it took most of them

251
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,443
minutes to even come
up with an answer.

252
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,309
But you?

253
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:54,676
You immediately
thought of a scenario

254
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,676
in which Kira is speaking
directly to the investigator.

255
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,576
I'm impressed.

256
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:03,209
You'll make a fine
detective, Light.

257
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:05,243
-But it's a bit of a
double-edged sword.

258
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:08,343
The more impressive my answers,
the more of a suspect I become.

259
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:08,976
L: Yes.

260
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,076
It's about 3% now.

261
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:14,209
However, it's made me
that much more determined

262
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:17,276
to work with you on
this investigation.

263
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:20,476
You see, I'm in a position
where even if you are Kira,

264
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:22,343
it would still be to
my benefit to have

265
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,009
you working alongside us.

266
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,109
Do you know why I'd say that?

267
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,543
-If I cooperate
with you, there's

268
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:31,609
a chance I can help the
investigation to move forward.

269
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:34,609
And if I'm Kira, I
might reveal myself.

270
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:36,309
In other words, whether
I'm Kira or not,

271
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:38,576
you stand to gain either way.

272
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:40,709
It's a very smart
move on your part.

273
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:43,009
But I think you might be
getting the wrong idea.

274
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,443
It's true that I do have an
interest in the Kira case.

275
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:48,609
And yes, detective work
is a hobby of mine.

276
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,409
But I know that I'm not Kira.

277
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:52,443
And I certainly don't
want to be killed by him.

278
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,609
Besides, what proof have
you been able to give me

279
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,776
that you yourself aren't Kira?

280
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,909
I mean, it hardly seems
fair for just one of us

281
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:00,876
to be investigated,
wouldn't you say?

282
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:04,309
At this point, neither of us
can prove that we're not Kira.

283
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:06,243
However, if you are
in fact L, I don't

284
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:08,676
imagine it would be that hard
for you to prove it to me.

285
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,643
I think I'd be convinced if,
say, my father or someone

286
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:13,176
else from the task
force headquarters

287
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,576
was able to confirm
your identity.

288
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,243
If you can't do
that, then I'm afraid

289
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:20,243
I just won't be
able to help you.

290
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:22,876
L (VOICEOVER): You sure
talk a lot, don't you Light?

291
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,176
Typical for someone
who hates losing.

292
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:27,209
We've got 7%.

293
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:30,243
Could it really be him?

294
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,309
-I don't remember saying
you couldn't meet anyone

295
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:36,043
from task force headquarters
to verify my identity.

296
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:38,843
I'm currently working alongside
your father, as well as

297
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:42,076
several other senior
detectives from the NPA.

298
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:43,643
Now, if I understand
you correctly

299
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:45,809
and I take you to task
force headquarters,

300
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:47,609
you'll help us with
the investigation.

301
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,609
Am I safe in making
this assumption?

302
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,743
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Does
this guy have a death wish?

303
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:53,576
I don't understand.

304
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:54,776
What's he thinking?

305
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:56,709
[phone ringing]

306
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:58,676
-Excuse me.

307
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,476
-Oh, there goes mine.

308
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:02,676
-Yes?

309
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,376
WATARI (ON PHONE): Ryuzaki
I have some bad news.

310
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,476
SACHIKO YAGAMI (ON PHONE):
Light, your father is--

311
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,709
-Light, it's your--

312
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:10,043
-My father!

313
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:11,343
He had a heart attack!

314
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,800
[sirens]

315
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,300
SACHIKO YAGAMI: OK,
see you tomorrow.

316
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,067
Have them call home if you
need me to bring anything.

317
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,800
Light?

318
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,967
You take care of him, OK?

319
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,467
LIGHT: Sure.

320
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:44,233
So the doctors think
stress was the only cause?

321
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,600
-Yeah.

322
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,867
To be honest, I thought it was
Kira when I first collapsed.

323
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,200
But I'll be all right.

324
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:52,467
It seems I've been pushing
myself a bit too hard lately.

325
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,400
-Indeed.

326
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,633
It must have added
to your stress

327
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,967
knowing that Light is a
suspect in this investigation.

328
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,867
-You actually told
my father that?

329
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,800
-Yes.

330
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,000
In fact, I've told
him everything.

331
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:02,767
It's true.

332
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,567
He even knows that I am L.

333
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
-That's correct.

334
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:11,867
This man is L. To protect his
identity, we on the task force

335
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,800
refer to him as Ryuzaki.

336
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,633
But make no mistake.

337
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,433
It's him.

338
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,300
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
This guy is the real L.

339
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,667
My father wouldn't lie.

340
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,200
The very same man who's been
controlling the police up

341
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:23,600
to this point.

342
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:27,400
If I get rid of him and the rest
of the investigative team-- no.

343
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:28,567
No, let's face it.

344
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,667
It wouldn't be that simple.

345
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,167
There's no need to rush.

346
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,867
I have time to sit
back and watch.

347
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,833
But for now, I'm
the Light Yagami

348
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:39,333
who's worried for his father.

349
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:42,500
-So, Ryuzaki, now that
you've had the chance

350
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,367
to talk to my son, is
he cleared as a suspect?

351
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,833
-When I say I suspect him, you
should know it's very minor.

352
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:51,200
We've gone over this, but
I'll explain it again.

353
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,967
Not long ago, Kira
killed 12 FBI agents

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,500
who'd come to
Japan to assist us.

355
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:58,067
They were instructed
to follow people

356
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,833
connected to the
Japanese police.

357
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,400
One of these
agents, Raye Penber,

358
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:07,200
exhibited unusual
behavior before he died.

359
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,133
-I understand, and I was one
of the people Raye Penber was

360
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,233
investigating before he died.

361
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,100
It only makes sense
I'd be a suspect.

362
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:15,467
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Nope.

363
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,400
To be more precise, there's
no one else you could suspect.

364
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:22,600
-I find Light's deductive
powers quite impressive.

365
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,900
He's always quick
and to the point.

366
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,567
-Ryuga, I'd like to help
with the investigation.

367
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,200
My father has
erased any doubts I

368
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,933
might have regarding
your true identity.

369
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,167
Also, I'd like nothing
more than to catch Kira

370
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,400
so I can prove once and
for all that I'm not him.

371
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,467
-No, Light.

372
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,033
This is a time in
your life when you

373
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,767
should be studying to
become a police officer.

374
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,400
It won't be to late to
join us once you are done.

375
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,333
-Come on, Dad, what
are you talking about?

376
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,600
Who knows how many
years that'll take.

377
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,333
Besides, don't you
remember my promise?

378
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:55,300
That if something
ever happened to you,

379
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,367
I would find Kira and make
sure he gets executed.

380
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,900
SOICHIRO YAGAMI
(VOICEOVER): I refuse

381
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:04,367
to believe that my son
could turn out to be Kira.

382
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,900
L (VOICEOVER): This doesn't
seem like an act to me.

383
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:10,300
Or if it is, it's too cheesy.

384
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,033
SOICHIRO YAGAMI:
Light, listen to me.

385
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,933
Kira is pure evil.

386
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,833
We can all agree on that.

387
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,600
But recently, I've
started thinking

388
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:21,733
of this whole situation
in a different way.

389
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:25,467
What is truly evil is
the power to kill people.

390
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,400
And any person who has come
to possess this kind of power

391
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:29,867
is cursed.

392
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,100
No matter how you use
it, no true happiness

393
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:38,167
can be obtained like that,
not by killing other people.

394
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,933
L: I think you're
absolutely right.

395
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:44,000
If Kira is just a normal
person who somehow obtained

396
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:48,067
this awful power, I would
say that he's cursed.

397
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,533
-Ryuzaki, I'm sorry
for all this trouble.

398
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,933
But I'll be back at work as
soon as the doctors let me out

399
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,200
of here.

400
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:57,400
-Excuse me, visiting hours
were over 10 minutes ago.

401
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,400
-Ryuga, what would
it take to get

402
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,033
you to believe
that I'm not Kira.

403
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,433
Please, isn't there something?

404
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,233
-If you aren't Kira,
it won't be necessary.

405
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,800
Let things run their course
and the truth will be revealed.

406
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,633
-I can't take this anymore!

407
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:18,933
Put yourself in my position.

408
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,167
How do you think it feels
to be accused of being Kira?

409
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,500
-It was one of the
worst feelings ever.

410
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,300
-What if you were to
lock me up for a month

411
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,867
in a place with no TV or
any other kind of access

412
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,967
to the outside world and keep
a constant watch over me?

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,567
L (VOICEOVER): Would
any normal person

414
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,867
be willing to go to such extreme
measures to clear their name?

415
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,933
-That's no good.

416
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:41,633
I can't do anything
that would deprive you

417
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,233
of basic human rights.

418
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:46,467
And furthermore, it is complete
nonsense for the investigator

419
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,700
to take suggestions
from the suspect.

420
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:51,033
-I understand.

421
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:53,133
L: Don't worry so much.

422
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,267
Be patient.

423
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,200
It'll become apparent to
us if you're not Kira.

424
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,633
And listening to that
conversation between you

425
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:02,900
and your father, I was almost
convinced you might not be him.

426
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,700
Light, please take good
care of Mr. Yagami.

427
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,300
-Oh, one more thing.

428
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,367
I know I agreed to help
with the investigation.

429
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
But I don't think
I'll be able to do

430
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,200
much until my father's
healthy again.

431
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,967
-Yes, of course.

432
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,933
Well, then.

433
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,633
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Hideki Ryuga.

434
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,567
Ryuzaki.

435
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,167
He's the L I've been
fighting this whole time.

436
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,233
But what is his real name?

437
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,200
L (VOICEOVER): Light Yagami.

438
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,600
Are you not Kira?

439
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,433
-Ryuk.

440
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,800
-Huh?

441
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,700
-I never once felt cursed since
I picked up the death note.

442
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:45,067
In fact, the thought never
even crossed my mind.

443
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,467
I'm happier than I've ever
been, all thanks to this power.

444
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm going to create
a perfect world.

445
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,300
RYUK: Honestly,
I could care less

446
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,467
whether you feel cursed or
happy to have a notebook.

447
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,867
I'll leave that sentimental
crap to you humans.

448
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,967
But normally, humans who come
into contact with the Shinigami

449
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,833
have nothing but misfortune.

450
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:10,233
[music playing]

451
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:11,700
-That's interesting.

452
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:16,167
But I have no intentions
of repeating that pattern.

453
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,667
-Well, I hope you're
right about that.

454
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,267
HITOSHI DEMEGAWA:
What is this crap?

455
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,000
Don't tell me this is
your idea of a proposal.

456
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:27,000
Listen, you people must think
that just mentioning Kira's

457
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,367
name is enough to get us
the ratings we need, huh?

458
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,700
Well, you're wrong.

459
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,967
Our program gets the ratings
because we cover the stories

460
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,467
that the other
stations won't touch.

461
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,900
If it bleeds, it leads.

462
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:40,367
What I need is a good
freaking story, not this crap.

463
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,633
Now get out there
and fine me a story.

464
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,567
-But the police won't talk, sir.

465
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,967
It's been impossible to get
details from them lately.

466
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,833
-Idiot!

467
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,233
I don't pay you to complain.

468
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,733
If they won't give you
anything, then get creative!

469
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:52,733
[knocking]

470
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:53,700
Huh?

471
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:55,733
-Mr. Demegawa, sir?

472
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,967
This is for you.

473
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,100
HITOSHI DEMEGAWA: What is it?

474
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,400
So who is this from?

475
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:02,867
Huh?

476
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,700
Now this is more like it.

477
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:12,300
This is what I call a story.

478
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,433
It's almost too good to be true.

479
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,833
A message to the
world from Kira--

480
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:19,900
"if you do not
broadcast these tapes,

481
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:23,767
I will kill your company's
board of directors one by one."

482
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,367
Who wouldn't air these?

483
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,567
If this is for real,
our ratings are

484
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,167
going to go through the roof.

485
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,567
Holy crap!

486
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,267
I'm so excited I feel like I'm
having a heart attack here!

487
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:41,351
[music playing]

488
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:52,506
LIGHT: If I just leave
things as they are,

489
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,306
I'm pretty sure that
L will be finished off

490
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,040
within the next four days.

491
00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:58,406
It looks like I've even
got God on my side now.

492
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,673
I suppose it's actually a
god of death, a Shinigami.
