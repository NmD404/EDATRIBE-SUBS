1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,866
[opening theme song]

2
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:40,315
SOICHIRO (ON PHONE):
Light, there's

3
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:42,282
another message from
the second Kira.

4
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:44,222
It was sent to Sakura TV
and we intercepted it.

5
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:46,756
I'm told it's a video
and a journal this time.

6
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:49,356
Anyway, I figured
I should tell you.

7
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:50,556
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): A journal?

8
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:52,556
What is that idiot up to now?

9
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:53,689
Why can't he just wait?

10
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,922
-He wanted the
journal shown on TV?

11
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:01,456
-Yes.

12
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,356
This is it.

13
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,256
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Hmm.

14
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,889
2006?

15
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:09,256
These entries are
from last year.

16
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,456
-Please take a look at the
entry he made on the 30th.

17
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:13,489
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Hmm.

18
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:16,989
"Confirmed our shinigami
at the Tokyo Dome."

19
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:18,422
This is probably
supposed to mean

20
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:20,922
that he plans to do
this on May 30th.

21
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:23,056
If this were aired
on TV, his intentions

22
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:25,422
would be obvious to
anyone who sees it.

23
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:26,922
-[laughs]

24
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:29,122
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Besides,
he can't see my shinigami

25
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:30,622
unless he touches my Death Note.

26
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:31,856
How's he planning to do that?

27
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:39,156
-Hey, Rem?

28
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,289
REM: Hmm?

29
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:41,289
-I forget.

30
00:02:41,322 --> 00:02:42,956
Why can't I see my
own lifespan even

31
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:44,189
though I have shinigami eyes?

32
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:47,356
Do you think you
could tell me again?

33
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,756
-Humans with shinigami
eyes only need

34
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,389
to know the lifespan
of their victims.

35
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,156
And just as we can't see the
lifespan of others of our kind,

36
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:58,589
humans who possess a
Death Note cannot see each

37
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:01,122
other's lifespan,
even with the eyes.

38
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:03,756
-Hmm.

39
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,089
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): "May 22nd.

40
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:07,856
My friend and I showed off
our notebooks in Aoyama."

41
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,822
If by "notebooks" he's
referring to our Death Notes,

42
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,256
that's something that could
only be understood by me.

43
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,022
And as for the
police, they'll be

44
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:17,389
distracted by the
May 30th entry.

45
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:19,822
"We confirmed our shinigami
at the baseball game

46
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:21,089
in the Tokyo Dome.

47
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:23,722
It must've been
intended for them.

48
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:26,256
I'm almost positive that the
real message from this diary

49
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,322
is the one regarding Aoyama.

50
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:31,756
But if that's the case-- hmm.

51
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:32,756
-What do you think?

52
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,489
Is it real?

53
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:37,989
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I have to
be careful not to say too much.

54
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:41,189
Better to wait and hear
his opinion, first.

55
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,689
-At this point in time,
all I can say for sure

56
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:44,989
is, he must be stupid.

57
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:46,456
-Yeah, I agree.

58
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,089
I mean it's
completely obvious he

59
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:49,956
wants to meet Kira
at the home game.

60
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,322
-Doesn't he
understand what would

61
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,122
happen if we aired this message?

62
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:54,822
It would create an
immediate panic,

63
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:56,956
and the game would
have to be canceled.

64
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,422
-To be honest, it's so
stupid, I'm not even sure

65
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:06,256
how to deal with this
whole situation anymore.

66
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,989
If we make the diary
public, then we'll

67
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:10,422
be forced to make some kind
of televised announcement

68
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,589
canceling the game on the 30th.

69
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:14,189
But if we don't
broadcast it, we can

70
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,656
be sure the second
Kira won't do anything.

71
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,456
-Won't canceling the
game make him angry?

72
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,422
There's no telling
what he'll do.

73
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:22,322
-Frankly, that's
not a big concern.

74
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:24,189
From what we've witnessed,
it's safe to say

75
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,222
the second Kira
admires the real one.

76
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,189
He gave his word to
the Kira we invented

77
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:30,389
that he'd refrain from
killing aimlessly.

78
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,756
I'm inclined to believe that.

79
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,222
I say we make it
public, and we air

80
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:37,722
an announcement
canceling the game.

81
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:39,856
At the same time we'll
announce that, on May 30th,

82
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:41,222
we're going to
set up checkpoints

83
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:44,122
on all roads leading
to the Tokyo Dome.

84
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:46,256
And finally, we'll
send a response

85
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,622
from our invented Kira.

86
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:51,122
Something like, I understand,
and I agree to meet you there.

87
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:54,222
-Ryuzaki, you don't honestly
expect him to go there

88
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:57,156
if we set up checkpoints
around the dome, do you?

89
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:59,389
I don't think that Kira
would even consider it.

90
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:02,322
But it's possible
the other one might.

91
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:05,556
It all depends on how
stupid he really is.

92
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:09,689
However, assuming he's not
actually the idiot we think is,

93
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:11,756
there could be
another message hidden

94
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:15,456
in this diary, one
that's not so obvious.

95
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:18,222
If there's a message
written in some code

96
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:21,789
that only people who have this
shinigami power can understand,

97
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,356
there'd be no way for
me to decipher it.

98
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,922
Still, it would only
make sense for us

99
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:29,289
to look into all the places that
were mentioned in the journal.

100
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:32,722
Uh, 22nd, he's meeting
a friend in Aoyama.

101
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:36,389
24th, meeting another
friend in Shibuya.

102
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:38,456
We have to be prepared
for the possibility

103
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,522
that all of our efforts
will be fruitless.

104
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:43,389
Let's keep an eye out for
people with notebooks in Aoyama

105
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:46,722
and people in clothing
stores in Shibuya.

106
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,256
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
It's as I thought.

107
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,889
If this phony Kira slips
up and gets apprehended,

108
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:53,556
at the very least I have
to obtain his notebook.

109
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,489
And in the worst
case, I may end up

110
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,856
having to kill everyone there.

111
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,122
-All we can do is place
more surveillance cameras

112
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:02,889
in Aoyama and
Shibuya in the hopes

113
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:04,289
that we might capture somebody.

114
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,456
We should also arrange to
have undercover officers

115
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,589
in both locations
on these dates.

116
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:10,922
I should probably go
to Aoyama and Shibuya

117
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:14,256
since I blend in with
the crowd there, ya know?

118
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,322
-I'll go, too.

119
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,556
-But, Light--

120
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,689
-I'll be all right.

121
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:18,856
Don't worry.

122
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,256
Aoyama and Shibuya are
places I'd go anyway.

123
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,122
Not to mention,
out of all of us,

124
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:25,589
I'd probably look the most
natural hanging out with Matsui

125
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:26,756
there.

126
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:28,956
Besides, the second Kira
will be there looking

127
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,256
for Kira, not for the police.

128
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,322
LIGHT: OK, we'll talk more
about our trips tomorrow.

129
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,489
MATSUDA: Sounds good, Light.

130
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:40,656
See you tomorrow.

131
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:41,556
Careful getting home.

132
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:49,189
[phone ringing]

133
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:50,656
-Uh?

134
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,289
[sighs] It never fails.

135
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:54,522
The second I'm out the door,
my phone starts ringing.

136
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,656
Yes?

137
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,989
L (ON PHONE): It's Ryuzaki.

138
00:06:57,022 --> 00:06:58,422
When you two are
working together,

139
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:01,089
I want you to keep a close
eye on Light the entire time.

140
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:04,056
And please keep this
between you and me.

141
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,422
-Uh, sure.

142
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:06,222
Yeah, I understand.

143
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:10,822
I guess he still plans
to investigate Light

144
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:15,422
until the probability that
he's Kira reaches zero.

145
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:16,656
-I'm home.

146
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:17,622
-Hello, dear.

147
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:19,056
You're back quite late today.

148
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,389
-Yeah.

149
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:21,956
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I'm supposed
to keep the fact that I'm

150
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:24,556
helping with the Kira
investigation a secret.

151
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:27,656
-Uh, It's because I was
hanging out my girlfriend.

152
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:28,622
-Your?

153
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,522
SAYU:
[excited scream and giggle]

154
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:30,456
What?

155
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,522
Light, you have a
girlfriend, now?

156
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:32,456
What's her name?

157
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:33,622
-It's not that surprising.

158
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,622
I'm 18 and I'm in
university now.

159
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,522
Of course I have a girlfriend.

160
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,656
You should look for
a boyfriend, Sayu.

161
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,189
-Huh?

162
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:41,022
A boyfriend?

163
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:42,856
What's that supposed to mean?

164
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:45,122
-Light, aren't you going
to have any dinner?

165
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:47,989
-Actually, I'm still full from
room service at the hotel.

166
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:50,556
--[squeal] I can't believe
you just said that to Mom.

167
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:51,989
So what's this about a hotel?

168
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:55,122
Sounds pretty suspicious.

169
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:56,856
-OK, Ryuk.

170
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,122
We need to have a little talk.

171
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:00,389
-Ah, should've known.

172
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:03,589
-And I'd appreciate an
answer, if you could.

173
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:06,289
If two shinigami happen to
meet in the human world,

174
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:08,189
are they allowed to
speak to each other?

175
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,789
-Hard to say.

176
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,756
As long as I'm
attached to a human,

177
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:13,789
I'd say it's against
the rules, unless I

178
00:08:13,822 --> 00:08:16,489
had their permission, first.

179
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:18,789
But there's no laws
against it either,

180
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:21,656
so I guess it's possible
that another shinigami might

181
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:22,989
talk to me.

182
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,656
-So does that mean that if
this fake Kira's shinigami were

183
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,189
to see you, there's
a chance he might

184
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:28,689
mention the fact
that you're with me

185
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:30,422
and reveal that I'm Kira?

186
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:34,056
-They probably wouldn't, but it
depends on their personality.

187
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:36,022
-And if this kind of
situation did arise,

188
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:38,956
I can assume that you'll
act the way you normally do?

189
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:40,289
-Yeah.

190
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:42,756
Even if I see another
human with a shinigami,

191
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,522
I'm not going to tell you.

192
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:47,356
-Well, I definitely think
you've got the right approach.

193
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:48,022
-Meh.

194
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:49,789
Thanks.

195
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,022
-Huh?

196
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:52,289
There's no way.

197
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,722
Did he really think
this far ahead?

198
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:56,356
-What is it?

199
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,422
-Aoyama is a big area.

200
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,222
I was searching for
possible meeting places

201
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:02,422
when I stumbled across this.

202
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:05,122
On the 22nd, there's
a big event going

203
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:08,089
on at a club in Aoyama
called the Note Blue.

204
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:12,522
Aoyama-- "blue mountain."
"Note" and "blue"-- it's a code.

205
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:13,656
-Well, well.

206
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:16,022
If you ask me, that's
pretty elaborate.

207
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,656
-He might be smarter
than I thought.

208
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:22,889
Which means I'll have to be that
much more careful from now on.

209
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:24,456
In any case, this
Note Blue place

210
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:26,422
is definitely
worth checking out.

211
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,056
-What's the point in
going there if you

212
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,922
don't want him to find
out that you're Kira?

213
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,489
You really think
it's worth the risk?

214
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:42,822
-Uh, excuse me, Light?

215
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:44,189
So what's going on here?

216
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:45,256
-Oh.

217
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:46,956
These are some of my
friends from school.

218
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:48,256
[shy laughter]

219
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,522
-Nice to meet you.

220
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,122
-This is my cousin, Taro.

221
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:52,589
It's his first
time ever in Tokyo,

222
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,689
and he wants to see
Aoyama and Roppongi,

223
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:57,389
so I figured the least we could
do is show him a good time.

224
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:58,789
I'm counting on you guys.

225
00:09:58,822 --> 00:09:59,956
Oh, yeah.

226
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,722
He also told me he's
looking for a girlfriend,

227
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:04,256
so does anyone
want to volunteer?

228
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:07,289
-Hey, I never said that.

229
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:09,056
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER):
I'm impressed, Light.

230
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:11,722
I doubt that anyone would ever
suspect that there was a police

231
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,589
detective hanging around
with these students.

232
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:19,856
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): With all of
us walking together like this,

233
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,956
even if Ryuk is
seen, no one would

234
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,522
be able to tell which
one of us he's following.

235
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:28,089
It's also a defense against
L's surveillance cameras.

236
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:30,356
Not such a bad way to
investigate, really.

237
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:32,889
I just have so stay
relaxed and keep an eye

238
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:34,822
on the entrance of the
Note Blue when it opens.

239
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:43,889
MISA (VOICEOVER): Found you!

240
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:54,222
Moon Yagami, is it?

241
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:57,622
You're the only one whose
lifespan I can't see.

242
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:58,956
He's Kira.

243
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:00,056
I can't believe it.

244
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,489
I never thought it would
be this easy to find him.

245
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:09,822
-All right, Rem.

246
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:10,822
Time to go.

247
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,122
-Huh.

248
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:14,322
You finally found him and
now you just want to leave?

249
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:16,589
-Well, I can't go up to
him and say, "Hi, Kira!

250
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:17,756
Nice to meet you.

251
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,489
I'm the one who sent
you the messages,"

252
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,322
with all these people around.

253
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:25,356
I know his name now, so I can
easily find out all about him.

254
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,422
After all, it's
such a unique name.

255
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:41,928
[music playing]

256
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:49,377
-Ohh, It's written as
"Moon" but read as "Light."

257
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,044
Light Yagami.

258
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,010
He sure is amazing.

259
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,910
Look at all this stuff.

260
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,544
He won the national
tennis championship

261
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:58,344
when he was in his second and
third years of junior high.

262
00:11:58,377 --> 00:12:01,344
He gave an address as freshman
representative at this year's

263
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:04,210
entrance ceremony
at To-Oh University.

264
00:12:04,244 --> 00:12:06,210
I can't find a picture
of him, but there

265
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:08,644
won't be anyone else with
a name like Light Yagami.

266
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:10,410
MISA (VOICEOVER): Who
would've ever thought

267
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:13,044
that Kira would be so
young and handsome?

268
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:15,410
Everything about him is
better than I imagined.

269
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,344
I can't believe how easy it was
to purchase this information.

270
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:20,277
The world sure is a scary place.

271
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,877
I even know his
home address now.

272
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,110
-So we were there both days, in
Aoyama on the 22nd and Shibuya

273
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:30,977
on the 24th, and we observed
nothing of significance

274
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,110
on either occasion.

275
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:35,210
That leaves us with only
the Dome on the 30th.

276
00:12:35,244 --> 00:12:36,610
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I didn't notice

277
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:39,677
anyone who looked
suspicious at the Note Blue.

278
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,077
Was he serious about the Dome?

279
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,444
[beeping]

280
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:45,777
WATARI (ON LAPTOP): Ryuzaki,
apparently Sakura TV has just

281
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,610
received another message
from the second Kira.

282
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,310
It was postmarked on the 23rd.

283
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:55,610
-I'm happy to say that
I have found Kira.

284
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,844
To all the people at
the television station

285
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,044
and the police department, I'd
like to thank you very much.

286
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:02,044
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Huh?

287
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:03,844
I- Impossible!

288
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:05,577
Where, in Aoyama?

289
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,510
His shinigami.

290
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:10,510
It must have seen Ryuk and
picked me out of the crowd.

291
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:11,910
No!

292
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:14,010
No, there's no way he could've
known who Ryuk was attached to.

293
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,410
I checked repeatedly that
no one was following me.

294
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:19,710
L (VOICEOVER): If this is
true, the only possible event

295
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:22,777
that would correspond with this
tape being mailed on the 23rd

296
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,610
is the entry regarding
Aoyama on the 22nd.

297
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:28,144
The only ones from the
taskforce who went to Aoyama

298
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:30,444
are Matsuda and Light Yagami.

299
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,277
Is Light really Kira after all?

300
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,844
Still, there's no proof it
even happened in Aoyama.

301
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:37,844
-This is a disaster
if he found him.

302
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:39,044
-Yeah.

303
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:40,744
It most likely means that
the two Kiras are now

304
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,310
cooperating with each other.

305
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:45,410
-At this point, I don't think we
should jump to any conclusions.

306
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:47,210
The second Kira is
only saying that he

307
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,844
found him, nothing more.

308
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:52,444
He may not have
made contact yet.

309
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:56,444
Now that it's come
to this-- --we

310
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:58,810
have no choice but to
communicate as the police

311
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:00,810
directly with the second Kira.

312
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,710
-You want to send a message?

313
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:03,910
-Yes.

314
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,677
The police need to
reach out to the copycat

315
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,977
and offer him a deal.

316
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,677
We need to negotiate
with him to see

317
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,810
if we can get Kira's real name.

318
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:16,244
--[laughs] That's the last thing
you wanted to hear, right?

319
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:17,710
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
This isn't good.

320
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:20,210
I have no idea how the fake
Kira will react to this.

321
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:22,510
But I have no means
of stopping the police

322
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:24,577
from sending this message.

323
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,610
TV ANNOUNCER: If Kira
doesn't yet know your name,

324
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:28,277
it may not be too
late for you, provided

325
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,010
you are willing to cooperate.

326
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:33,377
Whatever you do, you must not
approach Kira out of curiosity.

327
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,910
Make no mistake-- Kira will
kill you if you contact him.

328
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,510
You'll be used and disposed of.

329
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:41,044
Consider your own
life for a moment.

330
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:44,044
Yours, like every other
life, has an intrinsic value.

331
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:45,877
Now is your chance
to right past wrongs

332
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,144
by sharing what you
know about Kira.

333
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:51,677
Only you can help us bring
his reign of terror to an end.

334
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,177
-Hmm.

335
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,210
-Where are you going?

336
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:57,410
-To introduce myself.

337
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:02,310
REM: So this is what you meant.

338
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:03,077
-Oh.

339
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,344
Could that be your father?

340
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:06,944
-Coming!

341
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:11,610
Welcome h-- uh, hi.

342
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,044
-Hello and good evening.

343
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,477
My name is Misa Amane.

344
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,110
I just came by to give
Light an important notebook

345
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,344
he left at school earlier today.

346
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,377
-Could you wait
here for a second?

347
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:22,877
Light!

348
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,744
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Notebook?

349
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:27,677
Could it be?

350
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:43,710
MISA: Um, pleased to meet you.

351
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,377
I'm Misa Amane.

352
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,710
I thought you might get worried
if you saw that message on TV.

353
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:53,044
I just couldn't take it anymore,
so I brought this notebook.

354
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,177
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
[inward shudder] A Death Note.

355
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,977
A shinigami.

356
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,544
She's the fake Kira.

357
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,077
LIGHT: Please, come in.

358
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,710
MISA: Are you sure it's OK?

359
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:13,477
Thanks.

360
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,644
Mom, she came all this
way to return my notebook.

361
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:17,777
Could you make us some tea?

362
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,244
-Sure, I don't see why not.

363
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:21,210
-Hmm?

364
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:22,677
I already told you about her.

365
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,410
LIGHT: Have a seat.

366
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:30,977
-Oh.

367
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,344
Um, thank you.

368
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:45,810
-How did you find me?

369
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:46,810
-I knew it.

370
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:49,944
You never made the
shinigami eye deal.

371
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:52,177
When you have the
shinigami eyes like I do,

372
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,110
you can see most people's
name and lifespan

373
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:55,510
just by looking at them.

374
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:57,177
However, you can't
see the lifespan

375
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,610
of any person who
possesses a Death Note.

376
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:02,977
-No kidding.

377
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,710
I have to admit, even I wasn't
aware of that little detail.

378
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:09,144
Well, now you've
managed to find me.

379
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:10,177
But you were careless.

380
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,777
What if you were
caught by the police?

381
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,344
Then they'd know
everything about Kira.

382
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:15,644
-It's all right.

383
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:17,644
Because the police
didn't catch me,

384
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:21,244
and if I do as you say from now
on, they'll never be able to.

385
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:22,444
So we're safe.

386
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:25,477
After all, don't you need
someone to see L's name?

387
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,544
If you want, I
could be your eyes.

388
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:30,277
So--

389
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,177
-Yeah?

390
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,944
So what?

391
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:38,177
-Would you please make
me your girlfriend?

392
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,110
-Girlfriend?

393
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,010
-Yes.

394
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:42,310
RYUK: [laughs]

395
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,510
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): If she
finds out I'm manipulating her

396
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:46,810
and gets hurt, she'll
probably kill me.

397
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,477
But still--

398
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,510
-Impossible.

399
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:51,210
The day that you and
I were in Aoyama,

400
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,844
there were three
times the usual number

401
00:17:52,877 --> 00:17:54,577
of surveillance cameras around.

402
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,744
Anyone who was in
Aoyama on the 22nd

403
00:17:56,777 --> 00:18:00,477
would've definitely been caught
on camera-- that includes me.

404
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,044
If you and I were seen together,
it wouldn't look very good.

405
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:05,377
In fact, even being
here together right now

406
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,177
is a problem.

407
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,810
I wish you'd understand that.

408
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:10,877
-But look-- these
are pictures of me

409
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,177
when I went to Aoyama that day.

410
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,944
-Well, I'm sure no one would
recognize her from this.

411
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:20,010
-And what about
your fingerprints?

412
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:22,610
All those tapes you
sent to the TV station.

413
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,710
They all had the same
fingerprints on them.

414
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,844
-Yeah, but those
aren't my fingerprints.

415
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:29,510
It's not like I do these things
without thinking about them

416
00:18:29,544 --> 00:18:30,710
first.

417
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,844
Up until recently, I lived
in the Kansai region,

418
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:35,777
and I had this friend
who was into the occult.

419
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,444
I suggested that we distribute
this fake poltergeist

420
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:40,977
video I had made to a bunch
of different TV shows,

421
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,110
sort of as a prank.

422
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,944
And she agreed to
help me with it.

423
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:46,144
I had her take care
of all of the dubbing

424
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:48,510
so my fingerprints
wouldn't be on the tapes.

425
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,410
Then I took them from her
added the Kira graphic

426
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:54,677
and recorded the message
with that voice effect.

427
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,110
-And this friend you made the
tapes with, where is she now?

428
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:58,610
-Why are you doing this to me?

429
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:03,310
If you want me to kill her,
just say so and I'll kill her!

430
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:07,077
If you really still can't
trust me, then here.

431
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,977
I'll even let you hold
onto my Death Note.

432
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,344
But you'd just be holding it.

433
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:12,510
So I'd still be the
rightful owner of it

434
00:19:12,544 --> 00:19:14,677
and that means I get to
keep my shinigami eyes.

435
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,410
Isn't that right, Rem?

436
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:20,144
-Yes, that's right.

437
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:22,710
-Now there's no way I
could possibly kill you.

438
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:26,844
And if I become a burden to you,
then you can just kill me, OK?

439
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:30,344
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Why
would she go this far?

440
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,444
-But you might have
removed several pages

441
00:19:32,477 --> 00:19:33,644
from your Death Note.

442
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:36,710
You could be hiding them
somewhere for all I know.

443
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:38,510
-Why are you so
suspicious of me?

444
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,644
I already told you, I don't care
even if all you do is use me.

445
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:44,610
Believe me.

446
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:48,610
-How can you say that?

447
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,977
-Exactly one year
ago, my parents

448
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,410
were killed in a robbery.

449
00:19:52,444 --> 00:19:53,844
I was home with
them at the time.

450
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:56,077
It happened right
in front of me.

451
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,744
I wanted that man to
pay for what he did.

452
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,910
But the trial
dragged on forever.

453
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:04,344
Opinion started surfacing that
he was being falsely accused.

454
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:05,544
Then it happened.

455
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:08,877
Kira punished him for
what he did to my parents.

456
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,410
And that's why Kira
means everything.

457
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:15,144
Kira means everything to me.

458
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:19,477
All I-- All I wanted was a
chance to meet you one day,

459
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,077
so I could thank you
for what you did.

460
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,344
[sobs]

461
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:27,677
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): So all
these irrational moves, they

462
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,177
were just a means
for her to meet Kira.

463
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,077
Still, she got around the
surveillance cameras with ease

464
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,110
and managed not to leave her
fingerprints on the evidence.

465
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:37,710
She's not as stupid
as I thought.

466
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:40,344
And she has promised
to obey me from now on.

467
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:03,310
-I understand.

468
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:07,044
I can't be your boyfriend,
but I can act like it.

469
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:09,710
The lengths you went to meet
me, to be of help to me.

470
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:12,510
Those eyes of yours that you
sacrificed half your life

471
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:16,077
to get will become my weapon.

472
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,577
-Thank you so much.

473
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,444
I'll try my hardest to make
you love me, I promise.

474
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:22,939
[sighs]

475
00:21:39,237 --> 00:21:42,137
[ending theme song]

476
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:52,404
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): That's
good to know, Ryuzaki.

477
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,071
I also consider
you a close friend.

478
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:56,271
It'd be a shame if you no
longer came to university.

479
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:58,404
I was looking forward to
playing tennis against you

480
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:00,104
one last time.

481
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:01,304
L will die.

482
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:03,437
That's all it took.
