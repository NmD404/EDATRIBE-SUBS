[theme music]

2
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,207
-Quiet, Matsuda.

3
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,707
This is not the time
to be fooling around.

4
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,074
Knock it off.

5
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:39,907
-Yes, sir.

6
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,374
-This is the Kira investigation.

7
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:42,874
Stop messing around!

8
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:44,474
-Sorry, Aizawa.

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,841
MALE SPEAKER: Matsuda,
please don't, Matsuda.

11
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,662
-After all, the last thing
I want is to be dead weight.

12
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:52,696
-Ryuzaki, is there
anything I can

13
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,396
do to help with
the investigation,

14
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:55,629
besides the manager thing?

15
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:57,529
-Could you get me
another cup of coffee?

16
00:01:57,562 --> 00:01:59,396

MATSUDA (VOICEOVER):
I want to help, too.

19
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:06,096
I want to contribute
to the case.

20
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:14,162
-I love you.

21
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:19,196
So please, don't tell me
you're going home now.

22
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:23,362
Instead, say you'll
stay by my side.

23
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:25,896
-Uh, Mr. Director,
I can't do this.

24
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:26,896
I have a boyfriend.

25
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:28,362
Can we cut the love
scenes, please?

26
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:28,896
-Uh--

27
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:29,962
-Wait.

28
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:31,229
Where'd this come
from all of a sudden?

29
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:32,862
-Can't we just fake
kiss or something?

30
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:33,662
DIRECTOR: What?

31
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:34,796
You're kidding.

32
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,329
You can't expect us to
make a movie like that.

33
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:37,962
MISA: If I say no, then it's no.

34
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:38,696
OK?

35
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,496
DIRECTOR: Come on!

36
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:41,496
FEMALE SPEAKER: Come on.

37
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,462
Get rid of her.

38
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,896
Fire her.

MATSUDA (VOICEOVER): The Yotsuba
Group's main Tokyo office.

40
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:51,629
And today is Friday.

41
00:02:51,662 --> 00:02:53,562
-All the death that are
beneficial for Yotsuba

42
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:56,596
are concentrated
around the weekends.

43
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,096
-Hmm.

44
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:00,029
-The last thing I want
to be is dead weight.

45
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:02,729
-Mogi's been incredibly
efficient from the start.

46
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:03,829
-Quiet, Matsuda!

47
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:05,162
This is not the time
to be fooling around.

48
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:06,129
-Would you cut it out?

49
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:07,262
-That is his specialty.

50
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:09,496
-And could you get me
another cup of coffee?

00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:09,996

54
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:21,762
Hello, Matsu, get over here.

55
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,562
-I guess he had to
run off somewhere.

56
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:24,362
-(DISAPPOINTED) Oh.

57
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:33,896
-Hmm.

58
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,196
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: All right.

59
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:46,829
For the time being,
I want you to start

60
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:47,929
going over this list here.

61
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:48,462
-Yes, sir.

62
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,629
Right away.

63
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,996
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Would I
punish evildoers and criminals

64
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:55,662
if I could kill by just
seeing a name and face?

65
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:58,562
Is that what I'd do if I
had that sort of power?

66
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,462
I mean, it's true
that there are lots

67
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:02,929
of people around that the
world could frankly do without,

68
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:05,629
but I don't think I'd
become a murderer just

69
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,462
to change the world.

70
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,629
-Huh?

71
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:09,096
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Surely
I wouldn't do that.

72
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,862
No, I'm thinking
too hard about this.

73
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:13,129
There's no way anyone
could murder so many people

74
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:14,862
and not have any memory of it.

75
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:16,196
L: What's wrong?

76
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,762
You've been staring at me
for the last two minutes.

77
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:19,929
Wait, let me guess.

78
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:21,129
You must be annoyed
because I'm the only one

79
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:22,196
eating cake at the moment.

80
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:22,962
Am I right?

81
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,729
-Uh, no, that's not it.

82
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:25,562
-Here.

83
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:26,696
-Really, don't worry about it.

84
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:27,196
[beep]

85
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,029
-Hmm?

86
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:28,962
WATARI (ON COMPUTER): Ryuzaki.

87
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:30,229
L: Yes, what is it?

88
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:32,229
WATARI (ON COMPUTER):
Detective Eraldo Coil has just

89
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:34,729
received a private request
to investigate and reveal

90
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:35,962
the identity of L.

91
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:37,396
SOICHIRO YAGAMI:
Isn't Eraldo Coil

92
00:04:37,429 --> 00:04:39,362
supposed to be the
second-greatest detective

93
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:41,829
in the world after L himself?

94
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:43,896
Who on earth would
send such a request?

95
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,729
WATARI (ON COMPUTER):
The man who sought out

96
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:48,296
Coil's services is Masahiko
Kida, the head of the Rights

97
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,662
and Planning Department
of the Yotsuba Group's

98
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:52,029
headquarters in Tokyo.

99
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:53,862
-So it is Yotsuba.

100
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:56,529
-We know that Yotsuba
must be linked to Kira.

101
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,562
If they're trying to
find out L's identity,

102
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,729
it's probably because they
want to kill him and need

103
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:01,929
that information to do it.

104
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:02,996
SOICHIRO YAGAMI:
This isn't good.

105
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,796
We're already short-handed
enough as it is,

106
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:06,996
and now we have to
worry about Coil, too.

107
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:08,496
-Mm, mm.

108
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:10,829
It's quite all right.

109
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:13,196
The detective known
as Eraldo Coil is me.

110
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,229
-Oh?

111
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:15,529
L: It's quite simple, really.

112
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:18,762
Three of the greatest detectives
in the world, L, Coil,

113
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:21,996
and Deneuve, they're
all actually me.

114
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,562
It's been my
experience that people

115
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:26,896
who try to find me
usually fall for this.

116
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:30,929
I'll give you this strawberry
if you keep it a secret, OK?

117
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:31,862
-Mm.

118
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,062
-I'm impressed as
always, Ryuzaki.

119
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,662
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER):
Maybe I should

120
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:50,896
leave while I still
have a chance.

121
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:53,929
No, then there would have
been no point in coming here.

122
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:55,696
Or should I wait
until everyone's gone

123
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,296
and search their offices?

124
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,229
I-- I can't.

125
00:05:58,262 --> 00:05:59,429
I'd probably get
caught doing that,

126
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:02,396
and then-- maybe I
should get out of here.

127
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,329
SHIMURA: [grumbling]
Not this again.

128
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:04,996
-Huh?

129
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,529
-I'm too tired.

130
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:07,829
-Look on the bright side.

131
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,462
At least it falls
on the weekend.

132
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,529
We never know how long
these confidential meetings

133
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:12,929
will go on far.

134
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:14,696
Can you imagine if we
did this on Mondays?

135
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,429
That would be the worst
start to the week.

136
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:18,229
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER):
Confidential meetings?

137
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:18,896
All right!

138
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:24,196
Ah.

139
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,496
The 19th floor.

140
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:33,729
I've made it this far.

141
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:36,629
I'm going to see it through.

142
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,762
-All right.

143
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,796
I just have to get
close to him, right?

144
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,029
Leave it to me.

145
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:43,562
-And you want me to
make sure that we're

146
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:46,462
able to breach the security
and override the surveillance

147
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:48,462
cameras in the Yosuba
Group's head office.

148
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:49,896
Is that all?

149
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:50,862
-Yes.

150
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:52,496
At this point,
it's safe to assume

151
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,662
that Kira and the Yotsuba Group
are connected in some way.

152
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:57,962
We're going to investigate
Yotsuba to determine

153
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:00,029
who holds Kira's
power and if there

154
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:02,362
is more than one person
who possesses this ability.

155
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:05,162
We need a clear
understanding, quickly.

156
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:20,662
-Hmm?

157
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:21,162
Mm.

158
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:31,329
-We cannot let anyone from
Yotsuba figure out that we are

159
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:32,896
investigating them.

160
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:34,462
Please realize that
if they do notice,

161
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:38,196
it means we won't be
able to catch Kira.

162
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:41,829
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER): Damn it,
I can't hear them clearly.

163
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:45,862
If only I could hear just one
thing, something important.

164
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:51,296
[executives murmuring]

165
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:52,529
EXECUTIVE: Kill him.

166
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:56,129
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER): I just
heard someone say kill!

167
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:58,062
EXECUTIVE: I'm sure
Kira would approve.

168
00:07:58,096 --> 00:07:58,596
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER): Kira!

169
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:59,262
There it is.

170
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:00,229
Kira, they said it!

171
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,162
What's that?

172
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:03,329
Let's have Kira get rid of him?

173
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:04,529
I heard it!

174
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:06,062
They really are
working with him.

175
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:06,962
I did it!

176
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:07,929
This is huge!

177
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:16,562
[grunting]

178
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:19,617
-Who the hell are you?

179
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:23,684
L: Please be sure not
to act impulsively out

180
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:25,251
of panic or haste.

181
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,284
And don't take matters
into your own hands.

182
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:28,117
[beep]

183
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:29,151
WATARI (ON COMPUTER): Ryuzaki.

184
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:30,584
L: Yes, what is it?

185
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:31,951
WATARI (ON COMPUTER):
I have just

186
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:35,417
received an emergency
signal from Matsuda's belt.

187
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:37,484
-Oh, where is he?

188
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,584
-It seems that it's coming
from within the head

189
00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:41,884
office of the Yotsuba Group.

190
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,684
-Uh, sorry to
barge in like this.

191
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:45,351
Um, my name is Taro Matsui.

192
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,884
I'm an agent with
Yoshida Productions.

193
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,817
I just dropped by to ask
if your company would

194
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:52,451
be interested in using our
top multitalented start, Misa

195
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:54,851
Amane, as your new spokesperson.

196
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:55,817
[nervous laugh]

197
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,784
-Hmm.

198
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:59,851
-Disregard everything
I just said.

199
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:01,917
We'll need to
rethink our strategy.

200
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,417
[sigh] Matsuda, you idiot.

201
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:24,793
HATORI: Yoshida
Productions, Taro Matsui.

202
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,693
He doesn't have anything
suspicious on him.

203
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:32,359
I suppose that means he
isn't a corporate spy.

204
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:34,193
-[laughing] Right.

205
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:36,793
Um, so please take Misa-Misa
into consideration.

206
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,626
(VOICEOVER) THese two were
only acting as guards.

207
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,093
The rest of them
must be discussing

208
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,393
how they'll get rid of me.

209
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:47,293
Oh, there's no way out of this!

210
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:48,959
I'm going to killed for sure.

211
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:51,793
I wonder if the emergency
signal got through.

212
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:52,926
Never mind that.

213
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,293
Even if it did, will
Ryuzaki come and save me?

214
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,293
Oh no, what's going to happen?

215
00:09:57,326 --> 00:10:01,793
[ringtone - "alumina"]

216
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:02,693
-Go ahead.

217
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:03,826
You can answer it.

218
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:06,059
Don't say that
you're here, though.

219
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:07,993
And hold it away from your ear.

220
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:10,559
Make sure we can listen
in on the conversation.

221
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:11,026
-OK.

222
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,493
Hello?

223
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:17,793
L (ON PHONE): Yo, Matsui!

224
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,659
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER): Ryuzaki.

225
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,059
Oh.

226
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,693
L (ON PHONE): Uh,
it's me, Asahi.

227
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:24,359
It's been a while, buddy.

228
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:25,159
-Asahi!

229
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:26,459
Yeah, it's been a long time.

230
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,693
-Ha, it doesn't sound
like you're out right now.

231
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,326
Don't tell me
you're home already.

232
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,693
MATSUDA (ON PHONE): Yeah.

233
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:33,759
-So, you by yourself?

234
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:35,459
-Yeah, I'm by myself.

235
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:36,426
What's up?

236
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,859
-He's not with Misa
Amane right now.

237
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:40,293
Matsuda must be on his own.

238
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:41,493
-Hmm.

239
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:43,693
-So, do you want to, like,
go out drinking tonight?

240
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,693
MATSUDA (ON PHONE): Huh?

241
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:45,993
Right now?

242
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:48,026
Oh, sorry, I'll have
to pass tonight.

243
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,259
-Ah, what's the matter?

244
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:52,326
Don't tell me your wallet
is in trouble again.

245
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,993
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER): In trouble.

246
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:57,026
-Yeah, that's right,
big troubles with money.

247
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,659
You know me way too
well. [laughing]

248
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,626
-Matsuda's saying
he's in big trouble.

249
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,426
-Oh, that's too bad.

250
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,726
Guess I'll drag you out
some other time, all right?

251
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,526
See you, buddy.

252
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,526
[beep]

253
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:07,959
-Uh.

254
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:15,293
A-anyway, what do you think
about contracting Misa-Misa?

255
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:18,559
I think she'd be great
spokesperson for your company.

256
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:20,259
-Hmm.

257
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:22,226
If you're going to promote
one of your clients,

258
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:25,426
shouldn't you at least
bring them with you?

259
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:28,526
-Do you expect us to believe
your this girl's manager?

260
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,993
-Well, to be honest,
at the moment,

261
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:31,359
she's filming a movie nearby.

262
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:33,926
Once she's finished, I'll call
her and get her over here.

263
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,993
Then you can see why she'd
make a great spokesperson.

264
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:41,226
(VOICEOVER) I have to keep
stalling them somehow.

265
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:43,793
-Misa's cell phone is
on voicemail right now.

266
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:45,159
I left her a
message and told her

267
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:47,493
to get back to me
as soon as she can.

268
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:50,126
-What are you planning
to do, Ryuzaki?

269
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,793
-Well, we have to consider
that if Matsuda dies,

270
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,326
our suspicions about the Yotsuba
Group would be confirmed.

271
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,926
-Hmm.

272
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,026
L: Let's just watch the
situation for the time being.

273
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,359
-What should we do?

274
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:07,093
-The main question is
whether he heard anything.

275
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,326
-If it's a possibility,
no matter how small,

276
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,493
we'll have to kill him.

277
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,259
-I'm wondering if he
really did come here just

278
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:13,959
to promote his client.

279
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:16,426
He could be an undercover cop.

280
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,459
-No, that can't be it.

281
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:19,993
The Japanese police
have completely

282
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:22,193
withdrawn support
from the Kira case.

283
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:24,559
-Look, it doesn't
really matter who he is.

284
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:28,059
We have no choice
but to kill him.

285
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:28,593
-Hmm.

286
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:33,359
You know, now that
I think about it,

287
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:35,693
it might be good to have her
as the face of our company.

288
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:36,193
-Hmm?

289
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:37,859
-Ah, exactly.

290
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:40,326
Her shoot should be done
soon, so please wait.

291
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,493
She'll convince you.

292
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,126
-Mm, I'm beat.

293
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,559
[sigh] [gasp] I got
a call from Light!

294
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:54,826
He really does worry
about me when I'm late.

295
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,793
[laughing]

296
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,993
[phone ringing]

297
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:00,826
-M-Misa?

298
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:01,793
MISA (ON PHONE): Light!

299
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,393
I'm sorry I've been
working so much.

300
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:05,393
I'll be finished soon, 'kay?

301
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:08,559
-Misa, you're not with Matsuda
at the moment, are you?

302
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:09,193
-Him?

303
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:10,126
He's a total jerk.

304
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,426
He just ran off
and left me here.

305
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:11,993
[phone ringing]

306
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:12,826
Oh.

307
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:13,793
Hang on.

308
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,193
I'm getting a call
on my work phone.

309
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:18,426
Oh hey, it's from Matsu.

310
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,226
-Misa's just received
a call from Matsuda.

311
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,426
-Tell her to hold her phone so
that we can listen in as well.

312
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,926
MATSUDA (ON PHONE): Misa-Misa,
when you're finished filming,

313
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,126
come over to the Yotsuba
Group head office.

314
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,693
It's still tentative,
but there's

315
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,126
a chance you may
be able to appear

316
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,426
in Yotsuba's commercials.

317
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:34,859
We're working it out now.

318
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:35,526
-(EXCITED) What?

319
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,493
Are you for real?

320
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:37,693
You're amazing, Matsu!

321
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:39,893
So that's what you've
been up to all this time!

322
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:40,593
Don't worry.

323
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:41,326
We're wrapping up soon.

324
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,393
MATSUDA (ON PHONE): Great.

325
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:46,493
It's just a short trip by taxi.

326
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,626
-Huh?

327
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,059
-Listen to me, Light.

328
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:51,693
There is a chance that we
may be able to save Matsuda,

329
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:54,859
but we won't be able to
do it without Misa's help.

330
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:57,793
She'll listen to you and do
anything you say, won't she?

331
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:00,193
-Uh--

332
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:01,159
-I'm Misa-Misa.

333
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,726
My only rule is
I don't do nudes,

334
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,093
but swimsuits and
lingerie are totally OK.

335
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,426
It's really nice to meet you.

336
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,559
[nervous laughter]

337
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:12,659
-Hmm.

338
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:15,293
I gotta admit, she is
really cute in person.

339
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:18,326
-That's not exactly the main
issue now, wouldn't you agree?

340
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,726
-By the way, Matsu, since
Yotsuba's a big catch,

341
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,693
I got the OK from our office
to have a special reception.

342
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:24,626
-Hmm?

343
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:25,126
Reception?

344
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,426
[giggling]

345
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:27,793
MODELS: Good evening.

346
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,293
We're very pleased to meet you.

347
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:32,626
-Tonight, I'll be entertaining
you as our special guest,

348
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:35,393
along with the girls
from the agency.

349
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:38,193
-Hey, is it just me, or
is this getting weird?

350
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:38,959
-Hmm.

351
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,026
-Well, it can't be helped.

352
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,293
Right now, we can't afford
to leave Misa's manager

353
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:44,526
alone for a second.

354
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,559
-Let's just go with it.

355
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,426
I'm going to enjoy myself.

356
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:48,826
EXECUTIVE (MURMURING):
All right.

357
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,593
Hard to go wrong with this.

358
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:51,326
Hmm.

359
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:53,059
[nervous laughter]

360
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,793
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER):
Ryuzaki and the others

361
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,693
will be able to
watch us from here.

362
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:57,726
This is my way out.

363
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,059
-Here you are.

364
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:03,126
Drink right up. [laughing]

365
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,459
-Man, we gotta do
this more often.

366
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:05,993
-Hmm.

367
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:07,193
Well, well.

368
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:08,893
Misa's pretty good at
this sort of thing.

369
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:19,193
--[shaky laughter] [sigh]
(SLURRED) Excuse me, guys.

370
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:20,593
I gotta go to the bathroom.

371
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:26,359
Hmm.

372
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:32,959
Ryuzaki, are you watching this?

373
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:33,926
-Yes.

374
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,359
-L-look, I'm really
sorry that I--

375
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,693
-That's not important right now.

376
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:37,726
MATSUDA (ON PHONE): OK.

377
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,193
Listen, the eight
men who came here

378
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:40,393
were having a
meeting to determine

379
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:42,026
who they'd get Kira
to kill for them.

380
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:42,526
-Oh?

381
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,359
[grunt]

382
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:44,893
-I heard them say it clearly.

383
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:46,659
There's no doubt
they're behind this.

384
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,626
-Yes, that is probably true.

385
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,726
But if you did overhear
them, and they caught you,

386
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,526
then they'll almost certainly
be trying to kill you now.

387
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,793
-I know.

388
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:58,393
Do you think there's anything
I can do to save myself?

389
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,393
L (ON PHONE): Well,
luckily, you're still alive,

390
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,193
so we may be able to save you.

391
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:04,059
But for that to
happen, you will have

392
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,826
to die before they can kill you.

393
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,193
-What?

394
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:09,359
L (ON PHONE): I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

395
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:19,059
MATSUDA: [gasp] No way.

396
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:21,659
But that's-- that's crazy.

397
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:28,226
[murmuring]

398
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,459
-And you know our
company is expanding.

399
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,293
-Hey!

400
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:38,426
-What the hell?

401
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,693
EXECUTIVE (MUTTERING):
Who's that?

402
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:45,259
-(DRUNKENLY) Wow, I am so drunk.

403
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:47,659
[uneasy murmuring]

404
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:48,593
-Huh?

405
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:51,159
-Oh, h-hi, everyone.

406
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:52,059
Everyone having fun?

407
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:52,926
Good.

408
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,793
That's great.

409
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:57,826
Now, everyone, the
moment you've all

410
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:01,093
been waiting for,
the Taro Matsui show!

411
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:04,959
[laughing]

412
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:07,359
-Hey, what are you doing/

413
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:07,893
-Yay!

414
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,459
You can do it!

415
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:10,593
Go Matsu!

416
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:12,526
-All right, here we go.

417
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:16,093
Uh--

418
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:17,259
-Hey, you're drunk.

419
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:19,026
That's way too dangerous.

420
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:19,559
-Don't worry.

421
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:20,659
I'm just fine.

422
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:21,893
I do this all the time.

423
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:26,293
[grunting]

424
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:28,093
[astonished shouting]

425
00:17:28,126 --> 00:17:29,693
TAKAHASHI: What the
hell are you doing?

426
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:30,659
Get in here!

427
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:31,426
-Stop!

428
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:32,626
Are you crazy, you idiot?

429
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:35,093
-It's all right.
(STRAINING) No prob.

430
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:43,859
[shouting]

431
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:53,693
[screaming]

432
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:54,659
-He fell!

433
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,093
This can't be good.

434
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:01,059
-(SHOUTING) Ah, no!

435
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:02,759
I heard a thud, so I came out.

436
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:03,726
This is just horrible.

437
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,159
Someone call an ambulance!

438
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:07,659
MATSUDA: Geez. this
sure is a crappy role.

439
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,859
-Look, everyone, I think
you should all just

440
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:11,726
leave this for us to
take care of and go home.

441
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,259
-What?

442
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:12,826
But--

443
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:13,426
-Don't worry.

444
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,726
We'll handle it.

445
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,526
Just don't forget about me
for your next campaign, OK?

446
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,593
-Let's go.

447
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:19,259
If the press sees
us, we're in trouble.

448
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:20,059
[siren]

449
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:20,726
EXECUTIVE: Yeah.

450
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,093
FEMALE SPEAKER: What's going on?

451
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:28,026
Did someone jump?

452
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,659
-Well, we're lucky that he ended
up dying right in front of us,

453
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,593
at any rate.

454
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:33,093
-Hey.

455
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:33,593
-Huh?

456
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,359
-Mm.

457
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:45,093
-While I'm aware of the fact
that we're short-handed,

458
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:47,693
I'm not very pleased about
having to do this sort of thing

459
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:48,626
myself.

460
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:52,526
Matsuda, you idiot.

461
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,993
[sigh]

462
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:09,126
-"Misa Amane's
manager dies in fall."

463
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:10,893
Hmm.

464
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:14,193
[phone ringing]

465
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,993
Yes.

466
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,193
AIBER (ON PHONE): You're
Masahiko Kida, VP of the Rights

467
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,593
and Planning Department
at Yotsuba's Tokyo office,

468
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:23,259
correct?

469
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:24,126
-Yes, that's right.

470
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,493
And who am I speaking to?

471
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:29,393
-I go by the name Eraldo Coil.

472
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:32,759
I'm calling to discuss
my terms with you.

473
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:33,993
EXECUTIVE: What?

474
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:37,026
A $2 million advance and
$8 million upon completion?

475
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,459
Is he out of his mind?

476
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:39,859
-That's not all.

477
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:41,759
Even if we don't commission him,
we have to pay him $2 million

478
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,459
just to keep him silent.

479
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:46,326
-So he wants hush money, huh?

480
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,826
-If he's saying
something like that,

481
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:50,693
we should assume Coil
knows quite a bit already.

482
00:19:50,726 --> 00:19:52,926
-This it's getting ridiculous.

483
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,993
I've had it.

484
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,793
I want out of these
meetings right now.

485
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:57,859
I don't know who Kira
is, and I don't care.

486
00:19:57,893 --> 00:20:01,293
I just don't want to get wrapped
up in this and end up in jail!

487
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:01,793
HIGUCHI: No.

488
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,226
-Huh?

489
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:06,293
HIGUCHI: Hatori, I think you are
going to end up dead tomorrow.

490
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:15,993
-No, wait.

491
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:16,826
I was only joking.

492
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:19,393
It's not like that.

493
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,226
I'm in.

494
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,793
I'll see this to the end.

495
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:23,426
-So what are we going to do?

496
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,426
Coil is still willing
to accept the job,

497
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,226
despite what he already knows.

498
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,493
-Isn't it obvious?

499
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:30,759
He'll become partners with
us, as long as we pay him.

500
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:32,326
-His demand are
exorbitant, but we

501
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:35,159
need to have someone as
skilled as Coil on our side.

502
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:35,726
-Good point.

503
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,526
Pay him.

504
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,359
It doesn't matter how much.

505
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:39,159
-Exactly.

506
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:40,993
We'll just have to pay him.

507
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:41,493
Uh--

508
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,059
-All right, we'll contract Coil.

509
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:55,693
Anyone have any objections?

510
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:56,793
-(TOGETHER) No objections.

511
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:00,959
WEDY: L, are you listening?

512
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,293
(SCOFFING) I am To disappointed.

513
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:04,193
I thought this would
be a challenge.

514
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:06,393
Security level here is a joke.

515
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:09,259
They've left it all to
a single contractor.

516
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:12,459
There weren't even
any wiretap detectors.

517
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:15,193
It's been about a week since
I first snuck into the place.

518
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:17,426
It looks like things have
been moving pretty smoothly

519
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,959
since then, huh?

520
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:20,859
-We've almost got them.

521
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:25,826
-So one of these people--
mm, mm-- is Kira.

522
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,226
-Well, then.

523
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,326
Now that everyone's here, let's
commence our regular meeting.

524
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,526
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: But if
there's supposed to be eight,

525
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,793
why are there only seven?

526
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:42,188
[theme music]

527
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:55,408
LIGHT: Ryuzaki, you think I'm
capable of becoming a murderer?

528
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:56,608
Kira?

529
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,108
Even after I helped
you catch him?

530
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:02,374
Do I seem like that
kind of person to you?
