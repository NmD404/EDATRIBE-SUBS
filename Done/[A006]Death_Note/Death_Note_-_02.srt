00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:39,367
-The human whose name is
written this notebook shall die.

3
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,804
[laughter]

4
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:42,241
-Help me!

5
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:43,878
-Now, what will happen?

6
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:49,159
The Death Note.

7
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,432
It's for real.

8
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:55,409
[screaming]

9
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:58,016
-Any human whose
used a Death Note

10
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,893
can either to go to heaven
or hell for eternity.

11
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:04,733
-I want the world to
know of my existence.

12
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:07,708
That there's someone out there
passing righteous judgment

13
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:09,680
on the wicked.

14
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:13,591
And I-- I will become the
god of this new world.

15
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,837
-He found himself
overwhelmed with happiness

16
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,208
and satisfaction--

17
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,946
-I have no idea what he was
thinking coming to my house--

18
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,182
but I am so through with him.

19
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:24,419
-Seriously?

20
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:26,190
So happened with
your dad after that?

21
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:27,527
TEACHER: All right then, Yagami?

22
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,797
-Mhm?

23
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,635
-Please recite this line for us.

24
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:31,103
-Sure.

25
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:36,116
"Having finally made
his dream a reality,

26
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,592
he was overwhelmed, both by the
magnitude of his achievement

27
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:43,335
and by the joy and happiness
that it brought him."

28
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:46,744
-That was very well done, but
I'm not surprised, of course.

29
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:48,315
Absolutely flawless.

30
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:48,984
Very good.

31
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:56,905
Well, then we'll leave
it that for today.

32
00:02:56,938 --> 00:03:01,282
[dismissal bell]

33
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:02,886
-I thought it would never end.

34
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,525
How do you do this everyday?

35
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,062
It's so boring.

36
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,265
Hey, were are you going?

37
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:09,704
Hey, Light, are you
listening to me?

38
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:11,175
-Don't talk to me.

39
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,852
Unlike you, people can still
hear me when I talk out loud.

40
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:15,554
-Huh.

41
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:16,690
Well aren't you boring?

42
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:17,324
-Hey.

43
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:18,327
What's up, Light?

44
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:19,564
We were just get ahead down--

45
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:22,037
-Sorry, I'm a little busy today.

46
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:24,142
-You don't have anything to do.

47
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:26,549
Aren't you just going to go
home and hang out in your room,

48
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,551
as usual?

49
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:28,721
-What are you talking about?

50
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:30,894
Of course I have something to.

51
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:31,729
Yes.

52
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,166
Something very important.

53
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:37,946
-NEWSCASTER (ON TV): There was
more violence across the city

54
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,049
today.

55
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,853
Another stabbing, this
time at a restaurant

56
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,327
in the heart of the Kabukicho
District of Shinjuku.

57
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,652
-Hey, Light.

58
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,923
I'm talking to you.

59
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:51,061
-What is it?

60
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:53,535
-Why are you working so hard?

61
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,606
-I can't afford
to waste any time.

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,350
I have a very small window to
write names in this notebook.

63
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:02,023
I only have from when I get home
from school until I go to bed.

64
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:04,163
I still need to sleep, so
I can maintain my average

65
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:06,201
and stay at the top my class.

66
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,775
Obviously, I can't
be sleeping in class.

67
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,214
Plus, there's all the studying
at home and at cram school.

68
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:13,553
I can't let myself
get too tired.

69
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,629
It'll start to affect my health
and my mental performance.

70
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:19,603
If I'm serious about trying to
create an ideal world that's

71
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:24,650
free from evil, then I need
to make the most of my time.

72
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:25,151
SAYU: Huh?

73
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:25,685
Weird.

74
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:26,522
Hey, Light!

75
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:27,624
What's going on?

76
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,195
Why's your door locked?

77
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,264
-It's Sayu.

78
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:31,434
What is it?

79
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:33,239
SAYU: Can you help
me with my homework?

80
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,074
-Uh.

81
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:34,609
Yeah.

82
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:35,110
OK.

83
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,594
-We're doing quadratic
equations in math.

84
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:42,664
Sorry to interupt.

85
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:44,101
I know you're
studying right now.

86
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,872
But I'm, like, the
only person in my class

87
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,309
who doesn't get this stuff.

88
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:48,512
Thanks so much.

89
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:49,949
-No problem.

90
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:52,122
-I'd be careful
if I were to you.

91
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:54,094
If anyone else
touches that notebook

92
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,099
you've got hidden in
the drawer right now,

93
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:57,536
they'll be able to see me, too.

94
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:58,639
-Uh huh.

95
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,043
(VOICE OVER) He waits
till now to mention

96
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:01,714
that important detail?

97
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:03,151
Damn shinigami.

98
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:04,187
-What's wrong?

99
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,825
Are you all right?

100
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:07,028
-It's nothing.

101
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,234
So what exactly
don't you understand?

102
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,169
What are you stuck on?

103
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:11,139
SAYU: Um.

104
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:13,779
Well, I think all of it.

105
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,185
PANELIST 1: There have been
52 deaths that we're aware of.

106
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:17,823
And that's just
in the past week.

107
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:20,564
PANELIST 2: Every single one of
them involved a heart attack.

108
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:21,499
PANELIST 3: They
were all criminals

109
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:22,836
who were either
being held in prison

110
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,376
or who were wanted by police
for outstanding crimes.

111
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,081
And I think it's
safe to say, there

112
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:29,955
are other criminals whose
deaths are unaccounted for.

113
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:32,561
-In which case the death
toll could be well over 100.

114
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:35,168
[chatter]

115
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:35,837
-Uh.

116
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,807
Morning, Chief.

117
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,778
They started the
meeting without you.

118
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:39,915
-That's fine.

119
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:42,121
I had to take an urgent
call from headquarters.

120
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:44,259
-At any rate, these
were criminals

121
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:47,334
who would probably facing
execution sooner or later.

122
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:48,671
Perhaps we shouldn't wait--

123
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:50,476
-Why should it matter whether
it's a criminal or someone

124
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:51,578
innocent?

125
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,049
Last time I checked,
murder was still murder.

126
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:56,090
-It's still too early to
consider these a homicide.

127
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,695
-Then how did all
these people have

128
00:05:57,728 --> 00:05:59,266
heart attacks at
the exact same time?

129
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,201
That's not coincidence!

130
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,437
It's murder!

131
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,144
-Do you think it's possible
to simultaneously kill

132
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,883
all these people in
different locations?

133
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,222
-We're treating this has an
elaborate murder plot that's

134
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,428
been carried out by
a large organization.

135
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,567
-If it is a large
organization, I'm

136
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:16,377
sure I'm not alone in
suspecting the FBI or CIA.

137
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:18,181
MALE SPEAKER: I dare
you to say that again.

138
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:20,956
-Now, now this is not the
time to be joking around.

139
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:24,131
We need to confirm that these
are, indeed, homicides and not

140
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:25,234
coincidences.

141
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,604
-How?

142
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:28,476
Autopsy results showed that
all of these cases the victims

143
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,213
died of a sudden heart attack.

144
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:33,155
-Investigating a series of
heart attacks is pointless.

145
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:34,792
I don't see what
else we can learn.

146
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:37,546
-Absolutely, if these people
had been shot or stabbed,

147
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:39,140
at least we'd have
something to go.

148
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:41,303
-If that's the case,
It looks as if we'll

149
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:45,815
have no choice
but to bring in L.

150
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:47,286
-I can't believe--

151
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,227
[inaudible]

152
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,800
-Uh, Chief, what's this
L they're talking about?

153
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,037
-Right.

154
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,175
I forgot that is your first
time at this conference.

155
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,448
We don't know L's real
name or whereabouts.

156
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:01,356
In fact, we still don't even
know what it looks like.

157
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,932
However, he's managed to solve
every case he's ever taken on.

158
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,502
And he's tackled
some of the greatest

159
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:08,374
mysteries this world
has ever known.

160
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,079
He hides in the shadows.

161
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:14,791
But he's the best of the best,
a last resort, our trump card.

162
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:17,097
-But I've hear this L
is extremely arrogant.

163
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,835
I understand he'll
only take on cases

164
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:20,339
that he's personally
interested in.

165
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,509
-That's exactly right.

166
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,750
Besides, we don't even
know how to contact him.

167
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:26,790
L's CONTACT: L is
already on the move.

168
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:42,163
Gentleman L has already
begun his investigation

169
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,099
into these incidents.

170
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:43,634
-What?

171
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:44,402
[inaudible]

172
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:44,938
-Huh?

173
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:46,174
Who's that?

174
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:47,845
That man's the only
known person who

175
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:52,591
can contact L. Nobody knows
his true identity either.

176
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:53,994
L's CONTACT: Please be silent.

177
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:56,267
L would like to
address the delegates.

178
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,856
-Greetings to all
of you at the ICPO.

179
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,697
I am L.

180
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:09,669
-What are we doing here anyway?

181
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:12,109
I don't understand why we're
thinking about this dump.

182
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,312
Tell me.

183
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:14,448
-Isn't it obvious?

184
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,220
You told me that anyone
touches the Death Note

185
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,757
will be able to see you.

186
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,299
I can afford to carry something
this dangerous with me anymore.

187
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,341
Up until now, I thought
that if my family ever

188
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:26,079
saw the notebook,
I could tell them

189
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:28,686
I was keeping records of
various criminals in preparation

190
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:31,125
for becoming a
detective one day.

191
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,368
But I'm walking a very
fine line right now.

192
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:36,172
I don't want to think about it.

193
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:38,712
But if I make one
mistake, I might end up

194
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:39,648
killing my own family.

195
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,072
-The difficulty
of this case lies

196
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:51,045
in it's unprecedented scope.

197
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:52,782
And make no mistake,
we're witnessing

198
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:54,754
an atrocious act of mass murder.

199
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,960
One that is unforgivable.

200
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:59,935
This case cannot be solved
without the full corporation

201
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:01,138
of the ICPO.

202
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,009
That is, all of the
police organizations

203
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,149
we represent
throughout the world.

204
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:07,254
You need to make the
decision to fully support

205
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,694
the investigation
at this meeting.

206
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:11,766
Also I require
additional corporation

207
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,840
from Japan's national
police agency.

208
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:16,010
-What?

209
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:16,712
-What?

210
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:18,484
Why Japan in particular?

211
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,492
-Whether the guilty party
as an individual or a group,

212
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:24,766
there's a strong possibility
that they're And even

213
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,942
if they're not, we can be
sure they're hiding in Japan.

214
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:30,381
-What is all this based on?

215
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:32,120
-Why Japan you ask?

216
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:34,760
I think I'll be able to
provide you proof of that

217
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:37,734
after I directly
confront the culprit.

218
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:39,505
-A direct confrontation?

219
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,510
-At any rate, I
would like to set up

220
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:43,349
the investigation
headquarters in Japan.

221
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,869
-That was easier to make
that I thought it'd be.

222
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:52,072
-Huh?

223
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,645
Does that mean you were
able to hide the notebook?

224
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,682
-Yeah.

225
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,887
I hid it right here
in this drawer.

226
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:01,262
-But it just seemed to be
particularly well hidden.

227
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:02,737
You left the key in the lock.

228
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,309
-And that's the whole point.

229
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,948
I intentionally left the key
in the most noticeable place

230
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:07,717
I could think of.

231
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:13,099
-Isn't that just
a regular diary?

232
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:14,167
-That's what it is.

233
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:15,671
I'm guessing that
once most people find

234
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:17,677
the diary inside
my desk, that'll

235
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:20,217
probably satisfy
their curiosity.

236
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,760
But the real key is this.

237
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,130
Just in every day
item that you'd

238
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:27,469
expect to find lying
around on my desk,

239
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,274
a regular ballpoint pen.

240
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:31,112
And all I need is this part.

241
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:33,151
RYUK: So that's the key?

242
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:34,220
-Yeah.

243
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:35,624
If you look closely,
you'll find there's

244
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,699
a small hole
underneath the drawer.

245
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,203
Then you just insert this.

246
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:45,717
-Ah!

247
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:47,756
A fake bottom.

248
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,861
The diary will
distract most people,

249
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:51,666
so I doubt anyone will find it.

250
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,173
-But that's not all.

251
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:56,479
Even if someone figures out
that there's a fake base,

252
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:58,017
I've set things
up so that there's

253
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,960
no way they could get their
hands on the notebook.

254
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:04,868
You see once the ink
reservoir is inserted in acts

255
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:07,307
as an insulator, preventing
the flow of electricity

256
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:09,012
around this circuit.

257
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:11,318
When the fake base of
the drawer is put back,

258
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:12,822
this piece of
rubber also prevents

259
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,293
the flow of electricity.

260
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:16,732
However if someone were
to try to and force

261
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:19,473
the bottom of the drawer open,
the circuit would connect

262
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,612
and that would ignite
the gasoline contained

263
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:24,653
in this thin plastic
casing, instantly

264
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,793
setting the notebook on fire.

265
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:29,031
The way I've got it set
up, all the evidence

266
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:31,304
would be completely destroyed.

267
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,674
If I'm ever
questioned, I'll just

268
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,212
say that I was
hiding the real diary

269
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:36,117
because I didn't
want anyone to see.

270
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,256
It sounds like a pretty
believable excuse.

271
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,865
I mean, it is my
diary after all.

272
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:44,472
-I've heard of humans finding
Death Notes in the past.

273
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,444
And typically the biggest
problem they have is

274
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:48,483
find a good place to hide it.

275
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:51,724
But you, Light, you're probably
the first to have giving it

276
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:54,298
this much thought, though
it's a pretty risky

277
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:56,404
set up from the look of it.

278
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:58,376
If you make even the
slightest mistake,

279
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:00,682
you could be badly burned.

280
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:01,818
-Risky.

281
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,625
You say the strangest
things sometimes, Ryuk.

282
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:07,199
This whole thing has been a
risk since the very beginning,

283
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:10,774
from the moment I
obtain the Death Note.

284
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:13,014
I'm sorry but compared to
that, this doesn't even

285
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:14,451
qualify as a risk to me.

286
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,492
In fact, it actually
protects me.

287
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:19,331
It all comes down to a choice.

288
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,572
Would I prefer to be executed or
deal with a little house fire?

289
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,710
REPORTER (ON TV): Last night
in the West Tokyo Penitentiary,

290
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,684
Nyoki Korishkiyama, originally
sentenced to 15 years

291
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:45,726
for armed robbery is reported
to have died of a sudden heart

292
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,497
attack at the age of 32.

293
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:48,900
This is just the
most recent death

294
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,541
in a steadily growing number of
cases involving inmates dying--

295
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:52,710
CROWD: This is unbelievable.

296
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,783
Criminals are dropping
like flies lately.

297
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,853
It's a little scary.

298
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:58,058
But at the same time,
it's kind of cool.

299
00:12:58,092 --> 00:12:59,763
Just make sure you
don't do anything bad.

300
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:02,069
I wouldn't be surprised if
the police were behind this.

301
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,205
No way.

302
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:04,977
The police don't have
that kind of power.

303
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:05,945
Don't you know about him?

304
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:06,421
Huh?

305
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:06,989
About who?

306
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:07,858
Kira?

307
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:08,627
You know.

308
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,663
Kira.

309
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:11,167
I wonder who's going
to be killed next.

310
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,589
LIGHT: Ryuk, you
should check this out.

311
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:20,859
-Uh huh.

312
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:23,900
-Websites like this are
popping up everywhere lately.

313
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,675
RYUK: The Legend
of Kira the Savior.

314
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,410
Huh.

315
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:28,780
Sounds pretty cool.

316
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:30,217
It's this about you?

317
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,588
-Yeah.

318
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:33,292
I think they've taken the name,
Kira, from the English word

319
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,295
killer.

320
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:35,664
Can't say I'm too
happy about that.

321
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:39,140
But it looks like that's the
name they decided to give me.

322
00:13:39,174 --> 00:13:40,644
When I searched
the word Kira, I'm

323
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:42,984
pulling up ton of sites
just like this one.

324
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,655
The media hasn't
picked up on it.

325
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,292
They're still calling
this a succession

326
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,197
of unexplained deaths
among the world's most

327
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:49,902
hardened criminals.

328
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:52,208
But the people of
the world can already

329
00:13:52,242 --> 00:13:54,247
sense that there's
something happening.

330
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,717
They know there's
someone out there

331
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,224
passing righteous judgment.

332
00:13:58,258 --> 00:13:59,728
-Oh?

333
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:02,602
LIGHT: Human beings
are like that, Ryuk.

334
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:03,873
-Oh.

335
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:06,044
-Although this would probably
never happen in school,

336
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,548
let's say that
students were asked

337
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:10,523
to discuss whether bad
people deserve to die.

338
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:12,160
Well, you can bet
that everyone would

339
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,166
give the politically
correct answer.

340
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,639
-It's just wrong to kill people.

341
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:19,113
LIGHT: That's what they're
bound the say, of course.

342
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:21,585
That's the correct
response to give, right?

343
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,557
Humans will always try
to maintain appearances

344
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,527
when they're in public.

345
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,161
That's just how we are.

346
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:28,167
But this is how
they really feel.

347
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,871
Most are too afraid
to support me

348
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,876
as they're worried about
what others will think.

349
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:34,182
Many would rather
deny my existence.

350
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:36,756
But on the internet, where
you can remain anonymous,

351
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,062
support for Kira is growing.

352
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,834
Maybe people are afraid
to say it out loud.

353
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:43,073
But they all understand
what's happening.

354
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:46,214
Someone's making the bad
guys disappear one by one.

355
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:49,122
Those who have done no wrong are
cheering for Kira in the hearts

356
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,893
because they have
nothing to fear.

357
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:53,367
While those who done
wrong are on the run.

358
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,408
They're forced to hide
from an unknown enemy.

359
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:58,781
This is how it should be.

360
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,817
It's perfect.

361
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,594
Everything's going
just like I planned.

362
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:06,167
-We'd like to apologize
for the eruption

363
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,242
as of now we're bringing you
a live worldwide broadcast

364
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,946
from Interpol's ICPO.

365
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:11,816
-Hm.

366
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:12,718
What's this?

367
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:14,122
[interposing voices]

368
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:17,496
ONLINE REPORTER: We now
take you live to the ICPO.

369
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,636
-I head up an international
police task force

370
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,775
which includes all
member nations.

371
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:24,415
I am Lind L. Tailor.

372
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,955
Otherwise known as L.

373
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:28,159
-What?

374
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:29,829
Who is this guy?

375
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,333
CHIEF: So this is
how it all begins.

376
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:32,470
-But sir, I don't get it.

377
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:35,177
He's never actually
shows face before, right?

378
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,747
Why we choose to do it now?

379
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:39,655
-It must mean L's
serious about this.

380
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:43,164
(VOICEOVER) L, we followed
every single one of your orders.

381
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:45,537
Now it's time for you to prove
what you said to the ICPO.

382
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:49,781
-Criminals around
the world are being

383
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,453
murdered by a serial killer.

384
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,626
I consider this crime
to be most atrocious act

385
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,062
of murder in history.

386
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:58,137
I will not rest until the
person or persons responsible

387
00:15:58,171 --> 00:15:59,574
are brought to justice.

388
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,178
Kira, I will hunt you down.

389
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:02,314
I will find you.

390
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:04,755
-He seems certain
he'll catch you.

391
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:05,256
-Hm.

392
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:06,560
That fool.

393
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:08,498
He'll never find me.

394
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:10,403
He'll have to get this first.

395
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,207
And as long as the
police don't find it,

396
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:14,514
there won't be any
evidence to convict me.

397
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:18,758
Which means that catching me
will be absolutely impossible.

398
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:21,231
I anticipated that the
police would get involved

399
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:23,537
and that something
like this might happen.

400
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,011
-Kira, I've got a
pretty good idea

401
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:27,280
what your motivation might be.

402
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,887
And I can guess what
you hope to achieve.

403
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:33,764
However what you're
doing right now is evil.

404
00:16:33,797 --> 00:16:35,669
-Uh.

405
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:39,913
You think I'm evil.

406
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:41,451
I am justice.

407
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:43,891
I protect the innocent
and those who fear evil.

408
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:46,866
I'm the one who become the god
of a new world that everyone

409
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:47,801
desires.

410
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,673
All those who would
oppose that god,

411
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:52,413
they are the ones
who are truly evil.

412
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,855
I guess you're just
too stupid L. Too bad.

413
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,660
This could have been
a lot more interesting

414
00:16:57,694 --> 00:16:59,131
if you'd only be a bit smarter.

415
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:18,081
I'll show the world what
happens when you cross me.

416
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:29,578
The entire world is watching, L.
Five more seconds, four, three,

417
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:31,082
two, one.

418
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:44,884
What's wrong?

419
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,188
You got nothing else to say?

420
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:51,770
Huh?

421
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:55,312
-I had to test this just
in case but I-- I never

422
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:58,086
thought it would
actually happen.

423
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,793
Kira, it seems you
can kill people

424
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:03,801
without having to
be there in person.

425
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,845
I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't just witnesses it.

426
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,285
Listen to me, Kira.

427
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:13,427
If you did, indeed, kill Lind
L. Tailor, the man who you just

428
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,499
saw die on television,
I should tell you

429
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:17,838
that he was an inmate
whose execution was

430
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:19,041
scheduled for today.

431
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:20,913
That was not me.

432
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,049
-What?

433
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:23,921
-L: The police arrested
him in absolute secrecy.

434
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:25,425
So you wouldn't
have heard about him

435
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,062
on TV or through the internet.

436
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:29,268
It appears that not
even you have access

437
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:32,510
to information about
these types of criminals.

438
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,880
-Heh, heh.

439
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,685
He got you there.

440
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:38,159
-But I assure you, L is real.

441
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,364
I do exist.

442
00:18:40,397 --> 00:18:43,338
Now try to kill me.

443
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,243
-You, you bastard.

444
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:46,180
L: What's wrong?

445
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:47,483
CHIEF: What the
hell is going on?

446
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:48,987
He's really taking this too far.

447
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,424
-Are you try to
kill yourself, a L?

448
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:51,627
CROWD: What going on?

449
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,605
Look it's Kira versus L.
Live broadcast killing?

450
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:56,941
This is freaky.

451
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:57,475
Amazing.

452
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,646
Do it Kira.

453
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,648
Someone stop this.

454
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,152
-L: Can't you do it?

455
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:08,973
Well, Kira, it seems that
you can't kill me after all.

456
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,710
-(LAUGHING)

457
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:13,718
-So there are some
people you can't kill.

458
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:14,955
You've given me a useful hint.

459
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:20,536
I'll tell you something that I
think you'll find interesting.

460
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,210
Although this was announced
as a worldwide broadcast,

461
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:25,884
the truth is we are
only broadcasting

462
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:29,093
in the Kanto region of Japan.

463
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,966
I had planned to broadcast
this message around the world

464
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,136
until we found you.

465
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,776
But it looks like that
won't be necessary.

466
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,147
I now know where you are.

467
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,155
-(LAUGHING) This L
guy is pretty good.

468
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:42,361
-The police treated
your first killing

469
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:43,497
as an unrelated incident.

470
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,536
But in actuality, the
first of your victims

471
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:48,409
was a suspect in Shinjuku.

472
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:51,184
Of all the criminals that
recently died of heart attacks,

473
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:54,292
this one's crime was by
far the least serious.

474
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:58,102
Furthermore, his crime was only
ever recorded inside Japan.

475
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:01,277
I used that information
to deduce this much.

476
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,614
You are in Japan.

477
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:04,386
And your first victim
was little more

478
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,123
than an experiment
which means that you

479
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:07,627
haven't been killing
for very long.

480
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,777
We decided to broadcast
in Kanto first because

481
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:14,780
of its large population.

482
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,986
And luckily, we found you.

483
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:19,325
To be completely
honest with you,

484
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,866
I never expected that
things would go this well.

485
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:24,004
But it won't be too
long now before I

486
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:26,979
am able to sentence
you to death.

487
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:30,154
-L has certainly lived
up to his reputation.

488
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,491
-Uh huh.

489
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:34,665
He proved that Kira exists,
that the deaths were murders,

490
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,072
and that he's here in Japan.

491
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:38,911
-Naturally, I'm very
interested to know

492
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:42,420
how you're able to commit these
murders without being present.

493
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:44,190
But I don't mind
waiting a little bit

494
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:48,335
longer you can answer all of
my questions when I catch you.

495
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:50,240
Let's meet again soon, Kira.

496
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,776
-Really?

497
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,583
He's going to
sentence me to death.

498
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:08,622
Sounds interesting.

499
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:11,830
I accept your challenge, L.

500
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,903
-Each of the has to
hunt down the other

501
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:16,275
without knowing the
other's name or face.

502
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,250
And the first on whose
identity is revealed will die.

503
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:23,250
Humans are so much fun.

504
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:24,217
-L.

505
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,717
-Kira.

506
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,617
-I will hunt you down
wherever you're hiding

507
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,317
and I will eliminate you.

508
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,250
-I am--

509
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:31,684
I am--

510
00:21:31,717 --> 00:21:32,878
-justice.

511
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:40,744
[theme music]

512
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:52,659
-I'm not the one
who's going to find

513
00:22:52,692 --> 00:22:54,625
L. I can let the
police do that for me.

514
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,225
And when they do, that's
when I'll eliminate him.

515
00:22:58,259 --> 00:22:59,892
Looks like I may be
able to provide you

516
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,492
with more entertainment, Ryuk.
