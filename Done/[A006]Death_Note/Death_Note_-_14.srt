00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:16,633
[theme music]

2
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:42,928
-[gasping]

3
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:44,128
-I understand.

4
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:48,862
I can't be your boyfriend,
but I can act like it.

5
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:52,328
-Thank you so much, I'll try
my hardest to make you love me.

6
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,195
I promise.

7
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:55,828
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I'll arrange for her

8
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,062
to meet L. She'll
tell me his name,

9
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:00,995
and then I eliminate
the entire task force.

10
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:04,628
And when that's done,
I'll kill her, too.

11
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:06,862
After all, she's
the only person who

12
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:10,062
knows Kira's true
identity-- the only one.

13
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,795
I can't let her
live much longer.

14
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:15,062
-So you'll just pretend?

15
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:15,795
All right.

16
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:17,328
I guess it's a good start.

17
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:19,228
Well, now that we
talked about that,

18
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:20,828
could you show me
your Shinigami?

19
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:21,895
I really want to see him.

20
00:02:21,928 --> 00:02:23,595
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I
need her to trust me.

21
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:25,328
I guess I have to.

22
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:26,295
-Yeah, sure.

23
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:28,362
Could you please turn around?

24
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:29,062
MISA: All right.

25
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:38,028
LIGHT: You can turn back now.

26
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:40,762
MISA: OK.

27
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:41,462
-Hey there.

28
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,595
How's it going?

29
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:44,095
MISA: Oh, look at that.

30
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:46,528
You're a completely different
type of Shinigami than Rem,

31
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:47,295
aren't you?

32
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:48,328
I already know your name.

33
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:49,128
It's Ryuk, right?

34
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:50,895
Nice to meet you.

35
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:51,395
-Yeah.

36
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:52,662
Same here.

37
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:54,528
MISA: Oh, and by the
way, Light, darling,

38
00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:56,528
do you know how to
kill a Shinigami?

39
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:57,362
-Hm?

40
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:59,462
Did you just call me darling?

41
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:00,595
-Fine.

42
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,595
Then do you mind if I
call you Knight instead?

43
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:05,028
'Cause you're like my knight
in shining armor, you know.

44
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:07,795
LIGHT: [sigh] Let's
just stick with Light.

45
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:09,562
MAN: So, were you
actually planning

46
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:12,562
to check all of the footage
we got from Aoyama on the 22nd

47
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:13,562
by yourself?

48
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:14,828
-That's right.

49
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,862
I think it's very likely
that Kira and the second Kira

50
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:19,162
make contact with each
other there on that day.

51
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,762
So I want to check all of
these tapes personally.

52
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:23,428
Also, Mr. Yagami?

53
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:24,628
-Uh, yes?

54
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,995
L: Please ask Mr. Mogi
to start following Light,

55
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,928
so we can keep tabs
on what he's doing.

56
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:30,895
YAGAMI: You want him followed?

57
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:32,262
-It's only a slim chance.

58
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,628
But if you Light is Kira, then
there's still a possibility

59
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:37,928
that the second Kira might
try to contact him somehow.

60
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:38,428
-Mm.

61
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:40,228
Very well

62
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,728
-I'm starting to wonder
if Ryuzaki is even human.

63
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:44,095
The guy never sleeps.

64
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:46,428
-I saw him sleeping in
that exact same position

65
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:47,495
the other day.

66
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,295
-Huh.

67
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,462
MAN: No, I'm serious.

68
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:56,762
LIGHT: So if a Shinigami has
feelings for a human and kills

69
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:59,162
someone else in order to
extend that human's life

70
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:02,662
beyond its natural end,
and Shinigami will die?

71
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:04,462
-That's right.

72
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,928
--[laughs] Good luck
trying to find a Shinigami

73
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:08,528
who'd volunteer to do that?

74
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:10,528
-[laugh] That's true.

75
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:13,128
I can't see you ever doing that.

76
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:16,062
By the way, where did you
send all those tapes from,

77
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,662
the ones that went
to the TV stations?

78
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:18,862
-Let's see.

79
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:22,562
Osaka the first time,
then Tokyo, this other one

80
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,928
from Nagano.

81
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:25,995
I took the bullet train every
time, so that way the police

82
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:27,795
couldn't pinpoint my location.

83
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:28,562
-All right.

84
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:29,695
One more thing.

85
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,528
Do you still have the
videotapes and envelopes

86
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,362
with your friends
fingerprints on them?

87
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:34,495
-Uh-huh.

88
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:35,728
-Well, you'll have to
dispose of everything

89
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:37,495
that was used to create
those videotapes.

90
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,795
Understand?

91
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:42,195
But before you do, I need
you to send one last video,

92
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:44,728
and make sure it's from a
place you haven't used yet.

93
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:49,895
It should say, "I've decided
to stop searching for Kira.

94
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,862
And I'd like to thank
the police department

95
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:53,528
for all of its advice.

96
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:57,462
However, I still plan to
help Kira in his mission,

97
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:01,462
and I hope that in time he
will come to see me an ally.

98
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:03,428
I will start by
punishing criminals

99
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,695
that Kira has yet to judge.

100
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:10,895
Also, I will share my power with
others who I feel are worthy.

101
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:13,162
And I will encourage
them to do the same.

102
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:15,495
Together, we'll make this
world a better place."

103
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,128
MISA: Share my power?

104
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:20,028
-We'll just add that part to
throw off their investigation.

105
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:21,462
They suspect that
there are already

106
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:23,795
two people with this power,
so it wouldn't be a stretch

107
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:25,195
to assume there could be others.

108
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:27,028
And if they believe the
numbers are growing,

109
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:28,295
then they'll start to panic.

110
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,495
Can you do this?

111
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:30,562
-No need to ask.

112
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,695
Just tell me what to
do, and I'll do it.

113
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:35,028
I don't care what it is,
'cause I'd do anything for you.

114
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:37,328
LIGHT: There's one more thing,
which is very important.

115
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:38,295
-What's that?

116
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:41,062
-If you get arrested
by the police,

117
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,195
or if you're ever brought
in for questioning,

118
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:46,795
you can never mention anything
about us or the Death Note.

119
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:48,895
As long as they don't get
a hold of that notebook,

120
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:51,428
there's no proof that
you did anything.

121
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:53,628
Can you promise to say nothing?

122
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:54,795
-I promise.

123
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:56,995
So this must mean
that we're officially

124
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:58,828
boyfriend and girlfriend
now, aren't we?

125
00:05:58,862 --> 00:05:59,462
-Well sure.

126
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:00,562
I guess.

127
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:02,762
MISA: Then I'd like
to add one condition.

128
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,595
You have to go on a date
with me at least once week.

129
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:06,395
-[sigh]

130
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:07,628
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Unbelievable.

131
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:09,028
She still doesn't get it.

132
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:09,862
-We can't.

133
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,895
-[gasp] But why?

134
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:14,362
-It looks like I'm going to
have to spell this out for you.

135
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:16,262
L already suspects
that I'm Kira.

136
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:18,128
Do you see what I'm saying here?

137
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,062
-No way.

138
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:20,895
L is amazing.

139
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,962
I mean, everyone's been saying
that he's getting nowhere

140
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:25,462
with the investigation
and that he's

141
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:26,795
a complete idiot and stuff.

142
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:28,795
But he already knows that much?

143
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,128
-Anyway.

144
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:32,162
It's all worked out well for
me, because thanks to that,

145
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:34,662
I've also been able
to get close to L.

146
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:35,662
-Huh?

147
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,628
You and L are in
contact with each other?

148
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:39,495
Then that's even more amazing.

149
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:42,228
This is getting so exciting!

150
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:43,762
-Even though he
suspects I'm Kira,

151
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:46,928
L figures he's safe as long
as I don't know his real name.

152
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:51,195
He came right out and told me
who we was, just to get to me.

153
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:53,828
However, he's only
focusing on me

154
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,395
because he has no
other suspects.

155
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:58,528
And he has no evidence.

156
00:06:58,562 --> 00:07:01,628
At this moment, I'm working
with him on the case.

157
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:04,562
And little by little,
I'm winning his trust.

158
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:05,428
-Great.

159
00:07:05,462 --> 00:07:06,828
So I'll you have
to do is take me

160
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:09,028
to where L is and I can
see his real name for you.

161
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,128
LIGHT: I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

162
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,162
-Hm?

163
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:13,228
LIGHT: Listen, it
was difficult enough

164
00:07:13,262 --> 00:07:15,262
for me to get close to him.

165
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:18,295
Besides, if all of a
sudden someone I just met

166
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:19,828
gets too close, and
at the same time,

167
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:21,495
the police detect
changes in Kira

168
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:24,362
or the second Kira's
behavior, that person

169
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:26,295
will be suspected of
being in the second Kira.

170
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:30,128
And of course, that'll put me
under even greater suspicion.

171
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:32,328
We can't allow them to
make that connection, which

172
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:35,495
means we can't appear to
be too close to each other.

173
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,795
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

174
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:40,528
-Well, I think I understand.

175
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,428
So is that why we
can't go on dates?

176
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,395
We can't be seen in
public, because it'll

177
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,395
look too suspicious?

178
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:48,062
-Look, we need to
take the time now

179
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,995
to come up with a
good plan, some way

180
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:53,162
that you can see L without
letting him know you exist.

181
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:54,128
-Yeah.

182
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:56,062
LIGHT: I can't
eliminate L without you,

183
00:07:56,095 --> 00:07:59,862
so I'll call you and see you as
often as this situation allows?

184
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:01,162
-You will.

185
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:01,662
-But--

186
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:02,862
-Oh?

187
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:04,828
- --to make sure that our
meetings to stand out,

188
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:08,228
I have to make sure that I'm
seen with other girls, OK?

189
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:08,828
MISA: Huh?

190
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:09,895
What do you mean?

191
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:12,328
You're seriously gonna
date other girls?

192
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:13,228
-Yeah, more or less.

193
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:14,995
-I don't want you too!

194
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,962
-Huh?

195
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:20,862
-If I see you with another
girl, I'll kill her.

196
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,662
-Scary.

197
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:24,495
-Look, sweetie.

198
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:26,428
-Sweetie? [laughs]

199
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:27,995
-This is not a game.

200
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:31,628
Both of us are risking our lives
to change the world, aren't we?

201
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:33,295
-I know that.

202
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:36,862
But I love you more
than the world, Light.

203
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,562
-It sounds like you're confused.

204
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:40,828
Maybe it feels that way
to you, but you're here

205
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:42,595
because you admire Kira.

206
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:44,128
You don't even know me.

207
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:45,495
We just met.

208
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:47,795
-Don't you believe in
love at first sight?

209
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,862
-No.

210
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,062
-I admit that everything
you said was true.

211
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:54,162
I did want to meet Kira out
of gratitude and respect,

212
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:55,295
not love.

213
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:58,062
But from the moment I
first saw you, I knew.

214
00:08:58,095 --> 00:09:00,395
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): What
is wrong with this girl?

215
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:03,195
-Popular, as always.

216
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:06,795
-Well, you can show me
your love by obeying me.

217
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:09,262
I thought you said it
was OK if I used you.

218
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,695
A minute ago, you swore
you'd do anything I asked.

219
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:12,795
-Yeah, I did.

220
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:15,095
But I never said you
could date other girls.

221
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:18,495
I mean, those are two
totally different things.

222
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:21,762
-I think you're forgetting
I have both notebooks.

223
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,528
If you don't obey me,
I can easily kill you.

224
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:29,095
-I would never allow
that, Light Yagami.

225
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:32,595
If you do anything that
results in this girl's death,

226
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:35,862
the first thing I'll do is right
your name in my Death Note.

227
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:38,895
I will kill you.

228
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:43,028
I'm sure you realize that
I can see her life span.

229
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,528
If she happens to
die before that time,

230
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:48,395
I'll know it was
you who killed her.

231
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:50,795
LIGHT: But if you were to use
your Death Note to save her,

232
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:52,728
wouldn't that mean
you'd die, too?

233
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:53,828
-That's right.

234
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:56,362
If you tried to save
me, you would die, too.

235
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,462
-Yes, you are correct.

236
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:03,062
But I'm quite willing
to accept that outcome.

237
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,895
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Is
this Shinigami serious?

238
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:05,628
This is crazy.

239
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:06,795
Then this means--

240
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:07,728
[knocking]

241
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:08,428
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
--from now on--

242
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:09,095
LIGHT'S MOTHER: Light?

243
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,395
-Huh?

244
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:13,162
Yeah, what is it?

245
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,428
-It's almost 11:30, you know.

246
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:18,162
You really shouldn't have
a girl here this late.

247
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:19,662
-Oh, of course.

248
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:21,728
I guess we lost track of time.

249
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:22,895
MISA: Sorry, Mrs. Yagami.

250
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:29,195
I'm really sorry for coming
over so late at night.

251
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,895
See you later, Light.

252
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:31,995
-Yeah.

253
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:34,328
-Light, you should walk
her to the station.

254
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:36,195
-Uh.

255
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:38,762
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I can't risk
being seen with her in public.

256
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:40,662
-Oh, no, I'm all right.

257
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:41,295
Thanks.

258
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:42,295
Well, good night.

259
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:48,162
-Isn't she cute?

260
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:49,195
-Yeah, I know.

261
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:50,928
When she got here,
I wasn't so sure.

262
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:51,862
But you're right.

263
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:52,795
She's cute, Mom.

264
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:53,728
I like her.

265
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:54,928
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
That Shinigami

266
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:58,095
is going to kill me if
I kill that girl, which

267
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:00,795
means I'm going to have her
hanging around me until she

268
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:01,928
dies.

269
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,862
Not only that, it
also means that I'll

270
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,595
be forced to protect
her from being caught

271
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:07,262
by the police for
the rest of her life.

272
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,562
-Thanks to you,
Rem, Light really

273
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:14,362
is gonna be my knight
in shining armor.

274
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:17,262
-I suppose.

275
00:11:17,295 --> 00:11:18,228
-Hm.

276
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,528
But you can't
really kill him, OK?

277
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,787
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): For
a Shinigami to die,

278
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,120
they have to use
their Death Note

279
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:42,553
to save the life of
a human, a human who

280
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:44,787
they have fallen in love with.

281
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,387
Ideally, I could kill Rem first.

282
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,687
Someone I was controlling
would attack Misa,

283
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,187
forcing Rem to save her, but--
no, that would never work.

284
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,053
If Misa's life
was put in danger,

285
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:56,553
Rem would immediately
suspect me,

286
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:59,687
and I'd be the one
who'd get killed.

287
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,320
As things stand, she's a
bigger nuisance than L is.

288
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:04,453
Huh?

289
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:06,620
She-- she's famous?

290
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,920
Oh, I don't even
want to imagine what

291
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:12,820
would happen if someone
found out about us.

292
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:13,687
Damn it.

293
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,753
She's nothing but trouble.

294
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:16,653
What should I do?

295
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:19,253
No, more importantly,
I need to think

296
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:22,720
of how I can use Misa's
eyes to help me kill L.

297
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:24,553
If I can eliminate him--

298
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:30,087
SAYU: Good morning, Light.

299
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,320
-Good morning.

300
00:12:31,353 --> 00:12:34,487
LIGHT: Mom, Sayu, could
you do me a big favor

301
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,887
and keep Misa a secret
from Dad for now?

302
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,220
-All right.

303
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:40,720
-Actually, it's not just Dad.

304
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:43,053
You can't tell anyone
else about her either.

305
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,153
You see, Misa's an
up-and-coming model,

306
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:47,153
so people can't know about us.

307
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:47,720
-What!

308
00:12:47,753 --> 00:12:49,020
Is she really?

309
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:51,820
I thought she was pretty,
but I had no idea.

310
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:53,987
That's pretty impressive,
even for you, Light.

311
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,987
I'll keep it a secret for $50!

312
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,353
LIGHT'S MOTHER: Oh, stop it.

313
00:12:58,387 --> 00:13:02,153
-[laughs]

314
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,753
-Ah, on page number 246--

315
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:07,420
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Misa's final
message should arrive today.

316
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,953
Although before it ever
gets to the TV station,

317
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:12,620
it'll be rerouted to
task force headquarters.

318
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,320
I have to go down
there are some point

319
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,987
so I can see L's
reaction first hand.

320
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,653
KIYOMI: Light.

321
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:18,320
Light?

322
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:19,420
-Hm?

323
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:20,787
-I thought you and I
were seeing each other.

324
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,987
That is, we're more than
just friends, aren't we?

325
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,720
-Yeah, we are.

326
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:26,120
-Exactly.

327
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,753
And that's the reason why I'm
sitting next to you in class,

328
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:28,587
wouldn't you agree?

329
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,920
-Sure.

330
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,420
KIYOMI: But you don't look
like you enjoy being with me.

331
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:34,920
I mean, you haven't
even looked at me once.

332
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:36,953
-That's not true at all.

333
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:38,953
I guess I was just thinking
about how everyone's

334
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:40,787
going to be talking
about us now.

335
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,320
To think that I'm
actually going out

336
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:44,653
with Ms. Takada, the
famous Ms. Todai.

337
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,553
I mean, you're the most
beautiful woman at this school.

338
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:48,920
-[laughs]

339
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,120
--[clears throat] Why do you
even care about stuff like that?

340
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:54,853
Besides, I hate being called
Ms. Todai or whatever.

341
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,320
It's embarrassing.

342
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:57,320
-Yeah, you're right.

343
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:58,787
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
What do you know?

344
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,353
She actually likes
all the attention.

345
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,220
LIGHT: We should forget
about all that stuff,

346
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:05,220
and just go at our own pace.

347
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:06,487
KIYOMI: Yeah.

348
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,920
PROFESSOR: --increased
levels of dual-income housing

349
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:10,453
through the 1990s.

350
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:12,320
LIGHT: Hello.

351
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:13,620
-Oh, come in.

352
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,087
Your timing couldn't
be better, actually.

353
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,020
We just received a new video
message from the second Kira.

354
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:20,787
-Huh?

355
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,520
Wow, that didn't take long.

356
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:23,320
YAGAMI: Yes.

357
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:25,687
I believe it's the last one.

358
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,220
Well, take a look at this.

359
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:31,553
MAN (ON VIDEO): I've decided
to stop searching for Kira.

360
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:34,720
And I'd like to thank the police
department for their advice.

361
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:38,387
However, I still plan to
help Kira in his mission.

362
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,420
And I hope that, in time, you
will come to see me as an ally.

363
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:43,287
I will start by
punishing criminals

364
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,787
that Kira has yet to judge.

365
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,420
Also, I will share my power with
others who I feel are worthy.

366
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,487
And I will encourage
them to do the same.

367
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,587
Together, we'll make this
world a better place.

368
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,853
L: After watching
this, I can only

369
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,687
think that Kira
and the second Kira

370
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,553
have managed to make contact.

371
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:04,187
-What makes you say that?

372
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,020
-Oh, come on.

373
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:06,153
Didn't you sense it?

374
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:07,720
I was sure you'd come
to the same conclusion

375
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,853
after I did after watching
this once through.

376
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,687
First, consider how determined
he was to meet Kira.

377
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,353
So why the sudden
change of heart?

378
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:20,753
Now he wants to punish
criminals that Kira hasn't?

379
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:25,920
And all he wants out of it is
for Kira to see him as an ally?

380
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:28,487
Mm, it begs the
question, why didn't he

381
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,853
do this to begin with?

382
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,220
I'm guessing it's because he
never thought that far ahead.

383
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:34,320
He probably met
Kira and was told

384
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:37,453
which criminals he'd
be allowed to judge.

385
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:39,687
Mm, I suspect the
purpose of this message

386
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,020
is to hide the
fact that they met.

387
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:43,053
LIGHT: I see.

388
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,920
What I find really
strange is that it's

389
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:47,053
unlike Kira to be so careless.

390
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:48,120
-That's true.

391
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:49,820
[slurp] Mm.

392
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,653
But are we to believe that
Kira made a mistake this time?

393
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,320
Or is this his way
of letting us know

394
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,453
that they have made contact?

395
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,153
It would be an effective
means of provoking us.

396
00:15:58,187 --> 00:16:00,920
The idea of their union
is very threatening.

397
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:02,887
However, this is
also one less reason

398
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,487
to suspect that Light is Kira.

399
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,020
-Ryuzaki, what do
you mean by that?

400
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:10,453
-If Light is Kira,
I don't think this

401
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:12,953
is the message he would have
had the second Kira send us.

402
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,620
It doesn't fit.

403
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:17,353
He would have made the second
Kira go through with his plan

404
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:20,320
to have me appear on TV,
then deny that they ever

405
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,420
made contact, letting
the second Kira shoulder

406
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:24,287
the blame for my death.

407
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,753
He'd make him say
something like, hm,

408
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:31,687
although I agreed not
to go through with this,

409
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,553
I have come to realize that it
was not Kira's true intention

410
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:35,820
that I stop.

411
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:38,687
I'm positive that the real
Kira would want L to die.

412
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,453
There's no way
he'd make me stop.

413
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,220
[slurp] Mm.

414
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:43,787
LIGHT: Ryuzaki?

415
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,687
-Yes, Light?

416
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,087
LIGHT: I think you're mistaken.

417
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,753
I would never do
that if I were Kira.

418
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:49,820
L: Why not?

419
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:52,087
-Well, if you're L
and I'm Kira, then I'd

420
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,787
already know your
personality pretty well.

421
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,220
L would never agree to
appear on TV, no matter

422
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:58,787
what threat he was facing.

423
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,753
And he wouldn't allow someone
else to die in his place.

424
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:06,287
The L I know would find some
way to escape the situation.

425
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,920
-So, you've figured it out?

426
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:08,920
-Look, Light.

427
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:10,153
You've got to stop that.

428
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:11,920
I don't like hearing
you say, "if I

429
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:14,053
were Kira," even hypothetically.

430
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:16,353
-Oh, I'm sorry Dad.

431
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,487
I just wanted to
let Ryuzaki know

432
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,087
exactly what I
thought of his plan.

433
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
-Hm.

434
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,853
LIGHT: I posed that
scenario because I

435
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:24,220
want to help solve this case.

436
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,320
It's the only chance I
have to clear my name.

437
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:29,020
Besides, the only reason I
feel comfortable saying things

438
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:32,453
like that is because
I'm not really Kira.

439
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,787
L: That's a good point.

440
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,120
You're not Kira.

441
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:40,820
That is, it would be a
problem if you were Kira,

442
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:45,253
because I feel you're the first
friend that I have ever had.

443
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:45,753
RYUK: Oh-ho.

444
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:55,020
L: Uh, yeah, I
know what you mean.

445
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,553
The two of us have
a lot in common.

446
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:03,478
-Thank you.

447
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:06,511
-And I have missed having
you around at school.

448
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,844
We should play
tennis again soon.

449
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:11,411
-Yes, we should.

450
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,078
-A friend?

451
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:23,078
He's your friend?

452
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:25,278
That's a good thing,
isn't it, Light?

453
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:28,411
-That damn Ryuzaki had no
problem figuring out Kira

454
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:30,978
and the second Kira had made
contact with each other.

455
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,844
I've got to eliminate
him right away.

456
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,044
-I see.

457
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:37,044
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): The way
things are progressing,

458
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:38,711
I can't afford to
be seen with Misa.

459
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,644
MISA: Light!

460
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:42,111
-[grunt] Ah!

461
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:44,578
MISA: I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't wait for two weeks

462
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:45,678
like you said.

463
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:47,078
Actually, I was just
on my way to your house

464
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:49,378
when I spotted you. [giggle]

465
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,644
-[groan]

466
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:52,311
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): This is
the first time in my life

467
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,644
that I've been provoked
to hit a woman.

468
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:58,644
-I-- I just wanted
to see you so badly.

469
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:01,044
-Well, you might
as well come over.

470
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:01,544
-Yay!

471
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,011
-Another girlfriend?

472
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,011
-Oh!

473
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:11,444
Great to see you, Misa.

474
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:14,211
I saw you in a whole
bunch of magazines.

475
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:16,344
-Please, come on in.

476
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,344
--[giggle] Sorry to
drop by like this.

477
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:20,078
-Could you make
us some tea, Mom?

478
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:24,311
Rem.

479
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:25,511
-Huh?

480
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:28,811
-You are Misa's
ally, aren't you?

481
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,011
-Yes.

482
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,511
I'd seen her many times
from the Shinigami realm.

483
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:37,011
And then certain events made
me develop feelings for her.

484
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:37,711
-Feelings?

485
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,078
But you're a Shinigami.

486
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,478
[laughs]

487
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:42,411
-You don't like
what I said before,

488
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:46,344
about how I'd kill you if you
even attempted to kill Misa.

489
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,978
-So, if Misa is
happy, does that mean

490
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:50,711
that you'll be happy as well?

491
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:52,978
-I suppose you could say that.

492
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:56,144
I definitely don't
want her to suffer.

493
00:19:56,178 --> 00:20:00,678
LIGHT: As you know,
Misa loves me.

494
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:02,678
-Oh, Light.

495
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:03,878
-Misa.

496
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,078
-Yes?

497
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:07,811
-If I was happy, would
that make you happy, too?

498
00:20:07,844 --> 00:20:08,578
MISA: Yes.

499
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,811
-[laughs]

500
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:14,278
LIGHT: Then could you
ask Rem to kill L?

501
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:15,744
-Huh?

502
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:17,611
-Rem said that your
happiness was important.

503
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:20,611
But what do you think would
happen if L caught one of us?

504
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,711
It means our happiness
would be ruined.

505
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:26,478
--[laughs] It's true that
Shinigami are forbidden to give

506
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,878
out a person's name to anyone.

507
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:30,844
But then again,
there's no rule that

508
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:32,511
prevents Rem from
killing anyone.

509
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:33,611
-That's right.

510
00:20:33,644 --> 00:20:35,578
And if you agree to
kill L, it would only

511
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,511
make me love Misa
that much more.

512
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:39,478
Plus, I'd be grateful to you.

513
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:43,344
Most importantly, the two of
us will be happy together.

514
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:46,311
-Rem, I want Light to love me.

515
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:48,911
And I know we could
be happy together.

516
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:50,544
It's all I ever wanted.

517
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:03,111
-That's a shame.

518
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:03,811
REM: Fine.

519
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:05,644
-[gasp]

520
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:07,778
-As you wish, Light Yagami.

521
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,844
But I do not like you.

522
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:12,278
This will not kill
me, even if it ends up

523
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:14,644
lengthening your life.

524
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:16,878
I will kill L for you.

525
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,144
It really makes no difference.

526
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:20,444
He is just another human to me.

527
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,444
MISA: Hooray!

528
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:24,378
Oh, Rem, thank you so much.

529
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:27,578
I knew I could count on you.

530
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:30,011
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): L will die.

531
00:21:30,044 --> 00:21:31,478
That's all it took.

532
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:42,291
[theme music]

533
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:51,421
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): That's right.

534
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:55,187
Ryuga revealed that he's
L. Therefore, he must die.

535
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:56,587
The game is over.

536
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:59,954
[laugh] Tomorrow will
be L's, or at least

537
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:03,454
Ryuga and Ryuzaki's,
last day alive.
