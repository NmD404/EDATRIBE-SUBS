2
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,254
-Ryuzaki.

3
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:43,187
Please let me go
and make the arrest.

4
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:45,001
-I'd like to come with you,
Chief, if that's all right.

5
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,001
-I understand.

6
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:47,334
But remember, this is Kira.

7
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:49,567
Be sure to take every
precaution when you approach him

8
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:52,101
and don't allow him
to see your face.

9
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:53,367
Watari.

10
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,901
If Higuchi tries anything
or makes any sudden moves--

11
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:56,934
-Understood.

12
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,867
I will shoot to stop
him, not to kill.

13
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:08,734
-Aizawa, do you have
a helmet or something

14
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:09,967
to hide your face with?

15
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,634
-I do.

16
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,201
-Good.

17
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:13,934
Then cover me.

18
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,934
-Yes sir.

19
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,234
You can count on me, Chief.

20
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,767
-Higuchi.

21
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,767
Put your hands above your
head and get out of the car.

22
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,701
We've apprehended him.

23
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:39,867
-Mogi.

24
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:42,067
I want you to put a
headset on him as planned.

25
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:43,034
MOGI (ON RADIO): Roger.

26
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:46,034
L (ON RADIO): Higuchi.

27
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:48,134
How were you able
to kill people?

28
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:48,634
Tell me!

29
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,834
If you're not
going to talk, I'll

30
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:56,534
use whatever means necessary
to get it out of you.

31
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,067
-The notebook.

32
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,234
L (ON RADIO): Notebook?

33
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,134
-You probably won't
believe me, but I've

34
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,401
got a special notebook.

35
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,367
If I write someone's name
in it while thinking about

36
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,667
of their face, that person dies.

37
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,034
L (VOICEOVER): A notebook.

38
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,367
Mr. Yagami.

39
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,634
-Yeah, I found it.

40
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,534
It was in one of the
compartments of Higuchi's bag.

41
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,034
He has written a
lot of names in it,

42
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,267
but there doesn't seem to be
anything else unusual about it.

43
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:27,334
[screaming]

44
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,001
L (ON RADIO): What
is it, Mr. Yagami?

45
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,534
-It's a monster.

46
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,134
-Please calm down.

47
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:34,467
Don't panic.

48
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,667
Remember, you're not currently
armed to defend yourself.

49
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,401
-Oh.

50
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,034
All right.

51
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:38,601
Of course.

52
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:39,167
-Chief.

53
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:39,801
Hang in there.

54
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:40,901
Are you all right?

55
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,601
-Mogi, can't you see
that thing over there?

56
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:44,534
-Chief.

57
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,334
I think you must
be getting tired.

58
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:47,634
[screaming]

59
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,467

60
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:49,701
What's wrong?

61
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:51,634
-It-- that thing.

62
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:55,267
It seems only people who have
touched the notebook can-- can

63
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,401
see this-- this monster.

64
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:02,434
L (ON RADIO): Please
bring the notebook over

65
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:03,334

-Uh, oh.

67
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:04,867
OK.

68
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,967
REM (VOICEOVER): What in the
world are you planning to do,

69
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,667
Light Yagami?

70
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,734
Once you take hold of
that notebook again,

71
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,801
all the memories
of the Death Note

72
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:19,767
and what you did while it was
yours will return at once.

73
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,267
However--

74
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:23,901
-Here it is, Ryuzaki.

75
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:27,567
-Hm.

76
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:37,167
It really is a Shinigami.

77
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:40,267
They really do exist.

78
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,234
Light Yagami--

79
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:45,667
[voices whispering]

80
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,834
-Ryuzaki, come on.

81
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:49,334
Let me see it.

82
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:52,034
L (VOICEOVER): Two books.

83
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,367
There have to be two notebooks.

84
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:54,767
Possibly more.

85
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,701
This isn't over yet.

86
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:07,934
[screaming]

87
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,834
[voices whispering]

88
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,667
-Uh, are you OK, Light?

89
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:32,267
I suppose seeing that monster
would surprise anyone.

90
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:32,901
LIGHT: Ryuzaki.

91
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:35,367
-What is it?

92
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,667
-I want to check this out.

93
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,501
I'm going to try comparing
the names written

94
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:40,901
in this notebook with
the names of the victims.

95
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:41,401
-Hm?

96
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,934
Oh, right.

97
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,401
Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.

98
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:53,634
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I've won.

99
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,434
Exactly as planned.

100
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:07,001
I hereby forfeit ownership
of this notebook.

101
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:11,067
Now, that means ownership is
transferred back to you, right?

102
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:11,734
-Yes.

103
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,701
I already told you.

104
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:16,201
-Next, pass it on to Ryuk.

105
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:18,434
-Hm?

106
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,234
-Very well.

107
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:21,934
Here.

108
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,367
-Now that notebook's
ownership has

109
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:25,767
been transferred
from you to Ryuk.

110
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:26,901
OK, Ryuk.

111
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:28,267
Take the notebook and
drop it on the ground

112
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,734
so it's in the
human world again.

113
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:31,234
-Huh?

114
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,201
Well, OK.

115
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:39,501
-Now the ownership
goes back to me.

116
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:40,467
-Whoa, hang on.

117
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,334
It's just gone
around in a circle.

118
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,067
Nothing's changed, right?

119
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:46,701
-Maybe, at first glance.

120
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:49,701
But there will be a time
when I'll benefit from this.

121
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:53,334
Now, as for this notebook,
the one I first received,

122
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:55,067
I'm gonna give it
back to you, Ryuk.

123
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:56,667
Then you hand it over to Rem.

124
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:01,767
-Here.

125
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:09,967
-Rem, I want you to give
the notebook to someone

126
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:12,401
with status who lusts
for power and money.

127
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,867
They'll end up using the
notebook to satisfy that urge.

128
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,334
If you do that, I can
guarantee that Misa

129
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,667
will be released from
her confinement soon.

130
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:23,101
And if I'm wrong,
and if it looks

131
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:25,801
like she won't be released for
years, then you can kill me.

132
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:27,601
That sound fair to you?

133
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:29,367
-Light Yagami.

134
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:30,867
Just what are you thinking?

135
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:31,634
-Look.

136
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,234
This is all to save Misa.

137
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:34,867
You're gonna have
to trust me on this.

138
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:40,034
-All right.

139
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:44,934
If it means that Misa will
be saved, I'll do as you ask.

140
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,934
-After this, I'll go and demand
to be confined like Misa,

141
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:52,501
and have them put me under
24 hour surveillance as well.

142
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:54,434
While I'm locked
up, I'll relinquish

143
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,367
ownership of the
notebook to you.

144
00:07:56,401 --> 00:08:00,034
That'll mean I'll lose all my
memories of the Death Note.

145
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:04,467
During this time, the killings
of criminals will start again.

146
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,434
Once that happens,
Ryuzaki will be

147
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:10,234
put in a position where
he has to release us.

148
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:13,067
And, after I've lost
all my memories,

149
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:16,701
chances are I'll want to
help catch Kira myself.

150
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:19,367
That's just the way I am.

151
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:21,601
-So then you'll try
and catch the guy who

152
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:25,334
Rem gives the notebook to and
steal it before L gets to it.

153
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:26,701
-Right.

154
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:29,967
Once that's done, I'll kill
the new owner of the notebook.

155
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:33,001
But there's still one
problem remaining.

156
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,601
-If you don't have
full ownership,

157
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:36,867
your memories will
only return for as long

158
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:38,767
as you're in contact
with the notebook.

159
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,967
As soon as you let go
of it, your memories

160
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:41,901
will disappear again.

161
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:46,834
LIGHT: That means I've
got to kill Higuchi

162
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:49,134
without letting go
of this notebook.

163
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,801
If I manage to do
that, ownership

164
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,401
will transfer back to me and
my memories won't disappear.

165
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:59,967
I just have to pull this four
times in less than a second.

166
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,301
Got it.

167
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,801
Just as I expected.

168
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,867
I'm wearing this watch.

169
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,201
Old habits die hard.

170
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,234
-Mr. Yagami.

171
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,867
Please take Higuchi to the car.

172
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,701
-Uh, right.

173
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:25,334
Of course.

174
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,301
-You know, about this notebook.

175
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:37,967
I wonder what we would
find if we put it

176
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,567
through a forensic analysis.

177
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,367
-That doesn't sound
like you, Light.

178
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:45,801
We both know this thing
is beyond science.

179
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,734
-Yeah, you're right.

180
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:48,234
Hm.

181
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:02,267
This has got to be the
longest 40 seconds of my life.

182
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:20,901
-Ryuzaki.

183
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,467
Hiroguchi is--

184
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,167
-What the hell?

185
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,701
What's happening?

186
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:26,967
CHIEF YAGAMI: Hey!

187
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,634
Higuchi!

188
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,967
-LIGHT: Dad, what are you doing?

189
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,467
We can't lose him!

190
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:33,134
If Higuchi dies on us now--

191
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,367
CHIEF YAGAMI: It's impossible.

192
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,201
I-- There's nothing I can do.

193
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:37,934
He's already--

194
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:42,101
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Yes.

195
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:44,301
He's already dead.

196
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:45,934
And you're next, Ryuzaki.

197
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:29,608
-Hm.

198
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:32,542
How to use it.

199
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:36,042
It says the human whose name
is written in this notebook

200
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,875
shall die.

201
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:40,508
This note will not take
effect unless the writer has

202
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,642
a person's face in their mind
when writing his or her name,

203
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:47,242
therefore people sharing the
same name will not be affected.

204
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:50,475
If the cause of death is written
within 40 seconds of writing

205
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,542
the person's name,
it will happen.

206
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:54,342
If the cause of death
is not specified,

207
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,675
the person will simply
die of a heart attack.

208
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:02,342
After writing the cause of
death, details of the death

209
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,142
should be written in the next
6 minutes and 40 seconds.

210
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:13,208
As well, the back cover
has some more instructions

211
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:14,308
on how to use it.

212
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:15,675
There are two more rules.

213
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,208
One of them is if you make this
note unusable by tearing it

214
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:22,175
up or burning it, all the humans
who have touched the note 'til

215
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,375
then will die.

216
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,175
-What?

217
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,208
Is that really true, Aizawa?

218
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:26,575
Aizwa: Yeah, that's
what it says.

219
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:27,808
-(VOICEOVER) That's right.

220
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:29,775
With a rule like that in
place, the notebook's safety

221
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:35,742
is guaranteed, which means my
memories of it will remain.

222
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:38,575
-Rem, there's no way the old
man back home will get mad at us

223
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:40,708
if we write fake rules
in here, is there?

224
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:41,708
-No.

225
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:43,742
There are no rules
against doing so.

226
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,475
-Fine, then, Light, I'll do it.

227
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:47,708
But you owe me an
apple for this.

228
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:50,075
[laughter]

229
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:51,108
-Oh, man.

230
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:52,442
Maybe I shouldn't
have let my curiosity

231
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,975
about seeing a Shinigami
get the better of me.

232
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,342
-Maybe.

233
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,942
But then you would be the only
one in the investigation who

234
00:12:57,975 --> 00:12:59,708
didn't know what we
were dealing with.

235
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:01,008
Is that what you want?

236
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:01,575
-No.

237
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:02,708
Of course not.

238
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,008
I want to be on the same
page as everyone else

239
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:06,208
on the task force, Chief.

240
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:08,475
-And then there's
this last rule.

241
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,608
According to these instructions
at the back of the notebook,

242
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:18,975
if the person using the note
fails to consecutively write

243
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:22,575
names of people to be killed
within 13 days of each other,

244
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:27,142
then the user will die.

245
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:28,108
-Ah!

246
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,608
Wait a second.

247
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,508
If that's true, then
it means Light and Misa

248
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,408
Misa are completely
clear, doesn't it?

249
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:33,975
-Hm.

250
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:35,008
Yeah.

251
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,242
Now that you mention
it, that's right.

252
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,675
Light and Misa were detained
for more than 50 days,

253
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,075
and are still
under surveillance.

254
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:42,008
If either of them had
been Kira, there's

255
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,842
no way they would
still be alive by now.

256
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,875
-Wow, that's great news.

257
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:45,542
Isn't it, Chief?

258
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,108
-Yeah.

259
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:48,908
-Rem, was it?

260
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:50,008
That's your name, isn't it?

261
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,642
The white thing over there?

262
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:53,408
-Ryuzaki, isn't it
a bit rude to go

263
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:54,975
around calling
someone a white thing?

264
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,742
-What do you want?

265
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:59,042
-There's more than one
notebook in the human world,

266
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:01,542
isn't there?

267
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,075
REM: Who knows?

268
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,375
There may be, and
there may not be.

269
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:09,608
-If there are other notebooks,
either here or in your world,

270
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,842
would they all have the
same rules as this one?

271
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,942
-(VOICEOVER) You're
wasting your time, Ryuzaki.

272
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,775
You'll never get Rem to
admit these rules are fake.

273
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:19,108
-Yes, they are all the same.

274
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:21,675
There are many notebooks
in the Shinigami realm,

275
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,808
but they all have
the same rules.

276
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:27,142
Even the rules for when
humans obtain them.

277
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:28,475
-Ryuzaki.

278
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:30,742
Miss Amane and Light have both
been cleared of suspicion.

279
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:33,242
They shouldn't be under
surveillance any longer.

280
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:33,908
-That's right.

281
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:34,842
It's crystal clear.

282
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:39,108
-I suppose you're right.

283
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:52,108
I understand.

284
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,708
Please, accept my apologies
for all the trouble.

285
00:14:58,675 --> 00:14:59,908
-Thank goodness.

286
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,408
-Yeah, but we still
can't say that we've

287
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,575
solved the case until we've
figured out everything.

288
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:06,842
Would it be all right if I
kept investigating with you?

289
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,008
Without the handcuffs on?

290
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,375
-Yes.

291
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:15,475
-(VOICEOVER) And just like that,
Misa and I are proven innocent.

292
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:19,375
A notebook of death filled with
rules written by a Shinigami.

293
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:22,375
He has no choice
but to believe it.

294
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:27,275
He just lost his edge, thanks
to the fake rules I created.

295
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:32,508
Listen, Ryuzaki, no matter what
the word, the god of that world

296
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:33,608
creates the rules.

297
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,542
In truth, you've
already been defeated

298
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,375
by the rules I created.

299
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:40,442
And as punishment for defying
the god of the new world,

300
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:41,642
you will die.

301
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:47,475
-Oh, Light!

302
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:50,475
Be sure to text
me every day, OK?

303
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:52,808
-After all this time, we're
saying goodbye to Misa Misa.

304
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:54,375
-Knock it off, Matsuda.

305
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:56,242
Let's leave them alone.

306
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:57,575
MATSUDA: Goodbye, Misa Misa!

307
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:58,142
AIZAWA: Enough!

308
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:02,808
LIGHT: Good.

309
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:04,175
There are surveillance
cameras, but they

310
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,942
won't be able to pick up my
face or mouth from this angle.

311
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:10,175
Misa, I'm going to tell
you about a special place.

312
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,142
I need you to go there
and dig something up,

313
00:16:12,175 --> 00:16:14,242
but you have to make sure
that no one is watching.

314
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:15,075
-(VOICEOVER) Light!

315
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,608
Your memory must have returned.

316
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,175
Don't worry, I can do this.

317
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,608
I won't let you down.

318
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:31,342
[gasp]

319
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,442
-Light, I remember.

320
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:44,275
I remember everything
that happened

321
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:45,742
when I had this notebook.

322
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:48,542
You buried this one so I
could come here and regain

323
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,042
my memories.

324
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:52,608
Huh?

325
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:58,075
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Dear Misa, by
the time you read this letter,

326
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:01,042
you should have
remembered everything.

327
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:04,175
-Oh, a letter from Light!

328
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,008
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Do
you remember my friend

329
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,408
at To-Oh University?

330
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:10,808
He went by the
name Hideki Ryuga.

331
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:13,175
I want you to write his
real name in the notebook

332
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,875
and kill him.

333
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,175
Then burn this
letter right away.

334
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,408
Take a number of pages from
the notebook and re-bury

335
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:22,242
it where you found it.

336
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,075
The next time that
we see each other,

337
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,475
casually touch me with
a piece of the notebook.

338
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:30,975
If you do this for me, I
promise I will love you--

339
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,375
-For the rest of my life!

340
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,208
Yay!

341
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:35,408
Now I see.

342
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,442
This was all part
of Light's plan.

343
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:38,908
He wanted me to
get this notebook,

344
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:43,942
regain all my memories,
and then kill Hideki Ryuga.

345
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,208
Kill Ryuzaki.

346
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:48,708
One of Light's biggest
obstacles will be gone,

347
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:50,242
and I'll be helpful
to him at last!

348
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,308
-But Light, it's no good.

349
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,142
I don't remember
his name anymore.

350
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:03,208
I was seeing dozens-- no, no,
hundreds of names and lifespans

351
00:18:03,242 --> 00:18:06,308
every day!

352
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:07,275
Oh!

353
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:09,608
I can't remember
it, no matter what!

354
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,075
Oh, I'm such an idiot!

355
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,675
Huh?

356
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,408
-I've finally returned
to the human world.

357
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,375
-Ryuk!

358
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:18,808
Oh, it's been so long!

359
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:20,475
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

360
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:21,442
How are you doing?

361
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:26,175
-Sorry-- I'm a guy.

362
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,775
I get a little shy sometimes.

363
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:29,275
-Oh, yeah.

364
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:29,975
I almost forgot.

365
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,175
Here.

366
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:36,575
Light told me to
bring one for you.

367
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,408
Is it really that good?

368
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:39,342
-Oh, yeah.

369
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,542
Human apples are--
what's the word?

370
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,242
Juicy, I think.

371
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:43,075
They're great, anyway.

372
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:47,708
Why don't you try this?

373
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:49,142
-Huh?

374
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:53,308
-An apple from the
Shinigami world.

375
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:54,075
-Ew.

376
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:55,275
It doesn't look very good.

377
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:55,975
-Come on.

378
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:59,208
One bite won't kill ya.

379
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:00,942
-By the way, before
I forget, I want

380
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,308
you to make the
eye deal with me.

381
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:07,542
Ah!

382
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:08,808
It's sand!

383
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:09,308
Ugh.

384
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,575
-A deal, huh?

385
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:17,475
-Mm-hm.

386
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:19,708
-You understand what that means?

387
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,908
You already made the same
deal with Rem once before.

388
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:26,442
Are you sure you really want
me to cut your lifespan in half

389
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,408
for the second time?

390
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:31,142
-I know, but what
choice do I have?

391
00:19:31,175 --> 00:19:33,508
You see, I've forgotten
a name that I absolutely

392
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,375
have to remember.

393
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:40,575
Light will be so mad at
me if I let him down.

394
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:42,042
-Well, it's fine with me.

395
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:49,142
[buzz]

396
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:50,975
-Hey, it's Misa Misa.

397
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:51,908
The poor girl.

398
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,175
As long as we're
stuck in here, we

399
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,375
can't turn our cell phones on.

400
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:55,775
So she has to come
all the way out

401
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:58,342
here just to hang
out with Light.

402
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,542
-Light, would you hurry
up and go see her?

403
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,008
Don't you know, you should
never keep a woman waiting?

404
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:04,542
-OK.

405
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:08,942
-Huh?

406
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,975
Ryuk?

407
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:13,275
Why is he attached to Misa?

408
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:13,775
Huh?

409
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,442
Misa's lifespan.

410
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:20,775
It's been halved again.

411
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:21,742
No!

412
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:23,275
Did she make the
eye deal with Ryuk?

413
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:26,975
-Hey, Light.

414
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,342
-It's been a while, Ryuk.

415
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:41,642
-Light, I'm so sorry.

416
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,508
I don't remember Hideki
Ryuga's real name.

417
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,075
I tried, but I totally forgot.

418
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:47,175
-Oh, I see.

419
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,542
Well, that's too bad.

420
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:51,942
-But I did the eye deal with
Ryuk so I can try again!

421
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:54,342
-So, everything's going
according to plan.

422
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,442
-You idiot!

423
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:57,675
If you do that, then
your life span will--

424
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,675
-No, it's all right.

425
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,408
I just wanna be of
use to you, Light.

426
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:06,842
-Misa.

427
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,442
All I want is to enjoy
a long life with you

428
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,008
in an ideal world.

429
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,408
That's just how I feel.

430
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,875
-Light, I'm so happy.

431
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:16,775
-Let's create a
new world together.

432
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,875
It'll be a place with no crime,
where only kind people live,

433
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:20,575
OK?

434
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:21,075
-Yeah.

435
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,064
[theme music]

436
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,530
LIGHT: Goodbye, L.
