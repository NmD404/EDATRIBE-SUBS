[music playing]

00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:15,800
[music - nightmare, "the world"]

3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,106
-Uh.

4
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,573
-Huh?

5
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:45,040
-Huh?

6
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:48,006
-Uh--

7
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:49,522
-I am L.

8
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:51,222
SOICHIRO YAGAMI
(VOICEOVER): This is him?

9
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:52,488
TOUTA MATSUDA (VOICEOVER): Hm.

10
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:55,388
He's nothing like
I thought he'd be.

11
00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:56,955
-Hm.

12
00:01:56,988 --> 00:01:59,555
I'm Yagami of the NPA.

13
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:00,788
-Uh, Matsuda.

14
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:02,388
-I'm Aizawa.

15
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,022
-Mogi.

16
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:05,688
-Ukita.

17
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:07,222
-I'm very sorry we're late.

18
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:09,188
Currently the five of us are--

19
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:09,755
-Bang.

20
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:10,229
-Uh!

21
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:10,704
-Wha?

22
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:11,404
-Uh?

23
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:12,504
-What the hell was that?

24
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:14,137
-Hm.

25
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,037
If I were Kira, you'd be
dead, Mr. Soichiro Yagami,

26
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,270
chief of the NPA.

27
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,770
-Wha?

28
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:23,137
-Kira needs a face and a name
in order to commit murder.

29
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,304
But I'm sure you've already
figured that much out,

30
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:26,770
haven't you?

31
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:29,970
Please do not give out
your names so carelessly.

32
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:33,404
Instead, let's value our lives.

33
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:35,304
-I knew that he needed
a face to kill someone,

34
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:36,970
but I don't remember
any evidence that

35
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:38,670
showed that he
needed a name, too.

36
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:40,670
-There's no way to verify
if this is related,

37
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:43,504
but criminals whose names
were never released publicly

38
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,870
or whose names were spelled
incorrectly in the media

39
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:47,470
have not been targeted.

40
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:50,904
We briefly went over it
at one of our meetings.

41
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,470
L: That's enough
small talk for now.

42
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:53,637
Come this way.

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,037
-Oh, uh, right.

44
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,537
L: Please turn off all
your cellphones, handhelds,

45
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,270
and any other
communication devices

46
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,104
and leave them on the
table right there.

47
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:04,804
-What, do you think we're going
to be using our cellphones

48
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:06,704
during this meeting
to leak information?

49
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:07,404
-It's all right.

50
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,470
Just do as he says.

51
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:11,237
TOUTA MATSUDA: I realize
he's been cautious

52
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,970
from the very
beginning, but I still

53
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:15,170
can't tell if he
trusts us or not.

54
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:16,670
L: No, I just find
them distracting.

55
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:19,070
I can't stand it when
people's cell phones are

56
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:21,737
ringing while I'm
trying to talk.

57
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,470
Let me start by saying nobody
takes notes on anything

58
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,770
that's said in these meetings.

59
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,337
That means when we
leave headquarters,

60
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,937
any information we need
is committed to memory.

61
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,537
Please, make
yourselves comfortable.

62
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,804
-Uh, right.

63
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:48,937
[slurps]

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,904
[gulp]

65
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:51,404
-Mm.

66
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:57,704
-Excuse me, L?

67
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,070
L: Mm.

68
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,637
And from now on, I'll have to
ask that you stop calling me

69
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,137
L. It's Ryuzaki now,
just to be safe.

70
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,070
-Uh, OK, Ryuzaki.

71
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:08,604
If we know that he needs
a name and a face to kill,

72
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:10,470
couldn't we cut down on
the number of victims

73
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:13,037
by keeping criminals'
names from the news?

74
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,537
-If we do that, we'll only
be putting the general public

75
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,304
at risk.

76
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,304
-The general public?

77
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:17,804
Why?

78
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,437
-Kira is childish
and he hates losing.

79
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,404
-But how do you--

80
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:26,437
-Just what do you mean?

81
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,037
-Well, I'm also childish
and I hate to lose.

82
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,837
That's how I know.

83
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,804
-Ryuzaki, would you mind being
a little more specific for us?

84
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,337
-Early on in the
investigation, I

85
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,337
tried to provoke Kira
with that broadcast.

86
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,337
Up until then we thought
that Kira would only

87
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,637
go after criminals, but
as we all witnessed,

88
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,504
he didn't hesitate
to kill my stand-in.

89
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:53,504
Also, as soon as I said we knew
he was in the Kanto region,

90
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:55,637
in defiance he made
sure his next victims

91
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,270
came from within
Japan, as if to say,

92
00:04:58,304 --> 00:04:59,937
and what are you
going to do about it?

93
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:04,404
He's met each of my
challenges head-on

94
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,104
and he's never
missed an opportunity

95
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:07,837
to return the favor.

96
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,270
Now what do you
think would happen

97
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:12,304
if we tried to use media
restrictions to hide criminals

98
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:14,337
from someone like that?

99
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,737
-I guess--

100
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,737
-"If you choose to withhold the
names of your worst criminals,

101
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,337
I'll kill petty criminals
or the innocent.

102
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,970
I'm holding the whole world
hostage, so who's it gonna be?

103
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:27,037
I'm not the evil
one here, but all

104
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,970
those who oppose me
by hiding criminals?

105
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:32,904
You are truly evil."

106
00:05:32,937 --> 00:05:35,604
[sigh] That's exactly
how Kira thinks.

107
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:37,170
In any case, let's
look at another way

108
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,804
we can use the media
to draw him out.

109
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:41,337
-But how?

110
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,804
-How about something like this?

111
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:46,970
"Death of FBI agents
infuriates the US.

112
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:49,137
Latest killings anger the
international policing

113
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,404
community.

114
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:53,837
Nations agree to send 1,500
investigators to Japan."

115
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,570
For Kira, this will
be way beyond what

116
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,304
he faced with the FBI.

117
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:59,904
He'll see everyone as
a potential threat.

118
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:02,070
Psychologically he'll
start to feel cornered,

119
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:05,804
and that will cause him to take
some kind of drastic action.

120
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:07,570
-That-- that's interesting.

121
00:06:07,604 --> 00:06:10,337
-So he'll think there are
1,500 when there are really

122
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,804
only seven of us.

123
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:13,937
And since none of these
investigators exists,

124
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,737
Kira won't be able to kill them.

125
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,604
-It just might work.

126
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:19,770
-Well, before we
celebrate, I'll tell you

127
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:22,370
the rest of my thoughts
on the Kira case.

128
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:24,337
[all murmur]

129
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,137
-Kira works alone.

130
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,104
He had access to all our
classified information.

131
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:32,604
-What evidence do you have
that he's working alone?

132
00:06:32,637 --> 00:06:33,904
-Hold on, Aizawa.

133
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:37,437
Let's listen to his entire
theory before asking questions.

134
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,237
-We know he needs a
name and a face to kill,

135
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,804
and to some extent, he can
control a victim's time

136
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,937
of death and their
actions before dying.

137
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,504
We already know that much.

138
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:50,470
Please keep that
in mind and listen

139
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:53,637
carefully to what
I have to say next.

140
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,170
On December 14, 12 FBI
investigators enter Japan.

141
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,304
Here we are on December 19.

142
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:06,370
Using prison inmates,
Kira conducts experiments,

143
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:09,070
manipulating his victims'
actions before they die.

144
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:12,104
In other words, during this
window of only five days,

145
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:14,537
Kira became aware of
the FBI's presence

146
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,537
and obviously felt threatened.

147
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,670
Because he didn't know any
of their names or faces,

148
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:21,804
he was at a disadvantage.

149
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:24,670
He needed to know how much
control he had over his victims

150
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:27,237
before he could use it
against the 12 agents.

151
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,670
And as we all know,
on December 27--

152
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:32,670
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I got
a hold of a file which

153
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:36,170
contained all the names and
faces of the FBI investigators

154
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:40,304
in Japan and I succeeded in
killing each one of them.

155
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:42,370
It's practically
impossible to guess

156
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:44,604
which agent gave
the file to Kira,

157
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:47,970
but I have to make sure
that no one ever finds out

158
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:50,470
that I came into contact
with Raye Pember.

159
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:55,370
-Huh?

160
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,337
How come you're not using
the Death Note today?

161
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,204
You studying for
those entrance exams?

162
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:01,037
-Those are the
least of my worries.

163
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,237
Plus, it's a little
late to start now.

164
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,804
-Oh?

165
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:04,737
What you doing?

166
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,970
LIGHT: December
19 to December 27.

167
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:11,337
I've been most active
during this period.

168
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,504
L: During this period, to
the best of our knowledge,

169
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:17,437
at least 23 individuals
died of heart attacks.

170
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,837
But these victims were different
from Kira's previous targets.

171
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,204
They were all alleged
criminals, ex-convicts,

172
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,437
or suspects in ongoing
investigations.

173
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,570
So legally speaking,
they were innocent.

174
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:28,770
-That's true.

175
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:31,137
-What this indicates
is that Kira

176
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,337
had to manipulate these
lesser criminals in order

177
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,704
to kill those FBI agents.

178
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,437
He killed that
many people so we'd

179
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,304
be unable to tell
the decoys from those

180
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:41,004
who were actually used.

181
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:44,504
In truth, he probably
only needed a few.

182
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,370
He waited eight days so
the FBI could investigate

183
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,870
other suspects, which meant
there'd be no time line linking

184
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,370
him to their deaths.

185
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:54,670
I suspect Kira had to be one of
the people being investigated

186
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:58,870
by the FBI between the 14th
and the 19th of December.

187
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:03,037
In fact, I have no doubt.

188
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,304
These are files
provided by the FBI,

189
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,270
and they contain
additional information

190
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:08,969
you might find useful.

191
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:10,669
For obvious reasons,
you're not permitted

192
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:12,336
to take these out
of this room, but--

193
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:13,702
TOUTA MATSUDA: Amazing!

194
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:16,402
There might only be five of
us, but with this information

195
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,169
we should be able to
cover a lot of ground.

196
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:19,569
-We'll split into two teams.

197
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,502
One team traces the FBI agents.

198
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:23,336
The other looks at the
heart attack victims.

199
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:25,902
-There weren't that many people
who had access to information

200
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:28,102
from headquarters, and
of those, the FBI only

201
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:30,802
investigated a small group
in the first five days.

202
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:31,302
-Yeah.

203
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:32,802
Yeah.

204
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:35,102
-So does anyone
have any questions?

205
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:35,602
-Uh?

206
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:36,802
-Uh?

207
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:40,202
-Actually, Ryuzaki, I do
have one question for you,

208
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:42,536
and it pertains to what you
said to us earlier about how

209
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:43,669
you hate to lose.

210
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:45,302
Is the fact that you've
shown us your face mean

211
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,602
that you've lost?

212
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,469
By just being here, are you
admitting defeat to Kira?

213
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:50,669
-That's right.

214
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:52,969
By showing my face to you
now and by sacrificing

215
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:57,136
the lives of 12 FBI agents,
I have lost the battle.

216
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,436
But I'm not going
to lose the war.

217
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:02,536
This is the first time I've
ever put my life on the line.

218
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,236
I want to show
Kira that we're all

219
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,802
willing to risk our lives if
that's what it takes-- hmf,

220
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:11,202
and that justice will
prevail no matter what.

221
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,902
-Hey, yeah, that's right.

222
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:14,369
-I like the sound of that.

223
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:15,636
-We can do this.

224
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:16,402
-All right, then.

225
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:17,736
Let's do this, Ryuzaki.

226
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,002
SOICHIRO YAGAMI (VOICEOVER):
Well, I had my doubts about

227
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,936
whether it was
really him at first,

228
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,836
but there's no mistaking it.

229
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:26,302
This man is L.

230
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:27,802
-Before we go any
further, I have

231
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,836
to be absolutely sure
that none of you are Kira,

232
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:31,402
so I'll need to speak
with each of you

233
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:34,036
individually before
you leave today.

234
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:35,302
-Huh.

235
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:36,436
What's the deal?

236
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,702
He still doesn't trust us?

237
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,969
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: No, I
think it's a fair request.

238
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:41,869
Try to see it from
his perspective.

239
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:44,269
Kira's been getting information
from our headquarters

240
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,702
from the very beginning,
so there's a good chance

241
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:47,569
that he's one of us.

242
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:48,969
-Chief's right.

243
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:51,602
Working this case has given us
a chance to see him in person.

244
00:10:51,636 --> 00:10:53,136
-He's risking his
life to be here.

245
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,336
L (VOICEOVER): Things
are going well.

246
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:02,102
Just one clue, a single
decisive factor's all I need.

247
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,802
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Just one oversight.

248
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:08,569
A single piece of evidence
is all it would take.

249
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,636
It could cost me my life.

250
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,036
BOTH (VOICEOVER):
Just one thing.

251
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,864
RYUK: You already
finished studying?

252
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:42,930
-I guess.

253
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:44,264
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I'll be fine.

254
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:45,697
I haven't missed anything.

255
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,464
The biggest risk
I've taken so far

256
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,797
was that bus-jacking incident.

257
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,264
But they'll never be able
to connect it with Kira.

258
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:55,197
Fortunately for me,
both the police and L

259
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,064
don't know that
Kira can kill people

260
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:59,197
by means other than
a heart attack.

261
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,630
However, if anyone were
to discover that fact,

262
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,197
I'd be in a lot of trouble.

263
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,097
-What?

264
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,630
Does it have to be now?

265
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:08,430
-Your father's been
pulling overnighters

266
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:09,964
with no change of
clothes, so you're

267
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,130
going to bring these to him.

268
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,964
-But Mom, I totally
promised my friends

269
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:14,630
that I'd go out with them today.

270
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:15,897
-Why don't I go?

271
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,030
I could use a break.

272
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,264
-Thanks, Light.

273
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:20,697
I owe you one next time.

274
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,030
-So I guess this will give you
a chance to spy on the police.

275
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:25,864
-I won't go further
than the reception desk.

276
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,064
RYUK: Oh, you're
bringing a page.

277
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:34,964
Planning to kill someone?

278
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:36,997
-No, but lately I've been
bringing a page with me

279
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,830
every time I go
out, just in case.

280
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:44,930
[train rumbles on tracks]

281
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,230
NAOMI (VOICEOVER):
That day Raye said

282
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:48,697
he was planning
to go to Shinjuku.

283
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:54,530
That same day four people
died of heart attacks

284
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:58,297
in the Shinjuku area, and
there was the bus-jacking.

285
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,630
There's no way it
was a coincidence.

286
00:13:02,664 --> 00:13:10,097
[slow footsteps]

287
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,364
NAOMI (VOICEOVER): That's it!

288
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:13,264
Kira can kill in other ways.

289
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:15,464
It doesn't have to
be a heart attack.

290
00:13:15,497 --> 00:13:17,364
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE):
The mobile customer

291
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,197
you are trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

292
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,164
-That's unusual for Dad.

293
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:22,497
[beep]

294
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,964
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I wonder if
he's in a meeting right now.

295
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:30,697
NAOMI: Please, I need to
speak directly with someone

296
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,664
from the special
investigation task force.

297
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:33,730
It's urgent.

298
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:35,530
-I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I can't help you.

299
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,330
As I've told you
already, there is no one

300
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:38,997
at task force
headquarters right now.

301
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,197
-[sighs]

302
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,897
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): There's
no one at headquarters?

303
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,864
Dad's cell is turned off.

304
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:45,464
What's going on?

305
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:47,664
-Can't you contact them somehow?

306
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:49,864
I have information relating
to the Kira investigation.

307
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,630
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): The
Kira investigation?

308
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:57,630
-Look, I'll call headquarters
one more time for you.

309
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:58,930
One moment.

310
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,297
-Hi, I'm Detective Soichiro
Yagami's son, Light Yagami.

311
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,964
I brought my father
a change of clothes,

312
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,397
but it doesn't
look like he's in.

313
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,630
Can I leave them here?

314
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:07,730
-Sure.

315
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,130
Hey, I haven't seen
you in a while, Light.

316
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:11,230
-Oh, I'm sorry, uh--

317
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,564
-What, you don't remember?

318
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:15,030
You helped solve the insurance
fraud murder investigation

319
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,297
sometime last year.

320
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,530
But hey, no one remembers
the receptionist, do they?

321
00:14:18,564 --> 00:14:19,930
-Oh, I'm sorry.

322
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:21,597
I'm terrible with faces.

323
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,930
I just need to sign my
name on this form, right?

324
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,330
-So, Light, does
this mean you're

325
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,897
going to be helping us with
the Kira investigation, too?

326
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,130
-Sure.

327
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:31,364
If all goes well, maybe I'll
find Kira before L does.

328
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:33,730
NAOMI (VOICEOVER):
Find him before L does?

329
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:36,097
-As I thought, there's
no one at headquarters.

330
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,597
You're going to have to
trust me on this, ma'am.

331
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,130
I'll be sure to give them your
message as soon as I see them.

332
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:40,830
I promise.

333
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:41,797
-That's not good enough.

334
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,230
I have to tell them in person.

335
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:44,730
LIGHT: Excuse me.

336
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:48,097
My father is actually in charge
of the Kira investigation.

337
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,430
If you'd like, I could pass
your message on to him.

338
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:51,930
His cell phone is
off at the moment,

339
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:54,797
but I should be able
to contact him soon.

340
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,164
A number of FBI agents were just
killed, and a lot of detectives

341
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,930
have quit the case because
they're afraid of Kira.

342
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:02,797
So he's pretty busy right now.

343
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,597
-Uh, Light, it's probably
better if you don't discuss this

344
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,964
with--

345
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:09,430
-True, but it's practically
common knowledge at this point.

346
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:11,630
Besides, I feel like
I can trust her.

347
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:13,830
You can almost see
it in her eyes.

348
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:16,530
She's a wise and careful person.

349
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:19,364
You heard about what happened
and you must have figured out

350
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:21,964
that the police had
a leak of some kind,

351
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:24,497
and that's why you wanted
to tell them in person.

352
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,064
You've thought this through.

353
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:27,230
Well, am I right?

354
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,997
I'm sure my father
will be calling me back

355
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,464
once he checks his messages.

356
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:38,297
When he does, I'll give you the
phone and let you talk to him.

357
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,930
-You're sure that's all right?

358
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:41,330
-Oh, yeah.

359
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:43,764
You understand why I can't just
give you my father's cell phone

360
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:44,730
number.

361
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:45,697
But I have no
problem letting you

362
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,264
use my phone to talk to him.

363
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:49,897
You'll have to trust my father
and I, which I hope won't

364
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,030
be too difficult
for you. [laughs]

365
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:54,564
RYUK (VOICEOVER):
Why is he so happy?

366
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:58,530
-Thank you so much.

367
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:02,430
--[cackles] She walked right
into that one, didn't she?

368
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,297
LIGHT: I've got to
say, you must be

369
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,697
pretty brave to be getting
involved in the Kira case

370
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,964
like this.

371
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,197
-Hmph, not really.

372
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,964
-So according to you, is
Kira some-- [clears throat].

373
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:18,597
Um, we've been
talking and I just

374
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,397
realized I don't
even know your name.

375
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,130
My name is Light Yagami.

376
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:23,964
Light's written with
the character for moon,

377
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:26,664
and Yagami with the
characters for night and god.

378
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:28,464
Kind of weird, huh?

379
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:29,930
-My name's Shoko Maki.

380
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:31,797
It's written with the
characters for shining,

381
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,930
"ko" as in "child," "space,"
and "ki" as in "tree."

382
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:35,997
-Miss Maki, right?

383
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,297
-[cackles]

384
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,130
LIGHT: Miss Maki, I've been
thinking about Kira's powers,

385
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:44,530
and I believe they enable
him to somehow control

386
00:16:44,564 --> 00:16:46,430
his victims before they die.

387
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,630
-So do I!

388
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:49,530
It's odd that you say
that, because that's

389
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:51,364
exactly what I've been thinking.

390
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:54,230
Kira's able to control their
actions before he kills them,

391
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,564
but there's more to it.

392
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,897
If my analysis so
far is correct,

393
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,697
Kira can kill in
a number of ways,

394
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,564
not just with a heart attack.

395
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:03,964
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): She knows?

396
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:06,397
Who is this woman?

397
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,130
-I don't think anyone
else knows this yet,

398
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:11,130
but if the police are
willing to consider it

399
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,197
I bet it would help
them catch Kira.

400
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,764
-You know, that possibility
never even crossed my mind.

401
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:18,964
So what you're saying
is any time Kira wants

402
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,597
one of his murders
to go undetected,

403
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,597
he wouldn't use a heart attack.

404
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,930
-Right.

405
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:27,097
I'm almost positive that someone
I know may have met Kira.

406
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,630
-Met Kira?

407
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:32,364
[laughs] I'm sorry, but if a
person came in saying they'd

408
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:34,364
met Kira, the police
would be more than a

409
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:36,364
little skeptical,
to say the least.

410
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:37,730
-I know.

411
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:39,930
That's why I need to explain
it in person to someone

412
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:41,664
from task force headquarters.

413
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:43,797
Otherwise I'm afraid
they'll just write me off.

414
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,464
-But wouldn't it be
better if your friend

415
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,597
spoke to them instead?

416
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,464
-It probably would, but
he's no longer alive.

417
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:52,764
He was one of the
12 FBI agents who

418
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:56,397
came to Japan to
investigate Kira.

419
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,897
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): An
FBI agent who met Kira?

420
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,297
Could it be?

421
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,464
NAOMI: You see, he
was also my fiance.

422
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,964
While he was working he got
caught up in a bus-jacking,

423
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:11,530
and I have reason to believe
that he met Kira on that bus.

424
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:12,830
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Raye Penber.

425
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:20,930
-Is something wrong?

426
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:22,030
-Nothing.

427
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,897
I'm sorry to hear
that he passed away.

428
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,197
So what makes you think
he met Kira on that bus?

429
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,664
-Because eight days after
that bus was hijacked,

430
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,830
he died along with the
other FBI investigators.

431
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:40,930
The same man had attempted to
rob a bank two days before he

432
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:45,264
hijacked that bus, then he dies
in an accident, just like that?

433
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:47,264
I mean, really,
what are the odds?

434
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:52,697
I've come to believe that
Kira set up that bus-jacking.

435
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,664
It was planned to bring him
into contact with my fiance

436
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:57,397
in order to obtain
information regarding

437
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,130
the identities of
the other FBI agents

438
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:01,297
so he could get rid of them all.

439
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,730
Anyway, what stands out to
me is that the hijacker died

440
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:05,130
in an accident.

441
00:19:05,164 --> 00:19:07,930
In other words, it
suggests that heart attacks

442
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:09,664
aren't the only way
Kira can kill people.

443
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,897
-OK, so the bus-jacker
didn't die of a heart attack.

444
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,997
And based on that,
you're saying Kira

445
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,330
has other ways of
killing people?

446
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:30,497
-Yes.

447
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,164
-Don't take this
the wrong way, but I

448
00:19:32,197 --> 00:19:34,897
think that's a bit
of a leap of faith.

449
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,530
-There's no other
way of looking at it.

450
00:19:36,564 --> 00:19:38,364
If Kira was controlling
the hijacker,

451
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:41,264
chances are he killed him too.

452
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:42,364
-I still don't see it.

453
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,030
-I've been wondering
about that bus-jacking

454
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:46,730
ever since my fiance
first told me about it.

455
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:50,397
After he calmed down, I
asked him for details.

456
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,464
He didn't mention any names
or anything like that,

457
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:53,964
but he told me one thing.

458
00:19:53,997 --> 00:19:55,497
LIGHT: What did he say?

459
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,230
-That he'd been put
in a situation where

460
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,330
he had to show his
FBI ID to someone.

461
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:04,630
-Hm.

462
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:06,630
-The operation was
undertaken secretly

463
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,164
without the NPA's knowledge.

464
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:10,564
He wasn't allowed
to show his ID.

465
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:13,230
I think whoever
saw his ID that day

466
00:20:13,264 --> 00:20:16,764
is responsible for the
deaths of all the agents.

467
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:18,297
RYUK (VOICEOVER): Unbelievable.

468
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,230
She figured it out.

469
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:23,230
This must be the oversight
Light was worried about.

470
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,330
-I understand.

471
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:26,197
You're the only one
who knows any of this

472
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,464
and you want nothing more
than to avenge your fiance

473
00:20:28,497 --> 00:20:30,430
by bringing Kira
to justice, right?

474
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:31,864
And now you're
convinced that Kira

475
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,997
can kill without
using a heart attack.

476
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,630
-Yes.

477
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:37,064
LIGHT: There's no
doubt in my mind

478
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:38,697
your deductive
skills are excellent,

479
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,930
but you can't deny that you
have a personal interest

480
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,330
in the case.

481
00:20:42,364 --> 00:20:46,464
Still, , your theory is worth
looking into, that's for sure.

482
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:49,097
Your testimony could
be central to the case.

483
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,630
-It could.

484
00:20:50,664 --> 00:20:52,530
-If what you're
telling me is true,

485
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:54,164
then it'll only be
a matter of time

486
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:56,330
before the police
catch up with Kira.

487
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:59,597
The person your fiance
showed his ID to on the bus

488
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,097
that day-- it had to be Kira.

489
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,064
-That's right.

490
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:13,497
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
That was close.

491
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,464
This woman, if she'd
spoken to the police

492
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:20,397
before I met her--
but it seems there's

493
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,464
a god on my side after all,
and not just a god of death.

494
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:33,864
[slow footsteps]

495
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:40,897
[music - nightmare, "alumina"]

496
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:57,978
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I have to admit

497
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:00,178
I'd really love to
see how she dies,

498
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:03,245
but I can't be caught
following her around.

499
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:04,711
Go on.

500
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:07,211
Hurry to your death.
