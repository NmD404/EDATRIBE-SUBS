We have a new student that
will be joining our class today.

11
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:08,323
What do you want?

12
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:11,280
You're lucky Shoya. I heard it's a girl.

13
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,750
So what?

14
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:14,455

15

you like to introduce yourself?

Yoho! Hey there new girl, do
you know how to speak Japanese?

Huh?

42
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,904
Do - you - have - a - nickname?

43
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,430
How do you like that?

44
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,378
Come on! Take it.

45
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:07,484
What? Your nickname is Sho-?

46
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,513
Oh! Just like Shoya.

47
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,730
Hey! We have another "Sho" now.

48
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,440
Two "Shos" is pretty cool.

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,284
What? No it's not.

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,386
I'm gonna pants you!

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,902
Alright. Make sure to write this down.

52
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,281
The exercises on page 20 to pege 25, and page 32.

53
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:30,476
All of this will be on your next quiz.

54
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,789
Give me your notebook, ok?

55
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,481
Look at the diagram. At the center is the fulcrum.

56
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:43,260
The fulcrum is both the point
of rest and support for the lever.

57
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,639
It's the crux of any motion.

58
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,980
The placement of the fulcrum determines
how far the levered object will move.

59
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,940
For these...

60
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,380
Not yet Shoko,

61
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,136
y-you're coming in too early.

62
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:20,331
Watch me okay? Don't start singing till I start.

63
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:24,768
Okay, from the top.

64
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:31,499
Guess we want to be winning at choir contest...

65
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,220
You could say that again.

66
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,320
This is for acts like a moron!

67
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,166
Okay, go easy on me.

68
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,850
Alright, I surrender!

69
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,334
I'm so sick of this.

70
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:44,326
He talks so fast. I can't write everything down.

71
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,745
Well I can give you my notes if you want.

72
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,199
You're a lifesaver.

73
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:54,994
"But I didn't do anything wrong.
So I will never say, I'm sorry."

74
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:58,059
Why are you reading so slow. You sounds like you're five.

75
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:01,461
Fine. Enough of that. Who is next!

76
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,448
Four eyes...

77
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:03,554
Shoko.

78
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,710
Start reading from here.

79
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,660
There was an awkward silence.

80
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,742
His mother would have made him read it.

81
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:22,348
She should be home but you need to stop being so
stubborn all the time. He had no intention of apologizing.

82
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,974
That's good. Shoya, you are next.

83
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:27,711
You gotta be kidding me.

84
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:36,009
...

85
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,527
That isn't funny. Sit down, Shoya.

86
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,494
Okay!

87
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,997
Can you believe it?

88
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:47,290
Ha ha ha...

89
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:50,117
<i>"Please let me know what you are talking about."</i>

90
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,630
Emmm.....

91
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:52,996
No thanks.

92
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,990
Yeah, let's go.

93
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,250
Oh we're leaving, Shoko.

94
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,600
You konw something?

95
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,888
We're all sick of you with your notebook.
It's getting pretty old, pretty fast.

96
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,215
What do you want?

97
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,029
Frie-nds...

98
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,246
What?

99
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,083
You're such a freak.

100
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,236
Good morning everyone. I'm Ms. Keita of the DHH Liaison.

101
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,624
Do you all know what sign language is?

102
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,627
Okay, it's kind of like using your
hands to talk, instead if your voice.

103
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:39,866
Isn't that neat?

104
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,574
All right. Since we want to make
it easier to communicate with Shoko.

105
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:49,993
Every single morning we're going to spend
three minutes of class learning to sign.

106
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,220
Miss Keita.

107
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,154
Yes?

108
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,589
Why can't we just write in her notebook.

109
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,275
It would be easier for Shoko if everyone
just learned a little sign language.

110
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:08,131
Well, it would be easier for me
if I could just write stuff down.

111
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:14,263
Excuse me. I'll do it. I can learn how to sign.

112
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,220
<i>"Teach me sign language for Sahara Miyoko"</i>

Goody two-shoes loser.

00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,161
He is so cool.

118
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,324
Oh my gosh he's mine too.

119
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,186
Hey! He'll be on the next week.

120
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:39,821
Let's watch it together.

121
00:11:40,437 --> 00:11:42,499
Gross! She get dressed in the dark?

122
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,325
So based on the author's previous, we're
looking at the results of the experiment...

123
00:11:56,918 --> 00:11:58,713
Keisuke, you darw over there.

124
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:02,240
Sho-ko is...

125
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,593
What do you think you're doing?

126
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,420
You really shouldn't do that.

127
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,730
... Star.

128
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,852
Don't you think you're going a bit too far?

129
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,531
Nope. But I can go even further

130
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,790
You can be such a jerk.

131
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,500
Come on. I'm not that bad.

132
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,054
Check out my masterpiece.

135
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,460
Some people

136
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,438
here I'll just erase it for you.

137
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:39,853
So you don't have to see it.

138
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:41,556
There.

139
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:43,920
No need to thank me.

140
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,390
<i>"Thank you."</i>

141
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,474
I said no need to thank.

142
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,796
Let's go guys.

143
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,259
During the Jomon period...

144
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:12,625
Waw!

145
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,759
Cut it out, Shoya.

146
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:21,100
Would you rather have detention?

147
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,795
No, sir. Sorry.

148
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,761
Okay. Where did I leave off?

149
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:30,960
Right. The typical German house
was a pit dwelling with a central...

150
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:33,261
That was startling wasn't it!

151
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,340
Hey! Hey, Shoko.

152
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:43,800
What do we have here? Does
that mean you can actually hear?

153
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:46,320
You know what? I was wondering the same thing.

154
00:13:46,353 --> 00:13:47,690
Can I see it for a second?

155
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,598
Naoka!

156
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:54,928
What are those things? Toss it over.

157
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,260
Is that your earwax? That is so gross.

158
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,454
Ouch!

159
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:25,546
Shoko, are you OK?

160
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:29,333
Oh no, she's bleeding.

161
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,060
What will we do?

162
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:33,430
You went too far, man.

163
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,350
Mr. Four eyes is such an asshole.

164
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:45,460
Oh great. Now what. You're in our way.

165
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:47,966
What is she even doing?

166
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,540
Get lost.

167
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,501
<i>"I'm sorry."</i>

168
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:54,484
Sorry!?

169
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:56,492
You're not sorry, you're just pathetic.

170
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,471
Hey!

171
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:02,573
What are you doing!? Stop touching me.

172
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,840
Check it out, I think she wants to hold your hand.

173
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,900
You like it. You're blushing.

174
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,971
No, I'm not!

175
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,764
Come on. Let's go.

176
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,469
Huh?

177
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,880
Oh my god. Talk about crazy.

178
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:35,115
The water is gross.

179
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:46,050
See you tomorrow, Shoya. Later.

180
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:04,623
Listen up everyone. There's something very
important that I'd like to talk to you about.

181
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:08,340
As you can see, Shoko Nishimiya is absent today.

182
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:13,634
Yesterday the school received a
telephone call from Shoko's mother.

183
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:19,206
In the past five months, eight of Shoko's
hearing aids have been broken or gone missing.

184
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:21,887
Hearing aids are very expensive.

185
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,229
Her mother believes Shoko is being bullied.

186
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:30,940
If any of you have seen Shokobeing harassed,

187
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:36,669
or abused at school, I need you to come
forward and tell us who has been doing it.

188
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,745
If no one comes forward, I'd hate to
have to bring your parents into this.

189
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:51,442
This is a very serious matter and
the school does not take bullying...

190
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,550
Shoya!

191
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,379
Stand up. We all know that it's you.

192
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,938
I told you to stand up.

193
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:01,713
Yes sir.

194
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,880
Now then, Naoka.

195
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,400
You sit right next to him. What have you seen.

196
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,009
Well... ah...

197
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:11,308
It's kind of true. He does tease her a little

198
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:12,691
like he makes fun of her.

199
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:13,146
What?

200
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:14,745
And Kazuki?

201
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,648
He act totally.

202
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:18,688
I kept telling him to knock it off,

203
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:21,285
but Shoya won't listen to anyone.

204
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,313
What!?

205
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,826
Wait!

206
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,587
That's not fair. You were making fun of her too Kazuki.

207
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,513
And it's not just the boys the girls were doing it too.

208
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,077
I swear it's true.

209
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:36,103
Especially Naoka and Miki.

210
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:38,680
That's mean...

211
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:41,943
I would never do anything like that.

212
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,500
How could you... How could
you say something like that.

213
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:05,703
What?

214
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:20,987
Yes. I see.

215
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:24,680
I am very sorry for any trouble he caused.

216
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:26,947
Yes. Of course.

217
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:29,261
Thank you. Goodbye.

218
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:32,988
Shoya!

219
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,401
Come back here. I'm talking to you.

220
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,214
Shoya.

221
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:39,980
I just got off the phone with the school.

222
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:41,719
Wait a minute!

223
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,616
Why are you so wet?

224
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,760
Leave me alone. I jumped in the river like always.

225
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,717
Freeze Mr.

226
00:18:48,146 --> 00:18:50,026
Have you been causing trouble at school?

227
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:51,425
I wouldn't know.

228
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,217
Then why did I get a call from
your teacher this afternoon.

229
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,501
Okay, fine! It's true.

230
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,067
Get cleaned up. We're going
over to Shoko's place right now.

231
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,513
Come on Sho. Let's go home.

232
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,040
You're gonna try to be nicer from now on. Okay?

233
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:21,529
Huh?

234
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:26,386
All of these so-called great men
were going through their own struggles.

235
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,807
Huh?

236
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:50,329
Hey.

237
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:52,615
What is heck she doing?

238
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,823
Hey, what are you doing at my desk?

239
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:04,687
Don't you dare touch my stuff, you freak.

240
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:11,692
There's that, look again.

241
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,171
Don't try to act like you're some innocent.

242
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,919
What is it.

243
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,447
If you want to say something, spit it out.

244
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,120
You've done is just stand there with that stupid.
Look on your face, don't you ever get mad?

245
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:27,961
Well! Then do something!

246
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:29,166
Ouch!

247
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,540
What the hell is wrong with you?

248
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,280
I can't believe you beg me.

249
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,520
What are you even saying!

250
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,660
Get off!

251
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,974
I cannot even understand you!

252
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,080
<i>"Disappear"</i>

253
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,358
I hate her.

254
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,165
She is so weird...

255
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:35,731
Shoko Nishimiya has transferred to another school.

256
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,126
Moving on.

257
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,560
Now, who was in charge of the class journal yesterday?

258
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,228
Whoever it was forgot to hand it in.

259
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,151
Well, everyone just checked
their bags to see if they have it.

260
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,493
<i>"Sign Language Study Club"</i>

261
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,293
Oh, look it's Shoko. How are you doing.

262
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:36,299
Shoko!

263
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,198
Hello. Do you remember me?

264
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,460
We were in elementary school together.

265
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,318
I'm Shoya Ishida.

266
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:02,027
Where are you going?

267
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:02,726
Wait!

268
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:09,417
Please, come back.

269
00:24:13,226 --> 00:24:14,352
Where did she go?

270
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:15,775
Hey!

271
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:21,015
H... Hey.

272
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:27,439
So I...

273
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,836
I came here to give you this.

274
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,504
I....

275
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,446
You left this behind.

276
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,503
Oh, what's that? How do I know sign language?

277
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,932
From a class.

278
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,400
Here you go. It's yours.

279
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:56,436
I don't even know if you ever wanted to see this again.

280
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:03,006
I was wondering...

281
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,350
...can me and you...

282
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,203
Shoko,

283
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,860
can we be friends?

284
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:12,076
Is that an option...

285
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,550
Oh, what did I just say...

286
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,697
That's what you were trying to ask me back in school.

287
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,706
I finally understand you.

288
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:22,861
Oh...

289
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,361
Don't cry.

290
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:30,176
Please don't cry, Shoko.

291
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,324
I wanted to ask if we could
be friends. Would that be okay?

292
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,500
Sho-Sho,

293
00:25:47,736 --> 00:25:53,072
Sho-Sho, wake up!

294
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:55,682
Time for breakfast!

295
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:02,793
Okay Sho, up and at'em!

296
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:06,856
Good morning, Maria.

297
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:09,556
Sho-Sho is wake!

298
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:28,785
I'm heading out.

299
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:30,839
Bye bye, Mom!

300
00:26:30,864 --> 00:26:32,031
Have a good day dear.

301
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,064
Here, Sbreakfast is served.

302
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,643
Thank you for this meal.

303
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:39,747
Dig in big guy!

304
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:48,558
What's got you so bright and cheery this morning?

305
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:51,260
Because...

306
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,630
I found this!

307
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,490
Oh.

308
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,000
You've been working so hard at your job,

309
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,441
and you even sold your comics, colthes and futon.

310
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:04,958
I am so lucky to have such a thoughtful son...

311
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,807
But tell me Shoya...

312
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,360
Why would you want to kill yourself?

313
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,740
I just...

314
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,973
don't do a lot of crazy stuff lately.

315
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,506
What can I say... I just...

316
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,850
I knew it...

317
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:27,782
I knew something was going on with you.

318
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:29,990
Do not even try to deny it.

319
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,310
Your room is clean for a change.
You cancelled your phone service.

320
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,693
And everything after April's
been torn up from your calendar.

321
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,485
I can't believe it. It's so morbid.

322
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,072
Promise me you won't go through
with it or I'm torching this.

323
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:48,183
The 1.7 million yen you earned will go to waste.

324
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,639
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

325
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:53,859
Huh!?

326
00:27:53,986 --> 00:27:56,306
Yeah, don't do anything crazy, mom...

327
00:27:56,345 --> 00:27:58,680
Crazy? You were gonna over yourself.

328
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,819
No! Wait!

329
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:01,080
I'am sorry mom.

330
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,120
I'm really sorry. I won't do it again

331
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
I swear I won't. Please don't burn it.

332
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,331
What are you not gonna do. Please specific.

333
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,539
I promise I'm not going to kill myself.

334
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,040
I swear I won't do it, please believe me.

335
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:13,920
Do you mean it?

336
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:15,437
I swear to you!

337
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:19,692
OK, then I won't burn this...

338
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,058
Mom! Watch out!

339
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,060
Fire!

340
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,740
Give me some water.

341
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,781
Smoky!

342
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,820
Yesterday I was planning to jump off
a really tall bridge and kill myself.

343
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,539
I only went to see Shoko
Nishimiya to wrap up any loose ends.

344
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,183
It was hands-down the greatest test of courage ever...

345
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,620
I was supposed to be anyway.

346
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:09,217
Can we be friends?

347
00:29:14,526 --> 00:29:16,136
World's biggest loser!

348
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,141
On the first day of junior high,
Kazuki makes sure everyone knew...

349
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,627
You should probably stay away from Shoya Ishida.

350
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,635
He's a bully. He's so bad.

351
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,728
A girl had to switch schools.

352
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,679
Like they always say, what goes around comes around.

353
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,634
I knew I really screwed up.

354
00:29:40,406 --> 00:29:42,646
And I needed to pay for being a jerk.

355
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:47,989
And so I pushed everyone away.

356
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,228
All right everyone.

357
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,696
Make sure to have this translated by next week's class.

358
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:42,500
Hey Shoya.

359
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,415
H-hi.

360
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,290
Miki...

361
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,042
Have you had a chance to hand in your math notebook yet?

362
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:49,782
Oh sorry, I forgot.

363
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,162
That's okay.

364
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,321
Just try to hand it in soon all right.

365
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:54,246
Sorry.

366
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:55,101
No problem.

367
00:30:58,782 --> 00:31:00,637
Wanna go sit in the courtyard?

368
00:31:02,258 --> 00:31:05,838
Shoya never hangs out with anyone, what a loser.

369
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,632
Didn't you hear about him?

370
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,160
Everyone knows...

371
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,140
No way dude!

372
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,993
Hey check it out he's looking at us again.

373
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:18,750
I wonder if he gets a lonely
being by himself all the time.

374
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:20,966
What a total freak!

375
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,186
Why does he bother living?

376
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,780
Oh hey!

377
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,624
I got their new album. You want to check it out?

378
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,690
Yeah...

379
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:34,242
Since you like them I don't anymore.

380
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,800
Yeah Me too.

381
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,322
Yeah, all right.

382
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:00,199
Huh?

383
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,630
I've seen that head before.

384
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:07,017
Who is he?

385
00:32:17,883 --> 00:32:19,223
It doesn't matter.

386
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,191
Should I go and see Shoko again?

387
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,272
She said she feeds the carp bread.

388
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,473
But I can't just show up there.
Not after everything I've done.

389
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:34,751
Should I go and apologize for making her cry.

390
00:32:35,573 --> 00:32:38,126
She did say she's there every Tuesday.

391
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,550
Will is it too creepy?

392
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,985
Hey mom, I'm home.

393
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:06,841
Hi! Sho.

394
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,407
Oh you scared the crap out of me.

395
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,568
What's up?

396
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:18,826
I... I'm sorry for burning all your hard-earned money.

397
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:20,572
I didn't mean to.

398
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,991
Then again you only earn that
money so he could kill yourself.

399
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:27,788
So I don't want it anyway.

400
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:32,300
Sorry mom. I'll earn it back.

401
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,790
I konw you will.

402
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:36,187
But I don't want you to worry too much about it.

403
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,610
In the meantime, how about
some dinner. Who's hungry.

404
00:33:39,662 --> 00:33:40,875
I am hungry!

405
00:33:50,615 --> 00:33:51,801
Tuesday.

406
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:59,370
Hey, let me borrow your bike.

407
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:00,785
Me?

408
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,795
What do you need my bicycle for?

409
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,120
That kid I saw at lunch.

410
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:08,200
I forgot something at home.
So I need your bike to get it.

411
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,720
But I don't even know you.

412
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,711
Why can't you just use your own bike.

413
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:15,816
I'm asking you because I don't have one.

414
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:18,700
No... please don't.

415
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,040
Give me that.

416
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,885
I have been robbed! Somebody help me!

417
00:34:24,568 --> 00:34:26,750
Anybody up there?

418
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,990
Why don't anyone help me?

419
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:30,216
Shut up!

420
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,280
God you're annoying,

421
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,320
just let go of the dam bike already!

422
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,428
Do you want to borrow mine? It's over there.

423
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:44,375
Yeah, thanks man. You are godsend.

424
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,568
Of course he stole it...

425
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,902
And today's Tuesday of all days.

426
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:58,283
So is that a sign that I should just leave her alone?

427
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,087
It's not like I can't just walk there,

428
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,627
but it's like I'm being told not to go.

429
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,299
I need a good reason.

430
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,888
Something real.

431
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,310
It doesn't look like I'm trying too hard.

432
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,071
Half off fluffy new bread.

433
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:25,831
This is it!

434
00:35:27,457 --> 00:35:29,320
Uh... Is Shoko Nishimiya here?

435
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,600
She's not here.

436
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:32,680
She's right there.

437
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:33,968
Not her.

438
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:38,129
There's nobody here named Shoko.

439
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,097
Who are you anyway.

440
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,112
I mean are you actually a friend of hers?

441
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:44,954
Thought so.

442
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,430
Nothing to worry about.

443
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,882
There was a rat in the hallway.

444
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,189
A really gross one.

445
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,397
Don't worry. He won't be back.

446
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,343
Can we be friends...

447
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,727
What...?

448
00:36:32,169 --> 00:36:33,959
Oh, found him! Hey! You!

449
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:35,579
Hey! You!

450
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,938
Over here! Look! Check it out!

451
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:40,860
I found your bike! This is yous, isn't it?

452
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:44,523
What a perfect timing!

453
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:47,312
It's a good thing you had your address on it.

454
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,521
That's great! But where did you find it?

455
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:54,016
That jerk dumped it in a rice field.

456
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:56,386
May it took me forever to find it.

457
00:36:56,737 --> 00:37:00,017
Thank goodness I did and I found you too.

458
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:08,464
Is something wrong?

459
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:09,498
What?

460
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,593
Nothing...

461
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,414
Tell me. What's your name anyway?

462
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:19,341
But...? We don't already know?
Tomohiro Nagatsuka. I sit behind you.

463
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,980
Right I knew that.

464
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:25,235
It's really good bread and do
you want to split it with me?

465
00:37:25,506 --> 00:37:26,319
Shoya!

466
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,025
Hey there! Shoya.

467
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:31,442
Good morning!

468
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:33,562
Ah... morning.

469
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:37,604
Hey, Shoya.

470
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,346
Do you want to hang out with me after school today?

471
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:42,226
I mean... since we are friends now.

472
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:46,055
Shoya over here! I saved you a seat.

473
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,724
What's troubling you, Ya-sho?

474
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:13,488
It's nothing.

475
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,676
Who's "Ya-sho"?

476
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,798
It's your nickname, shows that we're close.

477
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:17,881
Oh cool!

478
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:22,402
Well, so tell me what's troubling you?

479
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,737
You know you can tell me anything.
That's what best friends are for.

480
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:32,259
Hey, do you mind if I ask you something?

481
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:35,377
What does it mean to become someone's friend?

482
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:39,940
Like it. Is there some sort of
friendship process you go through,

483
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:43,037
or like do you need any specific qualifications?

484
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:45,932
Hey, Ya-sho.

485
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:51,066
Give me your hand, okay?

486
00:38:56,058 --> 00:38:56,865
Hey, hey.

487
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,728
Now you and I is friends.
It could be simple as that. See...

488
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:12,412
Friendship don't got to do with rules or qualifications.

489
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:14,227
Because it's about something deeper.

490
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,446
A bond and you just can't break that.

491
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,281
Capeesh?

492
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,379
She is not here.

493
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:25,053
She is right there.

494
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:25,885
She is not!

495
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,618
Oh, I see it. I think Maybe...

496
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,104
Shoko's my girlfriend, okay?

497
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,774
Oh... well... that sucks...

498
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,652
Oh... not for me personally
because I brought her all this bread.

499
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,786
But...

500
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,880
I didn't know shoko was into younger guys.

501
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:46,151
I mean nothing against you I
just I never would have guessed.

502
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,369
Can you at least give her
the bread? It's really good.

503
00:39:48,394 --> 00:39:53,811
Litsen! If you are just here to make
yourself feel better, you might as well leave.

504
00:39:57,576 --> 00:39:59,218
If you'll excuse me...

505
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:00,800
Goodbye.

506
00:40:02,115 --> 00:40:03,299
Listening boy!

507
00:40:03,423 --> 00:40:07,011
What's your problem? My friend here
just wants to see miss Shoko okay?

508
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:09,644
So stop being so stubborn. Go get her!

509
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:11,898
Seriously, what are you even doing here?

510
00:40:13,053 --> 00:40:13,920
I followed you.

511
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,784
Friends have each other's backs.

512
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:21,078
The shitty stalker has his own shitty
stalker. Makes you two a load of crap.

513
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:24,452
What? Oh yeah what was that?

514
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,571
What did you say...!

515
00:40:28,037 --> 00:40:29,789
I called you are abull shit...

516
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,585
That doesn't sound good.
What's going on out there?

517
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,583
That's sounds like Yuzuru.

518
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,316
Oh, no. They are fighting.

519
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,115
Would you please clam down.

520
00:40:40,347 --> 00:40:43,880
Seriously man, don't worry about it. Let us get out here.

521
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:48,319
Oh hello? Aren't you the nice boy from the other day?

522
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:52,371
It wasn't me. It must been some one else...

523
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:54,362
Sorry buddy, you are on your own!

524
00:40:58,606 --> 00:40:59,931
Hey! They're gone!

525
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:03,006
Great he got to see her after all.

526
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:07,180
What are you doing?

527
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,271
You are spying on Shoko and Ya-sho?

528
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,270
Hand it over! I want to see.

529
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,590
Ya-sho sure does talk with his hands a lot.

530
00:41:16,617 --> 00:41:18,535
It's called sign language, dumbass.

531
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,628
What? Oh wow!

532
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:23,562
I'm telling you my man's got real skills.

533
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:25,664
Do you understand sign?

534
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,256
Tell me what they're saying.

535
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:31,451
Who was that loser you were with?

536
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,714
I have never seen him before in my life.

537
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:37,843
He was disgusting!

538
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,660
Shut up! Liar!

539
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,897
Right. Fine!

540
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:45,978
Don't fall over! Be careful!

541
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,293
The truth is

542
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,318
I wasn't sure if it was okay to come see you.

543
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,033
For the past two weeks,

544
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:59,923
I have been wondering whether you
and I could be considered friends.

545
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,417
In order to see you, I felt like I needed a good reason

546
00:42:07,426 --> 00:42:09,962
And finally, I found one.

547
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:13,586
Wow. What a great guy...

548
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,324
I'm glad you did.

549
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:18,713
I was thinking...

550
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:21,056
the exact same thing.

551
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:23,189
It's funny, isn't it.

552
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,777
So...

553
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:29,707
Anyway uh, I brought you some bread to feed the fish.

554
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,064
Do you enjoy feeding the fish?

555
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,066
She can't hear me.

556
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,170
Huh?

557
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:04,241
I think about it you really don't want to read that stuff.

558
00:43:16,515 --> 00:43:18,355
Wait! What are you doing!

559
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:22,575
Oh! She falls in!

560
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,168
No way! What happened? Is Ya-sh okay?

561
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:25,930
Hey!

562
00:43:25,968 --> 00:43:27,203
Hey, talk to me boy!

563
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:29,855
Oh! He went to the river!

564
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,678
Why!?

565
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,471
Ouch!

566
00:43:32,064 --> 00:43:33,544
Why did you do that for!

567
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,804
What is that? Oh!

568
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,649
Over here Shoko.

569
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,938
Shoko!

570
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,117
I'm really sorry that I drop that.

571
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,355
I don't believe it. What a dummy...

572
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:46,673
Ha ha...

573
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,058
So long stalker!

574
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,418
Have you seen this?

575
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,811
Seriously? Is that really Shoya?

576
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:57,566
See you latter.

577
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:00,502
So it's okay?

578
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,083
Hey Shoya.

579
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:07,529
We've all been wondering.

580
00:45:08,325 --> 00:45:09,320
It's that you?

581
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:11,921
Oh, where'd you get that?

582
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,038
Mr. Ishida, report to the faculty office immediately.

583
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,755
<i>"Notice of short-term suspension
from school - Shoya Ishida"</i>

584
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:30,631
I jumped into the river from the Suimonbashi
bridge even though I know it's prohibited...

585
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,128
and I posted a picture on ...

586
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:32,888
Shoya.

587
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,023
Yeah?

588
00:45:34,516 --> 00:45:37,920
Sorry to ask, but do you think
you could pick up Maria for me?

589
00:45:38,326 --> 00:45:41,150
I'm not supposed to leave the
house while I'm still suspended.

590
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,360
Oh come on! It'll only take
a second. You're life saving.

591
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:47,220
Wait!! Oh... really?

592
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,521
Okay, Maria, it's time to go home now.

593
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:07,090
Sho-Sho!

594
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:09,178
Somebody is in there!

595
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:14,100
Wait.

596
00:46:15,503 --> 00:46:16,544
Hey you!

597
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,330
Wake up! Are you okay?

598
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:24,571
Aren't you Shoko Nishimiya's boyfriend?

599
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,831
You're gonna catch a cold like this.

600
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,421
If it isn't the stalker?

601
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,121
What are you doing? How'd you end up sleeping here?

602
00:46:37,592 --> 00:46:38,767
Where are your shoes?

603
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,627
Aren't you mad at me?

604
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:44,694
About what?

605
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,863
I'm the one who posted the photo of you online.

606
00:46:50,425 --> 00:46:52,260
Oh, so that was you.

607
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:55,163
Huh!

608
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,050
Thank goodness what a relief, seriously.

609
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,485
For reals?

610
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:03,573
At least I have a pretty good idea of why you did it.

611
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,738
You're not angry?

612
00:47:07,305 --> 00:47:08,538
Why should I be?

613
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,717
I mean I kind of brought this on myself.

614
00:47:12,033 --> 00:47:12,903
Sho-Sho!

615
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,738
I am hungry!

616
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,867
OK!

617
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,695
Looks like I gotta take off.

618
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,828
You should probably be heading home too.

619
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,570
Crazy. I can't believe you've got a kid.

620
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,102
Ouch!

621
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,017
Ah, she's my sister's.

622
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:38,364
Hey!

623
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,960
Here you go, Yuzuru,

624
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,674
Eat it as much as you want, okay?

625
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,870
What is sis go?

626
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,947
She said she'd be back late.

627
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,258
Well, Maria do you like it?

628
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:53,430
I like it!

629
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:54,349
Great!

630
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:56,669
What's wrong, Yuzuru? Not hungry?

631
00:47:57,353 --> 00:47:58,815
Oh! I know!.

632
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,540
Open wide!

633
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,482
Crap!

634
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:57,297
What are you doing out here?

635
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,115
I woke up and you were gone.

636
00:49:01,616 --> 00:49:03,089
Here, take it.

637
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,710
O--oh!

638
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,588
Stop it. What are you doing?

639
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,168
Just take it, okay.

640
00:49:09,707 --> 00:49:10,677
Thank you.

641
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:12,693
Hang on are you not...?

642
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:13,983
Hey!

643
00:49:14,036 --> 00:49:15,196
Just as I thought.

644
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,770
Wanna you wear these?

645
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,862
They actually used to be mine.

646
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:22,623
Don't fit anymore. You can keep them.

647
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:27,702
So uh... why'd you run away from home?

648
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:31,680
I got into a fight with Shoko.

649
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,960
Oh... wow...

650
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,540
It's true what they say...

651
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,809
relationships can get messy sometimes, right?

652
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,160
Yes.

653
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,068
Because I used Shoko's shampoo without her permission.

654
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,001
Eh?

655
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,020
And she told me she doesn't need me anymore.

656
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,223
Wait, are the two of you living together!?

657
00:49:55,131 --> 00:49:57,537
Stop it, you're just getting away.

658
00:49:57,624 --> 00:49:59,910
What's the point of bringing an umbrella man.

659
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,680
Right, but I'm the idiot who
didn't think to bring two of them.

660
00:50:03,777 --> 00:50:07,567
Besides I'll feel bad for Shoko
if you come back with the cold.

661
00:50:10,326 --> 00:50:11,437
Seriously...

662
00:50:11,677 --> 00:50:14,928
Just who do you think you are?
You see through your act.

663
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,060
What are we? A couple of strays?

664
00:50:18,163 --> 00:50:20,673
You doing this to feel better about yourself...

665
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:24,039
Must be extra amusing to you because she's deaf, right?

666
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,655
Yeah, you even went to the trouble to learn how to sign.

667
00:50:29,023 --> 00:50:32,622
Big deal, you think that suddenly
makes you a hero or something?

668
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,324
I still can't stand you.

669
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:39,585
I see.

670
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,175
I guess Shoko told you all about me huh.

671
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,665
Well, you're right.

672
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,288
I am a horrible person. The world would
probably be better off if I wasn't around.

673
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:54,682
But still...

674
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,337
I just don't want to cause Shoko any more pain.

675
00:50:59,883 --> 00:51:03,895
Oh but uh that doesn't mean I'm
gonna try and horn in on your turf.

676
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,499
You don't have to worry about that.

677
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,734
That said... it's true,

678
00:51:09,073 --> 00:51:11,075
I guess I am being a bit selfish.

679
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:28,202
This is far enough.

680
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:28,842
Okay.

681
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,194
By the way...

682
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:36,760
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this earlier but

683
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:39,192
Ah... I'm actually Shoko's...

684
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:41,423
Know what I mean?

685
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,243
Ehh!

686
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,596
Younger sister!?

687
00:51:50,742 --> 00:51:51,476
Later!

688
00:52:00,812 --> 00:52:03,640
I remember you. You are Shoko's mother....

689
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,224
Let's go.

690
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:13,171
Oh, that hurts!

691
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:16,097
I'm sorry for what I did...

692
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,037
I'm back.

693
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,010
Yuzuru!

694
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,110
Don't hug me...

695
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,176
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

696
00:52:27,443 --> 00:52:29,094
I want to apologize too.

697
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,570
Granny, is there any Shiso
juice left? I'd like some.

698
00:52:34,147 --> 00:52:34,857
Yuzuru.

699
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:39,578
I don't want you hanging around
that boy. Tell your sister that too.

700
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,169
I can decide who to hang out with on my own.

701
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,589
Same with Shoko.

702
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,210
Oh! The prodigal son returns.

703
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,640
How are you doing this fun day? You come back for...

704
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,404
I just returning the umbrella I borrowed.

705
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,719
That's surprising.

706
00:52:57,886 --> 00:52:59,866
So our young lad has some manners after all.

707
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,951
Nagatsuka, that lad actually is a lass...

708
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:05,183
That's Shoko's little sister.

709
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:07,927
I knew that the entire time.

710
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:16,267
I wanted to thank you for
looking out for my homeboy Ya-sho.

711
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,122
This is my friend,

712
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,542
Na-ga-tsu-ka.

713
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,848
Oh... oh yeah,

714
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:28,768
I got a new cell phone.

715
00:53:29,563 --> 00:53:32,351
I'm guessing you have that cell phone too, don't you?

716
00:53:34,056 --> 00:53:36,626
So yeah... do you ever text?

717
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,374
Like with your friends um...

718
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,084
from your new school?

719
00:53:40,335 --> 00:53:41,585
Ah that's great.

720
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:44,912
So uh anyone you want to meet?

721
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,712
I mean do you need anyone's phone number?

722
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:51,328
Oh good maybe you'd like to have mine?

723
00:53:52,283 --> 00:53:53,003
What's that?

724
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:56,584
Sa... Ha... Ra.

725
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:02,747
Miyoko from elementary school?

726
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,827
Hey! Ya-sho!

727
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,302
Well?

728
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,237
So how are you gonna track down the Miyoko chick.

729
00:54:16,245 --> 00:54:18,733
Oh no, that's not exactly true.

730
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:21,524
But you get straight 'A's, don't you?

731
00:54:23,107 --> 00:54:25,367
Oh yeah... that's it.

732
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:27,647
Ya-sho?

733
00:54:27,672 --> 00:54:29,790
But Satoshi I didn't even...

734
00:54:29,863 --> 00:54:30,360
Miki...?

735
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,385
Um what's up?

736
00:54:34,006 --> 00:54:35,806
There's something I wanted to ask you.

737
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:39,007
Do you know how to get in touch with Miyoko Sahara?

738
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:41,733
She went to the same elementary school with us.

739
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:42,600
Miyoko?

740
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:45,661
Sorry, I have no idea.

741
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,090
But bet the school will have some kind of record.

742
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,287
I think Naoka goes to the same school with her.

743
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:53,068
Taiyo Girl's Academy...

744
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,865
Crap, I'm flat broke.

745
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,404
Ya-sho, my man.

746
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:58,717
I've got your back bro.

747
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:01,717
Wow, where'd that come from.
I don't really need that much.

748
00:55:01,742 --> 00:55:07,385
Come on! Let me sponsor you. There are travel and
meal is expensive and those love motels ain't cheap...

749
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:09,605
You'll be glad for the extra dough. Trust me.

750
00:55:09,718 --> 00:55:11,547
Guys over here.

751
00:55:11,733 --> 00:55:13,251
Looks like we just made it.

752
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:20,000
My sister was kind of annoyed that she was being
left out, since she was the one who suggested it.

753
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,499
So would you mind if she tagged along with you.

754
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,252
<i>"Are you tired?
Thank you for today."</i>

755
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:59,500
<i>"I was happy to hear that you are
trying to look for Sahara-san for me."</i>

756
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,701
<i>"I heard a lot about you from Yuzuru."</i>

757
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:07,278
<i>"I'm very happy to be with you today!"</i>

758
00:56:23,806 --> 00:56:28,059
So if we start walking from here...

759
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,214
Sho? Sho!

760
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,340
Sorry about that.

761
00:56:34,096 --> 00:56:35,335
Is that you?

762
00:56:36,183 --> 00:56:40,367
It is me. Miyoko. From school.

763
00:56:41,895 --> 00:56:42,708
Hi!

764
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:45,292
Hey, wait. Is that Shoya?

765
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:47,900
Heh heh heh.

766
00:56:48,192 --> 00:56:51,082
It's been a long time hasn't it huh.

767
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:59,205
And since then, I've been learning sign, or trying.

768
00:56:59,678 --> 00:57:00,712
Was that right?

769
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,595
I know I just kind of disappeared on you back then.

770
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,098
Sorry about that.

771
00:57:08,646 --> 00:57:11,353
But I never stopped thinking about you ever.

772
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,645
Seeing you makes me happy.

773
00:57:16,003 --> 00:57:17,553
I was so surprised.

774
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:23,625
Uh huh...

775
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,048
Really?

776
00:57:29,151 --> 00:57:33,391
So where are you going to school now, Shoko?

777
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,356
Well... well your chest has gotten bigger.

778
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,320
What's the size you are?

779
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,800
Want me to check?

780
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:47,640
What's the matter?

781
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,695
Nothing. I just have to go to the bathroom.

782
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:52,314
Oh, okay then.

783
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:59,352
Special offer. Here you go.

784
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:01,805
Special offer!

785
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:10,720
Naoka...

786
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,871
Here you are!

787
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:13,833
Please come and visit us.

788
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:15,390
Special offer!

789
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:16,589
Just give it a try.

790
00:58:23,803 --> 00:58:25,167
Meow Meow Club...

791
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,906
<i>"It's great that you learned sign language.
And thank you for bringing us together again!"</i>

792
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:38,408
Oh!

793
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:43,519
Wow I'd never have the guts to
do that. Yes they're having fun.

794
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:44,907
Hmm?

795
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:48,803
Maybe I should reunite her with Naoka as well?

796
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:52,660
Yep, that may be the worst idea you've ever have.

797
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:56,033
On second thought I'll pass.

798
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:02,687
Here we are.

799
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:05,880
Shall we? Meow meow Club?

800
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,093
Here we come.

801
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,910
Good afternoon.

802
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:08,511
Welcome!

803
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,980
And how long will you be staying with us.

804
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,640
One hour? I guess.

805
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:16,540
I have a coupon...

806
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,697
Oh good! Right this way.

807
00:59:19,233 --> 00:59:21,673
Crap! He actually came...

808
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,468
This is not what I imagined.

809
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,307
There cats... what were you expecting?

810
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,735
Well have you ever been to a place like this?

811
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,861
What? No, I never. I came here for you man.

812
00:59:34,886 --> 00:59:36,994
I wanted to help you reunite with your friend...

813
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,475
and speaking of old friends.

814
00:59:39,573 --> 00:59:40,852
Where is she, anyway?

815
00:59:41,432 --> 00:59:44,047
I wouldn't exactly call this girl a friend.

816
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,085
You wouldn't?

817
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:48,857
A lot of stuff happened when we were in sixth grade.

818
00:59:48,973 --> 00:59:51,457
To be honesty this whole thing's kind of awkward.

819
00:59:53,207 --> 00:59:54,607
She isn't here.

820
00:59:58,814 --> 01:00:00,427
Wanna take off then?

821
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,053
A bug!

822
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,986
Oh what are you doing here huh?

823
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,261
I came over to play with Maria.

824
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,024
Hey uh, do you think shoka would like this?

825
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:28,284
Kitty!

826
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:32,349
I brought you a present, Shoko!

827
01:00:47,363 --> 01:00:48,736
What happened...

828
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,294
I'm just gonna leave this here.

829
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:03,531
What?

830
01:01:03,813 --> 01:01:05,993
N--Naoka...

831
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:06,860
What...

832
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:08,274
Go, go!

833
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,847
Hey what are you doing!?

834
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,497
Long time no see!

835
01:01:12,659 --> 01:01:14,430
Yeah. Long time no see.

836
01:01:17,486 --> 01:01:18,456
Huh?

837
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:22,488
Wait a minute. Isn't the deaf girl?

838
01:01:23,386 --> 01:01:24,960
Still alone.

839
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,130
Poor thing!

840
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:31,906
Seriously Shoya. It really has been way too long.

841
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,220
Let's hang out soon.

842
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:35,404
No I don't think so.

843
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,340
Well, you really hate me, don't you?

844
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:37,939
What?

845
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,762
No I never said that.

846
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:43,229
You konw what Shoya,

847
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,410
I always thought I should have
made more of an effort to talk to you.

848
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:49,171
I'm sorry about everything
that happened when we were kids.

849
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,651
It's not that big of a deal.

850
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:54,584
Hey Naoka,

851
01:01:55,343 --> 01:01:56,119
get off.

852
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:04,732
That's purse from our cafe.

853
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,360
Where did that deaf freak get it from.

854
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,207
I gave it to her.

855
01:02:09,586 --> 01:02:11,922
Oh... I see.

856
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:17,197
Later.

857
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:18,739
Yeah.

858
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:24,837
Naoka?

859
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:29,040
Hey there Shoko long time no see!
Someone was likely tracking you.

860
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,640
Stop!!

861
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:31,880
That's weird. There's only one of them.

862
01:02:32,064 --> 01:02:34,070
Naoka! What do you think you're doing.

863
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,936
Thought we'd have a game a
catch, just like when we were kids.

864
01:02:45,424 --> 01:02:47,364
I'm so sorry Shoko.

865
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:52,830
No freakin way, you gotta be kidding me.

866
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,176
Hold on, wait a minute.

867
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,582
Don't tell me you guys are actually going out?

868
01:02:56,702 --> 01:02:59,148
What!? what are you talking about?

869
01:02:59,381 --> 01:03:00,595
We're just friends.

870
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,945
Just friends?

871
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,044
That's hilarious.

872
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:11,375
Are you telling me you are now besties with the
girl used to bully? I can't believe it. That's crazy.

873
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:15,431
Let me guess, are you trying to make amends?

874
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:16,611
Not really.

875
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,172
Ha ha.

876
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:20,974
Too funny, what's gotten into you?

877
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,056
Well, I'll leave you to your fake friendship thing.

878
01:03:27,142 --> 01:03:29,850
Ha ha ha.

879
01:03:35,007 --> 01:03:37,093
You want to know what we were talking about?

880
01:03:37,966 --> 01:03:40,146
Nothing, don't worry about it.

881
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,709
Look I gotta take off.

882
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,541
See you.

883
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:07,580
Yuzuru,

884
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,557
time to get up.

885
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,518
I'm up, you startled me awake.

886
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,084
Get off bed, breakfast...

887
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:16,777
Wait! Before you go...

888
01:04:17,126 --> 01:04:18,240
What's up?

889
01:04:20,651 --> 01:04:24,475
Your hair today it's in a ponytail.

890
01:04:24,587 --> 01:04:25,530
Are you...?

891
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,413
What a weird face!

892
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,716
Shoya will love the new dew.

893
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,183
<i>"So much carp. Shortage ofbread
and feeding manpower.You MUST come."</i>

894
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:48,634
Huh?

895
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,186
Oh, Shoko.

896
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,441
She's wearing a ponytail.

897
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,515
Where are you going, Shoya?

898
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,245
What was that? Where am I going?

899
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,946
To the bakery.

900
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,818
Yuzuru asked me to get some bread to feed the carp.

901
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,795
But you already have some bread. I bet
she only wants more so she can eat it.

902
01:05:24,848 --> 01:05:27,160
You don't have to buy her anymore. I
can't believe she made you do that for her!

903
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,286
Wait. Just...

904
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,546
Can you sign it?

905
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:34,222
Is my voice weird?

906
01:05:34,293 --> 01:05:35,029
Yes.

907
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:39,469
Oh, I'me sorry. I didn't...

908
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,487
Your voice sounds totally okay.

909
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:47,080
I'm gonna get some bread.

910
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:49,632
Be right back.

911
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:55,137
Huh?

912
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:57,303
What are you doing？

913
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,427
Present for me?

914
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:08,733
Wow, thanks.

915
01:06:09,093 --> 01:06:09,855
Can I open it?

916
01:06:12,227 --> 01:06:13,350
Like right now?

917
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,464
What are these things?

918
01:06:21,726 --> 01:06:23,250
Thank you so much.

919
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,617
What's that?

920
01:06:30,642 --> 01:06:32,070
Something about these?

921
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,658
I... ige... moo...

922
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:42,778
Huh?...

923
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,998
I love you!

924
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,789
The moon?

925
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,190
It is pretty, isn't it?

926
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:10,805
Where are you going?

927
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,040
<i>"How about we go out and see a movie now?"</i>

928
01:07:19,891 --> 01:07:21,417
Can I ask you something?

929
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,517
Do you think they look like the moon?

930
01:07:24,563 --> 01:07:27,012
Let's see... well they don't look like the moon.

931
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,505
Hummm.

932
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,247
Candy!

933
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,084
I'm pretty sure these things aren't candy.

934
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:34,463
Shoko gave these to me as a present.

935
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:36,425
I have no idea what they are.

936
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:39,568
Huh?

937
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,230
Oh...

938
01:07:43,473 --> 01:07:45,293
Are you okay? What happened?

939
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,360
<i>"I said I like you to Ishida-kun"</i>

940
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,160
Ah! You what...!

941
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,130
<i>"But he couldn't understand what I said."</i>

942
01:07:55,345 --> 01:07:56,367
Huh...

943
01:08:04,007 --> 01:08:05,947
Wow, check out your hair. It's different.

944
01:08:05,972 --> 01:08:07,680
What made you decide to change it?

945
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,075
Do you have a hot day? Whatever
it is, you should keep it like this.

946
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,740
Stop it you guys.

947
01:08:12,925 --> 01:08:17,992
You're making me blush. I just didn't
have any time to do it. That's all.

948
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,447
Well. I think it looks good.

949
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,653
Hi, Miki. I've got a question.

950
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,610
Why did you suddenly change your hair?

951
01:08:24,987 --> 01:08:27,372
Hmmm... what do you mean?

952
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:30,475
It's not like I need any particular reason.

953
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:33,763
Girls just like to change things up sometimes. You know.

954
01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:35,535
I see.

955
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:37,938
What is it?

956
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:43,468
The other days the Toshi told me he thought
you'd be a pretty cool guy to hang out with!

957
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:44,867
Huh?

958
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:54,795
Who are you and tell us the nature of your business.

959
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,967
Nice to meet you. Miyoko Sahara.

960
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,807
Hi. Satoshi Mashiba.

961
01:08:58,919 --> 01:09:01,216
Cut it out! Stop doing that over my head.

962
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,020
Miyoko! It feels like it's been a million years!

963
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,821
Hey! If Shoko coming today?

964
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,722
No. She's a stomachache.

965
01:09:07,855 --> 01:09:10,040
Umm... that's weird.

966
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,720
I hope she's not avoiding me.

967
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:12,630
How come?

968
01:09:12,907 --> 01:09:15,429
She was trying to tell me something the other day.

969
01:09:15,553 --> 01:09:17,989
I just could not understand what she was saying.

970
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,410
What exactly did she say to you?

971
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:21,652
The moon.

972
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,325
Pff!

973
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:26,182
It's an easy enough word but her
saying it didn't make any sense.

974
01:09:26,766 --> 01:09:28,637
I bet she was so annoyed.

975
01:09:28,786 --> 01:09:31,646
Well if you really want to know how she feels about you.

976
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,482
Then I suggest you just ask her out.

977
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,870
If she says no, you will have your answer.

978
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,210
I guess that you're right.

979
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:44,279
<i>"We are planning to go to the amusement
park, I was thinking maybe we can go together?"</i>

980
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,779
Come on! Lets all go on the big one first.

981
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,780
Everyone stick together so we don't get separated man!

982
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:06,118
Why did she actually act like a chaperone or something.

983
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:07,032
Who knows?

984
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:08,300
Shoya.

985
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,920
Who's that? Over there.

986
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,670
Oh!

987
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,814
Why is she acting so chummy with Shoko?

988
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,249
Naoka?... Why she's here?

989
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,520
Is she like a friend or something?

990
01:10:21,194 --> 01:10:21,742
Yeah!

991
01:10:22,145 --> 01:10:23,466
From elementary school.

992
01:10:24,607 --> 01:10:25,254
Hmmmm...

993
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:32,140
Hey... mind if I sit here?

994
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,850
Not at all. Go right ahead.

995
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,665
I might be scary.

996
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,326
Okay everybody, are you ready?

997
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,800
Yeah!!

998
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,741
Then hold on tight.

999
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,468
Miyoko, so are you like cool with Naoka now?

1000
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,321
Huh?

1001
01:10:50,843 --> 01:10:51,845
Oh, sure!

1002
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,464
We're actually both in the design department at school.

1003
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,703
Now it's got great taste. I've learned a lot from her.

1004
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:04,945
You know, when we were in elementary
school. I was way to scared to ride this.

1005
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,800
I was such a coward back then.

1006
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:12,399
But then, one day, I looked at it differently.

1007
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:17,120
I was going to wait until after the
ride to decide whether it's scary or not.

1008
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:22,387
Can't help feeling little scary though.

1009
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,035
Here we go!

1010
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,520
Oh... oh no!

1011
01:11:47,986 --> 01:11:50,670
Poor Shoko, your legs are shaking.

1012
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:53,692
Are you okay?

1013
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,212
Ha ha.

1014
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,745
That's pretty impressive. I didn't know you can sign it!

1015
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,722
You must have worked really hard to learn sign language.

1016
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,675
Huh?

1017
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,940
Hey get your dirty paws off my Ya-sho.

1018
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,280
Who said you could touch it Huh?

1019
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,968
Dude! I was just being friendly.

1020
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,500
Well go be friendly with someone else.

1021
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,040
Nagatsuka you really creak me.

1022
01:12:18,065 --> 01:12:20,729
Ya-sho is my friend I've got my eye on you. You better...

1023
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:22,862
Hey, is that your real hair?

1024
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,473
No, get off...!

1025
01:12:25,568 --> 01:12:26,614
I'm not joking.

1026
01:12:26,807 --> 01:12:27,667
What's so funny!

1027
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,167
Is this...?

1028
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,860
Faster it Satoshi! They are catching up!

1029
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,540
We can do this, Ya-sho. Come on! Pedal harder!

1030
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,720
What is this...?

1031
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,782
Is it okay...?

1032
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:40,733
Am I allowed to have this much fun?

1033
01:12:41,767 --> 01:12:44,645
This feels so... familiar.

1034
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:47,229
Great catch, funny.

1035
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:50,170
Oh yeah... It almost feels like...

1036
01:12:51,106 --> 01:12:52,465
...like real friends!

1037
01:12:57,881 --> 01:12:58,947
Hey Shoya!

1038
01:13:00,081 --> 01:13:02,655
I'am hungry. I feel like some takoyaki.

1039
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:03,959
Come with me to get some.

1040
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,254
Ah... I'm not... Hey! Hey! Wait!

1041
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,392
Here you go. One takoyaki.

1042
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,552
Thank you.

1043
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,479
And Naoka!

1044
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,664
You need to learn mind your own business.

1045
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:26,386
Ka... Kazuki...?

1046
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,177
Shoya where are you going?

1047
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,598
I'll text you later okay?

1048
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,877
Hey wait up!

1049
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,772
Are you mad at me?

1050
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,520
No I'm not.

1051
01:13:45,448 --> 01:13:47,180
I'm fine, yeah.

1052
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,495
I just thought

1053
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,841
maybe you guys could be friends.

1054
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,636
You know, like you used to be.

1055
01:13:53,504 --> 01:13:57,983
I guess I was hoping once you guys actually
saw each other everything would be okay.

1056
01:13:58,110 --> 01:13:59,891
Don't do me any favors, okay?

1057
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:01,824
Oops.

1058
01:14:03,932 --> 01:14:04,559
Wait...

1059
01:14:05,869 --> 01:14:08,009
I did the exactly same things...

1060
01:14:13,093 --> 01:14:15,364
You and I are more alike than you think you know.

1061
01:14:15,548 --> 01:14:16,795
No. We are not.

1062
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,087
Yes we are.

1063
01:14:18,386 --> 01:14:19,821
We're nothing alike.

1064
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,417
You know,

1065
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,987
If Shoko hadn't shown up, we would
all still be friends and be happy.

1066
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,530
You don't know that.

1067
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,652
Oh, come on. Just admit it.

1068
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,240
If it wasn't for her,

1069
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:38,036
things wouldn't have gotten
all weird between Miyoko and me.

1070
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,687
And then you wouldn't have stopped
being friends with Kazuki either.

1071
01:14:42,776 --> 01:14:46,082
I just want to go back to the way
things were, before she showed up.

1072
01:14:46,142 --> 01:14:50,761
Kazuki and I... That was
me. I run out on my own.

1073
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,302
Shoya, tell me the truth.

1074
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:54,630
Do you hate me?

1075
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:55,657
Probably.

1076
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,504
Fine! Time for a ride on the ferriswheel.

1077
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,837
I'll go see if Shoko wants to come with me.

1078
01:15:03,197 --> 01:15:03,883
Hey!

1079
01:15:04,394 --> 01:15:05,227
Huh?

1080
01:15:05,352 --> 01:15:08,287
Shoko, you've got to come ride the ferriswheel with me.

1081
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:09,680
Cut it out! Naoka!

1082
01:15:09,866 --> 01:15:12,186
If you guys are going, can you take my camera.

1083
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,612
I want to ride the roller coaster again.

1084
01:15:38,764 --> 01:15:40,403
Oh, hi Yuzuru!

1085
01:15:40,576 --> 01:15:42,943
Come on in. Shoya is upstairs in his room.

1086
01:15:43,896 --> 01:15:44,523
Wow.

1087
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:47,099
I got top secret video for you.

1088
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,581
A video from the ferriswheel?

1089
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:51,087
Yeah.

1090
01:15:51,741 --> 01:15:53,120
How would you get it?

1091
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,035
Spying.

1092
01:15:54,088 --> 01:15:54,738
What?

1093
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,060
I want you to listen to me carefully.

1094
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,044
I hate you.

1095
01:16:08,493 --> 01:16:09,957
Put that thing away.

1096
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,363
I'm going to speak slowly so you can understand.

1097
01:16:13,575 --> 01:16:15,678
And I'll listen everything you have to say.

1098
01:16:18,068 --> 01:16:20,523
I'll admit that in elementary school,

1099
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,464
I had no idea what things were like for you.

1100
01:16:23,784 --> 01:16:27,170
It's not like you tried to understand
what I was going through either.

1101
01:16:27,497 --> 01:16:28,694
You know what I mean.

1102
01:16:29,006 --> 01:16:32,066
And instead of getting a clue like a normal person,

1103
01:16:32,095 --> 01:16:35,334
You just kept giving me that stupid notebook of yours.

1104
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:37,329
You're always being so weird.

1105
01:16:37,442 --> 01:16:39,820
And you would apologize all the time for everything.

1106
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,037
So I tried a different approach.

1107
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,840
I ignored you and blew you off.

1108
01:16:44,063 --> 01:16:47,155
That was my way of telling you that
I didn't want to hang out with you.

1109
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,195
But nope,

1110
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,333
you just kept coming around with
your stupid book and your stupid signs

1111
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:56,447
you're so clueless then you had
to go run crying to the grown-ups.

1112
01:16:56,794 --> 01:17:02,428
You got Shoya it in trouble and that's how he
ended up losing every single one of his friends.

1113
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:06,825
You pretty much ruined everything
for everyone, you get that right.

1114
01:17:08,513 --> 01:17:09,770
I... I'm sorry...

1115
01:17:09,952 --> 01:17:14,171
God you still don't get it I'm not
looking for nother apology from you.

1116
01:17:14,737 --> 01:17:16,584
We were both going through a lot,

1117
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:19,730
and I don't think either of us
could have done anything differently.

1118
01:17:20,446 --> 01:17:24,040
But still, it's not like I want to
be your new best friend or anything.

1119
01:17:24,379 --> 01:17:28,909
I mean I still hate you a lot, and
I pretty sure you hate me too right?

1120
01:17:29,513 --> 01:17:32,752
So why don't we stop pretending
or something we're not okay?

1121
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,067
Let's shake on it from one hater to another.

1122
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:41,503
You wrong, I don't hate you...

1123
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,960
I.....I.....

1124
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,707
I hate myself...

1125
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,205
What did you say?

1126
01:17:46,532 --> 01:17:50,864
What did you say?

1127
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:56,915
Well what are you gonna do? You can't say sorry again?

1128
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,120
It has been five years,

1129
01:17:59,145 --> 01:18:04,239
and you haven't changed a bit. You still
have no intention of being real with me.

1130
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,748
What do you think?

1131
01:18:12,347 --> 01:18:13,474
It's all...

1132
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,055
all I want...

1133
01:18:19,552 --> 01:18:21,502
is for Shoko to like herself.

1134
01:18:30,675 --> 01:18:32,406
Are you sure with Naoka?

1135
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,959
Yeah it was her.

1136
01:18:34,723 --> 01:18:37,747
Is there really a lot of bad blood between her and Shoko?

1137
01:18:37,953 --> 01:18:39,500
Why do you ask?

1138
01:18:40,233 --> 01:18:43,461
Miki said something serious went down at your old school.

1139
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:49,580
Shoko's hearing is really bad. I
mean she can barely hear anything right?

1140
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:51,025
Yeah.

1141
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:55,944
It just occurred to me, maybe that's why
she kept getting bullied all the time you know?

1142
01:18:57,435 --> 01:18:59,865
You'd have to be a major douche bag

1143
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:01,746
who bullies a deaf kid.

1144
01:19:02,133 --> 01:19:04,203
What's wrong with people right?

1145
01:19:04,513 --> 01:19:05,867
What are you saying!?

1146
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,115
Wait! You think I'm spreading rumors
about what happened at elementary school?

1147
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,715
Shush! will you keep it down?
The whole school can hear you.

1148
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:17,055
I really wanted to believe that
you would actually change Shoya.

1149
01:19:17,102 --> 01:19:19,615
But you are still the same awful
person you were in elementary school.

1150
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,285
Are you okay?

1151
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:22,644
Can you just please calm down a second.

1152
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,540
Hey guys what's going on.

1153
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,668
Remember when I told you Shoko was bullied?

1154
01:19:26,761 --> 01:19:29,654
Well it was Shoko, he was the one who used to bully her.

1155
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,060
How can you say that Miki?
Ya-sho would never do that.

1156
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,916
Why I make up something like that.

1157
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,388
But you used to make fun of her to Miki.

1158
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,175
I never ever said anything horrible behind Shoko's back.

1159
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,909
What you picked on Shoko?

1160
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:50,468
Yeah, was him! He was the one
who made Shoko's life a living hell.

1161
01:19:52,617 --> 01:19:56,521
It was so awful I kept begging him to leave her alone.

1162
01:19:56,801 --> 01:19:59,027
But Shoya never listens to anyone.

1163
01:19:59,606 --> 01:20:01,046
I'm so scared of him.

1164
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:05,335
Ya-sho?

1165
01:20:06,053 --> 01:20:07,413
What's wrong?

1166
01:20:07,846 --> 01:20:08,935
Sorry, Nagatsuka...

1167
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:09,897
Are you OK?

1168
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:13,474
Ya-sho!

1169
01:20:42,052 --> 01:20:44,987
Yeah, I hate me too...

1170
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,092
Hey we're over here.

1171
01:20:58,117 --> 01:20:58,818
Hi!

1172
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,120
Is something wrong?

1173
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:05,392
Oh no, not really.

1174
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,203
It's nothing...

1175
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:07,725
Huh?

1176
01:21:09,373 --> 01:21:11,488
There he is. My main man.

1177
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,612
I brought your backpack for you!

1178
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,735
Hey guys.

1179
01:21:14,845 --> 01:21:15,827
Naoka...?

1180
01:21:16,866 --> 01:21:18,192
...I asked her to come.

1181
01:21:22,447 --> 01:21:24,313
I'm sorry about what happened.

1182
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:29,676
But well you were the one who
started causing all that trouble.

1183
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:37,288
Nothing is Satoshi said I should go ahead and forgive you
since you've been trying to make things right with Shoko.

1184
01:21:38,133 --> 01:21:39,526
Are you kidding me?

1185
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,217
This is wrong on so many levels.

1186
01:21:42,313 --> 01:21:46,078
You can't blame everything that
happened on Shoya. We were all guilty.

1187
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,126
We?

1188
01:21:48,823 --> 01:21:50,130
But no, that isn't true.

1189
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,168
What's not?

1190
01:21:52,135 --> 01:21:56,855
I never made fun of Shoko. Did anything to
bully her the way the rest of you guys did.

1191
01:21:57,296 --> 01:21:58,971
Don't lump me in with you.

1192
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:01,415
Naoka...

1193
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,930
Hmmm...

1194
01:22:05,406 --> 01:22:08,956
You're right. You and I are completely different.

1195
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,648
You just that back and laughed along with everyone else.

1196
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,915
It's not!

1197
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,688
Just asked Miyoko!

1198
01:22:15,213 --> 01:22:16,238
What? Me!?

1199
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:19,790
Naoka used to talk about you
behind your back all the time too.

1200
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:21,980
I just said what everyone else was thinking.

1201
01:22:23,587 --> 01:22:26,013
Well Miyoko, wanna weigh in?

1202
01:22:27,934 --> 01:22:29,528
To be completely honest...

1203
01:22:29,912 --> 01:22:30,652
back then I was...

1204
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,660
I was scared of both of you.

1205
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:35,660
What!? Whose side are you are anyway!?

1206
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,130
I'm not on anyone's side!

1207
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:38,270
Just stop.

1208
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,010
It's my fault okay. It's all my fault.

1209
01:22:44,779 --> 01:22:46,538
I can't stand martyrs..

1210
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,370
That's enough Naoka.

1211
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,694
Stop trying to drag everybody else down here level.

1212
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,580
That was harsh! You didn't have to put...

1213
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:56,935
Oh, please, Miyoko.

1214
01:22:57,208 --> 01:23:00,234
We all know that you just run
away when other things get intense.

1215
01:23:01,015 --> 01:23:02,940
Shoya, what's gotten into you...

1216
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:06,208
God will you just stop talking?

1217
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:09,003
You really love the sound of your own voice don't you?

1218
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,198
Listen man,

1219
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,608
No matter what anyone says I've got your back.

1220
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,681
I don't care what you just
back off. You hardly know me.

1221
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:21,707
I can't take this anymore.
I'm not staying here.

1222
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:23,366
It's okay.

1223
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:24,660
You don't mean it.

1224
01:23:25,281 --> 01:23:27,356
But I'm gonna give you some space.

1225
01:23:29,966 --> 01:23:30,952
Hey Shoko,

1226
01:23:32,444 --> 01:23:33,052
later.

1227
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,043
I'm sorry, Shoya.

1228
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,282
I never should have agreed to come here to begin with.

1229
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:51,006
It's not cool. We're way to harsh.

1230
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,392
What do you know? You're not
even really part of our group.

1231
01:23:56,326 --> 01:23:58,012
I thought we were friends.

1232
01:24:11,327 --> 01:24:12,320
Almost forgot...

1233
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:15,295
So starting next week,

1234
01:24:15,646 --> 01:24:17,070
it's summer vacation.

1235
01:24:18,013 --> 01:24:19,934
Do you want to go somewhere special?

1236
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:39,952
Yuzu.

1237
01:24:41,233 --> 01:24:44,447
You're going to ruin your eyes
reading in the dark like that.

1238
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,143
Here.

1239
01:24:58,232 --> 01:25:01,992
You spend so much time worried about your big sister.

1240
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,408
Now I'm starting to worry about you. Sweetie.

1241
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,880
You get so caught up in Shoko's life

1242
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,911
that you never leave any time for yourself.

1243
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:16,360
I could say the same thing about you granny!

1244
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:20,667
Instead of going to the senior center
all you do is study sign language.

1245
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,526
That's something I'm doing for
myself so that doesn't really count.

1246
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:28,576
What a coincidence. Because I'm
doing all these things for myself too.

1247
01:25:29,853 --> 01:25:30,761
Really?

1248
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,484
You are such a good kid.

1249
01:25:36,995 --> 01:25:37,977
You think so?

1250
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,760
Mom chews me out on a daily basis,

1251
01:25:40,812 --> 01:25:43,171
and I haven't gone to school in like... weeks.

1252
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,399
Yes, sweetie. But you've got a heart of gold.

1253
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,954
Shoko is no slouchy either.

1254
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,668
I've got some mighty fine grandchildren.

1255
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,166
Have one of the Manju too?

1256
01:26:00,352 --> 01:26:01,452
You've got it!

1257
01:26:16,427 --> 01:26:17,380
Granny...

1258
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:32,196
Hey there, Shoko.

1259
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:35,969
So today, I was able to score some really great bread.

1260
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:39,303
See! It's awesome, like you're awesome.

1261
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:45,786
Oh like really great bread is
awesome, This loaf here is just like you.

1262
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:48,747
That makes no sense.

1263
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:50,247
Huh...?

1264
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:53,902
I wonder if she's coming today?

1265
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:58,153
I guess not...

1266
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,517
Is your stomach bothering you?

1267
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:03,469
Is it not too personal?

1268
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,205
Hey, Yuzu???

1269
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,397
I should go...

1270
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:31,550
Shoya!

1271
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:32,967
Hey there!

1272
01:27:33,293 --> 01:27:34,623
What the heck are you wearing?

1273
01:27:34,822 --> 01:27:37,160
What's it look like. My uniform.

1274
01:27:37,242 --> 01:27:38,841
What do you think? You like?

1275
01:27:38,961 --> 01:27:40,049
Why are you wearing it?

1276
01:27:40,074 --> 01:27:40,987
For school.

1277
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,939
But we're on summer break right now.

1278
01:27:44,964 --> 01:27:45,504
Ehh...

1279
01:27:46,856 --> 01:27:48,676
So what's really going on?

1280
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,919
Nothing is going on I swear.

1281
01:27:53,075 --> 01:27:55,699
If anyone asks, tell him cosplay!

1282
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:56,765
Huh.

1283
01:27:58,210 --> 01:28:00,944
That was from my sister so I better take off.

1284
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,390
Where to? I'll walk you there.

1285
01:28:02,597 --> 01:28:03,703
No. It's fine.

1286
01:28:03,859 --> 01:28:04,822
You sure you're okay?

1287
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:06,742
Yeah, everything is cool.

1288
01:28:07,292 --> 01:28:09,039
Then why you were crying just now.

1289
01:28:09,738 --> 01:28:10,372
Come on!

1290
01:28:13,284 --> 01:28:16,244
This actually doesn't have anything to do with you.

1291
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:17,795
Sure it does...

1292
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,280
At least, I think so.

1293
01:28:20,866 --> 01:28:21,473
Why?

1294
01:28:22,259 --> 01:28:24,059
I'm just worried about you okay.

1295
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:29,196
I don't believe it you sound just like my grandma.

1296
01:28:31,052 --> 01:28:33,639
All right if you wanna come then come.

1297
01:28:37,022 --> 01:28:38,162
This is it.

1298
01:28:38,495 --> 01:28:41,832
Thanks for walking me. I appreciate it.

1299
01:28:42,011 --> 01:28:44,340
<i>"Funeral service for Ito Nishimiya"</i>

1300
01:28:44,466 --> 01:28:45,713
See you.

1301
01:28:51,586 --> 01:28:53,040
Good lucky, Yuzuru!

1302
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,765
Shoya. Wait.

1303
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,882
Truth is... I am scared.

1304
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:05,899
<i>"How about hanging out
somewhere tomorrow?"</i>

1305
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,750
Wow, that's cool!

1306
01:31:03,227 --> 01:31:05,693
Come on, Shoko. Let's go check it out.

1307
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,723
Huh?

1308
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,470
Shoko?

1309
01:31:25,069 --> 01:31:26,223
I'm fine really.

1310
01:31:28,653 --> 01:31:30,533
Why are you apologizing?

1311
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:38,634
That's totally not true!

1312
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,483
Hey, are you busy tomorrow?

1313
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,374
Let's hang out tomorrow, too!

1314
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:48,818
Shoko said...

1315
01:31:49,116 --> 01:31:51,484
that I'll be miserable whenever I'm with her.

1316
01:31:54,146 --> 01:31:56,056
But I'm the one who made her unhappy.

1317
01:31:57,153 --> 01:31:58,104
It was me...

1318
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:12,129
I want to see the sea,

1319
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:17,620
I want to have somemone love me,

1320
01:32:18,793 --> 01:32:22,004
even monsters feel

1321
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,884
feel there are...

1322
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,062
There's no going back to the way things were...

1323
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:39,135
Hey! Shoko. Cool! I see Yuzuru
is going to get along with us.

1324
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:40,310
Let's check outa movie!

1325
01:32:40,543 --> 01:32:43,416
Ha ha ha, this is hilarious.

1326
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,960
Hey greetings classmates!

1327
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,625
I gotta say this has been the best summer break ever.

1328
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,791
Just ask Yuzuru?

1329
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,746
Whatever...

1330
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:54,472
Seriously, we're having an absolute blast.

1331
01:32:54,552 --> 01:32:55,565
What about tomorrow.

1332
01:32:55,874 --> 01:32:59,060
We should go somewhere fun.
Any ideas? Where we should go?

1333
01:32:59,126 --> 01:33:02,012
Sorry, but we already have plans for tomorrow.

1334
01:33:02,445 --> 01:33:03,056
Huh?

1335
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,020
Hah? No way. Are you insane?

1336
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:07,766
Wants to make what?

1337
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:09,066
You sure it's okay?

1338
01:33:09,186 --> 01:33:11,632
I feel like I really shouldn't be here.

1339
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,940
Your mission should you choose to accept?

1340
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:17,126
It is to assist us in baking our mother's birthday cake.

1341
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:19,245
Are you absolutely sure?

1342
01:33:19,695 --> 01:33:20,873
I don't want to get hit again.

1343
01:33:20,898 --> 01:33:23,650
She won't hit you. She'll probably kill you this time.

1344
01:33:23,675 --> 01:33:24,510
For real?

1345
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,391
Oh that looks amazing!

1346
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,630
Why is he here?

1347
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,554
What's that boy doing our kitchen?

1348
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:35,120
I want an explanation right now.

1349
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:40,339
Come on, mom, don't be like that. It's a
party! We're supposed to be celebrating.

1350
01:33:40,386 --> 01:33:41,136
Yuzuru.

1351
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:42,384
You look great!

1352
01:33:43,697 --> 01:33:44,670
Eh...

1353
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:54,539
You lucked out, looks like mom isn't gonna kill you.

1354
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:57,460
I declare a victory.

1355
01:33:57,591 --> 01:33:59,453
Speaking of winning,

1356
01:33:59,653 --> 01:34:03,474
I submitted some of your photography
to the local contest Yuzuru.

1357
01:34:03,521 --> 01:34:04,028
Huh?

1358
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,160
You what?

1359
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,840
It was actually your sister's idea.

1360
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,700
What? But I'm no good. I'm just messing around.

1361
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:15,399
Oh, come on, that's not true.

1362
01:34:15,992 --> 01:34:18,754
Why would you do this to me.

1363
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,959
Before I forget, next Tuesday you're coming
to see the fireworks with us sitll right?

1364
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:27,495
I don't have to.

1365
01:34:27,733 --> 01:34:29,397
You're totally coming...

1366
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,489
Is here okay?

1367
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,595
Yeah, this is good.

1368
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:15,957
Well, perfect time to go buy snacks.

1369
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:17,183
Want to come on?

1370
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:30,441
Oh, thank you.

1371
01:35:32,455 --> 01:35:34,636
Thanks for inviting me over the other day too.

1372
01:35:35,009 --> 01:35:36,056
Your mom...

1373
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:38,599
You really think she was happy?

1374
01:35:39,607 --> 01:35:40,794
I couldn't tell...

1375
01:35:42,193 --> 01:35:43,642
Speaking of which...

1376
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:45,748
I don't know when your birthday is.

1377
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:50,142
Your birthday was June 7th.

1378
01:35:50,415 --> 01:35:53,521
Oh no I missed it. That's too bad.

1379
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:55,932
I can't believe you're already 18.

1380
01:35:56,324 --> 01:35:58,650
Next year, we'll celebrate together.

1381
01:35:59,052 --> 01:36:00,565
We'll throw a big party.

1382
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:03,311
I made it sound like we're together.

1383
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,177
Oh.

1384
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,462
I get now.

1385
01:36:28,555 --> 01:36:29,946
That makes perfect sense.

1386
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:32,896
That's why you closed your eyes.

1387
01:36:35,064 --> 01:36:36,945
Oh, where are you going?

1388
01:36:40,707 --> 01:36:44,422
What? Why now? The fireworks only just started.

1389
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:48,465
To go study...

1390
01:36:49,946 --> 01:36:50,697
Okay.

1391
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,422
Hey wait up I'll walk you home.

1392
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,021
But why...

1393
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,180
Oh well

1394
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:05,118
See you later.

1395
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,095
Hey what happened to Shoko?

1396
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:21,392
Oh, I forgot my camera.

1397
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,731
Would you mind going back to our place to get it?

1398
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:38,298
I'm coming in...

1399
01:37:38,717 --> 01:37:40,077
Oh, it's dark.

1400
01:37:40,379 --> 01:37:41,739
Shoko, you here?

1401
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:43,164
It's me, Shoya.

1402
01:37:44,204 --> 01:37:45,184
There it is.

1403
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:49,079
Shouldn't I make sure it's fully charged...?

1404
01:37:49,767 --> 01:37:52,289
Huh? Oh, you see the fireworks from here.

1405
01:37:54,226 --> 01:37:55,881
So that's where she is.

1406
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:58,829
She...

1407
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:00,589
Hey...

1408
01:38:01,246 --> 01:38:02,816
Wait, wait! Wait a second!

1409
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,495
What is she doing?!

1410
01:38:04,854 --> 01:38:05,881
Hey, Shoko?

1411
01:38:10,566 --> 01:38:11,491
Shoko...!?

1412
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:14,245
Huh!

1413
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:23,700
Don't do it!

1414
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,100
Ah! Ouch!

1415
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:31,404
Please no...!

1416
01:38:34,167 --> 01:38:35,852
Shoko!

1417
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:10,015
You have to hold on to the railing.

1418
01:39:11,059 --> 01:39:11,754
Please, God...

1419
01:39:12,421 --> 01:39:17,087
Give me one more ounce of strength... I
won't run away from my problem anymore.

1420
01:39:18,053 --> 01:39:20,415
Just through this one thing for me please.

1421
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:24,918
Starting tomorrow... I'll look everyone in the eye.

1422
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:30,336
Starting tomorrow... I'll listen when people speak to me.

1423
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:34,617
Starting tomorrow... I'll be better.

1424
01:39:34,919 --> 01:39:36,919
Shoko...

1425
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:43,092
There it is the scar I gave her all those years ago.

1426
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:45,647
Did I ever even apologize for that

1427
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:47,702
I'm sorry.

1428
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:50,117
Sorry for everything Shoko.

1429
01:39:50,806 --> 01:39:52,025
Are you still mad at me?

1430
01:39:52,906 --> 01:39:54,733
Huh, I'm so dumb.

1431
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:58,141
I should have asked her what she really thinks of me.

1432
01:39:58,906 --> 01:40:00,307
But now I don't know if.

1433
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,826
By the way, Shoko. I think that I might...

1434
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,026
He there Sho,

1435
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:22,398
your sister whipped you up some of her famous pancake.

1436
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:25,249
I'm going to watch the fireworks!

1437
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:38,151
It's cold...

1438
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:40,522
It's warm...

1439
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:08,457
Mrs Ishida.

1440
01:41:08,786 --> 01:41:10,184
What are you doing here?

1441
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,492
I'm glad I caught you.

1442
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:15,789
I tried calling the so long but it was closed.

1443
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:18,455
I just wanted to know about Shoya...

1444
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,663
Well he's doing a lot better.

1445
01:41:20,745 --> 01:41:22,536
They moved him out of the ICU.

1446
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:25,711
I was going to his new room. Do you want to come with me?

1447
01:41:26,813 --> 01:41:28,005
Do you know if Shoya...

1448
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,165
Mrs Ishita...

1449
01:41:29,973 --> 01:41:31,553
Mrs Nishimiya...

1450
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:35,483
I'm very sorry for all the trouble Shoya has caused.

1451
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:38,736
I know what he did in the past
is unforgivable. But I want you...

1452
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,062
Please forgive me.

1453
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,725
What are you doing? Oh get up...

1454
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,700
I'm sure Shoya must have done something...

1455
01:41:46,725 --> 01:41:47,610
Mrs Ishida,

1456
01:41:47,677 --> 01:41:51,229
Shoya was trying to save my stupid sister.

1457
01:41:51,455 --> 01:41:56,675
If I do better... she wouldn't have...

1458
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:58,870
I'm so sorry.

1459
01:41:58,954 --> 01:42:00,787
Please don't.

1460
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:03,604
Come on, both you. Please get up.

1461
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:06,343
I'm just glad that Shoko was okay.

1462
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:08,538
And you too Yuzuru...

1463
01:42:09,892 --> 01:42:10,953
So please get up...

1464
01:42:12,976 --> 01:42:16,362
Why is Shoya lying in a hospital bed instead of you?

1465
01:42:16,549 --> 01:42:19,481
Don't you dare try to play the victim.

1466
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:22,572
Say something!

1467
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:26,940
What? You finally come back for all
the problems you created for everyone.

1468
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,803
So you thought you would kill yourself.

1469
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:32,322
And now all you can say
is "I'm sorry"? Is that it?

1470
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:34,442
Well that's not going to cut it anymore.

1471
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:35,954
Who do you think you are, huh?

1472
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,587
You're a loser, a deaf loser.

1473
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,297
You sit there in your own little world

1474
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:42,210
and ignore everyone else around you.

1475
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:44,396
You're the most selfish person I know.

1476
01:42:49,126 --> 01:42:51,112
Hey who the hell are you?

1477
01:42:55,975 --> 01:42:58,147
You must be the little loser's mother!

1478
01:42:58,281 --> 01:43:02,760
If you can't keep your kid in line
then do us all a favor and stop breathing.

1479
01:43:02,785 --> 01:43:04,169
What are you two doing?

1480
01:43:04,898 --> 01:43:06,023
That's enough.

1481
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,615
I said that's enough.

1482
01:43:10,815 --> 01:43:14,763
Stop it. What is wrong with the both of you?

1483
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:28,457
Shoko, are you okay?

1484
01:43:36,427 --> 01:43:37,878
I am sorry.

1485
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:45,216
I am so sorry.

1486
01:43:50,993 --> 01:43:52,967
That's all my fault.

1487
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:06,347
What are you doing?

1488
01:44:07,516 --> 01:44:10,091
I thought if she saw what death looked like,

1489
01:44:10,126 --> 01:44:12,966
she'd stop saying she wanted to kill herself.

1490
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:21,061
I didn't know what else to do...

1491
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:09,684
I can't open it.

1492
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:11,357
Someone is holding it.

1493
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:13,585
Oh I didn't notice you there Shoko.

1494
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:16,876
Are you thirsty? How about I buy you a drink.

1495
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,580
<i>"Hospital rooms
400-417"</i>

1496
01:45:18,624 --> 01:45:21,360
I heard what happened with you and Ya-sho.

1497
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:26,125
<i>"I destroyed what Ishida-kun
created working so hard."</i>

1498
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:28,845
Does this have to do with that stuff on the bridge?

1499
01:45:30,042 --> 01:45:34,290
Ya-sho was kind and open-hearted
enough to accept a guy like me.

1500
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:39,354
For the first time, I know what it
feels like to have a true friend.

1501
01:45:43,733 --> 01:45:46,473
Ya-sho is my best friend in the whole world.

1502
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,993
So I know he'll wake up. He just has to...

1503
01:45:57,031 --> 01:46:00,795
<i>"I want to fix what I destroyed."</i>

1504
01:46:02,446 --> 01:46:03,179
Oh...

1505
01:46:06,207 --> 01:46:09,699
You wanted to die because you were
suffering? What were you thinking!

1506
01:46:09,779 --> 01:46:11,920
Just calm down, everybody is staring.

1507
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:16,464
I don't care about who's listening. I
have to be loud in order for Shoko to hear me.

1508
01:46:20,055 --> 01:46:22,230
We were all so worried about you.

1509
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:26,643
I know life can be hard sometimes.
It's like that for everyone.

1510
01:46:27,273 --> 01:46:33,385
Thing is you have to accept the bad parts of
yourself with the bad and just move forward.

1511
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:39,390
I am really glad you're okay.

1512
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:42,808
<i>"I want to fix what I destroyed."</i>

1513
01:46:42,833 --> 01:46:43,653
I see,

1514
01:46:43,913 --> 01:46:46,219
So you went to see everyone then.

1515
01:46:46,886 --> 01:46:48,085
That's awesome...

1516
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:53,460
But I'm not as brave as you.

1517
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:56,599
Even if Sharia does wake up from his coma.

1518
01:46:56,836 --> 01:47:00,229
I think I'd be too ashamed to face him.

1519
01:47:00,715 --> 01:47:03,497
Because he's right, I haven't changed one bit.

1520
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:06,192
You needed help and I still wasn't there for you.

1521
01:47:06,491 --> 01:47:08,431
I'm the same coward as I've always been.

1522
01:47:09,682 --> 01:47:12,272
You can change from now.

1523
01:47:13,710 --> 01:47:15,510
It is not too late.

1524
01:47:18,771 --> 01:47:21,388
I'm really glad you came to see me, Sho.

1525
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:06,880
Hey, stop it! Cut it out!

1526
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:16,850
<i>"Nishimiya"</i>

1527
01:48:17,807 --> 01:48:19,660
<i>"I found you..."</i>

1528
01:48:20,630 --> 01:48:23,680
<i>"Are you doing well?"</i>

1529
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:25,685
<i>"Somewhat?"</i>

1530
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:28,620
<i>"Strange, isn't it?"</i>

1531
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:30,074
<i>"I think..."</i>

1532
01:48:30,661 --> 01:48:32,600
<i>"I am going to die."</i>

1533
01:48:33,281 --> 01:48:34,241

01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,440

<i>"Nishimiya..."</i>

1537
01:49:44,881 --> 01:49:45,928
No! Shoko!

1538
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,638
What's all this?

1539
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,033
Mom!

1540
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,612
Hello? What's going on?

1541
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,327
Shoko?

1542
01:50:05,106 --> 01:50:06,373
Oh was there?

1543
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:17,983
She is here.

1544
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:23,977
I am so sorry.

1545
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:39,656
Yo!

1546
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:18,211
Aha ha ha.

1547
01:51:22,393 --> 01:51:24,005
Hey! Why are you crying?

1548
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,454
I'm really glad

1549
01:51:35,011 --> 01:51:35,998
you are okay.

1550
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,096
Don't worry, Shoko.

1551
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:44,709
I am fine now. I promise...

1552
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,315
...more or less.

1553
01:51:48,996 --> 01:51:51,901
So stop looking so gloomy, okay?

1554
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:53,753
Oh yeah...

1555
01:51:57,679 --> 01:51:58,872
I want to tell you...

1556
01:52:01,053 --> 01:52:02,326
that I'm really sorry.

1557
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:07,298
I never apologized for all the
stuff I did to you when we were kids...

1558
01:52:08,566 --> 01:52:11,497
...or any of the other stuff afterwards either.

1559
01:52:12,486 --> 01:52:13,598
So I'm sorry...

1560
01:52:15,633 --> 01:52:16,773
But the thing is...

1561
01:52:17,195 --> 01:52:18,900
Even though you were going through a lot...

1562
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:24,449
I was being selfish and focused
on myself more than anything.

1563
01:52:24,713 --> 01:52:27,846
I wanted to have a conversation with you.

1564
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,660
I wasn't trying to hurt you...

1565
01:52:34,215 --> 01:52:35,234
but I must have.

1566
01:52:35,533 --> 01:52:39,147
Because I made you feel so bad about yourself.

1567
01:52:39,695 --> 01:52:42,181
Then you decided to go and do the unthinkable.

1568
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:45,009
No, you are wrong.

1569
01:52:45,034 --> 01:52:46,942
It because I couldn't change.

1570
01:52:47,048 --> 01:52:48,830
And that's why you fell.

1571
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,196
It's me.

1572
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:53,860
Everything is all my fault.

1573
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:58,185
So I thought should I just disappear...

1574
01:52:58,210 --> 01:53:00,187
I am so selfish...

1575
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,940
I am sorry.

1576
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:06,541
Please, that's not true. Don't cry.

1577
01:53:09,799 --> 01:53:13,023
Shoko. Look at me.

1578
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,910
Did you know we were talking a little while ago...

1579
01:53:20,913 --> 01:53:21,963
I was dreaming

1580
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:26,476
and in this dream I was ready
to just give up on everything.

1581
01:53:27,319 --> 01:53:28,279
But I was wrong.

1582
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:34,290
To be honest, I've thought about
ending things just like you did.

1583
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,284
But then, I realized something,

1584
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:41,512
Even though certain things can
make life difficult sometimes.

1585
01:53:42,729 --> 01:53:45,189
that doesn't mean they are worth and dying over.

1586
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:50,154
I want to apologize and make sure I do it right.

1587
01:53:52,582 --> 01:53:53,318
Shoko.

1588
01:53:54,442 --> 01:53:56,367
I need some help from you.

1589
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:01,482
I was hoping

1590
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:03,728
that maybe you could

1591
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,247
teach me how to live.

1592
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:15,979
Please Shoko.

1593
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:38,507
Oh God.

1594
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:42,822
That's the creepiest thing I've ever said in my life.

1595
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:45,712
Oh I'm so sorry... just never mind.

1596
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,534
Forget everything I said okay? I didn't mean it.

1597
01:55:12,088 --> 01:55:14,814
You have arrived at your destination.

1598
01:55:15,361 --> 01:55:19,080
Hey there Maria become quite the
gardener since I've been gone huh?

1599
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:20,433
They're looking good!

1600
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:25,820
Sho-Sho!? You die? You die?

1601
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:28,960
That's right Maria. Oh ur Sho came back from dead.

1602
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,040
Don't listen to grandma, that wasn't really dead.

1603
01:55:31,283 --> 01:55:31,920
Hey look!

1604
01:55:32,118 --> 01:55:33,566
Isn't that Naoka?

1605
01:55:35,077 --> 01:55:38,834
You know she was by your side
the entire time you were in a coma.

1606
01:55:39,164 --> 01:55:40,720
You really should thank her.

1607
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,412
My mom said you came to the hospital...

1608
01:55:45,785 --> 01:55:48,604
Listen I really suck at life sometimes...

1609
01:55:49,146 --> 01:55:51,597
Especially when it comes to stuff like this.

1610
01:55:52,326 --> 01:55:56,171
I just... I just can't bring myself to like Shoko.

1611
01:55:57,133 --> 01:55:58,768
Probably gonna regret this.

1612
01:55:59,381 --> 01:56:01,632
Remember when you fell in the river?

1613
01:56:01,898 --> 01:56:06,818
It was Kazuki and the guys who pulled
you out and he told me not to tell you.

1614
01:56:06,872 --> 01:56:07,497
But...

1615
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:12,425
anyway welcome back.

1616
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,526
Well I'm gonna take off.

1617
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:16,973
Thanks Naoka.

1618
01:56:26,393 --> 01:56:29,310
I don't know, don't you think it's a little short?

1619
01:56:29,335 --> 01:56:31,948
No, no, it looks much cuter like this!

1620
01:56:31,981 --> 01:56:33,407
Oh your home Shoya.

1621
01:56:33,895 --> 01:56:35,295
Oh, hi Shoya.

1622
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:36,513
Mrs Nishimiya.

1623
01:56:38,166 --> 01:56:40,146
Wait a minute. Yes?

1624
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:42,412
I'm really sorry.

1625
01:56:42,626 --> 01:56:44,791
Yeah, me too.

1626
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:47,540
No matter what my son always bounces our right back.

1627
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:50,012
See you later mom I'm heading
out to pick up Maria now.

1628
01:56:50,177 --> 01:56:51,025
Okay!

1629
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:51,851
Who's that?

1630
01:56:51,876 --> 01:56:54,725
He is my son-in-law. He's back from being deployed.

1631
01:56:54,805 --> 01:56:58,211
Oh Shoya, Yuzuru is waiting for you upstairs.

1632
01:56:58,286 --> 01:57:00,011
Give her the Jello that's in the fridge.

1633
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:02,014
Yo.

1634
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:03,048
Wow.

1635
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:05,654
New threads? It looks good on you.

1636
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,247
Check it out. I won.

1637
01:57:07,891 --> 01:57:10,280
Oh wow! No kidding, impressive.

1638
01:57:10,323 --> 01:57:11,860
Now feast your eyes on this.

1639
01:57:11,860 --> 01:57:14,409
Wow... not so impressive.

1640
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:15,702
Since you're alive again,

1641
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:18,310
Will you please help teach me how to study.

1642
01:57:18,399 --> 01:57:19,697
Of course, no problem.

1643
01:57:23,263 --> 01:57:25,823
So uh, you're giving school another shot?

1644
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:29,320
Yeah I decided to take a cue from Shoko.

1645
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:33,260
I figured... at least I could do this try.

1646
01:57:33,708 --> 01:57:35,727
I don't want to let you went down.

1647
01:57:37,862 --> 01:57:40,330
Isn't your big school festival tomorrow?

1648
01:57:40,355 --> 01:57:41,457
Oh yeah, that's right.

1649
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:48,554
<i>"Hello, everyone said they
are going to the school festival</i>

1650
01:57:48,579 --> 01:57:49,687
<i>tomorrow. I will meet you at the
front gate at 10:00, is that OK?"</i>

1651
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,946
Ha, good morning, everybody!

1652
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:55,850
Up top! Yeah! Ha ha ha.

1653
01:57:56,260 --> 01:57:58,756
I said horrible things and I'm sorry.

1654
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:07,786
Okay!

1655
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:09,195
I'm heading out!

1656
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,617
Have a good day, sweetheart!

1657
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:11,303
Oh!

1658
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:14,580
I see now! So that's what you're
supposed to do with those things.

1659
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:15,285
What's that?

1660
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:17,506
Nothing. I'll see you later okay?

1661
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:20,105
Have a good day, Sho-Sho!

1662
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:36,609
There you are!

1663
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:41,399
Okay, let's go.

1664
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,245
Isn't that Shoya?

1665
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:54,080
Who's that?

1666
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:57,234
Wait the one who was in the
hospital right? The guy who jumped?

1667
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,207
Oops...

1668
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,645
You probably didn't know this,

1669
01:59:04,825 --> 01:59:07,365
but I don't really fit in at school.

1670
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:14,684
It's cause I have trouble looking people in the eye.

1671
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:19,359
So it's easier for me to just
stare at the floor all the time.

1672
01:59:22,506 --> 01:59:24,402
You think it's okay to do that?

1673
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,340
Aha Shoko...

1674
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:31,480
I can actually do it without you leading me.

1675
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:32,942
Thank you.

1676
01:59:34,047 --> 01:59:35,479
This is my classroom here.

1677
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:40,463
Has the water boiled guys? It
just was just a few more minutes.

1678
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:43,922
Oh wow, Shoya is back to school.

1679
01:59:43,947 --> 01:59:45,407
Are you okay now?

1680
01:59:47,565 --> 01:59:48,805
You know what?

1681
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:52,262
I think my stomach is acting up a bit.

1682
01:59:54,184 --> 01:59:54,781
Sorry.

1683
01:59:55,174 --> 01:59:56,240
Ya-sho!

1684
01:59:56,589 --> 01:59:57,256
Huh?

1685
02:00:09,450 --> 02:00:10,237
Ya-sho?

1686
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,780
Oh hey, that's Nagatsuka?

1687
02:00:13,887 --> 02:00:15,698
You're feeling okay?

1688
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:19,601
Ya-sho.

1689
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:23,751
Good morning Nagatsuka, good
to see you. So how is everything?

1690
02:00:23,953 --> 02:00:27,148
About that, what's going on? Why won't you look at me.

1691
02:00:27,453 --> 02:00:29,594
I don't know. I just feel weird.

1692
02:00:30,253 --> 02:00:33,682
I made myself a promise I would
look people in the eyes from now on.

1693
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,532
Guess I'm too chicken...

1694
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:37,305
Hey, Ya-sho...!

1695
02:00:37,938 --> 02:00:38,884
Shoya!!

1696
02:00:39,724 --> 02:00:42,348
You are okay, I'my glad.

1697
02:00:43,902 --> 02:00:44,879
Guess if you...

1698
02:00:45,219 --> 02:00:52,343
Cause if you didn't wake up, I don't know what I would
do. You are everything to me. I would've been all alone.

1699
02:00:52,738 --> 02:00:54,962
Listen, the stuff on the bridge,

1700
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,675
don't worry about okay?

1701
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:01,220
Friends say stuff they don't mean to
each other all the time! It doesn't matter.

1702
02:01:01,256 --> 02:01:02,582
I'm begging you...

1703
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:04,820
don't ever leave us again.

1704
02:01:04,845 --> 02:01:05,620
Promise me,

1705
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:07,020
I can't lose you.

1706
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:08,116
It's gonna be okay.

1707
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:12,292
Hey look, I'm sorry.

1708
02:01:13,032 --> 02:01:14,632
I mean,

1709
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:18,025
thank you for being a friend.

1710
02:01:18,506 --> 02:01:19,766
You're very welcome!

1711
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:22,756
But uh what's up with the facial hair?

1712
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:27,477
That's my lucky stash I swore. I
wasn't shaving it till you woke up.

1713
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:29,185
You did that for me...

1714
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:34,488
Huh?

1715
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:36,499
What's going on?

1716
02:01:36,573 --> 02:01:39,396
We heard Nagatsuka-kun's howling
your name so we followed him.

1717
02:01:41,766 --> 02:01:42,591
I see.

1718
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:45,872
Miki did you bring the stuff to give to Shoya?

1719
02:01:47,664 --> 02:01:48,675
I brought them...

1720
02:01:48,822 --> 02:01:51,640
But I can't give it to him. It's a total failure.

1721
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:53,767
Don't be silly, hand him over.

1722
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:00,876
Here...

1723
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:04,392
There's supposed to be a thousand of them,

1724
02:02:04,606 --> 02:02:06,592
but I couldn't finish it fast enough.

1725
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:10,090
Everyone worked really hard. Did their best.

1726
02:02:10,115 --> 02:02:11,671
But we just couldn't...

1727
02:02:11,717 --> 02:02:13,419
No! This is amazing

1728
02:02:13,519 --> 02:02:14,756
It's more than enough.

1729
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:16,993
No one's ever done anything like this for me.

1730
02:02:17,179 --> 02:02:19,053
It really means a lot seriously.

1731
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,984
Thank you Miki.

1732
02:02:21,253 --> 02:02:22,774
And, I am sorry. Also... sorry.

1733
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:24,307
And you too.

1734
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:26,940
No worries, it's all good bro.

1735
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:28,559
Ugh!

1736
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:29,540
Enough!

1737
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:32,540
All these every talk. I'm gonna lose my lunch.

1738
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:35,028
Why do you always have to be like that, Naoka?

1739
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:38,940
What? You got a problem with me
or something? You pick up a fight?

1740
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:41,113
Okay everybody just calm down!

1741
02:02:41,363 --> 02:02:42,957
Oh... Shoya.

1742
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:45,254
Listen I'm really sorry.

1743
02:02:45,665 --> 02:02:48,585
After all you've been through you really needed a friend,

1744
02:02:49,426 --> 02:02:51,303
but all I did was run away.

1745
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:53,499
That's okay.

1746
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:55,680
I did the same thing.

1747
02:02:57,106 --> 02:03:00,190
Stop acting so worried they're just talking things out.

1748
02:03:02,687 --> 02:03:04,122
You apologizing?

1749
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:08,199
Well. Yes that's all you know how to do.

1750
02:03:08,756 --> 02:03:10,824
Mo-ron!

1751
02:03:15,351 --> 02:03:17,031
Mo-ron!

1752
02:03:17,588 --> 02:03:18,722
Moron!

1753
02:03:19,355 --> 02:03:20,015
Eh...

1754
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:27,026
Whatever,

1755
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:28,480
I'm gonna go find somebody.

1756
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,760
Did she just run away?

1757
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:31,290
I think she's embarrassed.

1758
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:35,175
Hey guys,

1759
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:37,439
I have a big favor to ask all of you.

1760
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:39,047
That's okay?

1761
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:43,636
Do you wanna go together to the festival?

1762
02:03:43,863 --> 02:03:44,880
How's that sound?

1763
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:06,200
OMG, this is so good.

1764
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:08,554
Oh, hey! Let's go to the gym next!

1765
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:10,460
How can he come back to school?

1766
02:04:10,460 --> 02:04:12,973
Oh, the story is amazing!
