1
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,174
This story

2
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:01,715
is one that only she and I can tell.

3
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:05,465
It is the story of the secret of this world.

4
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,169
It was just there,

5
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:42,489
like a pool of light.

6
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:47,144
Without even thinking, she ran out of the hospital.

7
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:41,870
Praying with all her heart,

8
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:44,984
she crossed the shrine gate.

9
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,652
Are those fish?

10
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:23,112
Even now, I wonder

11
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,677
if everything I saw that day

12
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,982
was all just a dream.

13
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,841
But I know it wasn't.

14
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,518
On that summer day,

15
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,433
up in that sky,

16
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:40,240
we changed the shape of the world.

17
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,417
Attention, all passengers.

18
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,898
We will be expecting very heavy rain shortly.

19
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:17,160
It's gonna rain again?

20
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:18,900
I thought it was finally clearing up.

21
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:23,118
There was a typhoon on the island, too.

22
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:24,319
It was still fun.

23
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:25,463
Excuse me.

24
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:26,056
Sorry.

25
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,475
We may as well get lunch.

26
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,832
We ask that all passengers

27
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:31,286
who are out on the deck to please go back...

28
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:47,350
Whoa.

29
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,295
So cool.

30
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:10,288
Huh?

31
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:32,804
Thank you.

32
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:38,358
Yeah. That was a pretty intense storm, huh?

33
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:47,043
This is shockingly delicious.

34
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,222
You, uh, want to try, little man?

35
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,415
Nope. I'm not that hungry.

36
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:53,909
Last chance. 'Cause I'll just dig in.

37
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:55,116
Thanks for treating, by the way.

38
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:55,984
Oh, don't mention it.

39
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,977
It's the least I could do since you saved me.

40
00:05:58,002 --> 00:05:59,058
Oh, I did, didn't I?

41
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,602
It was a close one, too, huh?

42
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,627
Oh.

43
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:05,447
Hey, wait a minute.

44
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:06,320
Huh?

45
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:08,075
Yeah.

46
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,944
This is actually the first time I've saved a guy's life.

47
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:12,446
Well done, me.

48
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,408
Oh. Okay.

49
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,290
Come to think of it,

50
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:17,919
I think I deserve a beer.

51
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:19,899
Do you want me to buy you one?

52
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:21,758
That's...

53
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:23,538
so expensive.

54
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,976
I can't believe a grown man is mooching off of me.

55
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,099
Tokyo sure is scary.

56
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,181
Ugh. It's raining again.

57
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:55,292
So, tell me, little man, what brings you to Tokyo?

58
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:58,199
Oh, uh, I'm just here to visit some relatives.

59
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,757
Uh, 'cause, uh, at my school,

60
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:01,456
uh, s-summer break starts early.

61
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,213
I see.

62
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:06,477
Well, if you ever need help, feel free to reach out.

63
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:08,797
See you around, little man.

64
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,562
In the baggage claim area.

65
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,049
Again, thank you for riding the Salvia Maru,

66
00:07:14,074 --> 00:07:15,337
operated by Tokai Kisen...

67
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:16,259
Yeah, right.

68
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:25,728
Huh?

69
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,255
The shower's 280 for 20 minutes max.

70
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,050
Here.

71
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:32,484
That's crazy.

72
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:33,959
It started pouring out of nowhere.

73
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:35,635
You should know better by now.

74
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,499
Not my job to clean up after you.

75
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,725
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:42,527
Last year's record instances

77
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,530
of sudden torrential rain were exceeded this year,

78
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,832
with more frequent occurrences expected in July.

79
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,934
It is advised to take extreme caution...

80
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:50,958
Yes!

81
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:52,816
Not just to the mountains

82
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,947
and beaches, but also throughout the city.

83
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:56,941
In order to prevent accidents

84
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:58,997
and potential disasters, it is imper...

85
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,157
Seriously?!

86
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,790
You sure you're in college?

87
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,443
Let's see your I.D.

88
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:03,959
No I.D.?

89
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,031
How we supposed to hire you?

90
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:06,629
This job some kind of joke to you?

91
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,383
As you can see, sudden downpour...

92
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,424
Huh?

93
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,428
Tokyo sure is scary.

94
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,726
Can't keep spending money like this.

95
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:36,324
You can't sit here. You'll have to move.

96
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,248
Right. Sorry.

97
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:38,360
All you can drink for 18 yen!

98
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,489
Hi there, big guy. Would you like to come inside?

99
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:41,878
Hang on, buddy. Can you spare a minute?

100
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,487
Please beware of solicitors.

101
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,840
You are not obligated to give them any money.

102
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,739
They may or may not be telling the truth.

103
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:52,691
Hey, hang on there.

104
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:54,590
What are you doing out here?

105
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,091
You in high school?

106
00:08:57,697 --> 00:08:58,408
Hey, wait!

107
00:08:58,432 --> 00:08:59,515
Hey, come back here!

108
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:00,769
What the hell?!

109
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:03,984
This has been a public service
announcement from the Shin...

110
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:21,960
Huh.

111
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:24,629
Tokyo sure is scary.

112
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,300
You know what?

113
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:39,043
I just...

114
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:40,598
I don't want to go home.

115
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,026
Not ever.

116
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:46,250
Seriously?

117
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:47,434
Who is this kid?

118
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,252
He sleeping?

119
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:49,595
Out here?

120
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:50,622
Hey, kid.

121
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,268
You can't be out here.

122
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:53,237
Oh, sorry.

123
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:58,954
God, is he okay?

124
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:00,136
Ah, he's fine.

125
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,627
So, you would make way more with us.

126
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:03,587
Pardon me.

127
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,632
Gross.

128
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:26,105
It's got to be a toy.

129
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:28,529
Uh, s-sorry. Wh-What... what's this?

130
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,979
It's for you, but don't tell.

131
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,453
Uh, but wh-what for?

132
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:34,105
Take it, unless you want to have chowder for dinner again.

133
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:49,120
I think that was the most delicious
dinner I've had in all 16 years of my life.

134
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:04,258
Hey, so when can I see you again?

135
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:06,498
Uh, how about the day after tomorrow?

136
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:08,928
Great. I discovered this cute new café.

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,190
I'll book us a table.

138
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:12,878
Bye, Nagi. See you then.

139
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,282
See you then, Ayane.

140
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:16,721
They're in elementary school?

141
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:21,363
Nice!

142
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,221
I was hoping I'd see you.

143
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:24,694
Hi there, Kana.

144
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:25,636
Hello, Nagi.

145
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,391
What a player.

146
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,612
Oh, did you curl it?

147
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:29,881
Do you like it like this?

148
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,604
I do. It's super cute.

149
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,225
Tokyo sure is amazing.

150
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:41,398
This should be it.

151
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,794
Yeah?

152
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:54,091
Hmm?

153
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,500
It's not working. Ugh.

154
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:03,887
Excuse me.

155
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:05,595
I called earlier.

156
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,381
Hello? Is anybody here?

157
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,150
Mr. Suga...?

158
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:18,314
Mr. Suga?

159
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,899
No, I shouldn't be doing this.

160
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,352
Mm. Hello.

161
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:32,727
I-I'm so sorry.

162
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:34,562
Oh, you're the new assistant.

163
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,993
Kei told me about you.

164
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,400
What? No, I haven't...

165
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,402
I'm Natsumi. Welcome.

166
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:39,791
Huh?

167
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:43,501
Finally, he's found someone to do all my grunt work.

168
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,898
So, uh, kid...

169
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:51,931
Uh, yeah?

170
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:54,693
I saw you checking out my boobs.

171
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:55,776
No, I wasn't.

172
00:13:57,817 --> 00:13:59,438
Okay, kid, what's your name?

173
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,900
Hodaka Morishima.

174
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:03,220
Hodaka, huh? That's interesting.

175
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,590
Are you one of Mr. Suga's employees?

176
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:07,945
Oh, so you want to know the truth about us?

177
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,484
Yeah.

178
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,024
Hilarious.

179
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:13,558
I know what you're thinking, and you're right.

180
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:16,560
I don't believe it.

181
00:14:17,284 --> 00:14:19,048
I've never met a mistress before.

182
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,073
Huh.

183
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:23,950
Long time, no see, little man.

184
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:25,028
Did you lose weight?

185
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:25,547
For me?

186
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:29,695
Let me guess... This from playing pachinko?

187
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,286
So, little man,

188
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:35,288
you came for a job... am I right?

189
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:38,650
This is basically what we do here.

190
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:42,447
We write articles for time-honored, prestigious magazines.

191
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,388
We're doing a piece on urban legends.

192
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:50,686
All you got to do is talk to a
few people who have witnessed some.

193
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:51,780
It'll be a piece of cake.

194
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:52,750
Huh? I'm not...

195
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,292
It can be on anything.

196
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:57,223
Doomsday predictions, abductions, you know.

197
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,622
Whatever you kids are into these days.

198
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:01,013
Here. I got one.

199
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:04,468
"The girl who brings sunshine wherever she goes."

200
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:05,348
S-Sunshine girl?

201
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,472
Bring that sunshine!

202
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:08,639
Yeah, it's been raining so damn much this year.

203
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:10,185
She's got to be in demand.

204
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:10,946
Right?

205
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:12,287
Okay.

206
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:14,712
Come on, little man. Where's your hustle?

207
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:16,767
She's already got a thing set up.

208
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,448
Tag along. Take notes.

209
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:18,909
Huh?

210
00:15:19,013 --> 00:15:20,434
Wait, what? Like, like, now?

211
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:22,099
Oh, it'll be like an audition!

212
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:22,746
A what?

213
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,555
I don't think that's a good idea.

214
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:27,883
Of course.

215
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:29,867
Sunshine girls do exist.

216
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:30,638
I knew it!

217
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,254
But rain girls exist as well.

218
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:36,663
The former are protected by a fox spirit,

219
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:39,340
and the latter are protected by a dragon god.

220
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,036
Uh, what?

221
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:44,504
Those who are protected by the
dragon god tend to drink a lot.

222
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:46,095
They yearn for water.

223
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,480
They're strong-willed and competitive,
though careless and unreliable.

224
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,415
That kind of sounds like me.

225
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,730
Those protected by the fox spirit are hardworking

226
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,487
but too timid to be leaders.

227
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,593
Though many of them are quite beautiful.

228
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,539
That's totally me.

229
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:03,260
The four spirits of weather are off-balance, so
more sunshine and rain girls are born these days.

230
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,613
It's the homeostasis of Gaia theory.

231
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:06,703
That's how it works.

232
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:08,602
But one must be careful.

233
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:12,765
Whenever we mess with nature, we will always pay a price.

234
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:15,697
And they say whoever uses too much weather power

235
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:17,223
will get spirited away.

236
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:17,779
I see.

237
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:18,445
Huh?

238
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,735
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

239
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:23,100
So...

240
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,404
how did it go?

241
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:30,895
The so-called psychic went on about mystical
stuff that came straight out of a fantasy novel.

242
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,056
Weather power making you disappear.

243
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:34,423
Yeah, sure. Typical.

244
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,830
Weather isn't controlled by girls with powers.

245
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,451
It's a natural phenomenon
having to do with pressure fronts.

246
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:43,764
I know that, but we're not doing a research
paper. We're just providing some entertainment.

247
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,346
Is this all you've written so far?

248
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,417
Damn, you're slow.

249
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:48,272
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,663
Well, at least your writing style's not too bad.

251
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:53,634
All right, fine, you're hired.

252
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:55,746
Huh? Hold on a minute. I wasn't looking...

253
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:58,019
We need you on-site, so your room's included.

254
00:16:58,725 --> 00:16:59,418
Meals, too.

255
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:00,428
Really?

256
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:01,897
Yes. I'll take it.

257
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:03,120
That's more like it.

258
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,200
Now, what's your name again?

259
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,249
Hilarious.

260
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:07,541
It's Hodaka.

261
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:08,270
Oh, yeah, that's right.

262
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:09,475
Dinner's ready.

263
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:10,437
Here.

264
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:11,334
Hmm?

265
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:14,060
I'm underage, r-remember?

266
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:16,890
Now, here's to our new hire,

267
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,185
Hodaka.

268
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,456
Bottoms up.

269
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22,640
Slow down, Hodaka.

270
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:28,328
It was the first meal I had shared
with anyone since I came to Tokyo.

271
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,300
And that is how my new life began.

272
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:08,284
The place was a small publishing
company run by Mr. Suga and Miss Natsumi...

273
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:08,759
Hey, guys.

274
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:09,431
Good morning to you.

275
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,336
Where I pretty much did all the chores.

276
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,756
Starting with Mr. Suga's personal care,

277
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:18,687
to answering the phone, filing
receipts, transcribing interviews.

278
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:21,921
Is this seriously all you've written?

279
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,407
This isn't mine.

280
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,067
Sorry, but Mr. Suga's out right now.

281
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,010
Sometimes, I got to ride around town with
Miss Natsumi to assist with the interviews.

282
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:51,413
They're looking for a real-life sunshine girl.

283
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:52,947
That's so hilarious.

284
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:55,435
My little sister's friend's a real sunshine girl.

285
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,921
People will call her up right before they go on a date.

286
00:18:57,946 --> 00:18:59,995
We really don't do those kind of interviews.

287
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,969
After that, the balloon's particle
imager picked up something really strange.

288
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,351
A swarm of moving objects from among the cumulonimbi.

289
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:09,958
Is this seriously all you've managed to write?

290
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,863
You should wait for these to go on sale.

291
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,492
Mr. Suga's out right now.

292
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,696
This paragraph's crap.

293
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,131
But this one here's not too bad.

294
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:16,594
Oh.

295
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,352
Come on, Mr. Suga. We got to go.

296
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,391
Wake up.

297
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:29,534
My days were, well, hectic.

298
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:31,299
But for the first time in my life,

299
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,102
someone counted on me, and it was nice.

300
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:37,772
Those rainy days in Tokyo seemed to just fly by.

301
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,331
Rain. Rain.

302
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,532
Rain. Rain.

303
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:02,241
There you are.

304
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:03,801
Hey there, Rain.

305
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:04,834
Are you good?

306
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:07,597
Is that so? Here.

307
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:12,541
Don't you worry your pretty head.

308
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,112
I'm telling you, it's an easy job.

309
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:14,939
We'll see.

310
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,649
Just try it and see how you like it.

311
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:20,618
You'll get paid immediately after.

312
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:22,462
Our club's right over there.

313
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,202
I know her.

314
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,870
You might as well give it a go
and earn some quick cash, huh?

315
00:20:36,896 --> 00:20:38,883
It's just right through that door, okay?

316
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:39,963
Come on, let's go.

317
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:43,449
But...

318
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:53,517
Hey!

319
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:55,477
Let's go!

320
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:58,934
What? No, no, no, no.

321
00:20:58,959 --> 00:20:59,896
Where are they going?

322
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,631
Hey! Wait, please!

323
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:08,792
Just keep running!

324
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:09,804
No, wait!

325
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,977
Punk!

326
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,340
Hey. Where you think you're going, buddy?

327
00:21:20,784 --> 00:21:22,985
What in the hell do you think you're doing?!

328
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:25,540
You were about to force her t-to... to...

329
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:25,839
Huh?

330
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:27,363
What are you, dumb?

331
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:30,604
Hate to break it to you, but she and I made a deal.

332
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,193
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

333
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:36,649
Wait a second. You look familiar.

334
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:39,373
You were squatting in front of our club.

335
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:42,298
What is this, some kind of payback?

336
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:44,491
Please, stop hitting him.

337
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:46,719
I said stop!

338
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:47,644
Damn you!

339
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:49,114
Get off me!

340
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:54,421
What do you got there? A toy?

341
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,870
You really are dumb.

342
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,841
Get up.

343
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:24,780
Come on!

344
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,353
Hey!

345
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,196
What'd you do that for?

346
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:52,064
Paying me back for the burger?

347
00:22:52,318 --> 00:22:52,825
Huh?

348
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:54,382
Who are you?

349
00:22:54,638 --> 00:22:55,965
And where'd you get that gun?

350
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:57,219
That was just...

351
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,128
I-I found it. I-I thought it was a
toy, and it brought me luck, so I kept it.

352
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,714
That's your reason?

353
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,626
How could you point it at someone?

354
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,362
You could have killed him!

355
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:10,551
Seriously, who does that?

356
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,630
It's messed up.

357
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:47,353
So, uh...

358
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:49,997
I ended up getting fired.

359
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:51,576
'Cause of me?

360
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:54,208
It didn't have anything to do with the burger.

361
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:57,393
Since I got fired, I needed the money,

362
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,324
so, um...

363
00:23:59,435 --> 00:24:01,405
I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't have...

364
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:10,359
Hey. Does it hurt?

365
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:11,488
No, not really.

366
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:14,952
Let me guess... You ran away from home?

367
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:15,564
Huh?

368
00:24:15,818 --> 00:24:17,209
It's pretty obvious.

369
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:20,657
Too bad you can't enjoy Tokyo with all this rain.

370
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,435
Uh, yeah.

371
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:24,037
Come with me.

372
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:24,445
Uh...

373
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,290
Whoa.

374
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:44,389
Watch.

375
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:45,693
It's gonna clear up.

376
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:46,470
Huh?

377
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:01,335
Hey. What do you mean by...

378
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:14,048
What?

379
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,568
You're a sunshine girl.

380
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:22,019
My name's Hina.

381
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,018
And you?

382
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:23,937
Hodaka.

383
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:24,456
How old?

384
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:25,789
Uh, 16.

385
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:27,291
Mm...

386
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,735
You're younger than me.

387
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:29,111
Huh?

388
00:25:29,158 --> 00:25:31,306
I'll be 18 in, uh...

389
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,871
approximately a month.

390
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:34,450
You-you look younger.

391
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,152
So you should treat me with respect.

392
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:37,644
What?

393
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:40,662
Mm...

394
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:45,899
Nice to meet you, Hodaka.

395
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:32,709
Huh?

396
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:38,749
Mommy, I saw a fish.

397
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,688
Oh, yeah? That's nice.

398
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:43,301
You better not be making this up.

399
00:26:43,714 --> 00:26:46,255
I'm dead serious. Come on, this way.

400
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:51,587
Look. It's over there.

401
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:53,827
What am I looking at?

402
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:54,988
It's right over there.

403
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:56,418
Just trust me, will you?

404
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:02,294
Huh?

405
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:03,226
Mm.

406
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,806
What the heck is that?

407
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,012
And in our storm watch series,

408
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:33,512
the Kanto region is experiencing a
record-breaking amount of rainfall this summer.

409
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:36,981
It has been raining continuously
for more than two months now.

410
00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:41,663
And our 30-day forecast predicts more
heavy rain for at least another month.

411
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:47,344
The Meteorological Agency is calling for strict
alerts on landslides and other related disasters,

412
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:50,920
as these are extremely unusual
weather patterns for this season.

413
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:52,200
Is that too expensive?

414
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:55,072
Oh, my God. Come look at this.

415
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:56,593
Huh?

416
00:27:56,618 --> 00:27:58,204
It's amazing.

417
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,216
It's so weird.

418
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,082
Hmm.

419
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:07,705
I mean, they do kind of look like fish.

420
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:10,253
Except these things come from the sky,

421
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:13,005
and it's not like they leave behind evidence.

422
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,359
I know. They just instantly disappear. Look.

423
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,139
Huh?

424
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:22,444
And remember what that guy we interviewed said?

425
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:25,423
The sky's a more vast unknown world than even the sea.

426
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:30,841
A cumulonimbus can hold as much water as
an entire lake. Which means it's possible

427
00:28:30,866 --> 00:28:33,399
that it could hold a whole unknown ecosystem.

428
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:34,696
Something like...

429
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:35,858
like these fish.

430
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:36,640
Yeah, totally.

431
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:37,952
That's so cool!

432
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:39,749
If we write about it...

433
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:42,505
oh, maybe we can make good money from it.

434
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,592
Huh? What's...

435
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:44,183
Huh?

436
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:46,647
- Oh, come on. You're starting to sound like Kei.

437
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:48,949
You don't want to wind up a boring grown-up.

438
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:51,713
Careful, or that sunshine girl is gonna lose interest.

439
00:28:51,852 --> 00:28:53,028
You two are going on a date, right?

440
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:54,568
It's not a date. I'm just confirming if...

441
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:56,514
Well, I got a job interview, so...

442
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:58,841
What? Don't you work here?

443
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,344
This is just a temporary thing.

444
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,954
I told you guys, it's not a date.

445
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:12,149
I understand how you feel, Keisuke.

446
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:16,549
But we've finally gotten to the point
where she isn't asking about you constantly.

447
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:20,522
It would be too cruel to her to
allow you to meet with her now.

448
00:29:20,547 --> 00:29:23,126
That's not... It's well within my rights to see her.

449
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,758
Well, let me ask... You still smoke, right?

450
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,535
Huh?

451
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,689
She has asthma.

452
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:30,072
You know that.

453
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:32,102
Selfish, don't you think?

454
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:34,404
Actually, not anymore.

455
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:35,901
I've already quit.

456
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:36,818
Perhaps.

457
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:39,820
Still, that doesn't address your lifestyle.

458
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:40,717
Huh?

459
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:51,888
Besides, with all this rain now,

460
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,715
she can't play outside.

461
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,526
It would be bad for her asthma.

462
00:29:56,854 --> 00:29:59,030
I feel sorry for children nowadays.

463
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:02,755
We used to have such beautiful springs and summers.

464
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:17,914
They can't go on living there unsupervised like that.

465
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:20,093
I completely agree.

466
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:27,245
Wait a minute.

467
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:29,810
Could this possibly be...

468
00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:34,210
the first time I'm visiting...

469
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:36,068
a girl's home?

470
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:39,765
Welcome to my place.

471
00:30:39,877 --> 00:30:40,693
Was it hard to find?

472
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:42,139
Uh, I just stopped to, uh...

473
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:43,452
It's-it's not much. Here.

474
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:45,547
That was very sweet of you.

475
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,858
Welcome.

476
00:30:47,923 --> 00:30:48,431
Thanks.

477
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:49,550
Sure thing.

478
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:55,854
Hodaka, have you had lunch yet?

479
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:56,966
No, not yet.

480
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,776
But you don't have to.

481
00:30:58,801 --> 00:30:59,154
Uh...

482
00:30:59,178 --> 00:31:00,390
You just sit right there.

483
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,217
Hey, mind if I use these?

484
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:03,219
Yeah. No, sure.

485
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:04,380
Thanks.

486
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:19,783
So, do you live all by yourself here, Hina?

487
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:22,905
With my younger brother, due to some circumstances.

488
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,579
Circumstances?

489
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,670
How about you? Why did you run away?

490
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:32,176
Truth is everything was suffocating.

491
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,274
That town, my parents.

492
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:36,126
I see.

493
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,580
You should go back, don't you think?

494
00:31:48,177 --> 00:31:49,647
No, I don't want to.

495
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:51,212
I see.

496
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,242
Here you go. Lunch is served.

497
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:56,575
Whoa.

498
00:31:57,387 --> 00:32:00,071
I forgot the spring onions. Where'd I put them?

499
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:05,163
So, how do you feel now, living in Tokyo?

500
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,594
Huh? Uh...

501
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:09,955
I don't feel like I'm suffocating anymore.

502
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,128
Well, that's great, right?

503
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:13,903
Bon appétit.

504
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,785
Mmm!

505
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:25,526
Wh-What's that? An earthquake?

506
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:26,753
No. No.

507
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:28,768
It's just the train.

508
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:32,708
Hodaka,

509
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:33,727
are you serious?

510
00:32:33,957 --> 00:32:34,766
Why not?

511
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:36,730
I mean, you're a real sunshine girl, right?

512
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:37,317
Mm-hmm.

513
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:39,756
You can clear up the sky simply by praying.

514
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:40,500
I guess.

515
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:41,679
Then why not?

516
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:43,173
You said you needed a job, right?

517
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,262
I really do. But I feel weird charging.

518
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:51,142
Well, would you rather go back to that club? 'Cause
I don't think you're cut out for that kind of work.

519
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:53,206
Hodaka.

520
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:54,863
What are you looking at?

521
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:56,400
I'm not looking at anything!

522
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:57,711
Sorry.

523
00:32:58,817 --> 00:33:01,160
Isn't 5,000 yen too expensive?

524
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,661
Okay. Uh, how about 3,000?

525
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:07,395
Hmm, but in order to cover my living expenses...

526
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:09,326
We should have some artwork.

527
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:10,701
Oh, I can draw something.

528
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,601
What is that?

529
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:14,008
A hippo?

530
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,191
It's a frog.

531
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:17,200
S-Seriously?

532
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,545
It's done!

533
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,959
All right, I'm uploading.

534
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:21,901
Everything look good?

535
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:22,500
Yeah.

536
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:24,558
I'm home.

537
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:27,108
Hey, the sardines were on sale, so I...

538
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:28,029
Oh.

539
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:29,672
Who are you?

540
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,924
Uh, y-you're that kid!

541
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,432
From the back of the bus.

542
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:33,850
Huh?

543
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:35,234
You guys know each other?

544
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,152
Hodaka, this is my brother Nagi.

545
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,782
Nagi, this is Hodaka,

546
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,985
my brand-new business partner.

547
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:41,464
Huh?

548
00:33:42,173 --> 00:33:44,065
Whoa! We've got a response already!

549
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:45,900
What? You actually uploaded it?

550
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:48,948
And they say that... that they
want good weather for a flea market.

551
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:50,482
Uh, and it's tomorrow!

552
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:51,579
Hang on a minute.

553
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:53,462
Am I really going to do this?

554
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:54,933
And tomorrow, it looks like more rain.

555
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,245
And it's gonna rain!

556
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,052
Yeah, but isn't that, like, the whole point?

557
00:33:58,076 --> 00:33:58,626
What do I do?

558
00:33:58,651 --> 00:33:59,705
Ugh, who is this guy?

559
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:00,318
What do I do?

560
00:34:00,343 --> 00:34:01,390
It will be fine.

561
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,797
I'll be there to help you.

562
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:03,743
How?!

563
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:09,590
Here. I brought you this.

564
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,428
Thanks, but no.

565
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:18,216
Uh, th-that's okay.

566
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:19,624
I have another secret weapon.

567
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:29,286
Sorry, but no.

568
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:31,581
I told you, Hodaka!

569
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:35,013
Who called these guys again?

570
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:36,976
What a bunch of weirdos.

571
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:39,780
Uh, we figured it couldn't hurt.

572
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:46,159
Don't worry about it, kids.

573
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,568
I don't think it's working.

574
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:49,880
We can do this. We're-we're almost there.

575
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:51,254
Do you... do you need some water, Hina?

576
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,034
Uh, how about some candy?

577
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:55,168
Just tell 'em to go home.

578
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:56,121
Okay.

579
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:56,893
The sky!

580
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,904
Huh?

581
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:13,713
It's been forever since I've seen the sun.

582
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:16,971
It's so pretty.

583
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:18,568
Huh. Will you look at that?

584
00:35:18,593 --> 00:35:19,769
How'd I do?

585
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,492
That was truly amazing.

586
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:22,995
You are a sunshine girl.

587
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:24,865
I can't believe that actually worked.

588
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,801
You kids did great, even if it was a coincidence.

589
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:28,977
It wasn't!

590
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,232
How does 20,000 yen sound?

591
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:32,111
It's too much.

592
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:33,124
It's a bonus.

593
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:34,664
For a job well done.

594
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,332
Thanks again.

595
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,963
People will come out now, and we'll
be... we'll be able to sell more.

596
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:50,047
Yeah!

597
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:50,799
That was amazing, sis!

598
00:35:50,823 --> 00:35:51,143
All right!

599
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,609
I can totally do this!

600
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:53,088
Yeah!

601
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:54,876
Let's make some money off of the weather!

602
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:55,206
Yes!

603
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,870
Yeah!

604
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,902
The human mind works in mysterious ways.

605
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:54,510
Sometimes, you just need to see the sun
shining in the morning to feel energized.

606
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,618
A blue sky can make you feel happy that you're alive.

607
00:36:58,127 --> 00:37:02,003
It makes you feel more in love with
that someone special by your side.

608
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:06,256
This is a once-in-a-lifetime event,
and it better be under a blue sky.

609
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,009
The meteor will be passing Earth tonight.

610
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:10,450
He can't run well in the rain, so he's losing.

611
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:13,568
I've been working so many hours, saving up just for today.

612
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:15,206
We want to play outside.

613
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:20,085
Everyone had their own reason to want a
little sunshine in the constantly rainy Tokyo.

614
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:24,274
Hina was only able to clear up small
areas and only for a brief amount of time.

615
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,675
But it didn't matter.

616
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:28,039
The sky would always answer her prayers.

617
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:32,058
She was 100% a real-life sunshine girl!

618
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:50,451
It was like the whole city was
putting its best foot forward.

619
00:37:51,824 --> 00:37:53,396
It made me think...

620
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:56,749
what a wonderful world I was born into.

621
00:37:56,947 --> 00:37:58,875
Here we go. Big smiles.

622
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,877
That's it! Go, go!

623
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:02,879
Look, there's another one.

624
00:38:07,263 --> 00:38:08,126
Thank you.

625
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:09,192
Thanks a lot.

626
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:10,239
Thanks.

627
00:38:10,263 --> 00:38:11,274
Thanks, guys.

628
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:12,010
Thank you.

629
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:13,698
Thank you so very much.

630
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:17,384
It's amazing how a simple thing
like the weather can affect our moods.

631
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:22,278
That was when I realized for the first time just
how much the human heart is connected to the sky.

632
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:28,430
All right, I'm off.

633
00:38:30,463 --> 00:38:31,336
Huh?

634
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,044
To where?

635
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,578
Ugh. Five more minutes.

636
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,827
Five more minutes... That's all I'm waiting.

637
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,601
Is it canceled 'cause of the rain?

638
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,797
When was it actually supposed to start?

639
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:44,855
And I got all dressed up.

640
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:46,678
There's no way it's happening.

641
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:48,791
It's too crowded here anyway.

642
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:52,462
I read online that your sunshine girl is amazing.

643
00:38:52,507 --> 00:38:53,816
100% success rate.

644
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,971
Uh, yeah.

645
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:59,736
It's true, but d-do you really want to
rely on just that for such a huge event?

646
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,828
Well, it's supposed to rain all week
long, so I can't exactly postpone it.

647
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,886
I would say we're in a unique situation.

648
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,307
The door is opening.

649
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:08,634
May as well rely on luck.

650
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:09,364
Uh...

651
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,575
Huh?

652
00:39:55,892 --> 00:40:00,801
The Jingu Gaien fireworks will start
promptly at 7:00 p.m. as scheduled.

653
00:40:38,826 --> 00:40:41,009
I think that I'm in love.

654
00:40:41,057 --> 00:40:41,440
Huh?

655
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:44,378
This job, the sunshine girl.

656
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:47,714
It's like, for the first time in my life,

657
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,111
I've found a purpose.

658
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,901
And you know what?

659
00:40:51,497 --> 00:40:54,612
That's not not not such a bad thing.

660
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,253
Wait. How-how many "nots" is...

661
00:40:57,432 --> 00:40:58,832
Is it bad or not?

662
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,110
Lighten up a little.

663
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:05,576
And so, thank you, Hodaka.

664
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:13,330
Weather is such a mystery.

665
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:17,937
Seeing a beautiful sky can really make you feel things.

666
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:19,749
Just like Hina.

667
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:24,000
She really makes me feel things.

668
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:46,351
Yesterday's Jingu Gaien fireworks were
blessed with sudden miraculous clear skies.

669
00:41:46,597 --> 00:41:50,244
But as if to make up for it, the rain
is back again today with a vengeance.

670
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:53,189
The temperature in central Tokyo is now at 70 degrees,

671
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:55,369
much lower than average for this time of year,

672
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,847
making it an unusually chilly August.

673
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,310
Make sure to bring a light jacket when going out.

674
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:01,771
You're my first choice, of course.

675
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:03,169
You're my first choice, of course.

676
00:42:03,194 --> 00:42:04,734
You're my first choice, of course.

677
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:05,984
You're my first choice, of course!

678
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,591
Getting a flu shot may not be a bad idea.

679
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:13,116
In other news, the record rainfall and
low temperatures are driving food prices up.

680
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,834
A head of lettuce will cost you three
times more than this time last year.

681
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,036
This abnormal cold snap is affecting agriculture.

682
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,130
Oh, that submission?

683
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:25,741
Yes, we received it.

684
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,500
Look, I'm sorry, but we decided to pass.

685
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:31,717
I see. Thank you, and, uh...

686
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:34,911
we have other pieces in the
works for, you know, next time.

687
00:42:42,784 --> 00:42:43,499
Hmm.

688
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:46,493
Yeah, what?

689
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,911
Hello. Mamiya residence.

690
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:03,553
Hi. It's Keisuke.

691
00:43:04,032 --> 00:43:07,977
I'm sorry to bother you, but it's regarding my visit.

692
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:10,446
You're late again, Kei.

693
00:43:10,471 --> 00:43:11,965
And this is an important interview.

694
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:14,372
Bad mood?

695
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,208
Did you get rejected? Meow.

696
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,293
Where's the kid?

697
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,492
What do you mean, busy with his other job?

698
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:23,176
No wonder he's been slacking.

699
00:43:23,486 --> 00:43:24,800
Just leave him alone.

700
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:26,235
It's not like we're busy.

701
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,410
He took in a stray cat without asking.

702
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:29,626
Like you took him in?

703
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:30,609
Huh?

704
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,415
I know why you did it.

705
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,815
He reminds you of yourself.

706
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:38,867
Plus, how much could it be costing
you to pay the kid each month?

707
00:43:39,814 --> 00:43:41,178
What, 30,000 yen?

708
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,164
Cheapo.

709
00:43:42,276 --> 00:43:44,181
Actually, 3,000.

710
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:47,946
Uh... what?! Are you serious?! That's slave labor!

711
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:49,503
Is that even legal?

712
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:52,848
You're gonna get sued by the Department
of Labor. Young people love suing.

713
00:43:52,872 --> 00:43:55,171
You know what? Actually, I-I
think I'm gonna report you myself.

714
00:43:55,314 --> 00:43:56,959
One, he gets to live with us for free.

715
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:59,667
Two, we pay for his food and his phone bill.

716
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,153
It's a sweet deal.

717
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:02,488
Oh, God.

718
00:44:04,236 --> 00:44:06,214
Well, no wonder he got another job.

719
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:09,797
That's incredible.

720
00:44:09,822 --> 00:44:11,368
It really cleared up.

721
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,365
You kids are amazing.

722
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:16,390
It's a shame you're planning to quit.

723
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,490
Since she was caught on camera,
we've been flooded with requests.

724
00:44:20,935 --> 00:44:22,331
We can't handle them all.

725
00:44:22,904 --> 00:44:26,758
We have one more scheduled, so we'll
do that, and then we'll stop for a while.

726
00:44:27,718 --> 00:44:28,799
And besides...

727
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,817
All right, good job, sis.

728
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,114
Hey, Grandma. I see you got people over.

729
00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:35,672
I wasn't expecting you.

730
00:44:35,697 --> 00:44:37,350
Just stopped by to see if you needed help.

731
00:44:37,905 --> 00:44:39,717
You've got some really young guests.

732
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:41,306
Are you friends of Grandma's?

733
00:44:41,441 --> 00:44:42,244
Hello.

734
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,254
I wanted nice weather for Grandpa's Hatsubon.

735
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:46,676
Ah. Nice.

736
00:44:46,747 --> 00:44:48,535
Well, it did stop raining.

737
00:44:55,942 --> 00:44:59,333
It'd be hard for him to come back
with all the rain we've been having.

738
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,815
"Come back"?

739
00:45:00,977 --> 00:45:02,003
The Obon,

740
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:04,917
the day the dead come back from the sky to visit.

741
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:06,736
His first Obon?

742
00:45:06,863 --> 00:45:09,248
So, then your grandpa died about a year ago?

743
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:10,375
That's right.

744
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:13,201
Yeah, same goes for my mom, too.

745
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:17,764
Oh, did you lose your mother this past year, sweetie?

746
00:45:17,844 --> 00:45:19,012
Uh, yes.

747
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:22,561
Then let's light a welcoming fire for her as well.

748
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,645
I know she's watching over you.

749
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:26,224
Thanks.

750
00:45:30,912 --> 00:45:34,454
The spirits follow the smoke,
and that's how they come back.

751
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:36,615
Back from where?

752
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:37,982
From Heaven.

753
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:42,399
There's always been another world up there in the sky.

754
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:51,879
This painting is apparently
of what the Weather Maiden saw.

755
00:45:52,379 --> 00:45:54,731
It sure is mysterious.

756
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:57,051
I mean, there's a flying fish and a dragon?

757
00:45:57,076 --> 00:45:58,601
Absolutely stunning.

758
00:45:58,704 --> 00:46:00,189
Isn't it, though?

759
00:46:00,428 --> 00:46:02,558
So, this Weather Maiden, what is she?

760
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:04,314
Like a shaman or what?

761
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:05,610
Huh? What?

762
00:46:05,649 --> 00:46:06,673
Oh, he...

763
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:08,866
Is the Weather Maiden like a shaman?

764
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,963
Uh-huh.

765
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:16,246
Mending the ailing weather is
the charge of the Weather Maiden.

766
00:46:16,746 --> 00:46:18,385
So, is it like her job?

767
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:19,425
Sounds like a scam.

768
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,062
Does that mean she could fix
the abnormal weather we're having?

769
00:46:23,177 --> 00:46:26,630
Huh? There's nothing abnormal about the rain.

770
00:46:26,947 --> 00:46:29,754
The news makes a big deal about everything.

771
00:46:29,952 --> 00:46:32,390
They always say things like "record-breaking,"

772
00:46:32,906 --> 00:46:35,202
but when did their records start?

773
00:46:35,353 --> 00:46:37,061
100 years ago?

774
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:39,859
How old do you think this painting is?

775
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:41,982
800 years old, at least.

776
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,037
800?

777
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:46,279
Hey, you're getting yourself all worked up.

778
00:46:46,342 --> 00:46:48,758
Oh, oh, is he...?

779
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,778
My point is the weather can suddenly change on a whim,

780
00:46:52,905 --> 00:46:55,200
regardless of our human needs.

781
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:58,919
So we cannot tell what is normal and what is not.

782
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:03,027
We merely have been allowed to stay in this shifting space

783
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:06,563
between the heavens and earth, clinging for our lives,

784
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:09,779
trying our best not to be shaken off.

785
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:14,362
This is something we humans were
much more aware of in the past.

786
00:47:14,824 --> 00:47:20,112
However, there's a thin thread
binding us humans to the sky.

787
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:23,745
And that is the Weather Maiden.

788
00:47:24,348 --> 00:47:28,878
A special girl with the ability
to gather the people's wishes

789
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:31,541
and deliver them to the heavens.

790
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:37,610
In ancient times, there was one
in every village in every country.

791
00:47:37,658 --> 00:47:39,325
Hey, Kei. Sound like anyone you know?

792
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:43,282
You know, you don't have to
listen to everything Grandpa says.

793
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:45,284
No one actually believes in that stuff.

794
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:47,540
No, no, I love it.

795
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:49,680
We're grateful for all of your insight.

796
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:51,404
Just remember, though,

797
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,723
everything comes with a price.

798
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:57,211
This is no exception.

799
00:47:57,409 --> 00:48:00,443
A tragic fate awaits the Weather Maiden.

800
00:48:03,344 --> 00:48:05,767
One, two, three.

801
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,975
All right, it's your turn, sis.

802
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:10,493
One, two, three.

803
00:48:10,692 --> 00:48:12,345
Thanks for keeping Grandma company.

804
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,542
- It's really kind of you.

805
00:48:13,569 --> 00:48:15,969
Oh, we're actually here 'cause she hired us.

806
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,494
You have to. Come on.

807
00:48:17,779 --> 00:48:19,535
Well, they're having fun.

808
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:21,625
How old are you guys, anyway?

809
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:24,515
Oh. I'm 16, but she's actual...

810
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,735
She mentioned that she was turning 18 next week.

811
00:48:29,092 --> 00:48:30,514
18, huh?

812
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:32,049
Have you thought about what to get her?

813
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:35,703
Hey, you guys, I brought out some watermelon.

814
00:48:35,758 --> 00:48:37,324
Oh, nice. Thanks a lot.

815
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,128
Okay.

816
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,157
Hey, wait. I said wait!

817
00:48:53,158 --> 00:48:54,453
Just great.

818
00:48:59,014 --> 00:49:00,976
Ah, what the hell?

819
00:49:03,216 --> 00:49:04,662
I said wait!

820
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:21,052
Whoa, guys. You got to cut me some slack.

821
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,355
I didn't know she was a minor. I swear.

822
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:27,629
Huh? Wait, so this isn't about the girl?

823
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,302
That's what we've been trying to tell you.

824
00:49:30,098 --> 00:49:32,012
You made us run for nothing.

825
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,907
This is you, is it not?

826
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:34,522
What?

827
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:37,183
Take a good look.

828
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:39,764
What do you know about the boy in the video?

829
00:49:42,832 --> 00:49:45,334
So, the kid's about high-school age, huh?

830
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:49,402
Maybe he picked up the gun
Shibata threw away by pure accident.

831
00:49:50,626 --> 00:49:53,827
If that's the case, then the
kid might have posted about it.

832
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,250
Oh. You mean online.

833
00:49:58,213 --> 00:49:59,706
Yeah, nothing is private.

834
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:02,209
Kids post everything on social media these days.

835
00:50:18,965 --> 00:50:21,387
Go, Nagi, go!

836
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:22,301
Yeah!

837
00:50:22,326 --> 00:50:23,230
That was amazing, Nagi!

838
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:24,286
Yeah! Great shot!

839
00:50:27,935 --> 00:50:29,971
A ring. Definitely a ring.

840
00:50:30,344 --> 00:50:32,861
What? You sure it's not too much?

841
00:50:32,924 --> 00:50:35,268
We're talking about my sister's birthday, right?

842
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,518
I did ask a woman for ideas, but...

843
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:39,931
I know what I'd like.

844
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:41,980
Hugs and kisses, money,

845
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,532
boyfriend and a real job.

846
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:46,692
But she wasn't very helpful.

847
00:50:47,702 --> 00:50:49,111
See you later, Nagi.

848
00:50:49,385 --> 00:50:50,743
See you around, Nagi.

849
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,747
Mm-hmm.

850
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:54,748
Just admit it. You're in love with my sister.

851
00:50:54,883 --> 00:50:55,479
Huh?

852
00:50:56,408 --> 00:50:58,101
No, it's-it's noth-nothing like that.

853
00:50:58,126 --> 00:51:00,167
Uh, oh, wait. What if it is? Then what?

854
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:01,304
You know...

855
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:03,891
Being ambivalent is the worst thing as a man.

856
00:51:03,931 --> 00:51:05,482
Uh, is that true?

857
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:07,691
Be clear before you start going out.

858
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,329
Then you can be vague. Those are the basics.

859
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:14,643
I should call you "Sempai."

860
00:51:17,288 --> 00:51:18,931
Ever since our mom died,

861
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:20,863
my sister's been working nonstop.

862
00:51:21,205 --> 00:51:23,745
I know the reason she's doing it is for me.

863
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:25,105
'Cause I'm still a kid.

864
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:28,410
So that's why

865
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:30,969
I want to see her get to do more teenage stuff.

866
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:34,185
But you're gonna have to prove
you're the guy for the job, okay?

867
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,279
Here you go. Enjoy.

868
00:51:41,423 --> 00:51:42,298
Thank you.

869
00:51:42,687 --> 00:51:43,365
But, uh...

870
00:51:43,816 --> 00:51:45,262
do you think she'll like it?

871
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,248
Huh?

872
00:51:47,795 --> 00:51:48,782
Don't worry.

873
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:50,974
We spent three hours picking it out.

874
00:51:51,212 --> 00:51:53,492
If it were me, I'd be very happy.

875
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,962
Good luck, okay?

876
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:03,328
Tomorrow's sunshine girl job will be our last.

877
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:08,419
Our customer is a man who requested good weather
at the park so that he could play with his daughter.

878
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:11,606
After that appointment,

879
00:52:12,605 --> 00:52:14,410
I plan on giving Hina the ring.

880
00:52:25,766 --> 00:52:28,728
Daddy, can you do it one more time?

881
00:52:29,141 --> 00:52:31,446
Okay. Are you ready?

882
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:38,049
Oh, man.

883
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:39,980
That was tough on my back.

884
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:42,315
Of all the people that could have hired us.

885
00:52:42,395 --> 00:52:44,579
Did you already know I was doing this as a side job, huh?

886
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:48,295
I bet you knew this entire time and said
nothing. And since when have you had a daughter?!

887
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,656
Well, I'm impressed.

888
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,285
The forecast said it'd be 100% rain today.

889
00:52:54,358 --> 00:52:57,448
Yeah, unfortunately, my daughter has asthma.

890
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:02,040
And she lives with her grandmother, who
won't let me see her if it's raining out, so...

891
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:03,684
it's been tough lately.

892
00:53:04,901 --> 00:53:08,118
There's nothing more gorgeous than a beautiful, clear sky.

893
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:08,985
I concur.

894
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,730
I take it you're Hodaka's boss, then?

895
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,115
Yep. I also saved his life.

896
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,557
Hey, does your friend always speak so formally?

897
00:53:15,582 --> 00:53:18,503
Huh? Well, Hina is a whole two years older than me.

898
00:53:18,566 --> 00:53:19,872
What? Ridiculous.

899
00:53:19,957 --> 00:53:22,140
16, 17, 18... There's no difference.

900
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:22,932
Yeah, there is!

901
00:53:22,956 --> 00:53:23,651
Yeah, you're right.

902
00:53:23,676 --> 00:53:24,733
Ugh! There you are.

903
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:26,216
Hey!

904
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,464
Did I miss anything?

905
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:29,607
Wh-What are you gonna do about her?

906
00:53:29,632 --> 00:53:30,814
Aren't you gonna be in trouble?

907
00:53:30,922 --> 00:53:31,452
Hmm?

908
00:53:31,698 --> 00:53:34,146
I mean, does Natsumi even know that you're married?

909
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:36,792
What's wrong? You okay?

910
00:53:40,177 --> 00:53:43,443
Hodaka, he... he actually thought you were my...

911
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:45,451
Mistress?!

912
00:53:46,572 --> 00:53:49,360
Hang on. You never mentioned that she's your niece.

913
00:53:49,385 --> 00:53:52,196
So, this whole time, you had disgusting fantasies?

914
00:53:52,221 --> 00:53:53,444
That is so perverted.

915
00:53:54,174 --> 00:53:56,320
Classic Hodaka.

916
00:53:58,806 --> 00:54:00,002
Hmm.

917
00:54:00,228 --> 00:54:01,389
Are you looking at my boobs?

918
00:54:01,414 --> 00:54:02,349
I am not!

919
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:04,749
Natsumi!

920
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,675
Hey, Moka. What do you got there?

921
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,874
Daddy, look! A flower crown.

922
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:09,681
I made it for you!

923
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:10,979
Yeah? Let me see.

924
00:54:11,177 --> 00:54:12,559
Hodaka, join us.

925
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:14,464
Uh, Sempai calls.

926
00:54:17,095 --> 00:54:18,645
Hodaka is such a riot.

927
00:54:18,748 --> 00:54:20,162
He is such a child.

928
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:23,634
They're like the older and younger
versions of each other, don't you think?

929
00:54:24,072 --> 00:54:25,323
Hodaka and Mr. Suga?

930
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:26,096
Yeah.

931
00:54:26,215 --> 00:54:29,711
Kei ran away from home and came to
Tokyo when he was a teenager, too.

932
00:54:29,862 --> 00:54:32,754
Then he met and fell madly in love with his future wife.

933
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,997
But then, a few years ago, she died in an accident.

934
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,575
He's still very much in love with her, though.

935
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,422
It's so good to meet you.

936
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,497
I've been wanting to for a long time.

937
00:54:45,037 --> 00:54:47,652
You're the real sunshine girl. That's amazing!

938
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,796
I wish I had a special skill
to put on my résumé like that.

939
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:53,357
I hate looking for a job. Too bad I'm not in high school.

940
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:55,444
It's funny.

941
00:54:56,145 --> 00:54:58,543
'Cause for me, I can't wait to grow up.

942
00:54:58,886 --> 00:54:59,703
Huh.

943
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,431
Yeah, I understand that.

944
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:04,015
I'm glad you're
doing well, though.

945
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:04,499
Huh?

946
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:06,948
Actually, I was a bit worried about you.

947
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:08,269
Huh?

948
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:18,413
You okay, Moka? You tired?

949
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,518
Here you go.

950
00:55:19,786 --> 00:55:21,972
One, two, three.

951
00:55:23,705 --> 00:55:26,023
I'm fine. I want to keep playing.

952
00:55:26,048 --> 00:55:27,422
I know, but it's raining.

953
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:29,657
We're taking off. Have a good day, okay?

954
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:33,290
But I want to hang out with Nagi some more.

955
00:55:33,315 --> 00:55:35,101
Then why don't we all grab some dinner?

956
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:36,453
I'm sorry, but...

957
00:55:36,478 --> 00:55:38,444
Hey, how about I just go eat with Moka, then?

958
00:55:38,494 --> 00:55:39,440
Would that be okay?

959
00:55:39,638 --> 00:55:40,189
Great.

960
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:41,403
Yay!

961
00:55:41,807 --> 00:55:43,530
Hodaka, can you take Hina home?

962
00:55:43,586 --> 00:55:44,141
Uh...

963
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,240
Hey, whoa, uh...

964
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,522
Hina, thank you for bringing the sunshine today.

965
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,216
Thank you.

966
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:56,118
I'm happy you're happy.

967
00:56:11,696 --> 00:56:12,751
Oh, my God.

968
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,866
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

969
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,439
This might be...

970
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:19,671
the very first time that...

971
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:22,633
I tell someone I love them.

972
00:56:33,012 --> 00:56:33,776
Hina, I...!

973
00:56:33,801 --> 00:56:34,133
Hodaka.

974
00:56:34,229 --> 00:56:34,908
Oh, sorry.

975
00:56:34,932 --> 00:56:35,436
Uh...

976
00:56:36,499 --> 00:56:37,339
What is it?

977
00:56:37,363 --> 00:56:38,593
Nothing in particular.

978
00:56:38,939 --> 00:56:40,431
What did you want to say?

979
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:45,565
Hodaka,

980
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:47,724
so, um...

981
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:51,543
I...

982
00:57:02,262 --> 00:57:03,143
Hina!

983
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:09,881
Hodaka!

984
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:11,653
Where are you, Hina?

985
00:57:40,676 --> 00:57:42,637
I think I know when I became

986
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:43,893
a sunshine girl.

987
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:49,367
It was one year ago, on that day.

988
00:57:55,186 --> 00:57:58,250
I spent the entire day before praying for good weather.

989
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,929
I wanted to have one last walk under the sun with my mom.

990
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:10,828
And then I saw it.

991
00:58:11,344 --> 00:58:13,155
It looked like a pool of light.

992
00:58:13,536 --> 00:58:17,914
And praying with all my heart, I crossed the shrine gate.

993
00:58:29,894 --> 00:58:34,003
When I finally came to, I was lying on the ground,

994
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:36,466
and the sky was clear.

995
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,697
I think that's when it happened.

996
00:58:46,126 --> 00:58:47,079
That's when...

997
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:49,605
I became connected to the sky.

998
00:58:55,623 --> 00:58:58,449
Is it true? Connected to the sky?

999
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,993
Hodaka, don't come out.

1000
00:59:05,868 --> 00:59:08,491
It's the police. Sorry for the late visit.

1001
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,484
The police?

1002
00:59:10,025 --> 00:59:10,812
Look again.

1003
00:59:10,837 --> 00:59:12,511
You sure you haven't seen him before?

1004
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:17,436
Someone fitting his description has
been reported several times in this area.

1005
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:18,963
I don't know him.

1006
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:21,083
May I ask what he's done?

1007
00:59:21,472 --> 00:59:24,023
We just want to ask him some questions. That's all.

1008
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,860
He's a minor and a runaway.

1009
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:29,230
Additionally, his parents have
filed a missing persons report.

1010
00:59:30,198 --> 00:59:33,859
We've also been told that you live
here on your own with your little brother.

1011
00:59:33,899 --> 00:59:35,020
Is that correct?

1012
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:36,275
Yes.

1013
00:59:36,418 --> 00:59:38,698
That, unfortunately, is another issue.

1014
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:41,995
Children cannot live on their own without a guardian.

1015
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:42,600
But...!

1016
00:59:42,988 --> 00:59:43,750
Sorry.

1017
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,452
But we're quiet and don't cause trouble.

1018
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:50,059
Hina.

1019
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,793
She said that she was going to come back tomorrow,

1020
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:55,256
bring child services.

1021
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:56,725
What do I do?

1022
00:59:56,765 --> 00:59:58,354
They're going to separate us.

1023
00:59:58,402 --> 00:59:59,689
I just know it.

1024
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,875
Hodaka, the police.

1025
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:14,795
They were just...

1026
01:00:15,323 --> 01:00:15,931
I know.

1027
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,774
Go inside. I'll be back tomorrow.

1028
01:00:20,595 --> 01:00:21,737
Mr. Suga?

1029
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:24,256
Hey. Like the new look?

1030
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,403
I'm in disguise.

1031
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:29,730
Earlier today, the police stopped by my office.

1032
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,534
They're treating your disappearance as a kidnapping.

1033
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:36,761
I denied any involvement, but I
can tell they still suspect me.

1034
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:39,550
Consider this your severance pay.

1035
01:00:39,609 --> 01:00:40,018
Huh?

1036
01:00:40,526 --> 01:00:44,267
I can't have you coming back to the office.
If they catch you there, they'll arrest me.

1037
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:51,364
I'm in the process of filing for custody of my daughter,

1038
01:00:51,476 --> 01:00:53,787
so I got to be careful, understand?

1039
01:00:54,493 --> 01:00:57,274
If I were you, I'd head back home tomorrow.

1040
01:00:57,504 --> 01:01:00,055
Then everything can go back to normal.

1041
01:01:00,484 --> 01:01:01,915
It'll be best for everyone.

1042
01:01:02,144 --> 01:01:03,487
You'll see.

1043
01:01:05,633 --> 01:01:08,174
Time to grow up, little man. Got it?

1044
01:01:17,853 --> 01:01:19,440
We can't stay here anymore.

1045
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:21,793
But... where will you go?

1046
01:01:21,818 --> 01:01:23,596
I don't know, but...

1047
01:01:24,867 --> 01:01:28,069
Hey, it doesn't matter where
we go, as long as we're together.

1048
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:32,821
Hmm. Hodaka, you should probably go
home before you get caught by the police.

1049
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:35,338
At least you've got a place to go back to.

1050
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:36,830
Don't say that.

1051
01:01:39,469 --> 01:01:41,383
Don't worry. We're gonna be fine.

1052
01:01:43,004 --> 01:01:43,782
No way.

1053
01:01:44,297 --> 01:01:45,482
I'm not going back.

1054
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:47,914
Let's run away!

1055
01:01:53,955 --> 01:01:58,671
A special heavy rain advisory has
just been issued in the Tokyo area.

1056
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,079
It could be the heaviest downpour

1057
01:02:00,104 --> 01:02:02,250
that the city has experienced in decades.

1058
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:05,116
Lowland communities should be prepared for flash flooding.

1059
01:02:05,141 --> 01:02:07,752
A sudden typhoon-strength low-pressure system is...

1060
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:09,667
River levels rising.

1061
01:02:09,913 --> 01:02:11,676
Increased risk of flooding.

1062
01:02:12,011 --> 01:02:13,885
The dam is not going to hold!

1063
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,571
Keep calm and slowly make your way towards the exit.

1064
01:02:16,762 --> 01:02:20,835
The Namboku Line at Akabane-Iwabuchi
Station, the Shibuya Metro...

1065
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,794
Outgoing flights have been canceled from Haneda Airport.

1066
01:02:23,882 --> 01:02:27,767
Over six inches of rain is falling per hour, and
heavy flooding has been reported in many areas in Tokyo.

1067
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:29,088
Sir, are you okay?

1068
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:31,190
Kita Ward, Arakawa Ward,

1069
01:02:31,301 --> 01:02:33,558
Taito Ward, Sumida Ward, Shibuya...

1070
01:02:33,605 --> 01:02:35,956
Please head home immediately.

1071
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,055
It's really cold, right?

1072
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,121
It has been a record-breaking August.

1073
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,170
The temperature in Tokyo has fallen below 50 degrees.

1074
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:44,720
Cumulonimbi continue to gather above Tokyo.

1075
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:46,143
In merely an hour,

1076
01:02:46,175 --> 01:02:48,011
Tokyo's landscape has been transformed.

1077
01:02:48,201 --> 01:02:51,944
I repeat, a heavy rain special advisory
has been issued for the greater Tokyo area.

1078
01:02:51,998 --> 01:02:53,571
This is looking to be the heaviest rainfall

1079
01:02:53,596 --> 01:02:55,014
recorded in the last few decades.

1080
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:56,026
A low-pressure system over the Kanto region...

1081
01:02:56,051 --> 01:03:00,741
The stream of cold air that passed over
Kanto on the 21st is the cause of the current...

1082
01:03:00,765 --> 01:03:03,128
Active rainclouds will remain over
east and central Japan at least...

1083
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:06,204
The Meteorological Agency has
stated that this abnormal weather

1084
01:03:06,229 --> 01:03:07,246
will continue for at least the next few weeks.

1085
01:03:07,271 --> 01:03:12,614
Experts warn that the current weather pattern we
are seeing is unprecedented and extremely dangerous.

1086
01:03:18,742 --> 01:03:22,807
Trains on the Yamanote Line are
indefinitely delayed due to the heavy rains.

1087
01:03:23,082 --> 01:03:26,514
There is no way to resume
operations until the weather clears up.

1088
01:03:26,657 --> 01:03:27,586
Let's just get off here.

1089
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:29,547
Oh, I'll ask my mom to pick us up.

1090
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:30,654
It's freezing.

1091
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:31,822
What should we do?

1092
01:03:31,954 --> 01:03:33,158
Hey, don't worry.

1093
01:03:33,507 --> 01:03:35,533
Let's find a place to stay tonight.

1094
01:03:36,637 --> 01:03:39,106
I'm sorry, but we don't have anything available.

1095
01:03:39,154 --> 01:03:40,116
We're fully booked.

1096
01:03:40,172 --> 01:03:41,689
Do you have a reservation?

1097
01:03:41,808 --> 01:03:42,905
We're all full.

1098
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:44,955
There's no adult with you?

1099
01:03:45,217 --> 01:03:47,338
One last thing... I need to see your I.D.

1100
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:49,133
We can't accept unaccompanied minors.

1101
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:51,016
This ain't about the money.

1102
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,700
It's not about the money!

1103
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,449
Be honest.

1104
01:03:55,974 --> 01:03:57,697
Are you kids runaways?

1105
01:04:06,328 --> 01:04:08,471
Hina, Hodaka, look.

1106
01:04:09,568 --> 01:04:11,482
Is that snow?

1107
01:05:05,626 --> 01:05:06,936
Could it be true?

1108
01:05:08,294 --> 01:05:10,653
That Hina is connected to the sky?

1109
01:05:22,724 --> 01:05:24,264
It's freezing.

1110
01:05:25,647 --> 01:05:28,456
Hey, Kei, it's snowing in August.

1111
01:05:28,888 --> 01:05:31,271
It's official... The world's gone crazy.

1112
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:32,093
Hmm?

1113
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:33,638
Oh.

1114
01:05:34,362 --> 01:05:37,676
It is difficult to believe,
but it is snowing here in Tokyo.

1115
01:05:37,795 --> 01:05:40,305
Kei, wake up. Hey, you'll catch a cold.

1116
01:05:41,654 --> 01:05:42,357
Asuka.

1117
01:05:45,643 --> 01:05:46,407
Asuka.

1118
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:48,765
Kei, you, too. Smile!

1119
01:05:54,429 --> 01:05:55,659
Oh, it's cold.

1120
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:58,497
Careful. You're starting to act like an old man.

1121
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:00,643
That's what happens when you're old.

1122
01:06:03,353 --> 01:06:07,175
You have to make tough choices 'cause
you've got different priorities, you know.

1123
01:06:07,486 --> 01:06:09,030
What are you saying?

1124
01:06:09,177 --> 01:06:10,401
Where's Hodaka?

1125
01:06:10,608 --> 01:06:12,149
You kicked him out?!

1126
01:06:12,252 --> 01:06:13,666
I don't believe you.

1127
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,724
I told you, the police showed up.

1128
01:06:16,089 --> 01:06:18,719
I've got to protect myself, not some stranger.

1129
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:22,928
What? And how are you protecting
yourself by smoking and drinking again?

1130
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,422
Not cool. Meow.

1131
01:06:25,884 --> 01:06:27,958
See? Even Rain's judging you.

1132
01:06:28,108 --> 01:06:30,819
Not only is it uncool; it's so last century.

1133
01:06:30,858 --> 01:06:32,987
Don't get near me. I don't want you to rub off on me.

1134
01:06:33,012 --> 01:06:35,760
Ah, you're not exactly cool, either.

1135
01:06:35,887 --> 01:06:37,325
What's her name... Hina?

1136
01:06:37,365 --> 01:06:39,916
If the story about the Weather Maiden is true,

1137
01:06:40,733 --> 01:06:43,394
that she's a human sacrifice, then one day she'll...

1138
01:06:43,419 --> 01:06:44,732
I know, but then...

1139
01:06:45,215 --> 01:06:46,732
what was I supposed to do?

1140
01:06:46,939 --> 01:06:48,736
Ah, come on, relax.

1141
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:50,466
It's all bullshit anyway.

1142
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:53,738
Besides, if it were true...

1143
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:03,604
if you could fix this crazy weather with
one human sacrifice, I'd be fine with it.

1144
01:07:04,779 --> 01:07:06,043
Everyone would.

1145
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:13,327
A heavy rain and heavy snow advisory has
been issued for Tokyo and its surrounding areas.

1146
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:17,795
Residents are urged to stay
indoors at all times if possible.

1147
01:07:17,898 --> 01:07:19,496
You kids, hold up.

1148
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:22,856
It's dangerous to walk around right now unsupervised.

1149
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:23,982
What are you doing out?

1150
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:24,912
These your siblings?

1151
01:07:24,937 --> 01:07:25,797
I... Yeah, we're, uh...

1152
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:27,569
We're actually on our way home.

1153
01:07:27,682 --> 01:07:30,460
I-I'm a college student, and
these are my younger brothers.

1154
01:07:30,485 --> 01:07:32,527
Hmm. I understand, but...

1155
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:34,682
I'm gonna need to see some I.D.

1156
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:37,085
Oh, I, uh, don't have it on me.

1157
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,756
We may have located the boy.

1158
01:07:38,781 --> 01:07:41,877
We think he might be carrying
a firearm. Proceed with caution.

1159
01:07:42,846 --> 01:07:44,793
And you... you in high school?

1160
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:47,095
That's a pretty big backpack you got there.

1161
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,353
Can you remove your hood for us, please?

1162
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,442
Hina.

1163
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:52,166
Huh?

1164
01:07:52,658 --> 01:07:53,723
Run for it!

1165
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:56,465
Hey, wait!

1166
01:07:57,211 --> 01:07:58,085
Stop!

1167
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:01,229
Gotcha!

1168
01:08:01,253 --> 01:08:02,383
Let go of me!

1169
01:08:03,097 --> 01:08:04,457
Will you settle down?!

1170
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,511
Get off!

1171
01:08:09,535 --> 01:08:10,395
Stop struggling.

1172
01:08:11,343 --> 01:08:11,968
Stop it! No!

1173
01:08:11,992 --> 01:08:12,553
Hodaka!

1174
01:08:12,852 --> 01:08:13,678
No!

1175
01:08:14,384 --> 01:08:15,910
Stay where you are!

1176
01:08:18,496 --> 01:08:19,341
Hina.

1177
01:08:19,885 --> 01:08:22,060
Please!

1178
01:08:37,553 --> 01:08:38,649
Clear the area!

1179
01:08:43,601 --> 01:08:45,434
Hina, we've got to go.

1180
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:46,986
Let's go take a closer look.

1181
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:48,787
Come on.

1182
01:08:58,227 --> 01:08:59,808
It's 280 a night.

1183
01:09:00,295 --> 01:09:00,834
Uh...

1184
01:09:01,255 --> 01:09:02,961
So, can you pay it? 280.

1185
01:09:02,986 --> 01:09:05,059
Oh, y... oh, yes, uh, of course I can.

1186
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,419
It's official.

1187
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,834
Looks like I'm a full-fledged fugitive now.

1188
01:09:18,945 --> 01:09:20,200
That's so cool.

1189
01:09:20,514 --> 01:09:20,851
Huh?

1190
01:09:24,587 --> 01:09:26,675
That almost gave me a heart attack.

1191
01:09:26,785 --> 01:09:27,724
You totally almost got arrested.

1192
01:09:27,766 --> 01:09:29,221
Why are you laughing?

1193
01:09:29,245 --> 01:09:30,235
'Cause it was funny.

1194
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,233
I'm glad you think so.

1195
01:09:32,286 --> 01:09:33,214
It's huge.

1196
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,724
The bed's huge.

1197
01:09:34,835 --> 01:09:36,177
The bathtub's huge.

1198
01:09:37,617 --> 01:09:38,768
Whoa.

1199
01:09:39,181 --> 01:09:40,885
Hina. Hodaka.

1200
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,219
Let's take a bath together.

1201
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,560
Take it by yourself!

1202
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:47,747
Fine. Then let's take a boys-only bath together,

1203
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:48,736
okay, Hodaka?

1204
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,652
Wait, what?

1205
01:09:51,449 --> 01:09:53,888
This is the life.

1206
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:55,269
What's this do?

1207
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:56,748
Huh?

1208
01:09:58,758 --> 01:10:00,053
Whoa!

1209
01:10:01,339 --> 01:10:02,132
Your turn. Tag.

1210
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:02,969
My turn. Tag.

1211
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:05,852
Whoa, so many.

1212
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:06,870
What do you want?

1213
01:10:06,894 --> 01:10:08,262
How about one of each, Sempai?

1214
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:09,120
Are you sure?

1215
01:10:09,263 --> 01:10:11,177
Yeah. I got severance pay.

1216
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,464
Hina, we're having a huge feast tonight!

1217
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:15,797
I can't wait.

1218
01:10:19,885 --> 01:10:21,473
Sorry I took so long.

1219
01:10:22,576 --> 01:10:23,718
Uh, it-it's fine.

1220
01:10:34,573 --> 01:10:35,599
Bon appétit.

1221
01:10:36,323 --> 01:10:38,300
Hodaka, you want to try some of mine?

1222
01:10:38,387 --> 01:10:38,792
Mm.

1223
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:39,423
Mmm!

1224
01:10:39,661 --> 01:10:40,611
Curry's good.

1225
01:10:40,707 --> 01:10:41,880
So are the noodles.

1226
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:42,789
I want to try.

1227
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:45,752
Hey, wait. I don't think those are ready yet.

1228
01:10:45,777 --> 01:10:47,586
It tastes better this way... Al dente.

1229
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:49,964
My fortune cookie

1230
01:10:49,989 --> 01:10:52,424
Speaks of love again

1231
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:53,880
Future's looking, looking bright...

1232
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:56,668
It's that precious thing that is in your heart

1233
01:10:56,693 --> 01:10:59,688
It's the same thing that will soon depart, so...

1234
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,745
God, if you really exist,

1235
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:03,310
then I beg you.

1236
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,710
This is more than enough.

1237
01:11:05,932 --> 01:11:07,577
We don't need anything else.

1238
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,516
We'll manage somehow.

1239
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:10,694
See how you like it!

1240
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:12,986
So, please,

1241
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:15,791
don't throw anything more at us,

1242
01:11:16,243 --> 01:11:19,495
but don't take anything more from us, either.

1243
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,734
I'm begging you.

1244
01:11:22,322 --> 01:11:25,063
Please, God, let us stay like this.

1245
01:11:25,237 --> 01:11:27,891
Together, forever and ever.

1246
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,484
Hina, here.

1247
01:11:32,881 --> 01:11:34,255
Happy 18th birthday.

1248
01:11:35,469 --> 01:11:36,113
Huh?

1249
01:11:36,551 --> 01:11:40,578
It's not much, but, uh, it's something
that I thought would look good on you.

1250
01:11:43,876 --> 01:11:44,862
Thanks.

1251
01:11:48,731 --> 01:11:49,549
Hey.

1252
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:52,814
Can I ask you something?

1253
01:11:53,655 --> 01:11:55,478
Would you like the rain to stop?

1254
01:11:55,772 --> 01:11:57,550
Uh, yes. Yeah.

1255
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:07,979
I'm a human sacrifice, they say.

1256
01:12:08,582 --> 01:12:09,058
Huh?

1257
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:13,475
Natsumi was the one who told me
about the sunshine girl's fate.

1258
01:12:14,098 --> 01:12:16,854
If the Maiden gets sacrificed, then her body disappears,

1259
01:12:17,242 --> 01:12:19,737
but after that, the weather goes back to normal.

1260
01:12:21,471 --> 01:12:22,726
Come on, now.

1261
01:12:22,845 --> 01:12:24,980
You can't believe the stuff in those weird legends.

1262
01:12:25,005 --> 01:12:27,808
I mean, people don't disappear.

1263
01:12:40,586 --> 01:12:41,904
What are you looking at?

1264
01:12:41,959 --> 01:12:43,739
I'm not looking at anything!

1265
01:12:49,062 --> 01:12:50,921
I'm looking at you, Hina.

1266
01:12:52,678 --> 01:12:54,790
Come on. Why are you crying, Hodaka?

1267
01:12:57,962 --> 01:13:02,243
The more I pray for sunshine, the more my body fades away.

1268
01:13:03,173 --> 01:13:05,746
But if I end up dying from this...

1269
01:13:06,596 --> 01:13:08,869
we'll finally get our summers back.

1270
01:13:09,615 --> 01:13:11,034
Take care of Nagi for me.

1271
01:13:11,069 --> 01:13:11,688
No!

1272
01:13:11,799 --> 01:13:12,872
I won't!

1273
01:13:13,412 --> 01:13:14,995
'Cause you're not going anywhere.

1274
01:13:15,114 --> 01:13:17,009
We're all gonna live together.

1275
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,758
Hodaka.

1276
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,555
Hina, let's make a promise to each other

1277
01:13:20,841 --> 01:13:23,001
to always be together.

1278
01:13:25,578 --> 01:13:28,500
I'll get a job. I'll take care of us.

1279
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,421
You don't have to be a sunshine girl anymore.

1280
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:33,109
Your body will go back to normal, and then...

1281
01:13:53,465 --> 01:13:54,553
I had a dream.

1282
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:56,897
I was still on the island.

1283
01:14:05,636 --> 01:14:06,787
I wanted to leave.

1284
01:14:07,326 --> 01:14:08,917
I pedaled as fast as I could.

1285
01:14:09,067 --> 01:14:12,077
I was desperate, wanting to go into the light.

1286
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:14,382
When I finally reached it,

1287
01:14:14,842 --> 01:14:17,583
I discovered I had reached a dead end.

1288
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:20,110
That's when I decided

1289
01:14:20,975 --> 01:14:22,804
that I was gonna go into that light.

1290
01:14:24,081 --> 01:14:25,207
And at the edge of it,

1291
01:14:26,474 --> 01:14:27,688
I found you.

1292
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:32,219
I had a dream...

1293
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:35,118
the day I met you.

1294
01:14:37,596 --> 01:14:38,096
Huh?

1295
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,671
You looked like a lost kitten.

1296
01:14:42,859 --> 01:14:45,836
But you helped me find a reason to live.

1297
01:14:47,475 --> 01:14:51,095
I continued working as the sunshine
girl because it made me happy.

1298
01:14:51,906 --> 01:14:53,826
I liked making people smile.

1299
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,418
I'm really glad I met you.

1300
01:14:57,977 --> 01:15:01,425
So, please, don't cry, Hodaka.

1301
01:15:16,306 --> 01:15:17,831
Where am I?

1302
01:15:21,519 --> 01:15:22,590
Hodaka.

1303
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,031
Oh, no. Hina?

1304
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:13,667
Where are you?!

1305
01:16:14,056 --> 01:16:14,850
Hina?!

1306
01:16:15,151 --> 01:16:16,136
Hina!

1307
01:16:16,224 --> 01:16:17,956
Hodaka, what is it?

1308
01:16:18,188 --> 01:16:19,871
Your sister's disappeared!

1309
01:16:19,896 --> 01:16:20,602
She's gone.

1310
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:23,907
I was just dreaming...

1311
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:27,370
that she disappeared into the sky.

1312
01:16:32,633 --> 01:16:33,633
It can't be.

1313
01:16:36,104 --> 01:16:36,889
Open the door.

1314
01:16:37,971 --> 01:16:38,749
Open up.

1315
01:16:38,868 --> 01:16:39,876
What?

1316
01:16:42,325 --> 01:16:44,200
Are you Hodaka Morishima?

1317
01:16:44,819 --> 01:16:47,155
You're the subject of a missing persons report.

1318
01:16:47,392 --> 01:16:50,888
We also believe that you're in
possession of an illegal firearm.

1319
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,248
I need you to come to the station.

1320
01:16:52,273 --> 01:16:53,598
Let go of me!

1321
01:16:53,717 --> 01:16:54,975
It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.

1322
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,559
No!

1323
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,031
We're taking a little trip.

1324
01:16:57,056 --> 01:16:57,872
Sempai!

1325
01:16:57,897 --> 01:17:00,130
Don't make this any harder than it has to be.

1326
01:17:13,098 --> 01:17:14,448
Why are you stopping?

1327
01:17:18,557 --> 01:17:23,410
After months of intense rain, the Kanto
region is finally seeing some brilliant sunshine.

1328
01:17:23,648 --> 01:17:26,716
The sun's rays are making yesterday's
storms seem like a crazy dream.

1329
01:17:26,741 --> 01:17:28,987
In a matter of hours, the weather has done a 180.

1330
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:31,945
By 8:00 a.m., the temperature was 25 degrees Celsius.

1331
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:35,082
Many areas adjacent to the
Arakawa River have remained flooded.

1332
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:36,718
The trains are still not running.

1333
01:17:36,743 --> 01:17:39,568
The extent of the damage has yet to be ascertained.

1334
01:17:39,592 --> 01:17:43,202
Authorities say it will take at least
a week to restore municipal services,

1335
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:46,316
as long as the weather remains clear.

1336
01:17:46,756 --> 01:17:47,571
The sky's clear.

1337
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:48,937
Oh, so sunny.

1338
01:17:48,996 --> 01:17:50,378
Oh, it's so bright.

1339
01:17:50,608 --> 01:17:52,199
The sky's actually clear.

1340
01:17:52,379 --> 01:17:54,016
It's making me all emotional.

1341
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:55,057
Well, it took a while,

1342
01:17:55,082 --> 01:17:56,891
but summer has finally arrived.

1343
01:18:07,569 --> 01:18:09,050
Hey. Hurry up.

1344
01:18:12,248 --> 01:18:13,630
This is Hina's.

1345
01:18:14,743 --> 01:18:16,070
She sacrificed.

1346
01:18:17,086 --> 01:18:18,792
Hina! What happened to you?!

1347
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:19,556
Hey. Where are you going?

1348
01:18:19,581 --> 01:18:20,103
Hina!

1349
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:21,045
Calm down.

1350
01:18:25,851 --> 01:18:28,290
I have something I need you to confirm for me.

1351
01:18:28,565 --> 01:18:32,562
The girl who disappeared last
night is 15-year-old Hina Amano.

1352
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,540
Is that correct?

1353
01:18:35,162 --> 01:18:36,991
Do you have any idea where she could be?

1354
01:18:38,436 --> 01:18:39,279
She's 15?

1355
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:40,931
Hina said she was older.

1356
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,376
Isn't she 18?

1357
01:18:43,568 --> 01:18:47,078
She's been lying about her age on
her résumés and job applications.

1358
01:18:47,411 --> 01:18:50,701
I understand she needed to make a living,
but the truth is she's in middle school.

1359
01:18:51,305 --> 01:18:53,395
Or at least legally she's supposed to be.

1360
01:18:53,826 --> 01:18:54,762
You didn't know?

1361
01:18:56,645 --> 01:18:57,804
I don't believe it.

1362
01:18:58,774 --> 01:19:00,076
I'm the one who's older?

1363
01:19:02,628 --> 01:19:03,324
Oh, what a pain.

1364
01:19:03,349 --> 01:19:04,026
This whole time.

1365
01:19:05,018 --> 01:19:07,266
Hey. Do you know where she is or not?

1366
01:19:09,435 --> 01:19:10,746
The weather cleared up

1367
01:19:10,936 --> 01:19:13,717
only because Hina sacrificed herself in exchange.

1368
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:14,281
Huh?

1369
01:19:14,903 --> 01:19:16,156
No one knows the truth!

1370
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,610
No one knows her sacrifice.

1371
01:19:19,278 --> 01:19:20,454
What a pain.

1372
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,607
Should we get a psychiatrist?

1373
01:19:27,431 --> 01:19:28,780
It's clear.

1374
01:19:33,754 --> 01:19:34,401
Huh.

1375
01:19:43,036 --> 01:19:44,869
Daddy, did you look outside?

1376
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:46,436
Yeah, I did.

1377
01:19:46,674 --> 01:19:48,414
I had a dream about Hina.

1378
01:19:48,644 --> 01:19:50,562
She's the one who brought the sunshine back.

1379
01:19:50,614 --> 01:19:51,955
I know it.

1380
01:19:57,262 --> 01:19:59,900
Yeah. I think you might be right.

1381
01:20:03,547 --> 01:20:04,407
Excuse me.

1382
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:07,646
Detective, I have a favor to ask you.

1383
01:20:08,584 --> 01:20:09,269
What is it?

1384
01:20:09,752 --> 01:20:10,665
Let me go.

1385
01:20:11,565 --> 01:20:13,312
I need to go out there and look for Hina.

1386
01:20:13,337 --> 01:20:14,797
It's my turn to help her now.

1387
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:16,394
I'll come back as soon as I find her.

1388
01:20:16,886 --> 01:20:20,258
What you need to do is step in
here and answer some of my questions.

1389
01:20:20,298 --> 01:20:21,028
Understood?

1390
01:20:21,909 --> 01:20:24,650
Tell Yasui we're about to begin the interrogation.

1391
01:20:25,214 --> 01:20:25,834
Yes, sir.

1392
01:20:26,978 --> 01:20:27,421
Huh?

1393
01:20:27,567 --> 01:20:29,505
Hey! Get back here!

1394
01:20:32,571 --> 01:20:33,665
Stop running!

1395
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:34,381
Come back!

1396
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,067
Someone stop him!

1397
01:20:36,092 --> 01:20:37,865
Stop! I said stop!

1398
01:20:40,548 --> 01:20:41,424
Do not let the boy in the white T-shirt

1399
01:20:41,449 --> 01:20:42,886
leave the building.

1400
01:20:43,045 --> 01:20:44,638
Stop that kid!

1401
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:48,032
Wait! Stop!

1402
01:20:53,023 --> 01:20:54,523
Hey! Come back here!

1403
01:20:56,867 --> 01:20:58,118
What the hell?!

1404
01:20:58,462 --> 01:20:59,322
That little shit.

1405
01:20:59,449 --> 01:21:00,475
Cut him off.

1406
01:21:00,785 --> 01:21:01,710
You go that way.

1407
01:21:01,734 --> 01:21:02,475
Yes, sir.

1408
01:21:09,841 --> 01:21:10,674
No!

1409
01:21:19,357 --> 01:21:20,391
Hodaka!

1410
01:21:20,614 --> 01:21:21,209
Huh?

1411
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,544
Natsumi?

1412
01:21:24,752 --> 01:21:25,943
What are you doing?

1413
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:28,195
I'm going to get Hina back.

1414
01:21:28,306 --> 01:21:28,957
Huh?

1415
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,157
Get on.

1416
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:39,864
Goddamn punk!

1417
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:43,106
While you were at the station, Nagi called.

1418
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:46,585
He said Hina had disappeared and
that the police had arrested you.

1419
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:47,523
Where is he?

1420
01:21:47,642 --> 01:21:49,843
At a child service center.

1421
01:21:54,316 --> 01:21:55,356
No going back.

1422
01:21:55,809 --> 01:21:57,598
We're about to become outlaws.

1423
01:21:57,796 --> 01:22:00,028
Breaking the law!

1424
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:02,721
All right, partner, where we headed?

1425
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:08,555
What? Another visitor?

1426
01:22:11,502 --> 01:22:13,207
Yeah, and it's another girl.

1427
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:14,909
He sure is popular.

1428
01:22:17,469 --> 01:22:18,550
Hello, Nagi.

1429
01:22:18,637 --> 01:22:20,719
Ayane, I'm so glad you could make it.

1430
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:22,558
Kana, this is Ayane.

1431
01:22:22,582 --> 01:22:23,412
Nice to meet you.

1432
01:22:23,437 --> 01:22:24,989
Ayane, this is Kana.

1433
01:22:25,013 --> 01:22:25,803
My pleasure.

1434
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:27,341
And that's Officer Sasaki.

1435
01:22:27,836 --> 01:22:29,774
She's going to be watching over me all day.

1436
01:22:29,799 --> 01:22:31,251
Wow. That's so cool.

1437
01:22:31,276 --> 01:22:32,572
It's like you're a celebrity.

1438
01:22:32,723 --> 01:22:33,181
How do you do?

1439
01:22:33,205 --> 01:22:33,852
Nice to meet you.

1440
01:22:34,923 --> 01:22:36,583
Thank you both so much for coming.

1441
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:39,097
I'm sure you must have been surprised by my call.

1442
01:22:39,134 --> 01:22:40,086
I was.

1443
01:22:40,215 --> 01:22:41,931
When I heard they took you in custody,

1444
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:43,219
my heart almost stopped.

1445
01:22:43,275 --> 01:22:45,537
Me, too. Mine's still pounding.

1446
01:22:45,562 --> 01:22:48,317
Nagi, if you touch my chest, you can feel it.

1447
01:22:48,342 --> 01:22:49,527
Yeah, she's right.

1448
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,314
Oh, I do feel it.

1449
01:22:55,207 --> 01:22:56,761
Um, excuse me.

1450
01:22:56,785 --> 01:22:57,336
Yes?

1451
01:22:57,399 --> 01:23:00,789
It's-it's my first time here, so I
don't know my way around, and, uh...

1452
01:23:00,813 --> 01:23:01,627
Uh-huh.

1453
01:23:02,072 --> 01:23:03,796
Uh, where's the bathroom?

1454
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,599
Oh.

1455
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,500
Thanks. I owe you one.

1456
01:23:10,682 --> 01:23:12,550
You better. I can't believe you.

1457
01:23:12,677 --> 01:23:15,680
Calling your ex to help you out with something like this?

1458
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,024
Take it.

1459
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:18,291
Turn around.

1460
01:23:18,404 --> 01:23:20,199
We still need to swap clothes.

1461
01:23:30,331 --> 01:23:33,239
Mr. Keisuke Suga. Good to see you again.

1462
01:23:33,572 --> 01:23:34,540
You again?

1463
01:23:34,669 --> 01:23:35,447
What do you want?

1464
01:23:35,729 --> 01:23:38,966
Looks like the weather's finally
back to the way it should be, huh?

1465
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:42,868
I told you already, I know nothing about that runaway.

1466
01:23:43,122 --> 01:23:45,156
Would you mind if we took a look around your office?

1467
01:23:45,181 --> 01:23:46,364
What? Hey. It's not a good time.

1468
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:48,066
Oh, it's really flooded, huh? That's too bad.

1469
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:50,090
You're not gonna find him down there.

1470
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:52,869
Yeah, we know.

1471
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:55,228
This is embarrassing, but, uh, the truth is...

1472
01:23:55,318 --> 01:23:57,446
Huh? What do you mean, he ran away?

1473
01:23:57,474 --> 01:23:59,170
From the police station?

1474
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,807
An abandoned building in Yoyogi?

1475
01:24:01,832 --> 01:24:03,767
Yeah. It's where she became a sunshine...

1476
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:04,437
Duck!

1477
01:24:06,114 --> 01:24:09,474
She said she became connected
with the sky on that building's roof

1478
01:24:09,657 --> 01:24:11,676
and that's how she became the sunshine girl.

1479
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:14,146
So, I think that's where I have to go.

1480
01:24:19,413 --> 01:24:20,651
Oh, great!

1481
01:24:23,768 --> 01:24:25,183
Hey, on the scooter!

1482
01:24:25,284 --> 01:24:25,859
Pull over!

1483
01:24:26,802 --> 01:24:28,159
Hold on tight.

1484
01:24:35,349 --> 01:24:36,310
Hold on!

1485
01:24:37,146 --> 01:24:38,303
I think that maybe...

1486
01:24:38,327 --> 01:24:38,736
What?

1487
01:24:38,839 --> 01:24:41,467
That I'm totally awesome? I know!

1488
01:24:41,612 --> 01:24:43,313
I was born for this stuff.

1489
01:24:43,384 --> 01:24:48,198
That's it... I'm gonna be a motorcycle
cop and catch anyone who speeds!

1490
01:24:48,286 --> 01:24:50,739
They're not gonna hire you after this!

1491
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:56,238
We have a theory about why the kid escaped.

1492
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:59,598
We think he may be trying to
search for the girl who he was with.

1493
01:25:00,003 --> 01:25:04,707
You see, he told us a few things that
frankly sounded like science fiction.

1494
01:25:05,103 --> 01:25:10,164
He seems to believe that the girl disappeared
in exchange for the good weather returning.

1495
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:12,979
That's ridiculous.

1496
01:25:13,011 --> 01:25:14,503
Don't tell me you believe him.

1497
01:25:14,528 --> 01:25:16,046
No, of course I don't.

1498
01:25:16,665 --> 01:25:20,175
But what I do believe is that he's throwing his life away.

1499
01:25:21,947 --> 01:25:24,411
And all of it is just because of some girl.

1500
01:25:24,847 --> 01:25:26,428
To be honest with you,

1501
01:25:26,733 --> 01:25:29,511
I envy the kid to feel that passionately.

1502
01:25:30,853 --> 01:25:33,649
What's the point in sharing that? It doesn't change much.

1503
01:25:35,773 --> 01:25:36,265
Huh?

1504
01:25:37,711 --> 01:25:39,483
Mr. Suga, are you, uh...

1505
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:40,539
Huh?

1506
01:25:42,755 --> 01:25:43,718
Are you okay?

1507
01:25:44,123 --> 01:25:45,146
Why do you ask?

1508
01:25:46,003 --> 01:25:48,410
Well, it's just that you, uh...

1509
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,492
you're crying.

1510
01:25:59,771 --> 01:26:00,916
This is bad.

1511
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:04,457
We're gonna jump it.

1512
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,875
Huh?

1513
01:26:06,248 --> 01:26:07,829
No. Wait.

1514
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,236
Ugh, it's the end of the line.

1515
01:26:17,418 --> 01:26:17,904
Hurry. Get out of here.

1516
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:18,825
Go on.

1517
01:26:23,172 --> 01:26:24,839
Thank you. Wish me luck.

1518
01:26:29,813 --> 01:26:32,062
Hodaka!

1519
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:34,243
Never give up!

1520
01:26:58,074 --> 01:26:58,797
Hina.

1521
01:27:00,241 --> 01:27:02,521
Hina. Hina, Hina!

1522
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:04,634
Hina?

1523
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,589
Hina, are you there?

1524
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:08,472
Hina!

1525
01:27:10,117 --> 01:27:11,818
Hey, Hodaka.

1526
01:27:12,366 --> 01:27:13,924
It's gonna clear up.

1527
01:27:16,378 --> 01:27:18,420
It's for you, but don't tell.

1528
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:20,438
Unless you want to have chowder for dinner again.

1529
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,805
Does it hurt? Let me guess... You ran away from home?

1530
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:25,443
Too bad you can't enjoy Tokyo with all this rain.

1531
01:27:25,602 --> 01:27:26,739
You're younger than me.

1532
01:27:26,803 --> 01:27:28,891
I'll be 18 in approximately a month.

1533
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:30,029
You should treat me with respect.

1534
01:27:30,054 --> 01:27:31,441
Hodaka, have you had lunch yet?

1535
01:27:31,602 --> 01:27:32,879
You just sit right there.

1536
01:27:32,935 --> 01:27:34,413
How do you like living in Tokyo?

1537
01:27:34,452 --> 01:27:35,867
Huh? Uh...

1538
01:27:36,073 --> 01:27:38,618
I don't feel like I'm suffocating anymore.

1539
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:40,929
Well, that's great, right?

1540
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:43,283
I think I'm in love...

1541
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,951
with this job as the sunshine girl.

1542
01:27:46,268 --> 01:27:47,060
And so...

1543
01:27:47,524 --> 01:27:49,399
thank you, Hodaka.

1544
01:27:52,694 --> 01:27:53,327
Hey, hey, look.

1545
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:54,776
There's someone on the tracks!

1546
01:27:54,801 --> 01:27:55,687
Who is that?

1547
01:27:55,711 --> 01:27:56,334
Stop!

1548
01:27:56,556 --> 01:27:57,459
You can't be here!

1549
01:27:57,483 --> 01:27:58,295
Come back! It's dangerous!

1550
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,739
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

1551
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,991
This place is off-limits!

1552
01:28:04,564 --> 01:28:05,548
What is he doing?

1553
01:28:05,726 --> 01:28:06,651
What is he doing?

1554
01:28:06,675 --> 01:28:07,358
That's so crazy.

1555
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:08,693
There's someone running up there.

1556
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:09,853
He's gonna get himself arrested.

1557
01:28:09,877 --> 01:28:10,395
Do you see that?

1558
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:11,691
Some people are such idiots.

1559
01:28:26,502 --> 01:28:27,368
I'm sorry.

1560
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:28,884
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1561
01:28:28,909 --> 01:28:30,236
I'm so sorry, Hina!

1562
01:28:30,482 --> 01:28:32,350
I made you do that sunshine girl job,

1563
01:28:32,588 --> 01:28:35,582
but in the end, you were the one
who had to deal with the consequences.

1564
01:28:35,756 --> 01:28:36,177
Hey.

1565
01:28:36,383 --> 01:28:38,028
Can I ask you something?

1566
01:28:39,276 --> 01:28:41,190
Would you like the rain to stop?

1567
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:11,158
Mr. Suga?

1568
01:29:12,216 --> 01:29:14,147
People are looking for you, Hodaka.

1569
01:29:14,353 --> 01:29:15,513
How did you find me?

1570
01:29:15,695 --> 01:29:16,526
Look at you.

1571
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:18,311
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

1572
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,145
You don't get it. Hina's gone!

1573
01:29:20,795 --> 01:29:21,947
And it's my fault.

1574
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,823
The sunshine girl job was my idea.

1575
01:29:23,848 --> 01:29:24,992
Hodaka, calm down.

1576
01:29:25,017 --> 01:29:26,271
That's why I have to help her!

1577
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,130
I have to go.

1578
01:29:31,481 --> 01:29:32,204
Hey, wait.

1579
01:29:32,229 --> 01:29:33,381
Where are you...

1580
01:29:33,937 --> 01:29:36,446
I can make it to Heaven if I just go through that.

1581
01:29:38,601 --> 01:29:39,020
What?

1582
01:29:39,045 --> 01:29:39,948
Have you lost it?

1583
01:29:39,972 --> 01:29:41,229
She's somewhere in the sky.

1584
01:29:41,254 --> 01:29:42,945
I can get there if I use the stairs!

1585
01:29:42,985 --> 01:29:44,477
Hodaka, stop this.

1586
01:29:44,502 --> 01:29:45,879
There's no way she's up there.

1587
01:29:46,689 --> 01:29:48,033
Snap out of it!

1588
01:29:49,866 --> 01:29:51,533
What's gotten into you?

1589
01:29:51,908 --> 01:29:53,597
You have to go back to the police station.

1590
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,433
If you explain it to them, they'll understand.

1591
01:29:55,457 --> 01:29:56,967
You haven't done anything wrong.

1592
01:29:57,407 --> 01:30:01,995
You can't keep running away from your
problems. They'll catch up to you. You know this.

1593
01:30:02,131 --> 01:30:04,442
We've located the vehicle. We're going in.

1594
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:06,867
Look don't worry.

1595
01:30:07,065 --> 01:30:08,519
I'll come with you, okay?

1596
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:10,697
Then we can explain everything together.

1597
01:30:10,761 --> 01:30:11,949
Let go of me!

1598
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:13,366
I said let go!

1599
01:30:13,525 --> 01:30:14,093
Cut it out!

1600
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:14,854
Let go!

1601
01:30:16,918 --> 01:30:18,140
Get off of me!

1602
01:30:22,701 --> 01:30:23,983
Get out of my way.

1603
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:27,787
Hodaka, what are you doing?

1604
01:30:27,897 --> 01:30:31,193
Let me go to Hina. I have to see her!

1605
01:30:53,085 --> 01:30:54,300
Hodaka Morishima!

1606
01:30:54,538 --> 01:30:56,074
Drop the gun!

1607
01:30:56,098 --> 01:30:56,704
Whoa.

1608
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,816
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1609
01:30:58,841 --> 01:30:59,652
Everybody, calm down.

1610
01:31:00,081 --> 01:31:01,511
This is a misunderstanding.

1611
01:31:01,536 --> 01:31:03,085
Don't shoot. I can explain.

1612
01:31:03,387 --> 01:31:04,412
Hodaka, come on.

1613
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:07,894
Huh? What are you...?

1614
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,393
Don't do this. Put the weapon down.

1615
01:31:10,713 --> 01:31:12,332
I don't want to shoot you.

1616
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:25,879
Hodaka.

1617
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:27,146
It's gonna be okay.

1618
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:28,357
Just do what they say.

1619
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:29,891
What's wrong with you guys, anyway?

1620
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:31,129
Give him a break.

1621
01:31:31,154 --> 01:31:32,488
He's just a kid. It's...

1622
01:31:32,513 --> 01:31:33,920
Why can't you leave me alone?

1623
01:31:34,118 --> 01:31:35,652
Why are you standing in my way?

1624
01:31:35,985 --> 01:31:37,023
You don't know anything,

1625
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:38,973
because you choose to ignore the truth.

1626
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:40,377
So, please...

1627
01:31:41,213 --> 01:31:43,619
All I want is to see her again.

1628
01:31:44,659 --> 01:31:46,233
I have to see her!

1629
01:31:50,374 --> 01:31:52,160
Stay down!

1630
01:31:53,924 --> 01:31:55,363
Let me go!

1631
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:58,398
Get your hands off Hodaka right now.

1632
01:31:59,001 --> 01:32:00,218
Get off of him!

1633
01:32:02,513 --> 01:32:04,029
Son of a...

1634
01:32:04,466 --> 01:32:05,769
Hodaka, go!

1635
01:32:05,857 --> 01:32:06,961
What the...

1636
01:32:09,665 --> 01:32:10,569
Hold it!

1637
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:12,413
Hodaka!

1638
01:32:13,817 --> 01:32:14,740
Nagi?

1639
01:32:15,884 --> 01:32:17,720
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1640
01:32:17,822 --> 01:32:20,723
This is your fault, Hodaka, so you have to fix it!

1641
01:32:20,811 --> 01:32:22,685
Go and bring my sister back!

1642
01:32:57,477 --> 01:32:58,342
God...

1643
01:32:59,173 --> 01:33:01,153
please, please.

1644
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:02,655
Please!

1645
01:33:02,977 --> 01:33:04,332
I beg you!

1646
01:33:34,162 --> 01:33:35,797
Is that fish?

1647
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:37,170
In the sky?

1648
01:34:03,324 --> 01:34:05,400
Hina!

1649
01:34:22,988 --> 01:34:24,090
Hina!

1650
01:34:26,126 --> 01:34:27,726
Hina!

1651
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,366
Hina!

1652
01:34:46,905 --> 01:34:47,679
Hina!

1653
01:34:47,738 --> 01:34:48,556
Hodaka!

1654
01:34:55,588 --> 01:34:56,271
Hina!

1655
01:34:56,296 --> 01:34:57,192
Hodaka!

1656
01:34:58,138 --> 01:34:59,305
Just jump!

1657
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:12,388
Hina, I found you.

1658
01:35:12,511 --> 01:35:14,448
Hodaka. Hodaka!

1659
01:35:14,527 --> 01:35:15,823
Don't let go of my hands.

1660
01:35:34,556 --> 01:35:35,556
Hina!

1661
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:37,669
Hodaka!

1662
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:45,887
Let's go home.

1663
01:35:46,914 --> 01:35:49,067
But if I do, the weather,

1664
01:35:49,116 --> 01:35:50,517
it-it will go back to...

1665
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:51,101
Let it.

1666
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:53,197
I don't care. You've done enough.

1667
01:35:53,308 --> 01:35:56,183
You don't have to be the sunshine girl anymore!

1668
01:36:09,135 --> 01:36:11,540
I don't care if I ever see the sun again.

1669
01:36:12,185 --> 01:36:15,535
I care about you. I don't care about blue skies.

1670
01:36:16,642 --> 01:36:18,015
It'll be okay.

1671
01:36:18,299 --> 01:36:20,167
Let the weather stay crazy.

1672
01:36:59,947 --> 01:37:01,387
Pray for yourself...

1673
01:37:03,341 --> 01:37:04,135
Hina.

1674
01:37:20,591 --> 01:37:21,392
Huh?

1675
01:37:26,404 --> 01:37:27,714
Hodaka.

1676
01:38:12,779 --> 01:38:14,924
The rain started falling again that day,

1677
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:17,371
and since then, it hasn't stopped.

1678
01:38:18,101 --> 01:38:21,460
Slowly, it sank Tokyo, where it remains,

1679
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:23,262
submerged in water.

1680
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:27,129
The rain's still falling three years later.

1681
01:38:42,308 --> 01:38:47,586
The garden where we've grown

1682
01:38:48,454 --> 01:38:51,557
When we look back

1683
01:38:51,671 --> 01:38:54,961
It went so fast

1684
01:38:55,023 --> 01:39:00,757
Now we must Say goodbye

1685
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:03,642
We're leaving here

1686
01:39:03,777 --> 01:39:04,993
After all this...

1687
01:39:05,811 --> 01:39:07,479
 What's left for me to say?

1688
01:39:09,499 --> 01:39:11,960
Excuse me. Hodaka?

1689
01:39:13,938 --> 01:39:17,984
Uh, i-is it true that you're moving to Tokyo?

1690
01:39:18,019 --> 01:39:19,356
Uh, yeah.

1691
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:21,377
Just ask him already.

1692
01:39:21,575 --> 01:39:22,902
It's your last chance.

1693
01:39:22,981 --> 01:39:23,640
Mm...

1694
01:39:23,751 --> 01:39:26,162
Wait a minute. Could this be...

1695
01:39:26,187 --> 01:39:28,327
Um, I just... I...

1696
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:30,783
Well, there's something that
I've always wanted to ask you.

1697
01:39:30,808 --> 01:39:31,764
I don't believe it.

1698
01:39:31,889 --> 01:39:33,358
My first love confession?

1699
01:39:33,787 --> 01:39:35,709
Uh, Hodaka...

1700
01:39:36,118 --> 01:39:36,616
Huh?

1701
01:39:36,773 --> 01:39:37,670
I...

1702
01:39:38,077 --> 01:39:40,445
I heard you were wanted by the police in Tokyo.

1703
01:39:40,572 --> 01:39:41,492
Is it true?

1704
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:43,296
Huh?

1705
01:39:47,142 --> 01:39:48,420
That same summer,

1706
01:39:48,959 --> 01:39:50,081
three years ago,

1707
01:39:51,073 --> 01:39:52,662
I ended up getting arrested.

1708
01:39:53,806 --> 01:39:55,562
They charged me, and I stood trial.

1709
01:39:56,737 --> 01:39:59,471
I had to be on probation until I graduated high school.

1710
01:40:00,526 --> 01:40:03,355
The island, my parents' house, school...

1711
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:06,365
They were all the same old places where I spent my life.

1712
01:40:06,502 --> 01:40:09,084
But, actually, I was just biding my time,

1713
01:40:09,204 --> 01:40:10,872
waiting for graduation to come.

1714
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:13,812
That day...

1715
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:17,466
was the last time I saw Hina.

1716
01:40:18,839 --> 01:40:21,232
I have no idea what I'll think.

1717
01:40:23,258 --> 01:40:25,966
I haven't seen Tokyo since after it changed.

1718
01:40:27,093 --> 01:40:29,573
And I have no idea what I'll say to her.

1719
01:40:31,697 --> 01:40:34,670
Here's tomorrow's weather forecast for the Kanto region.

1720
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,373
A full day of rain is predicted.

1721
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:39,027
Now if I could just find a job.

1722
01:40:39,099 --> 01:40:42,512
Heavy rainfall in the mountain
regions. Lower, in the metropolitan areas,

1723
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:46,323
there is a chance of the rain letting
up periodically throughout the day.

1724
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:52,541
The high will be 59 degrees Fahrenheit, with the
same or slightly hotter temps in surrounding areas.

1725
01:40:53,335 --> 01:40:54,345
Oh, right.

1726
01:40:54,902 --> 01:40:56,275
Speaking of jobs...

1727
01:40:57,802 --> 01:41:00,137
Now for the forecast for the rest of the week.

1728
01:41:00,232 --> 01:41:01,787
It looks like rain is expected every day.

1729
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:02,853
The site's still up.

1730
01:41:09,636 --> 01:41:11,664
There was still one unanswered request.

1731
01:41:12,053 --> 01:41:13,427
It was from two years ago.

1732
01:41:13,618 --> 01:41:15,858
Next stop: Takashimadaira.

1733
01:41:16,025 --> 01:41:17,341
Takashimadaira.

1734
01:41:17,366 --> 01:41:20,100
Oh, it's you. Are you alone?

1735
01:41:20,378 --> 01:41:22,182
Where's your sunshine girl?

1736
01:41:22,261 --> 01:41:25,033
Oh, she's no longer a sunshine girl.

1737
01:41:25,461 --> 01:41:28,447
Actually, it's why I'm here... To tell you that.

1738
01:41:28,872 --> 01:41:31,000
Uh, thanks, but I'm okay.

1739
01:41:31,849 --> 01:41:34,040
So, how long have you been living here?

1740
01:41:34,489 --> 01:41:36,665
Last time, weren't you in a house downtown somewhere?

1741
01:41:36,864 --> 01:41:37,998
I had to move.

1742
01:41:38,023 --> 01:41:40,224
The entire area is underwater now.

1743
01:41:40,494 --> 01:41:41,694
Sorry about that.

1744
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:44,079
Why are you apologizing?

1745
01:41:48,813 --> 01:41:53,496
Did you know the entire area of
Tokyo used to be under the sea?

1746
01:41:54,084 --> 01:41:57,801
I think, until about 200 years ago.

1747
01:41:59,229 --> 01:42:00,915
Back when it was called Edo,

1748
01:42:01,114 --> 01:42:02,681
Tokyo was just a bay.

1749
01:42:03,187 --> 01:42:07,167
Little by little, humans... As well as
the weather... Changed this landscape.

1750
01:42:08,524 --> 01:42:09,741
Look at it now.

1751
01:42:09,994 --> 01:42:11,639
It's sort of reverted back,

1752
01:42:11,862 --> 01:42:13,848
back to its original self.

1753
01:42:15,652 --> 01:42:19,028
What is wrong with you? You've been thinking
about this crap for the last three years?

1754
01:42:19,562 --> 01:42:21,138
Hey, don't call it crap.

1755
01:42:21,162 --> 01:42:22,286
Stop acting like a kid.

1756
01:42:22,318 --> 01:42:24,748
You're about to start college.
You should focus on other things.

1757
01:42:24,796 --> 01:42:27,093
Yeah, but the two of us did something.

1758
01:42:27,204 --> 01:42:29,070
Did what? You think you caused this?

1759
01:42:29,095 --> 01:42:31,851
You really think you're
responsible for changing the world?

1760
01:42:34,323 --> 01:42:36,079
That's precisely why I called it crap.

1761
01:42:36,404 --> 01:42:38,032
You don't matter in the scheme of things.

1762
01:42:38,057 --> 01:42:39,575
Don't flatter yourself.

1763
01:42:39,678 --> 01:42:41,472
Oh. Check it out.

1764
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:43,174
It's from my last date with my daughter.

1765
01:42:43,284 --> 01:42:45,995
Natsumi and Nagi were the third and fourth wheel, though.

1766
01:42:46,256 --> 01:42:51,212
Now, for crying out loud, will you stop
brooding over all this nonsense and just go see her?

1767
01:42:51,355 --> 01:42:52,802
I don't know why you haven't already.

1768
01:42:52,827 --> 01:42:56,646
I was on probation, so I wasn't supposed
to, and I didn't want to cause her any trouble.

1769
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,462
Plus, even if I wanted to, she doesn't have a cell phone.

1770
01:42:59,565 --> 01:43:01,083
Also, I'm super nervous.

1771
01:43:01,194 --> 01:43:03,170
I don't even know what to say to her.

1772
01:43:09,392 --> 01:43:09,970
Rain?

1773
01:43:10,575 --> 01:43:11,997
You've gotten so big.

1774
01:43:12,753 --> 01:43:15,961
Go on. Get out of here. Can't
you see I got work to do? Beat it.

1775
01:43:16,072 --> 01:43:17,957
Go and find her. You know you want to.

1776
01:43:18,844 --> 01:43:20,094
Thank you for your time.

1777
01:43:20,182 --> 01:43:21,309
Nice to meet you.

1778
01:43:22,261 --> 01:43:22,729
Hey.

1779
01:43:22,959 --> 01:43:23,610
Huh?

1780
01:43:24,313 --> 01:43:27,139
Don't sweat the small stuff, big man.

1781
01:43:28,127 --> 01:43:29,508
The world is crazy.

1782
01:43:30,014 --> 01:43:32,383
It always has been, always will be.

1783
01:43:42,221 --> 01:43:43,849
The next stop is Hamamatsucho.

1784
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:45,862
So where do you want to go to lunch?

1785
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,530
You're always so incredibly positive.

1786
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:48,557
You really think so?

1787
01:43:48,581 --> 01:43:49,299
The flowers should be

1788
01:43:49,323 --> 01:43:50,107
in full bloom.

1789
01:43:50,131 --> 01:43:50,951
That's what I hear.

1790
01:44:01,797 --> 01:44:04,577
Used to be under the sea.

1791
01:44:06,253 --> 01:44:07,627
The world's crazy.

1792
01:44:07,969 --> 01:44:09,909
Always has been, always will be.

1793
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,035
So that means it's no one's fault that it's like this now.

1794
01:44:17,318 --> 01:44:18,957
Is this what I should say to her?

1795
01:44:19,917 --> 01:44:20,959
I don't know.

1796
01:44:52,867 --> 01:44:55,027
No. They're wrong.

1797
01:44:55,217 --> 01:44:58,682
That day, I... No, we changed the world.

1798
01:44:58,904 --> 01:45:00,092
I made a choice.

1799
01:45:00,287 --> 01:45:01,366
I chose her.

1800
01:45:01,604 --> 01:45:02,987
I chose this world,

1801
01:45:03,219 --> 01:45:05,284
and I choose to live in it!

1802
01:45:06,346 --> 01:45:07,538
Hina!

1803
01:45:13,246 --> 01:45:14,467
Hodaka!

1804
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:23,449
Hodaka, what's wrong?

1805
01:45:23,803 --> 01:45:24,789
Are you okay?

1806
01:45:25,791 --> 01:45:26,577
Yeah.

1807
01:45:28,619 --> 01:45:29,626
Yeah, I'm fine.

1808
01:45:29,912 --> 01:45:31,128
You know what, Hina?

1809
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:34,013
We're gonna be all right.
