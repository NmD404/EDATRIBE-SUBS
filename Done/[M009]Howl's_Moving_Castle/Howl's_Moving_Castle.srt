1
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,428
Sophie, we just closed the shop. You've done enough work.

2
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,451
Why don't you come out with us this time?

3
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,852
No, I'd better finish this. You go and have fun.

4
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,466
All right, suit yourself.

5
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,188
Let's go, girls.

6
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:26,700
Wait for me!

7
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:27,588
I'm ready.

8
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,733
Do I look okay?

9
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:30,466
Oh! It's Howl's castle!

10
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:30,967
Where?

11
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:31,509
Howl?

12
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,638
I've never seen it close!

13
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:37,076
Do you think Howl will go into town?

14
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,529
He's gone.

15
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:48,381
No, he's just hiding in the fog from those planes.

16
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,338
Did you hear what happened to
that girl Martha from south haven?

17
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,382
They say Howl tore her heart out.

18
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,030
I'm too scared to go out!

19
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,609
What?

20
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,969
Don't worry, he only preys on pretty girls.

21
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,223
All right, let's go.

22
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,613
You girls are mean.

23
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:05,137
It's not funny.

24
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:10,196
Hey. Looks like a little mouse lost its way.

25
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,389
Oh, no, I'm not lost.

26
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,248
This little mouse looks thirsty.
We should take her for a cup of tea.

27
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,370
No, thanks, my sister's expecting me.

28
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:20,570
She's pretty cute for a mouse.

29
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,177
How old are you anyway? You live around here?

30
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,915
Leave me alone.

31
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:28,205
You see? Your moustache scares all the girls.

32
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,716
So? I think she's even cuter when she's scared.

33
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,478
There you are, sweetheart.

34
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:34,950
Sorry I'm late. I was looking everywhere for you.

35
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,353
Hey, we're busy here.

36
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,462
Are you really?

37
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,274
It looked to me like the two of you were just leaving.

38
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,378
Hup!

39
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:43,444
Hup!

40
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,215
<i>Whoa!</i>

41
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,809
Don't hold it against them.
They're actually not all that bad.

42
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,337
Where to? I'll be your escort this evening.

43
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:58,347
Oh, I'm, um, just going to the bakery.

44
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:00,485
Don't get alarmed, but I'm being followed.

45
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,851
Act normal.

46
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,416
Sorry. Looks like you're involved.

47
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,486
This way.

48
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:39,271
Hold on.

49
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,877
Now, straighten your legs and start walking.

50
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:54,466
See? Not so hard, is it?

51
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,728
You are a natural.

52
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,372
I'll make sure I've draw them off.

53
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,739
But wait a bit before you head back outside.

54
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,757
Okay.

55
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,482
That's my girl.

56
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,448
Excuse me, could we trouble you for some more coffee?

57
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:47,425
There you go.

58
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,210
Do you have any Lettie-shaped cookies?

59
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:49,730
I'd like buy some those.

60
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:50,666
Here.

61
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,405
What time do you get off?

62
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,431
She what?

63
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,196
Hey! I'm over here, what're you doing?

64
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:56,935
Hey!

65
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:01,416
Sophie?

66
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:02,918
Lettie.

67
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:03,875
What's going on?

68
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,653
Someone just told me you floated down onto our balcony.

69
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,757
So that did happen. It wasn't a dream.

70
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:12,078
Lettie, would you like to use my office?

71
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:15,215
I should really get back to work. Thank you, though.

72
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,792
Wow. He must have been a wizard, then.

73
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,381
But he was so kind to me.

74
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:25,090
He rescued me, Lettie.

75
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,419
Of course he did. He was trying to steal your heart!

76
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,819
You are so lucky, Sophie.

77
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,233
If that wizard were Howl, he would have eaten it.

78
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,117
No, he wouldn't. Howl only does that to beautiful girls.

79
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,795
Don't give me that.

80
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:42,077
You need to be more careful. It's dangerous out there.

81
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,208
Even the Witch of the Waste is back on the prowl.

82
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:47,782
Are you listening?

83
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:48,901
Huh?

84
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,482
Ugh!

85
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:56,012
Lettie, the chocolate eclairs are done.

86
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:58,096
Okay. I'll be right there.

87
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:58,919
Thanks.

88
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,767
All right. I'd better get going then.

89
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,180
I just wanted to make sure that you were doing okay.

90
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,288
Hello, Lettie.

91
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:09,573
Hi, how are you doing?

92
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:13,801
Sophie, do you really want to spend
the rest of your life in that hat shop?

93
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,057
The shop was just so important to Father.

94
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,700
And I'm the eldest, I don't mind.

95
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm not asking what Father would have wanted.

96
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:22,859
I want to know what you want.

97
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,986
Well...

98
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:25,655
See you later, Lettie.

99
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,084
Good seeing you again.

100
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:27,918
You, too.

101
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,270
I'd better be going.

102
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,670
It's your life, Sophie.

103
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,553
Do something for yourself for once. Will you?

104
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:33,354
Bye, Lettie.

105
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,302
I'm sorry, but the shop's closed now, ma'am.

106
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:46,249
I could have sworn I locked
that door. Must have forgotten.

107
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:53,343
What a tacky shop. I've never seen such tacky little hats.

108
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:57,452
Yet you're by far the tackiest thing in here.

109
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,969
I'm afraid you will have to leave now.

110
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,312
The door's over here, ma'am. We're closed.

111
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:14,055
Standing up to the Witch of the Waste, that's plucky.

112
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:15,820
The Witch of the Waste?

113
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:26,656
The best part of that spell is
you can't tell anyone about it.

114
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:28,881
My regards to Howl.

115
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,748
Oh. No.

116
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:56,803
Oh!

117
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,895
That's really me, isn't it? I've got to stay calm.

118
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:38,850
I've got to stay calm!

119
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,791
Now, there's no use panicking, Sophie. Oh!

120
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:46,559
It's a bad dream, that's all. Just go inside, go to bed.

121
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:50,475
You're gonna be fine, Sophie. You're gonna be fine.

122
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,806
Got to stay calm.

123
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:04,841
Look who's here!

124
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:05,984
You're back! There she is!

125
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,033
Welcome to home,ma'am Look at you!

126
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:10,766
What do you think? It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

127
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:12,225
It's gorgeous!

128
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,406
I know ! Our customers will love it ! Sophie !

129
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,001
Sophie ?

130
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:20,108
I'm afraid your daughter hasn't
come downstairs yet today, ma'am.

131
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,342
That's strange. I wonder what's wrong.

132
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,100
Sophie !

133
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:29,591
Sophie !

134
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,965
Sophie !

135
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:39,329
Don't come in here. I've got a bad
cold. I don't want you to catch it.

136
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,825
You sound ghastly, like some 90-year-old woman.

137
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,818
I'll just stay in bed all day, so you go on.

138
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,228
Well, if you insist.

139
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:53,525
Up we go.

140
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,447
This isn't so bad, now, is it?
You're still in pretty good shape.

141
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,949
And your clothes finally suit you.

142
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,779
But you can't stay here like this for long.

143
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,912
Oh! Being old is worse than I thought.

144
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,994
They say their prince is missing.

145
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,924
And they're blaming us.

146
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,079
Yeah, and it sounds like they're gonna start a war.

147
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,927
Nobody wants to go to war.

148
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,428
Let's hope the prince turns up soon.

149
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,326
Excuse me, could you use some help?

150
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:01,615
I'll be fine, but thanks for
offering. That was really kind.

151
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,158
Sure, there's room in back if
you like, but where are you headed?

152
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:08,105
Just a little ways farther than where you're going.

153
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:14,835
You're crazy if you do this, Grandma!

154
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,792
There's nothing but witches and wizards out there!

155
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,253
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

156
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:22,431
She's going to the Wastes by herself?

157
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,647
She says she's looking for her younger sister.

158
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:41,840
I'll never get there with these legs.

159
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:46,440
At least my teeth haven't fallen out yet.

160
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:58,595
That would make a nice cane. Up we go.

161
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,563
Oh.

162
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,113
Might be too big.

163
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:20,030
This is one stubborn branch.

164
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:24,845
You're not getting the best of this old lady.

165
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,488
Oh!

166
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:39,020
Just a scarecrow!

167
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,443
I was afraid you were one of those blob men.

168
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,938
But how're you standing on your own like that?

169
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:49,427
Your head's a turnip.

170
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:52,962
I've always hated turnips, ever since I was little.

171
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,529
At least you're not upside down now.

172
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,126
So long.

173
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:06,190
It's too cold.

174
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,908
And I can still see the town. I've barely moved.

175
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:12,149
Hmm?

176
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,928
Go away! Quit following me!

177
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,789
There's no need to thank me, you don't owe me a thing.

178
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,517
I'm sure you have some kind of spell on you,

179
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,169
and I've had more than enough of witches and spells.

180
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:28,659
So, just go find some field and stand in it!

181
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,699
Thank you, this cane is perfect, it's just what I need.

182
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,882
If you'd like to do me one more favor,

183
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,710
you could run off and find me a place to stay.

184
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:11,216
I seem to become quite cunning in my old age.

185
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,438
A battleship! Oh!

186
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:28,529
Why do you get so cold when you're old?

187
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,542
I'm fatter than ever, yet the wind blows right through me.

188
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:51,553
Someone's got a fire going. Maybe there's a cabin nearby.

189
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,077
You turnip-head! That's Howl's castle!

190
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:18,074
That is not what I meant when I asked for a place to stay.

191
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,017
Look at that. They call this a castle?

192
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,156
Ah!

193
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,890
Is that the way in?

194
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:57,998
Slow down!

195
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,533
For heaven's sake.

196
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,617
Make up your mind. Are you gonna let me in or not?

197
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:07,951
<i>Whoa!</i>

198
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:12,504
Oh, my shawl!

199
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:27,838
It's nice and warm in there, so I'm going in.

200
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,312
Oh, my shawl, thank you.

201
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:34,583
I'm sure Howl won't eat the heart
of a shriveled, old lady like me.

202
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,004
It's been a pleasure of meeting you.

203
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,892
Even if you are my least favorite vegetable.

204
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,227
Take care, Turnip-head.

205
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:15,372
Ah.

206
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,189
Here we go.

207
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,414
What a dump.

208
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,005
When I think castle, this is not what I picture.

209
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:48,974
Well, one nice thing about
getting old is nothing frightens you.

210
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:01,362
I don't envy you, lady. That is one bad curse.

211
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,107
Curses are tough. You're gonna have
a hard time getting rid of that one.

212
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,545
The fire spoke!

213
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,255
Let me guess,the curse won't
allow you to talk about it, right?

214
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,075
Are you Howl?

215
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,610
No, I'm an extremely powerful fire demon named Calcifer.

216
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,478
I just like to do that once in a while.

217
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:21,799
A fire demon. Well, then, you
should be able to break my curse.

218
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,256
Maybe, maybe not.

219
00:22:23,304 --> 00:22:26,011
Listen, if you can find a way
to break the spell that's on me,

220
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,754
then I'll break the spell that's on you, you got it?

221
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,153
If you're a demon, how do I know I can trust you?

222
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,520
You promise to help me if I help you?

223
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,564
I don't know, lady. Demons don't make promises.

224
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,791
Then go find someone else.

225
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,878
Come on! You should feel sorry for me!

226
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,828
That spell keeps me stuck in this castle,
and Howl treats me like I'm his slave.

227
00:22:46,853 --> 00:22:49,775
It burns me up. "You got to keep
the water hot, the rooms warm,"

228
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,905
"Keep the castle moving."

229
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,355
Oh, that's rough.

230
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,622
Come on! You ever try to move a castle?

231
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,959
If you can figure out how to
break this thing I'm in with Howl,

232
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,587
then you can break my spell.

233
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,280
After that, I can easily break the spell that's on you.

234
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:05,133
All right, it's a deal.

235
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,664
Hey, lady? Lady?

236
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,167
Hello? Lady? Hello? Hey, hey! Lady? Lady?

237
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:20,347
Hey, let me get over there. Some big help you're gonna be.

238
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,463
Hey, who's this lady?

239
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,822
Porthaven door.

240
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:19,442
How'd she get in here?

241
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,286
Stand by.

242
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,023
Mr. Mayor, good day.

243
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,308
Good afternoon, sir.

244
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:39,019
Would the great Wizard Jenkins be at home?

245
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,605
I am afraid that my master is out at the moment.

246
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:43,681
I speak for him in his absence.

247
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:49,213
An invitation from His Majesty the
King. The time for war is upon us.

248
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:53,518
His Majesty requires that every
witch and wizard aid our homeland.

249
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,971
Wizard Jenkins must report to the palace immediately.

250
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:57,833
That is all.

251
00:24:57,858 --> 00:24:59,063
War...

252
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:03,178
I can't believe it's come to this.

253
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,522
And what do you think you're doing here, Grandma?

254
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,611
Calcifer said that I could come in.

255
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:11,210
I did not. She just wandered in here from the Wastes.

256
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,212
She's from the Wastes?

257
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:16,145
How do we know that she's not a witch?

258
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,267
Do you think I'd let a witch in here?

259
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,197
Porthaven door again!

260
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,184
Must be a customer.

261
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:27,243
Stand by.

262
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,255
Yes, my dear child?

263
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,608
My mom sent me to pick up a spell.

264
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,713
Ah, yes, do come in.

265
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:36,517
Okay.

266
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,202
Just keep quiet and don't cause any trouble, Grandma.

267
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,231
It's not the Wastes.

268
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,066
Excuse me, Granny, are you a witch, too?

269
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,831
That's right. I'm the scariest witch of them all.

270
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:09,184
Dust your ship with this powder
and the winds will favor it.

271
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,122
Thanks.

272
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,525
Farewell, child.

273
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,448
Quit telling lies to our customers.

274
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,971
What about you? You're wearing a disguise.

275
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,104
I have to. I'm practicing my magic.

276
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:25,125
Hmm?

277
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,475
It's the Kingsbury door!

278
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,922
Stand by.

279
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,263
Good day. Would this be the
residence of the great Wizard Pendragon?

280
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:39,389
It Is.

281
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,029
I bear an invitation from His Majesty the King.

282
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:45,079
Please inform Mr. Pendragon that all witches and wizards

283
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,590
are required to report for duty at the palace.

284
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,800
I will inform him right away.

285
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,429
This is the royal city, isn't it?

286
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:10,480
Move in, Grandma, or you'll lose your nose.

287
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,233
And stop wandering around!

288
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,638
Leave it alone, Grandma. I'm getting angry.

289
00:27:57,578 --> 00:27:59,794
This is a magic house, isn't it?

290
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:00,494
Oh!

291
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,115
So, tell me, where does the black one lead?

292
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,831
Only Master Howl knows that.

293
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,866
I need some breakfast. I'm starved.

294
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,942
Don't you want to have some bacon and eggs?

295
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,827
Yeah, but we can't use the fire. Master Howl's not here.

296
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,904
Don't worry, I can cook.

297
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:33,378
It doesn't matter if you can cook,
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

298
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,085
That's right, lady. I'm not taking any orders from you.

299
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,867
Oh, there's my hat.

300
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,188
That's better.

301
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,782
All right, Calcifer. Let's get cooking.

302
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,345
I don't cook! I'm a scary and powerful fire demon!

303
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,225
How would you like a bucket of cold water in your face?

304
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,736
Or maybe I should tell Howl about our bargain?

305
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:02,781
Oh! Stupid me! I never should have let her in here.

306
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,697
So, what'll it be?

307
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:11,544
That's right. That's a good fire.

308
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,421
Here's another curse. May all your bacon burn.

309
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:19,049
Calcifer's doing what she says.

310
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:21,830
I think I'd like some tea, too. Do you have a kettle?

311
00:29:21,855 --> 00:29:22,569
Sure.

312
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:24,468
Hey, what are you doing?

313
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:26,932
Don't get the kettle! Who's side are you on, anyway?

314
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:28,613
Michael, what are you doing?

315
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:29,186
Huh?

316
00:29:32,224 --> 00:29:34,789
Master Howl, the king's messengers were here.

317
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,766
They said you have to report to the palace

318
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,197
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

319
00:29:49,718 --> 00:29:53,086
Calcifer? You're being so obedient.

320
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,349
Not on purpose. She bullied me.

321
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,891
Not just anybody can do that.

322
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,340
And you are who?

323
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,735
Uh, you can just call me Grandma Sophie.

324
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,678
I'm your new cleaning lady. I just started work today.

325
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:07,981
Give that to me.

326
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,403
Oh!

327
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:15,712
Hand me two more slices of that
bacon and six more of those eggs.

328
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:32,270
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

329
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:35,281
Mmm.

330
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:36,568
Yummy.

331
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:48,096
So, then, who hired you to clean?

332
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:53,018
Uh, Calcifer did. He's disgusted
by how dirty it is in here.

333
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,341
Hmm.

334
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,390
Michael, get the plates.

335
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,477
Wait a second, you're all gonna
eat while I do all the work?

336
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,725
Come have some breakfast, Sophie.

337
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,592
Take a seat.

338
00:31:12,695 --> 00:31:13,130
Hmm.

339
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,599
Which do you want?

340
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,030
You only get one 'cause the rest are dirty.

341
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,313
Looks like I've got my work cut out for me.

342
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,357
Bread, Michael?

343
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:39,420
Thanks.

344
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,803
Sophie?

345
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:43,765
Yes, thank you.

346
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,770
So, friends, enjoy. Bon appétit.

347
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,826
Bon appétit.

348
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,854
I can't remember the last time we had a real breakfast.

349
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,768
Even the manners are a mess in this house.

350
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,962
So, what do you have hidden in your pocket, Sophie?

351
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:07,385
Huh? Oh...

352
00:32:16,515 --> 00:32:17,801
What is this?

353
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:18,666
Give it to me.

354
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:19,478
Hmm.

355
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:21,035
Oh!

356
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:28,613
Scorch marks. Howl, can you read them?

357
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:32,118
That is an ancient sorcery. And quite powerful, too.

358
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,294
it's from the Witch of the Waste?

359
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:37,011
"You who swallowed a falling star,

360
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:40,911
"Or heartless man, your heart shall soon belong to me."

361
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,598
That can't be good for the table.

362
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:58,168
Wow! It's gone!

363
00:32:58,347 --> 00:33:01,132
The mark may be gone, but the spell is still there.

364
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,152
Excuse me, my friends, please continue your meal.

365
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:08,593
Calcifer, move the castle 60 miles to the west.

366
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:16,462
And while you're at it, make hot water for my bath.

367
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:19,174
Fine. Like moving the castle isn't hard enough?

368
00:33:19,724 --> 00:33:22,321
You're not working for the Witch of the Waste, are you?

369
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,946
I would never work for that witch! She's the one who...

370
00:33:31,212 --> 00:33:34,444
I'm actually a...

371
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:42,437
If I ever get my hands on that
witch, I'm going to wring her fat neck!

372
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:44,553
Finish your breakfast!

373
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:49,471
I've had enough of this!

374
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,928
You bugs better run before I bite your heads off!

375
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:58,504
I'm sick of being treated like some timid little old lady.

376
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:05,544
Hello, sir, is my potion ready?

377
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:08,992
Come back later. There's a witch on a rampage in there.

378
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,564
Sophie, please!

379
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:21,005
Sophie! Please help me. I'm going out!

380
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,596
Please, get me some firewood, quick!

381
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,870
Hey, please help me. Wait, what are you doing?

382
00:34:28,895 --> 00:34:31,878
Don't! I'll fall! You crazy lady with tongs!

383
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,851
You'll be fine.

384
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:33,463
I'll fall! Help!

385
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:34,965
I'm just sweeping out the ashes.

386
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,425
No, I'm not fine! Please! I'm going out!

387
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,791
Please. I'm falling.

388
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,419
Help, I'm falling!

389
00:34:52,018 --> 00:34:56,649
Sophie, hurry up, please. Hurry, please.

390
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,176
<i>Whoa!</i>

391
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:22,345
I'd appreciate it if you didn't torment my friend.

392
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:29,345
Master Howl, are you going out now?

393
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:36,409
Michael, make sure the cleaning lady
doesn't get carried away while I'm gone.

394
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,350
Sophie, what did you do now?

395
00:35:43,606 --> 00:35:45,600
She almost smothered me!

396
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,064
If I die, Howl dies, too, I hope you know.

397
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,524
Oh, be quiet. You're all right.

398
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:54,134
Now quit bothering me, I've got a job to do.

399
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,582
Wait, you can't come up here!

400
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,649
Whatever you don't want me to clean, better hide it now.

401
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,349
Save my room for last, okay?

402
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,993
These little outbursts seem to be giving me some energy.

403
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,221
What a mess.

404
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,342
Oh!

405
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,161
Oh!

406
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:56,690
Incredible! Calcifer! Calcifer!

407
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,107
Are you the one moving the castle?

408
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,219
Of course I am. No one else does any work around here.

409
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,166
I am thoroughly impressed!

410
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:06,536
You are a first-class fire demon. I like your spark.

411
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:13,162
She likes my spark! Ha-ha!

412
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,814
Ah! Not ready! Not ready!

413
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:54,998
It's beautiful.

414
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,890
Yeah. It's called Star Lake.

415
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,007
Hey, what's that stick doing in there?

416
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,505
Oh, dear. Give me a hand, Michael.

417
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,545
It's a scarecrow.

418
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,922
Yep, I've been calling him Turnip-head.

419
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,138
Somehow he always manages to get stuck upside down.

420
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,979
He keeps following me everywhere.
Seems to have taken a liking to me.

421
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:37,649
That's weird. Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

422
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,477
Oh, yes! I'm the worst kind of
witch ever, the kind that cleans.

423
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:13,544
Quit pulling so hard, Turnip-head!

424
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,812
I think he likes doing the laundry.

425
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:27,719
Looks like he'll have it dry in no time.

426
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:34,223
I bet he's some kind of demon.
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him at all.

427
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,975
You're right. He probably is a demon.

428
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,599
But he led me here, So maybe he's the good kind.

429
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:26,309
We got all the laundry put away, Sophie.

430
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:27,886
Oh, thank you, Michael.

431
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:31,406
When you're old, all you want
to do is stare at the scenery.

432
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:36,434
It's so strange, I've never felt so peaceful before.

433
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:56,026
Whew.

434
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:58,932
You okay? I mean, you smell terrible.

435
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:18,558
You shouldn't keep flying around like that.

436
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:21,696
Soon you won't be able to turn back into a human.

437
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,275
Isn't this great? Sophie put these here for me.

438
00:42:31,814 --> 00:42:33,691
This war is terrible.

439
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,561
They've bombed from the southern
coast to the northern border.

440
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,992
It's all in flames now.

441
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,557
I can't stand the fire in gunpowder.

442
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,519
Those dopey guys have absolutely no manners.

443
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:46,231
My own kind attacked me today.

444
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,566
Who, the Witch of the Waste?

445
00:42:47,591 --> 00:42:51,315
No, some hack wizards who turned
themselves into monsters for the king.

446
00:42:51,823 --> 00:42:54,484
Those wizards are going to regret doing that.

447
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,075
They'll never change back into humans.

448
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,286
After the war, they won't recall they ever were human.

449
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,140
Hey, aren't you supposed to report to the king, too?

450
00:43:03,592 --> 00:43:06,595
I'm tired. Make some hot water for my bath.

451
00:43:06,768 --> 00:43:08,852
What? Not again.

452
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,571
Is Howl back?

453
00:43:42,596 --> 00:43:44,740
Yes. He's wasting all my hot water again.

454
00:43:50,176 --> 00:43:51,828
I don't know why we're doing this.

455
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,759
Master Howl hardly eats anything.

456
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,640
Too bad.

457
00:43:54,903 --> 00:43:55,833
Good morning.

458
00:43:55,858 --> 00:43:56,673
Good morning.

459
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:03,391
Don't you love early morning
markets? And just look at the water!

460
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,693
I've never seen the ocean before! It's beautiful!

461
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,409
It always looks like that.

462
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:19,509
Hmm. I hate potatoes.

463
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:20,294
Pay up.

464
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,106
Thanks, have a nice day.

465
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:23,679
Thank you. Come again.

466
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,628
All our fish were caught fresh this morning.

467
00:44:29,582 --> 00:44:31,489
Hmm, I hate fish.

468
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,629
One of our ships is in the harbor!

469
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,964
It looks like it's on fire!

470
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,058
Looks like there's been a serious battle.

471
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:39,696
What happened? Sorry, lady, we're closed.

472
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,602
The ship, it's sinking!

473
00:45:04,437 --> 00:45:06,384
Come on, Sophie, let's get a better look.

474
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,370
No, I've seen all I can take. Let's go home.

475
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,937
I can't believe this. That's
almost the advanced battleship.

476
00:45:17,443 --> 00:45:19,389
The witch's henchmen are here.

477
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:19,930
What?

478
00:45:19,955 --> 00:45:21,025
Quiet down.

479
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:23,861
They're only a few feet away.

480
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,559
He's gone.

481
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:33,443
I don't understand why no one else seemed to notice him.

482
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,988
Look! There they are!

483
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,032
That plane! That's what dropped the bombs!

484
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:45,145
Look, Sophie. It's the enemy's airship!

485
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,853
Sophie! Wait up! Sophie!

486
00:45:53,236 --> 00:45:55,878
Ignore the flyers. They're enemy propaganda.

487
00:46:00,783 --> 00:46:02,426
Sophie, are you okay?

488
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:10,545
I just need a glass of water.

489
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:11,722
I'll get it.

490
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:32,598
Sophie! You sabotaged me! Look!
Look what you've done to my hair!

491
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,141
Look!

492
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,604
What a pretty color.

493
00:46:35,898 --> 00:46:37,264
It's hideous!

494
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:40,624
You completely ruined my magic potions in the bathroom.

495
00:46:41,531 --> 00:46:44,200
I just organized things, Howl, nothing's ruined.

496
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,773
Wrong! Wrong!

497
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:49,396
I specifically ordered you not to get carried away!

498
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:54,466
Now I'm repulsive. I can't live like this.

499
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,359
Come on, it's not that bad.

500
00:47:06,226 --> 00:47:09,305
You should look at it now. This shade is even better.

501
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:10,569
I give up.

502
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:14,437
I see no point in living if I can't be beautiful.

503
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,477
Howl, cut it out. Howl, no, stop it.

504
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,681
He's calling the Spirits of Darkness.

505
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,919
I saw him do this once before when a girl dumped him.

506
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,848
Now, Howl, you're all right.
We'll just dye your hair back again.

507
00:47:42,253 --> 00:47:44,383
Okay? Oh!

508
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,881
Fine! So, you think you've got it bad?

509
00:47:55,951 --> 00:47:59,113
I've never once been beautiful in my entire life!

510
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:03,370
I've had enough of this place!

511
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,881
Thank you, Turnip-head. How did you get to be so kind?

512
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:49,235
Sophie, get back inside, we
need your help! Howl's in trouble!

513
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:51,626
Howl, cut it out, cut it out! I'm gonna drown!

514
00:48:51,651 --> 00:48:55,057
I'm drowning here, Howl. Sophie! Sophie, help him, please!

515
00:48:55,194 --> 00:48:56,950
Sophie! Do something!

516
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,716
Such drama.

517
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:02,224
Is he dead?

518
00:49:02,249 --> 00:49:04,984
No, he's fine. He's just throwing a tantrum.

519
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:06,579
Come on. Give me a hand.

520
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:08,083
Okay.

521
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,388
Get the hot water running.

522
00:49:13,427 --> 00:49:14,038
Right.

523
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,708
Come on, Howl, you can still walk.

524
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,063
Get him cleaned up, Michael.

525
00:49:30,088 --> 00:49:30,896
I will.

526
00:49:33,114 --> 00:49:34,782
Now I have to mop again.

527
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:46,517
This says they've landed on the coast already.

528
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,439
Where?

529
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:48,106
North.

530
00:49:58,284 --> 00:50:00,421
Howl, I'm coming in.

531
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,463
I brought you some warm milk. Want a sip?

532
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:17,780
I'll leave it here for you, then.
Try to drink it before it gets cold.

533
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,184
Sophie, wait.

534
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,694
Do you want some milk?

535
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:46,121
The Witch of the Waste is trying to find my castle.

536
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:51,159
I saw her henchmen at the harbor.

537
00:50:51,445 --> 00:50:53,859
I am such a big coward, all I do is hide.

538
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:57,569
And all of this magic is just to keep everybody away.

539
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,873
I can't stand how scared I am.

540
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:05,134
Howl, why is the Witch of the
Waste trying to hunt you down?

541
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:09,114
She was once quite beautiful, so I decided to pursue her.

542
00:51:09,312 --> 00:51:13,483
Then I realized she wasn't. So, as usual, I ran away.

543
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,244
I can't run much longer, though.
I have to report to the palace,

544
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,992
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

545
00:51:22,032 --> 00:51:24,408
How many aliases do you have, anyway?

546
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,680
As many as I need to keep my freedom.

547
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:27,817
Hmm.

548
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:30,629
Just refuse the king's invitation.

549
00:51:30,748 --> 00:51:31,677
See that?

550
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:35,492
That's the oath I took when I
entered the Royal Sorcery Academy.

551
00:51:35,578 --> 00:51:38,145
I must report to the palace whenever summoned.

552
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,974
You know, Howl, I think that you should see the king.

553
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:42,960
What?

554
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,646
Give him a piece of your mind.
Tell him this war is pointless.

555
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,751
And you refuse to take part, huh?

556
00:51:51,757 --> 00:51:54,534
You obviously don't know what these people are like.

557
00:51:55,038 --> 00:51:56,540
But he's our king.

558
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,983
He should want to hear what all his citizens have to say.

559
00:52:01,065 --> 00:52:04,632
I got it! Why don't you go to the palace for me?

560
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,600
Huh?

561
00:52:06,218 --> 00:52:08,595
Just say that you're Pendragon's mother,

562
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:12,616
and your son is such a cowardly
wizard, he's too afraid to show his face.

563
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:15,466
Maybe then Madame Suliman will finally give up on me.

564
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:17,415
Who's Madame Suliman?

565
00:52:21,245 --> 00:52:22,644
You're wearing that hat?

566
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:25,170
After all the magic I used to make your dress pretty?

567
00:52:25,195 --> 00:52:26,600
Take care of him, Michael.

568
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:27,323
Mmm-hmm.

569
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:29,626
Good luck.

570
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,743
This charm will guarantee your safe return.

571
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,763
Don't worry. I'll follow behind you in disguise.

572
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:47,400
Now. Off you go.

573
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,126
Why do I feel like this is not going to work?

574
00:53:06,582 --> 00:53:08,811
I wonder what Howl disguised himself as.

575
00:53:08,836 --> 00:53:10,354
Surely not a crow.

576
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,656
Can't be a pigeon, he's too flamboyant for that.

577
00:53:25,797 --> 00:53:27,132
That could be him.

578
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,171
Look how far I still have to go.

579
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,002
Come on! Step right up!

580
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,430
Howl? You disguised yourself as an old dog?

581
00:54:31,989 --> 00:54:34,807
You couldn't think of something a bit more useful?

582
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,748
Do you know how hard it is to do things when you're old?

583
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:44,120
Look who's here. The tacky little girl from that hat shop.

584
00:54:44,374 --> 00:54:45,572
Witch of the Waste.

585
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:49,071
Thank you for handing my scorching love note to Howl.

586
00:54:51,365 --> 00:54:53,263
How's he doing, by the way?

587
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:55,401
He's acting like a big baby.

588
00:54:55,443 --> 00:54:58,863
And he's working me to the bone as his cleaning lady.

589
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,890
How delightful.

590
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:06,325
So, tell me, what business do you have here at the palace?

591
00:55:06,497 --> 00:55:09,034
Job hunting. I'm sick of working for Howl.

592
00:55:09,383 --> 00:55:10,968
And what about yourself?

593
00:55:11,185 --> 00:55:13,452
I received a royal invitation.

594
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:18,854
That idiot Suliman finally
realized how much she needs my powers.

595
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:22,619
If you're so great, why don't
you break this spell you put on me?

596
00:55:22,829 --> 00:55:24,279
I'm sorry, dear.

597
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:28,458
My talent lies in casting spells, not breaking them.

598
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,325
Bye, Granny.

599
00:55:31,526 --> 00:55:34,966
Now, just wait a minute! You get back here right now!

600
00:55:35,976 --> 00:55:39,152
If I didn't have you to worry
about, I would have clobbered her.

601
00:55:56,756 --> 00:55:58,420
What on earth is wrong with you two?

602
00:55:58,564 --> 00:55:59,539
Sorry, ma'am.

603
00:55:59,626 --> 00:56:01,959
Vehicles are prohibited beyond this point.

604
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,735
You must continue on foot.

605
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,100
That Suliman.

606
00:56:05,192 --> 00:56:09,485
Using her magic to force me to
climb all those godforsaken stairs.

607
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:24,766
Come on, Howl. We can do this, just act natural.

608
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,015
Oh!

609
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,397
Howl, why are you so heavy?

610
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:05,093
Wait. Help. I can't make it.

611
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:06,857
What'd you say?

612
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:11,441
You suddenly remembered how to
break the spell you put on me?

613
00:57:11,536 --> 00:57:15,135
I told you. I don't know how.

614
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:18,153
Then start studying.

615
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:24,344
I don't get it.

616
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,206
Where does she get all that energy?

617
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:37,556
I have to rest a bit.

618
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:49,085
Why don't you just give up? You're killing yourself.

619
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:54,019
I've waited for 50 years now to be invited here.

620
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:59,470
Ever since that Suliman banished me to live in the Wastes.

621
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:00,884
Well, good luck, then.

622
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,348
Too bad I'm not younger, or I'd lend you a hand.

623
00:58:05,056 --> 00:58:06,376
Come on, Howl.

624
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:12,713
You cold-hearted old hag. Next
time, I'll turn you senile, too.

625
00:58:33,648 --> 00:58:35,785
Almost there!

626
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,590
Honored guest, please follow me.

627
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,641
You should go help her get up these stairs.

628
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,905
I am strictly forbidden to offer such assistance.

629
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,289
Why? That's so rude. The king himself invited her.

630
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,523
Come on! Let's go!

631
00:58:51,993 --> 00:58:55,532
Don't give up now! Are you a witch or aren't you?

632
00:58:57,608 --> 00:58:59,045
Just shut up.

633
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,735
What happened? You look so much older.

634
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,820
Mrs. Pendragon and the Witch of the Waste!

635
00:59:10,316 --> 00:59:13,563
Pull yourself together. Isn't
this what you've been waiting for?

636
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,563
Mrs. Pendragon and the Witch of the Waste!

637
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,615
Your name's Pendragon? Why
does that name sound so familiar?

638
00:59:24,805 --> 00:59:27,411
Uh, because that was the name of my tacky hat shop,

639
00:59:27,436 --> 00:59:28,500
don't you remember?

640
00:59:28,637 --> 00:59:30,065
Is that what it was?

641
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,503
Wait in here, please.

642
00:59:39,095 --> 00:59:42,165
A chair! It's mine!

643
00:59:53,513 --> 00:59:55,743
Howl, get back here.

644
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:03,346
Oh!

645
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:05,308
This way please, ma'am.

646
01:00:13,502 --> 01:00:14,456
Huh?

647
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,649
Thank you, Madame Suliman.

648
01:00:46,528 --> 01:00:47,682
Madame Suliman.

649
01:01:05,797 --> 01:01:08,052
So, you are Howl's mother, are you?

650
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:11,143
Yes, I'm Mrs. Pendragon.

651
01:01:11,383 --> 01:01:13,947
You must be tired. Please have a seat.

652
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:15,139
Thank you.

653
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:29,050
I am Madame Suliman, His Majesty's head sorceress.

654
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,457
Hmm.

655
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:36,622
That's not your dog, is it?

656
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:42,612
His name is Heen. He's my errand
dog. I had him escort you here.

657
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:45,374
Oh.

658
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,976
I take it Howl won't be joining us?

659
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,210
He's such a lazy son, he sent me instead.

660
01:01:53,282 --> 01:01:56,546
I'm afraid the king would find him completely useless.

661
01:01:57,639 --> 01:01:59,836
I am very sorry to hear that.

662
01:02:00,236 --> 01:02:03,332
Howl was the last apprentice I ever took on.

663
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,147
I'd never seen such a gifted student.

664
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:12,699
I was so thrilled to have finally found
someone talented enough to replace me.

665
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,831
Then, one day, his heart was stolen by a demon.

666
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,178
He never returned to complete his apprenticeship.

667
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:24,004
And from that day forward, he has been
using his magic for entirely selfish reasons.

668
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,127
Mrs. Pendragon.

669
01:02:27,152 --> 01:02:27,611
Yes?

670
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,822
That boy is extremely dangerous.

671
01:02:29,877 --> 01:02:32,840
His powers are far too great for someone without a heart.

672
01:02:35,143 --> 01:02:36,597
If he stays selfish,

673
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:39,506
I'm afraid he'll end up just like the Witch of the Waste.

674
01:02:39,608 --> 01:02:40,704
Send her in.

675
01:02:46,925 --> 01:02:48,736
What on earth happened to you?

676
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,504
I just restored her to the age she actually is.

677
01:02:53,671 --> 01:02:55,618
All her powers are gone now.

678
01:02:55,897 --> 01:03:00,170
Once, she, too, was a magnificent
sorcerer with so much promise.

679
01:03:00,488 --> 01:03:06,225
But then she fell prey to a demon of
greed, who slowly consumed her, body and soul.

680
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:12,349
Our kingdom can no longer afford to turn a
blind eye to these disreputable witches and wizards.

681
01:03:12,435 --> 01:03:16,543
If Howl reports to me and vows to
use his magic to serve the kingdom,

682
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:19,063
I will show him how to break from his demon.

683
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:23,401
If not, I'll strip him of all his powers. Just like her.

684
01:03:24,575 --> 01:03:26,141
That is enough!

685
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:30,974
Now I understand why Howl was so
concerned about coming to see you.

686
01:03:31,088 --> 01:03:32,084
It's a trap.

687
01:03:32,328 --> 01:03:35,414
You lure people here with an invitation from the king,

688
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:38,218
and then you strip them of all their powers.

689
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,567
Howl would never be so heartless.

690
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,652
He may be selfish and cowardly,

691
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,900
and sometimes he's hard to understand,

692
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,404
but his intentions are good. He just wants to be free.

693
01:03:48,527 --> 01:03:51,240
Howl won't come here. He doesn't need your help.

694
01:03:51,487 --> 01:03:54,188
He can fix his problem with his demon on his own.

695
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,777
I am certain of it.

696
01:03:56,908 --> 01:03:59,745
Now I understand. You're in love with Howl.

697
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,363
Howl? Did you say Howl's coming?

698
01:04:03,526 --> 01:04:06,416
I want his heart, his heart belongs to me!

699
01:04:06,892 --> 01:04:08,886
Stop that, just calm down.

700
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,214
Howl is not coming here, okay?

701
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,811
Oh, I think he will.

702
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,641
I now know his weakness, Mrs. Pendragon.

703
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,595
Your Majesty.

704
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,579
As you were.

705
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:28,950
So, then, how are you feeling?

706
01:04:28,975 --> 01:04:30,322
I'm fine, thank you.

707
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,617
Thought I'd drop by,

708
01:04:31,729 --> 01:04:33,976
rather than sit through a dull war meeting.

709
01:04:34,122 --> 01:04:35,708
What an honor.

710
01:04:35,813 --> 01:04:37,400
Who are your guests?

711
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:40,094
This is Howl's mother, Mrs. Pendragon.

712
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,015
Ah.

713
01:04:45,499 --> 01:04:46,708
Thanks for coming.

714
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,921
But I've decided not to use magic to win this war.

715
01:04:50,357 --> 01:04:55,196
We have tried using Madame Suliman's magic
to shield our palace from the enemy's bombs.

716
01:04:55,284 --> 01:04:57,753
But the bombs fall on civilian homes instead.

717
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,615
That's the problem with magic. Right, Suliman?

718
01:05:00,773 --> 01:05:03,061
You're so eloquent today, Your Majesty.

719
01:05:03,117 --> 01:05:04,746
Suliman!

720
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,056
I've got a new battle plan.

721
01:05:09,081 --> 01:05:11,189
This time we're going to beat them to a pulp.

722
01:05:11,762 --> 01:05:12,368
Um...

723
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,080
Suliman, that's the best double you've made of me yet.

724
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,915
Ha! Keep up the good work.

725
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,169
Your Majesty.

726
01:05:20,593 --> 01:05:22,591
- Get my generals assembled. - Sir.

727
01:05:26,274 --> 01:05:28,733
So nice to see you again, Howl.

728
01:05:29,466 --> 01:05:31,509
You're looking well, Madame Suliman.

729
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:33,984
Rather weak disguise. Didn't I teach you better?

730
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,890
I'm not trying to outwit you.

731
01:05:35,925 --> 01:05:38,416
I kept my oath, I reported when summoned.

732
01:05:38,744 --> 01:05:40,546
Now Mother and I will go.

733
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,174
I'm afraid not.

734
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,121
Now whatever you do, don't look down.

735
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,958
It's time to show your mother what you really are, Howl.

736
01:06:54,322 --> 01:06:55,115
Oh!

737
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,913
Stop, Howl, it's a trap!

738
01:07:19,332 --> 01:07:20,375
Hold on.

739
01:07:28,595 --> 01:07:30,533
Sophie, sit up here.

740
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,482
Did you have to bring those two with you?

741
01:07:36,933 --> 01:07:38,810
Nice doggie.

742
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,228
Hmm. I can't believe you work for Suliman.

743
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,256
I guess it's too late to toss him.

744
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,733
Sophie. Take the wheel.

745
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:47,504
What?

746
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,276
I can't fly, are you kidding?

747
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:50,944
They're gaining on us.

748
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,409
I'll distract them, then you can fly
this thing back to my castle in the Wastes.

749
01:07:59,468 --> 01:08:01,261
How? I don't know the way.

750
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:04,163
Hey, don't worry. The ring that I
gave you will guide you back home.

751
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,699
All you have to do is summon Calcifer with your heart.

752
01:08:06,936 --> 01:08:08,026
Calcifer?

753
01:08:11,862 --> 01:08:12,761
It's glowing.

754
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,251
Just keep following that light
and you should be there before dark.

755
01:08:17,276 --> 01:08:20,764
I can't do this. Why did you make me
come here if you were coming yourself?

756
01:08:20,898 --> 01:08:23,283
Knowing you'd be there gave me the courage to show up.

757
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:26,197
That woman terrifies me, I can't face her on my own.

758
01:08:26,618 --> 01:08:30,621
You saved me, Sophie. I was in big trouble back there.

759
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:33,514
Oh! Don't let go!

760
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,975
Wow. You're good.

761
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,135
Are you nuts?

762
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:46,479
We've got a good lead now.

763
01:08:46,716 --> 01:08:49,982
I can give you five minutes of
invisibility, so use it wisely.

764
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,005
Howl!

765
01:08:55,109 --> 01:08:56,777
Good luck!

766
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,516
Oh!

767
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,606
No, not now.

768
01:09:09,555 --> 01:09:13,041
Oh, thank you. That was the most fun I've had in ages.

769
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:15,684
I suppose Howl thinks he's evaded me.

770
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:19,403
Hmm. I bet his mother can help me find him.

771
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:37,548
Go!

772
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:40,776
Huh?

773
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:13,166
Almost there. That's my hometown below us.

774
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:19,489
Don't try to be cute, dog. I'm
still not going to trust you.

775
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,471
The castle is coming to meet us!

776
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,817
Sophie! Here!

777
01:10:52,842 --> 01:10:56,426
Michael, help me! How am I supposed to land this thing?

778
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:09,703
Sophie!

779
01:11:11,038 --> 01:11:12,379
Nice doggie.

780
01:11:14,527 --> 01:11:15,730
Michael !

781
01:11:16,082 --> 01:11:17,940
I'm home.

782
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:19,443
Are you hurt?

783
01:11:19,845 --> 01:11:20,921
<i>Whoa!</i>

784
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,288
I missed you.

785
01:11:22,313 --> 01:11:23,319
I missed you, too.

786
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,226
Thanks for coming to meet us.

787
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:58,587
Oh, this is bad. You've gone too far, Howl.

788
01:12:17,157 --> 01:12:19,251
I wonder if Howl's back home.

789
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:14,972
Howl?

790
01:14:17,338 --> 01:14:19,522
Howl, is that you?

791
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,640
Are you in pain? Tell me what's happening.

792
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:27,062
Go away.

793
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,340
No, I'm not going away.

794
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,115
I'm going to help you break the spell that you're under.

795
01:14:32,989 --> 01:14:36,373
You... You can't even break your own spell.

796
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,965
But you don't understand. I love you.

797
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,752
You're too late.

798
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,685
Howl! No!

799
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,305
Calcifer, did Howl just get in?

800
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,870
Yeah, and he looks terrible.

801
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,809
You better figure out how to break the spell on us quick.

802
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:08,646
Howl's running out of time, I hope you realize that.

803
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,158
You mean he'll become a monster. Is that it?

804
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:14,819
I can't tell you details of the
curse, lady. You should know that by now.

805
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,815
Do you know what Madame Suliman said?

806
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,185
She said that Howl's heart was stolen by a demon.

807
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,078
Tell me now. What do you know?

808
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:27,355
I'm so sorry, but that would be confidential information.

809
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:29,874
What if I dump a bucket of water on you?

810
01:15:30,103 --> 01:15:32,846
If you drown me, then Howl will die, too!

811
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:55,903
Hi, Turnip-head. This isn't gonna be easy.

812
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:01,703
Okay. Ready!

813
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:05,374
All right! Calcifer, open it wider.

814
01:16:05,882 --> 01:16:08,050
Here we go!

815
01:16:20,538 --> 01:16:23,311
I said move!

816
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:24,535
Ow!

817
01:16:25,402 --> 01:16:26,872
Oh! Oh!

818
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:50,842
If I just hang a little curtain
here, maybe Howl won't notice.

819
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,790
Come on in, it's time to eat.

820
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:03,498
Here. Want some more?

821
01:17:04,802 --> 01:17:07,272
Don't feed her! That's the Witch of the Waste!

822
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,050
Oh, she's all right.

823
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,665
She keeps staring at me. It's freaking me out.

824
01:17:11,903 --> 01:17:13,976
What a pretty fire.

825
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:18,212
Howl! Hello.

826
01:17:18,237 --> 01:17:19,193
Good morning, everyone.

827
01:17:19,249 --> 01:17:20,375
Glad you're home.

828
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:22,691
Master Howl, we can keep this dog, can't we?

829
01:17:22,864 --> 01:17:25,711
The Witch of the Waste and Suliman's dog at my table.

830
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,611
What possessed you to let them in the house, Calcifer?

831
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,145
I didn't let them in.

832
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,083
Sophie crash-landed her plane into my face.

833
01:17:35,664 --> 01:17:37,570
I knew she'd make a great pilot.

834
01:17:38,202 --> 01:17:41,029
Looks like we have yet another addition to the family.

835
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:45,073
Hmm, you've got quite a nasty spell on you, too.

836
01:17:45,789 --> 01:17:48,021
Seems everyone in this family's got problems.

837
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,416
What a handsome man.

838
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:54,178
So, we've got a lot of work to do. We're moving.

839
01:17:54,481 --> 01:17:55,347
Moving?

840
01:17:55,372 --> 01:17:56,020
That's good.

841
01:17:56,045 --> 01:17:58,707
I'm sick of being stuck out here in the middle of nowhere.

842
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:02,330
Madame Suliman is hot on our
trail, so we're gonna have to hurry.

843
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:05,181
I'm afraid your spell is too strong for this move.

844
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,890
You're gonna have to stay behind.

845
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,661
There. All done.

846
01:18:15,143 --> 01:18:18,266
All right, Calcifer, line her up.

847
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:35,039
There. That should do it. Sit tight for a second.

848
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:40,998
Be gentle with me, please.

849
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:45,669
On my mark.

850
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:32,705
Moving's done. You can get down now.

851
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:37,534
This is great, Master Howl! It's huge!

852
01:19:37,623 --> 01:19:40,720
Oh, what a pretty fire.

853
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:55,927
But this is...

854
01:19:56,016 --> 01:19:57,493
I added on a bathroom,

855
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:59,827
since our family seems to keep growing.

856
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:01,876
Come over here, Sophie.

857
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,137
I added another bedroom, too.

858
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:09,639
Have a look.

859
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:17,036
Oh.

860
01:20:19,908 --> 01:20:21,755
Why'd you do this?

861
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,259
So we'd have a room that suited you. Do you like it?

862
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:29,962
Of course. It's perfect for a cleaning lady.

863
01:20:30,061 --> 01:20:33,425
I got you some new clothes,
too. But you can open them later.

864
01:20:34,357 --> 01:20:36,588
Come on, Sophie. Look at this.

865
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,749
All right, a courtyard!

866
01:20:38,774 --> 01:20:40,775
That shop's ours, too.

867
01:20:41,308 --> 01:20:42,649
Heen! Come on!

868
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:46,775
See that new color on the dial? There's a new portal.

869
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,542
It's a present for you. Come see.

870
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:02,649
Oh!

871
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,833
You like it? It's my secret garden.

872
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:22,135
It's incredible.

873
01:21:23,813 --> 01:21:26,777
Did you use your magic to make this?

874
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:29,995
Only a little, just to help the flowers grow.

875
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:41,117
This place is gorgeous, Howl!

876
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,935
It's like a dream.

877
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:07,255
Sophie?

878
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:12,578
It all seems so familiar, yet I
know I've never been here before.

879
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,247
I feel so at home.

880
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,362
Come with me.

881
01:22:16,387 --> 01:22:17,123
Okay.

882
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,038
Look there.

883
01:22:31,783 --> 01:22:33,298
What a cute cottage.

884
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,325
That was my secret hideaway.

885
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,661
I spent a lot of time here by myself when I was young.

886
01:22:41,299 --> 01:22:42,676
You were alone?

887
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:47,146
My uncle, who was a wizard, gave
me this place as my private study.

888
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,650
Now you can come here whenever you like.

889
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:54,711
What's the matter?

890
01:22:55,213 --> 01:22:57,357
It's... You're scaring me.

891
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,891
I have this weird feeling that you're going to leave.

892
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:07,608
Howl, tell me what's going on.
Please. I don't care if you're a monster.

893
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:16,648
I'm setting things up so that all of
you can live a comfortable life. Sophie

894
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:21,279
With all the flowers you've got in this
valley, you could easily open up a flower shop.

895
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,004
Right? I'm sure you'd be good at it.

896
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,363
So, you are going away.

897
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,837
Please, Howl, I know I can be of help to you.

898
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:35,261
Even though I'm not pretty,
and all I'm good at is cleaning.

899
01:23:35,554 --> 01:23:37,875
Sophie! Sophie, you're beautiful!

900
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:46,534
Well, the nice thing about being
old is you've got nothing much to lose.

901
01:23:48,903 --> 01:23:49,371
Hmm?

902
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,570
What is that thing doing out here?

903
01:24:01,595 --> 01:24:02,627
A battleship?

904
01:24:02,652 --> 01:24:04,627
Still looking for more cities to burn.

905
01:24:04,652 --> 01:24:06,600
Is it the enemy's or one of ours?

906
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,293
What difference does it make?

907
01:24:20,694 --> 01:24:22,465
Those stupid murderers.

908
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:32,015
We can't just let them fly off with all those bombs.

909
01:24:47,984 --> 01:24:50,908
What's happening? What did you do?

910
01:24:51,097 --> 01:24:53,449
Just messed with it. It won't crash, though.

911
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:56,206
Oh!

912
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:58,415
Howl!

913
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,013
Uh-oh. Here they come.

914
01:25:10,469 --> 01:25:13,282
Those things are Suliman's henchmen. Let's go.

915
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:16,054
Faster! We need to take off!

916
01:25:29,813 --> 01:25:31,370
All right, you're going in.

917
01:25:31,395 --> 01:25:33,855
No! Don't let go!

918
01:25:42,482 --> 01:25:44,231
Sophie, what happened?

919
01:25:44,569 --> 01:25:47,719
Oh! I'm too old to be treated like this!

920
01:25:57,317 --> 01:25:58,922
Uh, good night, Sophie.

921
01:25:59,011 --> 01:26:00,343
Good night, Michael.

922
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,826
Oh, don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie.

923
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,353
Sometimes he likes to go away for days on end.

924
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:09,616
Thank you. That's good to know.

925
01:26:09,739 --> 01:26:10,936
Need anything else?

926
01:26:10,961 --> 01:26:12,307
No, I'm fine.

927
01:26:12,332 --> 01:26:14,152
Well. Good night, then.

928
01:26:14,665 --> 01:26:15,833
You're in love.

929
01:26:18,775 --> 01:26:22,097
Don't deny it. You've been sighing all day.

930
01:26:33,404 --> 01:26:35,231
Hmm. Just as I thought.

931
01:26:35,506 --> 01:26:37,677
Have you ever been in love before?

932
01:26:38,103 --> 01:26:41,190
Of course I have. I'm still in love.

933
01:26:42,272 --> 01:26:45,415
Strapping, young men are so difficult to deal with.

934
01:26:45,752 --> 01:26:48,586
But their hearts, I just adore.

935
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:49,905
You're terrible.

936
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:52,478
And they're so cute, too.

937
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:57,850
What's that?

938
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,915
It's an air raid siren.

939
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:01,664
Air raid?

940
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:04,370
It's a long way's off.

941
01:27:04,395 --> 01:27:07,010
But you better not go outside tonight, dear.

942
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:12,395
I'm sure Suliman's henchmen are
looking everywhere for this place.

943
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,227
What a good fire.

944
01:27:17,911 --> 01:27:19,954
He keeps this house so well hidden.

945
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,731
Sophie, there's a strange lady in here!

946
01:28:05,371 --> 01:28:06,328
Mother?

947
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:08,139
Sophie!

948
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:14,347
Thank goodness you're here! I searched everywhere for you!

949
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:17,292
Oh, my, look at your face, you're so old!

950
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,222
Everyone's saying it's my fault that you left!

951
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:24,816
You'll forgive me, oh, won't you? Oh, Sophie!

952
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:25,663
Mother.

953
01:28:28,796 --> 01:28:31,389
I barely recognize the place.

954
01:28:31,491 --> 01:28:34,691
Who is that woman? Huh? The landlady?

955
01:28:34,905 --> 01:28:38,106
Oh! I forgot to tell you! I got married again!

956
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:41,208
He's such a nice man, and he's filthy rich, too,

957
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:43,287
so we can all live together again!

958
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:46,076
You won't have to work as a cleaning lady any more.

959
01:28:46,355 --> 01:28:49,579
That's all right, Mother. I actually like living here.

960
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:52,591
Really? Oh! I forgot!

961
01:28:52,754 --> 01:28:54,942
I've got a car waiting. I've gotta run.

962
01:28:56,106 --> 01:28:58,470
Sophie, I'm so glad I found you.

963
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:16,927
A peeping bug? Can't Suliman do better than that?

964
01:29:17,261 --> 01:29:19,221
Open wide, Cal.

965
01:29:27,931 --> 01:29:30,740
I hope you and your new husband will be very happy.

966
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:33,102
Thank you, Sophie. Bye.

967
01:29:33,158 --> 01:29:34,198
Bye, Mother.

968
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,542
I did what I was told. Now take me to my husband.

969
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:43,980
Yes, ma'am. I'm sure Madame
Suliman will be very pleased with you.

970
01:29:45,972 --> 01:29:47,765
Forgive me, Sophie.

971
01:29:51,941 --> 01:29:53,568
Wow. Look at all of them.

972
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:57,191
If they keep leaving at this
rate, the town will soon be empty.

973
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,090
Do you want to leave, too, Sophie?

974
01:29:59,272 --> 01:30:00,336
What?

975
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,974
That lady said she wants you to live with her now.

976
01:30:03,047 --> 01:30:06,795
Yes, well, at least she cared enough to visit.

977
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:08,631
Don't leave, Sophie.

978
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:11,945
I love you. You have to stay.

979
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:17,347
On, I love you, too, Michael. I'll stay.

980
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:18,507
Really?

981
01:30:18,761 --> 01:30:19,570
Mmm-hmm.

982
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:21,271
Because we're a family now.

983
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,702
Yes, we're a family.

984
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,132
Thank you, Sophie.

985
01:30:33,237 --> 01:30:36,645
I'll never let Suliman get a hold of Howl.

986
01:30:53,234 --> 01:30:55,325
But the newspaper says we won.

987
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:58,716
Only idiots believe what they read in the paper.

988
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:02,854
That's so strange. I can't get Calcifer going.

989
01:31:03,745 --> 01:31:07,153
Do you have to keep smoking that? It smells terrible.

990
01:31:07,521 --> 01:31:10,393
Don't deny an witcher pleasures, young lady.

991
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,643
Michael, will you crack a window, please?

992
01:31:12,682 --> 01:31:13,468
Mmm-hmm.

993
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,499
I wouldn't open that window, If ll were you, dear.

994
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:23,575
Calcifer's too weak right now to protect this place.

995
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,862
Suliman's henchmen could get in.

996
01:31:27,009 --> 01:31:27,968
Michael!!

997
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:39,766
Get back!

998
01:31:46,776 --> 01:31:49,649
Michael, get back inside. I'm going to check on the shop.

999
01:31:49,674 --> 01:31:50,276
Mmm-hmm.

1000
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:09,641
There are bombs falling on us!

1001
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:12,612
Why can't you put out some fires instead?

1002
01:32:36,901 --> 01:32:38,409
Howl! No!

1003
01:32:41,669 --> 01:32:42,548
Oh!

1004
01:32:51,729 --> 01:32:53,071
This is exciting.

1005
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:07,453
Howl!

1006
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,997
I'm sorry, Sophie. I should've gotten here sooner.

1007
01:33:12,361 --> 01:33:15,588
You're alive! Oh, thank goodness!

1008
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,484
Master Howl!! Sophie! You're okay!

1009
01:33:36,905 --> 01:33:40,233
Calcifer. You hang in there, now.

1010
01:33:44,746 --> 01:33:49,075
Tell me, was that cigar a gift
from Madame Suliman by any chance?

1011
01:33:49,341 --> 01:33:52,587
Howl, she fed me something gross. I feel sick.

1012
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:55,605
Why, if it isn't Howl.

1013
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:59,897
I think you and I need to have a
nice, long, heart-to-heart chat.

1014
01:34:00,185 --> 01:34:04,170
There's nothing I'd like more than
that, but right now there's a war going on.

1015
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:08,740
How unlike you, Howl, not running away anymore.

1016
01:34:09,121 --> 01:34:10,543
Until later, then.

1017
01:34:11,552 --> 01:34:14,508
Stay here. Calcifer will protect you from the henchmen.

1018
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:16,423
I'll stand guard out front.

1019
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:22,517
No, wait! Howl! Don't go out there. It's too dangerous.

1020
01:34:22,758 --> 01:34:24,209
Another wave's coming.

1021
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,370
And Calcifer's too weak to stop the bombs.

1022
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:28,769
Let's run! Don't fight them, Howl.

1023
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:31,820
Sorry. I've had enough of running away, Sophie.

1024
01:34:32,368 --> 01:34:35,906
Now I've got something I want to protect. It's you.

1025
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:42,759
Come back!

1026
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,292
Hmm!

1027
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:08,542
There's where we are, at the shop.

1028
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,493
Looks like Howl's in trouble.

1029
01:36:23,671 --> 01:36:24,790
Howl, look out!

1030
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:36,612
What's going on? Turnip!

1031
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:41,824
Michael, I need your help.

1032
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:42,442
Huh?

1033
01:36:42,617 --> 01:36:45,622
Are you crazy? I can't move
the portals without Howl's help.

1034
01:36:45,647 --> 01:36:49,012
You have to try. If we don't break away,
Howl will keep protecting that hat shop.

1035
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,989
I've preferred him as a coward.

1036
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:52,740
Okay, we have to go now.

1037
01:36:52,877 --> 01:36:54,416
Are we going for a stroll?

1038
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:56,769
We can't do that. It'll make us too vulnerable!

1039
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,146
We already are.

1040
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:00,565
And if we don't move quick, Howl doesn't have a chance.

1041
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:03,334
Sophie! They're about to bomb the hat shop!

1042
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:05,418
Quick. Help her get outside, okay?

1043
01:37:05,443 --> 01:37:05,982
Right.

1044
01:37:08,835 --> 01:37:10,408
You're coming with us. Hop on.

1045
01:37:10,451 --> 01:37:12,306
I can't! It's impossible!

1046
01:37:12,331 --> 01:37:14,445
No one but Howl can take me out of this hearth.

1047
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,320
There's no time to lose,Calcifer.
We have to try something.

1048
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:19,378
Oh! Don't do this! No, no!

1049
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,753
Help, help, crazy lady with a shovel! Don't...

1050
01:37:21,992 --> 01:37:24,981
If you take me out that door, the castle could collapse.

1051
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:25,805
Good!

1052
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:30,519
We're ready.

1053
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:31,404
Okay, step back.

1054
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,815
Make sure I go out last, Sophie.

1055
01:37:34,089 --> 01:37:37,516
I don't know what's gonna happen,
but I'm sure it won't be good.

1056
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:10,241
I told you it would collapse. Rain! Rain!

1057
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:14,404
That ship's headed for town!

1058
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:15,973
Michael, look after her, okay?

1059
01:38:16,001 --> 01:38:17,884
Turnip-head, help me find a way back in.

1060
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:21,745
Don't you worry, now, ma'am,
I'm gonna take good care of you.

1061
01:38:24,551 --> 01:38:26,428
Michael, here's a way in!

1062
01:38:37,598 --> 01:38:39,400
The roof's leaking. Don't let me get wet!

1063
01:38:39,495 --> 01:38:40,704
Hold on for a second.

1064
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:43,165
It's wet here, Sophie! Ah!

1065
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:47,280
Too damp, too damp, very damp here!

1066
01:38:47,695 --> 01:38:48,821
Hurry! Hurry!

1067
01:38:48,926 --> 01:38:50,133
Hurry, please!

1068
01:38:57,944 --> 01:38:59,612
Michael, hurry, get inside.

1069
01:38:59,851 --> 01:39:01,469
The castle's a wreck.

1070
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:05,299
Told you we should have stayed
put. Howl and I could have handled it.

1071
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,630
We have to tell Howl we're not
attached to the hat shop now.

1072
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:12,775
Move the castle and take us to Howl.

1073
01:39:12,911 --> 01:39:14,364
Ah! What?

1074
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:18,774
I know you can do it. I've
never seen a fire with more spark.

1075
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:22,623
But there's no chimney here,
and I keep getting dripped on.

1076
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:24,183
And the wood's all damp.

1077
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:28,847
They say that the best blaze brightest
when circumstances are at their worst.

1078
01:39:29,022 --> 01:39:31,223
Yeah, but no one really believes that.

1079
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,859
Come on, let's be honest.

1080
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:35,348
Oh! What a pretty fire.

1081
01:39:35,373 --> 01:39:36,800
Why don't you have a seat.

1082
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:39,557
All right. I need something of yours, Sophie.

1083
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:40,782
Why's that?

1084
01:39:40,807 --> 01:39:43,611
I can't do it by myself. How about your eyes?

1085
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,987
Huh? How about this?

1086
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,296
Ah!

1087
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,823
Ah!

1088
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:54,621
Thanks, Calcifer. You're fantastic!

1089
01:40:54,727 --> 01:40:57,926
Imagine what I could've done
with your eyes. Or your heart.

1090
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:00,874
That's it! You've got Howl's heart!

1091
01:41:03,449 --> 01:41:04,910
I found it!

1092
01:41:17,382 --> 01:41:20,776
I can see Howl down there. Looks like he's trapped!

1093
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,267
Calcifer, hurry!

1094
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:29,723
No!

1095
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:31,556
Put it back!

1096
01:41:31,655 --> 01:41:33,400
Let go!

1097
01:41:33,951 --> 01:41:36,833
Howl's heart, it's mine!

1098
01:41:47,562 --> 01:41:49,274
Put it back now!

1099
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,429
It's hot! Ah!

1100
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:53,787
It's burning me!

1101
01:41:53,812 --> 01:41:54,851
Let go!

1102
01:41:55,001 --> 01:41:56,948
You're catching on fire!

1103
01:41:57,921 --> 01:42:04,059
No, it's mine. It's mine! It's mine!

1104
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:14,943
Ah!

1105
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:19,291
Sophie!

1106
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,391
Sophie!

1107
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:26,122
Sophie ruined it!

1108
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:28,124
My heart's ruined!

1109
01:43:11,826 --> 01:43:15,708
Heen, what have I done? I poured water on Calcifer!

1110
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:20,236
What if I killed Howl, too?

1111
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:49,871
It's moving. Is Howl still alive?

1112
01:43:50,243 --> 01:43:51,762
Can you lead me to him?

1113
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,161
The front door.

1114
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:34,468
Heen.

1115
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:11,442
That's Howl.

1116
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,822
I know where I am. I'm in Howl's childhood.

1117
01:46:56,285 --> 01:46:57,246
Oh!

1118
01:47:51,391 --> 01:47:53,948
Howl! Calcifer!

1119
01:47:55,081 --> 01:47:56,933
It's me, Sophie!

1120
01:47:57,206 --> 01:47:59,595
I know how to help you now.

1121
01:48:00,099 --> 01:48:03,004
Find me in the future!

1122
01:48:35,341 --> 01:48:37,938
Sorry, Heen. I'm trying to hurry.

1123
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,639
I just can't seem to stop crying.

1124
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:05,984
Howl.

1125
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:15,455
I'm sorry. Did I come too late?

1126
01:49:15,836 --> 01:49:18,179
I didn't mean to make you wait this long.

1127
01:49:22,781 --> 01:49:25,831
I need you to take me to Calcifer if you can.

1128
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:30,003
He's dead?

1129
01:50:30,272 --> 01:50:31,653
No, Michael.

1130
01:50:35,972 --> 01:50:37,532
Howl needs that back now.

1131
01:50:37,557 --> 01:50:41,092
Don't look at me. I don't have it. I
don't know what you're talking about.

1132
01:50:41,663 --> 01:50:42,789
Please.

1133
01:50:44,513 --> 01:50:45,946
Please give it back.

1134
01:50:49,078 --> 01:50:51,854
You really want it that badly?

1135
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:52,938
Yes.

1136
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:55,355
All right, then.

1137
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,421
You'd better take good care of it.

1138
01:50:57,446 --> 01:50:58,412
Okay.

1139
01:50:58,523 --> 01:50:59,714
Here, dear.

1140
01:51:01,075 --> 01:51:03,218
Thank you, you have a big heart.

1141
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:20,333
Calcifer.

1142
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:24,623
Sophie, I'm so tired.

1143
01:51:24,755 --> 01:51:28,284
If I give Howl back his heart, what will happen to you?

1144
01:51:28,473 --> 01:51:31,176
I'll be okay if you do it. I think.

1145
01:51:31,396 --> 01:51:35,283
I mean,you dumped water on me,
and Howl and I both survived.

1146
01:51:35,859 --> 01:51:37,500
I better try then.

1147
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:43,856
It's so warm and fluttering like a bird.

1148
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:46,463
It's still just the heart of a child.

1149
01:51:47,576 --> 01:51:50,221
Please, help Calicifer live.

1150
01:51:50,676 --> 01:51:53,160
And please help Howl take back his heart.

1151
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:08,822
I'm alive! I'm alive! Look, I'm free!

1152
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:12,880
Free! Free! I'm alive!

1153
01:52:14,533 --> 01:52:16,486
He moved! See?

1154
01:52:21,369 --> 01:52:23,279
It can't stand without Calcifer!

1155
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:39,208
Turnip!

1156
01:52:51,764 --> 01:52:53,257
His pole snapped!

1157
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:55,703
Are you all right? We'll get you a new pole, okay?

1158
01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:59,796
You saved us, Turnip.

1159
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:09,440
Thank you, Sophie.

1160
01:53:10,409 --> 01:53:12,888
I'm the prince who's being
missing from the neighboring kingdom.

1161
01:53:13,078 --> 01:53:15,461
Somehow I got that blasted spell put on me.

1162
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:18,933
I know that spell. A kiss from your true love breaks this.

1163
01:53:19,084 --> 01:53:23,660
That's right. If it weren't for Sophie, I
would be a scarecrow for the rest of my life.

1164
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:26,091
My, what a strapping young man you are.

1165
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:28,593
What's going on? What am I doing here?

1166
01:53:28,663 --> 01:53:32,455
I feel terrible, like there's a weight on my chest.

1167
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,058
A heart's a heavy burden.

1168
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:38,898
Wow! Sophie, your hair looks just like starlight.

1169
01:53:39,146 --> 01:53:40,312
It's beautiful.

1170
01:53:40,605 --> 01:53:43,157
You think so? So do I!

1171
01:53:45,027 --> 01:53:47,779
Looks like your true love is in love with someone else.

1172
01:53:47,823 --> 01:53:51,571
You should go home anyway, and
tell your king to stop this dumb war.

1173
01:53:51,642 --> 01:53:53,462
Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

1174
01:53:53,577 --> 01:53:56,544
One thing you can always count on is that hearts change.

1175
01:53:56,838 --> 01:53:59,587
So as soon as this war is over, I shall return.

1176
01:53:59,867 --> 01:54:02,286
I love it when you talk like that.

1177
01:54:02,419 --> 01:54:04,783
I look forward to your return, big boy.

1178
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:15,295
There you are. You should have checked in earlier.

1179
01:54:15,607 --> 01:54:17,568
What on earth were you up to?

1180
01:54:20,628 --> 01:54:22,873
Howl found his true love.

1181
01:54:23,068 --> 01:54:24,931
You little traitor.

1182
01:54:31,645 --> 01:54:33,488
The game is over.

1183
01:54:34,061 --> 01:54:37,198
Get me the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.

1184
01:54:38,163 --> 01:54:41,235
It's time to put an end to this idiotic war.

1185
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:41,798
Yes, ma'am.

1186
01:54:42,427 --> 01:54:44,237
Hey, it's Calcifer!

1187
01:54:44,655 --> 01:54:47,010
You didn't have to come back, Calcifer.

1188
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,136
I Kind of missed you guys. And
it looks like it's gonna rain.

1189
01:54:53,253 --> 01:54:55,265
I missed you, too, Calcifer.

1190
01:54:56,306 --> 01:54:57,211
Wow!
