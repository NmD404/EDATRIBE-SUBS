- Hot, isn't it?

9
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,931
I'm home.

10
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,186
Thanks.

11
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,439
You don't need a bag for just milk!

12
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,066
They put it in one.

13
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,486
Just say no. Pour me some too.

14
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,363
Dad, want some barley tea?

15
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,616
Please, I'll come there.

16
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,329
- The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.

17
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,916
I should buy an electronic notebook.

18
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,877
I smell cigarette.

19
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,505
You could've gone to your aunt's too.

20
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,424
No. Shiho wears me out.

21
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,344
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.

22
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,845
Do you need lunch?

23
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,639
No, I'll eat out.

24
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:04,768
The library's busy
going to a bar code system.

25
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,979
I like the book cards better.

26
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,440
Me too.

27
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,859
Hey, this isn't right...

28
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,319
What?

29
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,906
Did you leave out a line?

30
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,992
- You're right!
- Let me go first.

31
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,121
I have to get this right
or my professor will complain.

Yeah. Good night.

36
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,727
I thought I'd seen that name before.

37
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,689

Is he good-looking?

I'm leaving!

46
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,533
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.

47
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,203
Bye!

48
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,292
Oh, no! I've got to meet Yuko!

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,296
My purse!

50
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,674
You ran back upstairs again?

51
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,842
Yeah.

52
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,553
That's funny.

53
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,597
Try by the phone...

54
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,432
Yes!

55
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,059
...where you left it.

56
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,686
I'm late! Lock the door!

57
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,396
Silly!

58
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,407
It's flying so low!

59
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,872
Today's a lucky day!

60
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,024

61
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,660
How's it going?

62
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,807
Hit it!

63
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,560
Hi, Shizuku!

64
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,812
Hi!

65
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,485
Miss Kosaka?

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,697
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?

67
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,158
Could I ask a favor?

68
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,660
Nothing weird, I hope...

69
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,663
- Let me in the library!
- What?

70
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,041
Can't you wait till school starts?

71
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,836
I've read all my books,
and the public library's closed.

72
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,965
I'm reading 20 before school starts.

78
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,523
Yes, ma'am.

No one's ever borrowed this book!

80
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,449

Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?

84
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,758
Look what you made me do!

85
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:50,136
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.

86
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,180
Ask an older teacher.

87
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,723
Shizuku!

88
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:59,354
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!

89
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,816
If I have to stand in the sun,
I get more freckles!

90
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,942
Sorry!

91
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,696
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.

92
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,365
They're a serious problem, miss!

93
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,619
Yeah, yeah.
OK, out of here, both of you.

94
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,543
Move up! Move up!

95
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:28,383
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?

White clouds spreading up over a hill

98
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,522

My good old hometown

104
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,047
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.

105
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,299
It's trite.

106
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,468
Yeah?

107
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,179
I wrote another one.

108
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:19,893
Concrete roads, everywhere

109
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,898
Cut down all the trees
Filled in the valleys

110
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,484

Tama Mountain

112
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:34,199
My hometown is concrete roads

113
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,327
What is this?!

114
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,996
But what's this problem?

115
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,957
You don't need the lyrics yet.

116
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,211
No. Are you in love with anyone?

117
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,754
What?

118
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,841
Studying for entrance exams
would be easier having someone.

119
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,718
We could encourage each other.

120
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,013
Yuko! You're in love!

121
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,017
You got a love letter?!

122
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,185
Shh!

123
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,354
When? Who? Is he handsome?

124
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,774
He's in another class. He's not bad.

125
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,111
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!

126
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,529
Yeah, but...

127
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,533
So there's someone else you like!

128
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,330
You can't hide it from me! Confess!

129
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,667
It's Su... Su...

00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,963
Bring me my bag, will you?

132
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,425
- Sugimural!
- That blue sports bag.

133
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,469
Come on, Tsukishimal!

134
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,222
Throw it over here.

135
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,059
Shut up and go back to the bench!

136
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,855
I'm first-string,
and we're through to the regionals!

137
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,064
Yuko?

138
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,371
You're in love with Sugimura?

139
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,500
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!

140
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,919
Don't worry. He's too dense.

141
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,715
What about the guy who wrote you?

142
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,846
I'll think about it awhile.

143
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,431
I see.

144
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,476
At least your parents
aren't always after you to study.

145
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,313
Silence isn't always great.

146
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,064
I wonder...

147
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,442
- Oh, no!
- What?

148
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,944
I forgot my book! I'll go back.

149
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,070
I'll ride with you.

150
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,073
No. You'll be late for cram school.

151
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,992
I'll call you.

152
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,866
That book...

153
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,869
Oh, is it yours?

154
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,834
Here, Tsukishima Shizuku.

155
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,836
How do you know my name?

156
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,839
Guess!

157
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,510
My library card.

158
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,514
I'd forget about Concrete Road, though.

159
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,355
You read it!

160
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,066
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

161
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,695
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

162
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,492
Jerk!

163
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,422
"I'd forget about Concrete Road.”

164
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,507
Get lost!

166
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,797
I'm home.

167
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,010
Shiho? You're back already?

168
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,346
I'm beat!

169
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,558
I got a ride with someone
who was coming this way.

170
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,186
Where's Mom?

171
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,272
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.

172
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,609
You could clean up a little.

173
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,904
- What about dinner?
- I'm going to wash the rice.

174
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,074
Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!

175
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,659
I'm getting to it!

176
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,207
Mom's busy! We've got to help!

177
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:44,133
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.

178
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,305
Aunt says to come see her
when you get into high school.

179
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,392
Are you studying?

180
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,313
Don't think you can take it easy just
because Mom and Dad don't bug you.

181
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,357
I know!

182
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,486
She even wanted me
to bring home soy sauce!

183
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,655
That's your aunt, all right.

184
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,991
It was the same thing last year.

185
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,537
Yes! It was miso! Boy, was it heavy!

186
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,498
Two kilos of it!

187
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,307
Shizuku! Get up
and vacuum by your desk!

188
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,977
I'm washing the sheets.

189
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,687
And airing the bedding.

190
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,607
- Where's Mom?
- Long gone.

191
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,031
Put that stuff away
and take Dad his lunch.

192
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,616
Me?!

193
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,786
Why not? You're going to the library.

194
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,623
Shall I go instead?

195
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,711
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath
and the balcony and go to the co-op?

196
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,757
Don't forget to turn the bedding
and fix dinner.

197
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,762
I'm going!

198
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,562
Shizuku!

199
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,231
Mail these, will you?

200
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,608
What?

201
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,902
M-A-I-L!

202
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,868
You don't have to read them!

203
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,370
Take the paper clip off.

204
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,706
- Your boyfriend?
- Idiot!

205
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,295
MUKAIHARA STATION

206
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,848
Hey, cat, are you alone?

207
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,854
Where are you going?

208
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,110
What's out there?

209
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,364
Hey! Answer me!

210
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,129
I get off here. What about you?

211
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,010
See you.

212
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,858
Hey! A cat!

213
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,205
SUGINOMIYA STATION

214
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,671
The library's that way!

215
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,658
And it felt just like
the start of a story.

216
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,945
There he is!

217
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,306
NO TRESPASS

218
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,794
What a hill! How far up is he going?

219
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,231
Cat?

220
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,026
Cat?

221
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,866
Does he live around here?

222
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,568
Hey, cat! Where are you going?
Do you live around here?

223
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,259
I never knew there was
a place like this way up here.

224
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,809
THE SUZUKI FAMILY

225
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:46,031
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!

226
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,547
Maybe you're teasing me too.

227
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,353
I never guessed there was
a store like this up here either.

228
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,092
Cool!

229
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,143
Are you that cat?

230
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,741
- Oh, hello.
- Um...

231
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,787
That's all right.
Look around all you want.

232
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,164
The Baron gets bored.

233
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,210
Is this doll The Baron?

234
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:08,549
Yep. Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name.

235
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,059
Sorry.

236
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,063
- Thanks. I'm fine now.
- That's a great clock.

237
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,776
It was sitting in some castle,
all rusted out. Look.

238
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:35,242
It's beautiful. What is it?

239
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,330
Wait and see.

240
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,664
What great dwarfs!

241
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:28,212
So, you're a young lady
who knows about dwarfs, are you?

242
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:34,176
Watch the face... if it works.

243
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,278
A fairy!

244
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,198
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.

245
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,914
- A princess?
- That's right.

246
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,968
Are they in love?

247
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:20,889
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.

248
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:26,520
Only while the clock is striking 12
is she changed back from a sheep.

249
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:32,192
But he appears every hour
and waits for her.

250
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:38,323
The artisan who made this
must have been disappointed in love.

251
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,744
That's why they both look so sad.

252
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,418
This clock's fast, isn't it?

253
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,086
Only about five minutes, though.

254
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,337
Oh, no!

255
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,924
I've got to be at the library!

256
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,927
Can I come back sometime?

257
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,598
Sure, but go left
to get to the library!

258
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,278
I'm right above it!

259
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,621
What a find!
A place where stories start!

260
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,582
Fantastic!

261
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,044
Tsukishimal

262
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,879
Tsukishima Shizuku!

263
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,591
Isn't this yours?

264
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,182
Forgetful, aren't you.

265
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:49,102
- Thanks, but how...?
- Guess!

266
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,399
The cat. Is that your cat?

267
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,527
You sure eat a big lunch!

268
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,656
No!

269
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,493
Concrete roads, everywhere...

270
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,412
It's not mine! Hey!

271
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,708
Oh, here you are.

272
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,755
What's wrong with you?

273
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,716
It's hard to explain.

274
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,887
I felt like I'd found
a treasure hidden in a cave.

275
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,848
Then what someone said
buried me alive.

276
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,892
Sounds complicated.

277
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,024
- Getting more books?
- Seven more to go.

278
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,861
- Still at it? What about lunch?
- I'll buy something.

279
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,364
You will? Thanks, then.

280
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,138
June 16th...

281
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,267
Wow! Amasawa's read this one too!

282
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,520
What's he like?

283
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,734
No! He's not you!

284
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,283
"HAMBURG"

285
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,623
Shizuku! Hurry!

286
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,417
I'm late!

287
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:19,836
Pass my umbrella.

288
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,884
Rain every day this term!

289
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,347
At least you're studying
because you want to.

290
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,640
Sorry.

291
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,392
Study hard!

292
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,976
Don't you worry!

293
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,903
- Shizuku!
- Hi!

294
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,488
Hurry! We'll be late!

295
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:52,160
- I hate all these tests!
- One every day!

296
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,835
- Did you answer?
- No.

297
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,420
Did he say anything?

298
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,922
I'm going to say no.

299
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,384
Yeah? Maybe that's best.

300
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:08,552
Sugimura!

301
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,013
Better hurry!

302
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,349
I know!

303
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,069
Time's up. Gather the papers.

304
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,035
See you this afternoon.

305
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,205
Tanaka, come over here.
Let's have lunch.

306
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,167
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.

307
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,960
Let me go to the teachers' room first.

308
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,295
Sure.

309
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,881
- Tsukishimal
- What?

310
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,716
I lucked out on the test!

311
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,884
Isn't that nice.

312
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,928
Everything I studied was on it!

313
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,639
So, you're not just a baseball goof.

314
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,894
Yuko's good at guessing too.
Why not study with her?

315
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,395
With Harada?

316
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,397
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?

317
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,025
Come on!

318
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,407
Stop fixing me up!

319
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,575
Was it obvious?

320
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,702
I never just guess!

321
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:16,912
Sorry!

322
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,915
Excuse me.

323
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,630
A library book donor?
Gee, I don't know.

324
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,592
Sorry to bother you at lunchtime.
There's this stamp in it.

325
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,469
Oh...

326
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,929
DONATED

327
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,263
FAIRYTALES

328
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,391
That's Dr. Amasawa.

329
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,560
I've read it. It's a good book!

330
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:45,273
Yes, very. What kind of person is he?

331
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,444
He was chairman of the PTA
a few years ago.

332
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:53,323
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?

333
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,116
His given name?

334
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:59,704
Mr. Kimura, do you remember
that Dr. Amasawa's given name?

335
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,083
Dr. Amasawa? It was Koichi.

336
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,085
Amasawa Koichi.

337
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,966
His youngest son's in your year,
Tsukishima. You don't know him?

338
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,968
He is?!

339
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,053
Thank you very much!

340
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,639
Goodbye!

341
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,100
Sorry!

342
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,688
Shizuku, where are you going?

343
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,233
What a surprise!

344
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,318
Tell me about it!

345
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,154
What's with you?!

346
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,365
Sorry!

347
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,377
Hey, where are you going?

348
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,854
He ignored me! Of all the nerve!

349
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,857
Who is he? Where are you going?

350
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,610
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!

351
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,158
I've been carrying her lunch all over.

352
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,911
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?

353
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:26,416
Looks like springtime has come
for Shizuku at last!

354
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,585
It isn't true!

355
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,546
You met a prince
from one of your books?

356
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,714
Is he handsome?

357
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,383
I just want to find out what he's like!

358
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,929
Come on, Yuko,
you heard his name. Tell us!

359
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,681
Yuko!

360
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,433
It happened too fast.

361
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,395
"Ma," something, "Masaki," maybe...

362
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,938
Hmm?

363
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,065
Hmm...

364
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:55,445
But it's like Tsukishima to run out
without hearing the end of something.

365
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:58,073
You want to know, but you don't.

366
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:02,077
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!

367
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,705
How terribly romantic!

368
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:11,628
Should you really tease a girl
who has just written your lyrics?

369
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,588
- You finished?!
- Let's see!

370
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:20,345
Oh, Shizuku! Oh, great poet!
We will not transgress again!

371
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,347
All right, then.

372
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,266
I'm not sure...

373
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:31,815
I don't know about old hometowns,
so I wrote about what I feel.

374
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,150
This is great!

375
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:39,572
Country road, this old road

376
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:45,161
If I go right to the end

377
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:49,874
Got a feeling it'll take me

378
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:55,255
To that town, country road

379
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,007
This is good, Shizuku. I like it.

380
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,009
It's not hard to sing?

381
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,469
We'll manage.

382
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,849
We can give this to the juniors
and sing it at the teachers' thank you!

383
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,267
There too?!

384
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,769
- Slow down!
- I like this part.

385
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:14,149
"I left because I was alone
and I had nothing.

386
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,194
Pushed away my sadness
and pretended I was strong..."

387
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,613
Ladies, the bell.

388
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,957
The sun's come out!

389
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,250
Shizuku!

390
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:36,588
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.

391
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,007
No, I'm going to the library.

392
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,759
There's another test tomorrow.

393
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,345
- I'll study there.
- Bookworm!

394
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,014
Bye.

395
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,385
Harada.

396
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,973
Can I talk to you for a minute?

397
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,528
It's closed.

398
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,281
Have these flowers been watered?

399
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,672
Baron's gone.
Maybe someone bought him.

400
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,056
ART GALLERY: CHIKYU-YA
SHIRO NISHI

401
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:15,019
Nishi Shiro. Maybe
that jerk's name is Nishi too.

402
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,035
Shizuku! Shizuku!

403
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,917
Yuko's on the phone!

404
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,670
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.

405
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,672
Yuko?

406
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,633
What? I can't hear you.

407
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,053
I'll be there in a minute.

408
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,264
Bye.

409
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,142
- Where are you going?
- Not far.

410
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,734
What's wrong?

411
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,903
Shizuku!

412
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,488
What's the matter?

413
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,949
What am I going to do?!

414
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:15,830
The guy who wrote the letter
got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

415
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,126
Uh-oh.

416
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,838
Why you, of all people?!

417
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,674
Hey!

418
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,555
That guy is so dense!

419
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:37,101
But he doesn't know
how you feel about him.

420
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,189
I'll apologize to him.

421
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:46,235
But I can't go to school tomorrow
looking like this.

422
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,695
And miss the test?

423
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,155
Yeah.

424
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,199
Oh.

425
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,455
"DEVELOPMENT"

426
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,719
Idiot!

427
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,640
What?

428
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,018
It was easy.

429
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,062
The library again, Shizuku?

430
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,355
I'm going to Yuko's.

431
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,440
Say hello.

432
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,867
Tsukishimal

433
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,370
Wait up!

434
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,962
About Harada...

435
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:58,474
...then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?

436
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:04,897
She said, "Why you, of all people,”
didn't she?

437
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,317
Yeah. A guy on the
baseball team asked me.

438
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,361
No!

439
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,448
She didn't want to hear something
like that from you!

440
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,033
Don't you understand?!

441
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,118
No, I don't!

442
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,453
Tell me!

443
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:23,875
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!

444
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,879
What?! No way! I don't need this!

445
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:33,384
You don't? How do you think Yuko feels?
She stayed home sick today!

446
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,472
But... I like you!

447
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,931
What?

448
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,310
Don't make jokes at a time like this!

449
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,646
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!

450
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,650
Not me! You can't!

451
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,987
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?

452
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,740
I don't have a boyfriend.

453
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,909
But...

454
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,161
- I'm sorry!
- Wait!

455
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,663
Tell me the truth!

456
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:09,128
But we've always been friends...
l like you, but not...

457
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,467
I'm sorry. I can't say what I mean.

458
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,475
Just friends?

459
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,771
Forever?

460
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:33,402
I see.

461
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,578
I'm the one who's dense.

462
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,258
The parcel delivery left this with me.

463
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,760
Thank you again.

464
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,277
You don't have to do this.

465
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,946
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.

466
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,073
Oh, you're home.

467
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,451
Shizuku?

468
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,700
Hi.

469
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,287
Have you been shut out too?

470
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:36,919
Do you live here? Are you hungry?

471
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:43,926
You're not very nice. Just like me.

472
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:51,809
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet.

473
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:56,105
Books don't even excite me
like they used to.

474
00:46:56,272 --> 00:47:01,527
There's always someone inside me
saying, "Things aren't that easy."

475
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,446
I'm not very nice.

476
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,723
Hey! Tsukishima!

477
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,310
Moon lets you pet him?

478
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,771
Moon, you're not coming in?

479
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,481
Is that his name?

480
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,733
He's like a full moon.

481
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,402
That's why I call him that.

482
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,742
Isn't he yours?

483
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,619
He won't stay in one house.

484
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:55,206
I heard him called Ball at one place.

485
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,541
I'm sure there's others.

486
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,294
So he does the rounds.

487
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,757
Yes! He commutes, on the train!

488
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,509
The train?

489
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:11,430
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here. I followed him.

490
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:16,435
And he brought me to a neat store,
just like out of a story.

491
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:18,479
I insulted him.

492
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,984
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.

493
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,696
You're not like Moon at all!

494
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,492
He's half-devil, he is.

495
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,626
- Um...
- Would you...?

496
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:47,133
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...

497
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:51,220
He's fine. It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.

498
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,180
I'm glad he's all right.

499
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:57,268
I can't see The Baron through
the window. Did he sell him?

500
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:00,604
That cat doll?
You want to see it? Come on.

501
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,283
Close the door.

502
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,889
It's like we're in the sky!

503
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,565
Afraid of heights?

504
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,610
No, I like high places. This is great.

505
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,745
This is the time it looks best. In here.

506
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,478
Perfect timing.

507
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,688
Sit there.

508
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,106
The clock's gone!

509
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,609
The one that was there?

510
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,279
Grandpa's delivering it today.

511
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,739
Did he sell it?

512
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,325
It was here being fixed.

513
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,453
I wanted to see it again.

514
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,457
It took three years. He finished it
the day you forgot your lunch.

515
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,750
That lunch!

516
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,836
I know it wasn't yours.

517
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,838
Look into the cat's eyes.

518
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,052
Quick, before the light goes.

519
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,526
Engelzimmer: "angel's room."

520
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,988
The artisan accidentally
scratched it with a cloth.

521
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,823
It's beautiful.

522
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:19,118
The Baron won't go. He's a treasure.

523
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:20,703
A treasure?

524
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:26,083
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.

525
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,503
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.

526
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,467
Turn on the light if you want.

527
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:53,819
It's weird. I feel
as if I've known you for years.

528
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,530
Sometimes I really want to see you.

529
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,704
You look sad today, somehow.

530
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:09,978
- Had enough?
- Yeah. Thanks.

531
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,773
Are you making a violin?

532
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,650
Uh, yeah.

533
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,611
Can I see?

534
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,659
It fits like this.

535
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,955
You made all that? By hand?

536
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:31,417
- Sure!
- Amazing!

537
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,795
The shape hasn't changed
in 300 years.

538
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,215
The sound comes
from the craftsman's skill.

539
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,719
You made all those?

540
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,556
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.

541
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,268
- But one of them is yours?
- Yeah.

542
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,813
- Which one?
- That one.

543
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,648
This one?

544
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:59,737
Wow! You made this? It's like magic!

545
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,283
How can you talk like that
with a straight face?

546
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,494
Why? It's what I think.

547
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,330
Anyone can do that.

548
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,167
I've got a long way to go.

549
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,676
You can play, can't you?

550
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:23,844
A little.

551
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:26,430
Play for me, OK? Please!

552
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,639
Listen...

553
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,267
Please, please, please!

554
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,145
You have to sing too.

555
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,815
Me? I'm tone-deaf!

556
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,358
Perfect!

557
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,336
Sing. You know this song.

558
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:26,406
Had a dream of living on my own

559
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:32,079
With no fear of being all alone

560
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:37,459
Pushed my sadness down inside of me

561
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:42,548
And pretended
! was strong as I could be

562
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:47,928
Country road, this old road

563
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:53,559
If you go right to the end

564
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:59,356
Got a feeling it'll take me

565
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:04,319
To that town, country road

566
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:10,492
It doesn't matter to me
how sad I might be

567
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:15,831
! will never ever let
a tear show in my eye

568
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:22,296
If my feet are moving faster
that's because I only want to

569
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:26,925
Push away memories

570
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:32,556
Country road, this old road

571
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:37,811
Could go right to my hometown

572
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:43,483
! won't go there, I can't go there

573
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:49,364
Can't go down that country road

574
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:54,244
Country road, when tomorrow comes

575
00:56:54,828 --> 00:57:00,500
I'll be like I always am

576
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:05,881
Want to go back there
Can't go back there

577
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:09,009
Fare thee well

578
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,806
Country road

579
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,548
That was fun!

580
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,846
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.

581
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,811
I was hoping you'd come back again.

582
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:04,189
These are my musical friends.

583
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,233
Nice singing.

584
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,028
You're the lucky one who was there
when he fixed the clock.

585
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,365
Seiji has some pretty friends.

586
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:18,078
Seiji? Are you Amasawa Seiji?

587
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,581
Yeah, didn't I tell you my name?

588
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,419
No! It says Nishi outside.

589
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,339
That's Grandpa's name. I'm Amasawa.

590
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:34,636
Oh, no! First I was buried alive,
and now the sky's fallen in!

591
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:38,473
What difference does it make
what my name is?

592
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,144
A lot! You've been calling me
by my full name!

593
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,438
You never asked me mine!

594
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,773
I never had the chance!

595
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,110
My image of Amasawa Seiji...

596
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,278
What?

597
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,363
...was someone quiet and gentle.

598
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,657
You read too many books.

599
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,826
So do you!

600
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,928
That was fun. They're nice people.

601
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,931
Come back. They'll like that.

602
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,976
Just to listen. Singing's too hard.

603
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:27,564
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?

604
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,734
There's lots as good as me.

605
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,904
What I want to do is make violins.

606
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,990
Yeah. You're good at that.

607
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,827
There's a school for it
in Cremona, Italy.

608
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,580
I want to go there.

609
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,500
And not go to high school?

610
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:52,714
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.

611
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,896
It must be great
to know what you want to do.

612
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:13,026
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.

613
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:18,406
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.

614
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:24,246
Even if l go, I won't know
if I have the talent until I try.

615
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,834
I'll see you home.

616
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,878
No, it's not far. See you.

617
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,756
Tsukishima...

618
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,591
Yeah?

619
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,969
You've got a talent for poetry.

620
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:43,557
What you sang back there was fine,
but I liked Concrete Roads too.

621
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,685
You told me to forget that!

622
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,563
- Did I say that?
- Yes!

623
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,356
I did?

624
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,027
Thanks for everything. Good night.

625
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:19,134
Don't fall asleep
with the light on again.

626
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,894
When did you decide on your future?

627
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,270
What?

628
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,605
Your future!

629
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,524
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?

630
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,568
I don't mean that!

631
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,613
I'm at university finding that out.

632
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:42,782
Good night.

633
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,242
Good night.

634
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:02,135
Mom's class is canceled,
so now she sleeps in!

635
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,314
- Morning!
- Morning!

636
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,733
Run faster!

637
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,610
You go ahead!

638
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:33,625
PERIOD 1
FREE STUDY. GO OVER P. 32-33

639
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,296
Great!

640
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,632
Shizuku!

641
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,425
You look awful!

642
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,303
You sure got better fast!

643
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,181
I hear you were out
with a boy last night.

644
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,308
Who told you that?!

645
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,186
A little bird who said
you were like lovers.

646
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:54,562
We are not!

647
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:06,950
Harada, I'll tell my friend
the answer's no. Sorry.

648
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,953
I'm sorry too.

649
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,496
That's OK.

650
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,838
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!

651
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:31,224
This formula will be
on the midterm, so remember it!

652
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,227
That's all!

653
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,125
Is Tsukishima here?

654
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,627
Amasawa? What do you want?

655
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,047
Is Tsukishima in this class?

656
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,467
Tsukishima? Yeah, she's here.

657
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,136
Tsukishima! You've got a visitor!

658
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:09,304
A male!

659
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,643
There she is.

660
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:19,272
Seiji?

661
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,900
Can I talk to you?

662
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,069
Yes!

663
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,405
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!

664
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:33,495
No, I don't!

665
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,961
What is it?

666
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:45,507
- I'm going to Italy.
- What?

667
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,467
Come with me.

668
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,973
- Where are we going?
- The roof!

669
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,066
Wow!

670
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:08,113
We can't talk
with all those people around.

671
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,658
Sorry. I wanted to tell you first.

672
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:17,664
Let them think what they want.

673
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,960
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.

674
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,254
What's that?

675
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:29,217
I apprentice in a workshop there
for two months.

676
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,177
Apprentice?

677
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:35,807
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.

678
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,936
Also if I have the patience
to stick it out.

679
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,189
Otherwise I go to high school.

680
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,985
I hate that they're leaving
an escape route...

681
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,903
...but it's a good chance.

682
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,572
When do you go?

683
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:55,493
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.

684
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,412
Soon then.

685
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,124
Great! Your dream's coming true.

686
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:04,377
Well, I'll do the best I can.

687
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,006
- Well

688
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,428
- The rain's stopping.
- Yeah.

689
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,097
Look over there.

690
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,605
There might be a rainbow.

691
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:39,579
What's Cremona like? I hope it's nice.

692
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:45,627
It's an old town,
with lots of violin makers.

693
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:49,547
It's great. You're on your way.

694
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,133
I feel like a fool.

695
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,678
I was hoping we'd go
to the same high school.

696
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,307
What a stupid thing to think.

697
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:21,663
I saw your name on the library cards
a long time ago.

698
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:25,625
We passed each other in the library.

699
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,671
I even sat beside you there.

700
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:36,511
I read all kinds of books so my name
would be on the cards before yours.

701
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,681
I...

702
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:44,352
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.

703
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,567
Me too.

704
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,320
Don't push!

705
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,245
Hey!

706
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,833
Look out, she's mad!

707
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:09,919
Run!

708
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,204
- Here.
- Thanks.

709
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,497
Excuse me.

710
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,042
Finished already?

711
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,086
I'm meeting Yuko.

712
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,383
If you're by the station, get some milk.

713
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,846
You're the one who drinks it all!

714
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,224
She's slacking off these days.

715
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,164
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's OK.

716
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,124
My head's in a whirl.

717
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,878
- Hello, Shizuku.
- Hello.

718
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,676
- Hello.

719
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,805
I'll make some tea.

720
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:48,434
Dad and I aren't speaking.

721
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,276
Boys are so lucky!

722
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:04,450
When he comes back to graduate,
he goes again for ten years!

723
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,828
That's like forever!

724
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:11,457
But it's like fate
brought you together! Cool!

725
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:16,671
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books,

726
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:20,466
except one's going forward
while the other stays behind.

727
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,552
Yeah.

728
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:26,806
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.

729
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:31,477
She said he was hard to get to know,
but good-looking and smart.

730
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:35,815
Don't tell me that, will you!

731
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,483
I just feel worse!

732
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:41,320
Why? He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!

733
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,531
Now I'm not so sure.

734
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:52,498
I don't get it. I'd write every day,
we'd encourage each other.

735
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,003
You can't say "Go for it"
to someone more ambitious than you.

736
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,172
Maybe...

737
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:04,051
But I don't understand what you want.

738
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,388
Can't you be in love
without your future planned out?

739
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,809
You have talent.

740
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,521
All the juniors liked
your translation of Country Roads.

741
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,442
You can express yourself too,
unlike me.

742
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,155
"There's lots as good as me."

743
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,574
That's what he said.

744
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:30,703
He's going to find out
if he has talent. Well, so will I!

745
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,875
I'll write a story!

746
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:39,587
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.

747
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,256
But it's exam time.

748
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:46,469
I don't care. Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.

749
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,387
- You going?
- Yeah.

750
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,559
Good night.

751
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,937
Tell your mother hello.

752
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,192
You go for it too.

753
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,697
Sugimura will realize.

754
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:08,533
Bye.

755
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:14,455
It's so easy!
I just have to do something too!

756
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:19,669
Moon?

757
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,216
Muta?

758
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:29,095
Mom! Muta's gone again!

759
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,721
Muta!

760
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:32,932
Muta...

761
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:41,858
'WHISPER OF THE HEART'": LISTEN
TO THE VOICE OF THE FOREST...

762
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,968
The Baron as the hero?

763
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,345
Would you mind?

764
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:15,641
I ask because Seiji says
the doll is a treasure of yours.

765
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,187
You didn't have to ask.

766
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,483
Of course you can.
But on one condition.

767
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:26,652
Yes?

768
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:31,657
That you let me be the first person
to read your story.

769
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:33,951
Um...

770
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:35,995
All right?

771
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:41,167
Do I have to? I don't know
if I can write it or not.

772
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,923
It's the same for a craftsman.

773
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,343
Don't expect perfection at first.

774
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:53,220
Here, let me show you something.

775
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,270
This.

776
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:06,567
Look at it.

777
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,411
It's called mica slate.

778
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,914
Look at the seam.

779
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,166
Like that.

780
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,470
It's beautiful!

781
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:40,059
It's called beryl.
You find it in emerald ore.

782
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:43,270
- Emerald? The jewel?
- Yes.

783
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,857
You and Seiji are like this stone.

784
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,986
Rough, unpolished, still natural.

785
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:53,781
I like stones that way.

786
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:58,411
But making violins
or writing stories is different.

787
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:04,417
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.

788
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,419
It takes time and effort.

789
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:10,631
You see the ore that makes up
most of that stone?

790
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,216
Yes.

791
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:17,722
You could polish that,
but what you'd get would be worthless.

792
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:21,100
The smaller part inside is purer.

793
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:26,564
There might even be a better stone
deep inside where we can't see.

794
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:31,652
I'm sorry. Old people like to preach.

795
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:37,908
I'm scared. What if there
isn't a beautiful crystal in me?

796
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:42,496
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.

797
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,624
Thank you. I'll look forward to it.

798
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:57,803
A rough stone... lapis lazuli...

799
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,810
Let us go forth together

800
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,646
in search of the treasure
of lapis lazuli!

801
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:13,944
Have no fear. Space is deformed
on the night of the new moon.

802
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,826
Faraway things loom large,
nearby things look small.

803
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,957
Fly! We will rise on the updraft.

804
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:36,383
Make haste! The planetoids converge!

805
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,981
Good! We're riding the wind!

806
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,485
Straight up to that castle!

807
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,695
It's so high!

808
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,532
It's not so high once you're there!

809
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:23,389
When the air currents mingle in the
afternoon, you can touch the stars!

810
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:26,392
Huh?

811
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:35,359
That's rare.
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...

812
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:17,776
He's making a violin in his cell.

813
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,144
Seiji!

814
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,272
I thought you'd gone!

815
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:58,234
Grandpa said I might find you here.

816
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:02,112
I leave tomorrow.

817
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,906
Tomorrow...

818
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:10,120
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.

819
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,565
Sorry I can't walk you home.

820
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,777
That's OK. I'm glad you came.

821
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:45,447
I can't come to the airport,
but I'll wait for you.

822
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,700
Yeah. It's only two months.

823
01:19:54,581 --> 01:20:00,170
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.

824
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,555
I'll see you, then.

825
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,560
Have a good trip!

826
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:37,875
I and Luisa, my betrothed,
were born in a distant land.

827
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,466
In that town, magic still lived,

828
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:50,763
and in the veins of its artisans
flowed the blood of sorcerers.

829
01:20:57,227 --> 01:21:01,815
It was a poor doll maker's
apprentice who fashioned us,

830
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:08,113
but Luisa and I were happy

831
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:12,076
because he had made us
So we could love others.

832
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,787
But then...

833
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:22,461
...BUT THE PEACEFUL...

834
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,463
Shizuku! Shizuku!

835
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,466
Shizuku!

836
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:33,347
What's going on? Tsukishima!

837
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,767
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

838
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:39,478
Pay attention! This is important!

839
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:40,604
Sorry, sir.

840
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:42,606
Harada, you read.

841
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:48,278
You were up until four again?!

842
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:51,240
It's OK. I'm not sleepy at all.

843
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:56,161
But you're spaced out all the time.
Like just now...

844
01:21:56,328 --> 01:22:00,624
I was thinking. I've got
to organize what I want to write.

845
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,837
I'm not hungry.

846
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,951
Shizuku? So, you are home.

847
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,704
Turn on the lights!

848
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:42,708
At least you could bring in the laundry!

849
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:46,211
Shizuku! Come here!

850
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,550
Shizuku's here, isn't she?

851
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,552
She's not hungry.

852
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:21,371
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.

853
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:25,042
This way.
Is anyone in the guidance office?

854
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:27,586
Please.

855
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:35,219
I'm back!

856
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:39,806
Hello.

857
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:42,434
You're home early, Shiho.

858
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,355
I'm beat!

859
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,899
- Want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

860
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:54,738
Mom, can I talk to you?

861
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:55,948
What?

862
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,622
I'm thinking of moving out.

863
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:08,460
- I've found a place.
- But can you afford it?

864
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:10,796
I've saved from my job.

865
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:14,299
I found another one
at a cram school. I'll get by.

866
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,555
I guess I've made you help me out
too much around here.

867
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,516
I'll talk to your father.

868
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:24,893
You will? Great!

869
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:31,191
Money's tight till I graduate
in the spring and get working,

870
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,443
but I'll help you out then.

871
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,237
Sounds good.

872
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:38,198
Sorry to go during your master's thesis.

873
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:39,908
Thanks.

874
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:43,829
You helped enough just
with sorting out data.

875
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:49,459
And Shizuku can concentrate
in her own room. She's acting weird.

876
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,253
You think so too?

877
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,299
The school called me. Look at this.

878
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:57,467
What is it?

879
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:01,972
She's gone down a hundred places!

880
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:06,977
She's at her desk all the time.
What's she doing?

881
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,863
- Good evening.
- Hello.

882
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,533
Excuse me.

883
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:30,751
What high school will take you
with marks like this?!

884
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:33,420
I'm not going to high school!

885
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:39,301
Use your head! What can you do
with a middle school education?

886
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,928
I can decide my own future!

887
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,597
Watch your mouth!

888
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:47,893
Face the facts! The school makes
its report on you after the second term!

889
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,437
You're a fine one to talk!

890
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:53,273
You don't study!
You just work part-time!

891
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,734
I do what I have to!

892
01:25:56,610 --> 01:26:00,572
You're the one who isn't doing that.
Don't you understand?

893
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,951
I've got something more important to do!

894
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:07,871
Like what? Tell me.

895
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,584
Shiho, Shizuku, that's enough.

896
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:15,962
But Dad, listen to this girl!

897
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:19,424
Both of you come out here
and tell me about it.

898
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:22,678
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.

899
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:25,639
Come on.

900
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,110
MID-TERM TEST RESULTS:
153TH OF 275

901
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:43,699
I see. Is it true what Shiho says?

902
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,451
I do so care about my marks!

903
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,620
You just said you
weren't going to high school.

904
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,289
You said I wouldn't get into one!

905
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:55,877
Shiho, can Shizuku
and I talk alone for a bit?

906
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,879
Yes.

907
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,634
- Where's your mother?
- At the Tanakas.

908
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:06,471
- I'm back.
- Hi, Mom.

909
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,140
Is your dad back?

910
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:13,353
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.

911
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,688
Coming.

912
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:22,154
All right, Shizuku.

913
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:28,285
Is what you're doing now
more important than studying?

914
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,789
Can you tell me what it is?

915
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,876
When it's time.

916
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:40,213
Is this something
you have to do right away?

917
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,842
I've only got three weeks left to do it!

918
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:47,846
I'm testing myself.

919
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,097
I have to.

920
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:52,642
Testing yourself? How?

921
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:56,897
How will we know if you don't say?

922
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:01,777
Is it something you can't even tell us?

923
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:06,364
- Seiyal
- Oh, sorry.

924
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:20,337
Whatever you're doing at the library,

925
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:22,547
I admire how hard you're working.

926
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:26,718
Let's let her do what she wants.

927
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,472
Not everyone has to be the same.

928
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:36,645
I should know that if anyone does...

929
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:41,566
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.

930
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:46,446
But it's not easy
when you walk your own road.

931
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,866
You've only got yourself to blame.

932
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,871
And join us at mealtimes, all right?

933
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:57,958
- Yeah. We're a family.
- Yes.

934
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,043
Call Shiho.

935
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:04,422
I'll make some tea.

936
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:08,885
Shizuku.

937
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:15,183
I know what Dad said, but what
he really wants is for you to study.

938
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,186
I know. It's written on his face.

939
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:21,773
I'm moving out next Sunday.

940
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,109
You'll have your own room.

941
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,152
You're leaving home?

942
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,446
Yep. So, smarten up!

943
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:40,667
Hurry!

944
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:42,961
Hurry!

945
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,798
Only the one is real.

946
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:49,634
Which is the real one?!

947
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:52,012
Hurry! Hurry!

948
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:54,306
Hurry!

949
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:38,284
Luisa, you've finally come,
but I've grown so old.

950
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:06,438
Shizuku.

951
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:10,775
Come in. I was fast asleep.

952
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:16,740
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.

953
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,246
It's finished?

954
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:28,752
You promised you'd be
the first to read it.

955
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:31,171
It's a novel!

956
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:32,464
"WHISPER OF THE HEART"

957
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:34,758
A STORY FROM THE BARON
SHIZUKU TSUKISHIMA

958
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:39,471
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.

959
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:45,268
But you've worked so hard on it.
Shouldn't I take my time?

960
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:50,565
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...

961
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:53,902
My heart's pounding.

962
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:57,155
I see. I'll read it right now.

963
01:32:57,322 --> 01:33:00,408
Come sit by the fire. It's cold.

964
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,999
Now we won't be bothered.

965
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,465
Can I wait downstairs?

966
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:19,302
It's OK. I'm not cold at all.

967
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:24,307
Of course, but...

968
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:39,215
You're asleep here?

969
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:41,551
Shizuku, I'm finished.

970
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:46,723
Thank you. It's very good.

971
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,224
It's not!

972
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:52,228
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!

973
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:55,940
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!

974
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:59,861
Yes, it's rough, blunt, unfinished,

975
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:02,614
just like Seiji's violin.

976
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:10,121
You've shown me the rough stone
you've just cut out of the rock.

977
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,792
You've worked hard. You're wonderful.

978
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:20,298
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.

979
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:48,409
It's cold out here. Come inside.

980
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:49,619
Now...

981
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:53,665
Now that I've written it I know.

982
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:56,334
Wanting isn't enough.

983
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:59,170
I have to learn more,

984
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:05,134
but Seiji's getting
further and further ahead.

985
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:09,639
I felt that I had to force myself
to write, and I was so scared.

986
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:15,144
You like Seiji, do you?

987
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,208
How is it?

988
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,585
It's very good.

989
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:47,093
When Seiji finished his first violin,
we had ramen noodles.

990
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:48,886
Jumbo size.

991
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:55,393
Thank you.

992
01:36:57,312 --> 01:37:00,064
Now, where was I?

993
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:03,443
You found The Baron in a coffee shop...

994
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,820
Yes, in Germany.

995
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:11,534
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic.

996
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:15,246
I asked the owner to sell him to me.

997
01:37:15,872 --> 01:37:17,832
But he wouldn't.

998
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:23,087
The Baron had a lover,
and he wouldn't separate them.

999
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:29,969
He was waiting for her to come back
from being repaired

1000
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:32,096
at the doll maker's shop.

1001
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:36,309
Just like in my story!

1002
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,771
Yes, quite the coincidence.

1003
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:44,108
I had to come home,
so I'd just about given up.

1004
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:48,363
Then a lady friend of mine

1005
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,617
said when the other doll
came back, she would take it

1006
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:55,620
and bring the two dolls together.

1007
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:58,289
So the owner gave in.

1008
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:03,044
So I ended up leaving Germany
with just The Baron.

1009
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:09,217
! promised her I'd come back,
and asked her to keep the other doll.

1010
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:13,638
The day the dolls met again

1011
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:17,517
would be the day we did.

1012
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:24,357
But then the war started,
and I couldn't keep my promise.

1013
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:31,239
When I was finally able to go back,
I looked all over for her.

1014
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:37,495
But there was no trace of her
or The Baron's lover.

1015
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:42,250
She must have been
very important to you.

1016
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:46,629
Your story brought The Baron
out of my memory

1017
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:49,424
and back to life.

1018
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,342
Oh, yes.

1019
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:01,686
Hold out your hand.

1020
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:09,152
But...

1021
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:13,489
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.

1022
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:17,827
Now, finish up your story.

1023
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:18,995
Yes.

1024
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,304
Thank you!

1025
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:41,851
Goodbye!

1026
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:53,404
I'm home.

1027
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:55,198
Hi.

1028
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,160
Where's Dad?

1029
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:03,247
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?

1030
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:09,128
Sorry I worried you. Today I return
to studying for my entrance exams.

1031
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:12,131
So, your trials are over?

1032
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:13,841
For now.

1033
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:17,929
Did you eat? There's curry.

1034
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:19,263
I'm fine!

1035
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:22,808
"For now."”

1036
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:35,404
Shizuku, the bath's open.

1037
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:57,176
Ah, a soldier at ease.

1038
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:05,036
No!

1039
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:14,587
Wait there!

1040
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:32,021
It's a miracle! You're here!

1041
01:42:32,188 --> 01:42:33,731
We're not dreaming?

1042
01:42:33,898 --> 01:42:36,984
I got an earlier plane. Hop on.

1043
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:40,821
Wait, you'll be cold.

1044
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:44,575
Climb on.

1045
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,119
I'll get a coat.

1046
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:49,455
No time! Get on.

1047
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,417
Hang on tight.

1048
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:02,802
I was out there calling you in my head.

1049
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:04,428
"Shizuku!"

1050
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:08,015
And then you appeared!

1051
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:09,433
What a team!

1052
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:14,438
Me too. It's like I'm still dreaming!

1053
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:22,113
How was Cremona?

1054
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:25,866
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.

1055
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:27,952
It's getting light!

1056
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:39,505
- Shall I get off?
- It's OK.

1057
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:45,720
I made up my mind
I was going to ride you up this hill!

1058
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,596
That's not fair!

1059
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,685
I'm no man's burden!

1060
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:59,191
I want to be of use!

1061
01:44:00,401 --> 01:44:02,445
OK! Push!

1062
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:04,280
Almost there!

1063
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:21,672
Shizuku! Jump on!

1064
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:41,150
We made it!

1065
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:48,199
- I'll hold the coat.
- It's OK.

1066
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:52,620
Here...

1067
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:13,432
Wow! In the mist it looks
just like the sea!

1068
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:17,394
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.

1069
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:04,650
I wanted you to see this.

1070
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:10,781
Grandpa told me everything.

1071
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:15,452
I didn't do anything to help.
I was just thinking of myself.

1072
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:18,789
No, you were the reason I did it.

1073
01:46:19,707 --> 01:46:24,461
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.

01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:30,134

and go on to high school.

Listen, Shizuku,

1076
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:37,641
I can't say how soon it'll be, but...

1077
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:40,978
...would you marry me?

1078
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:46,150
I'm going to be a violin maker
and then...

1079
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:52,948
You mean it?

1080
01:46:53,115 --> 01:46:56,327
That's exactly what I wanted.

1081
01:46:56,493 --> 01:46:58,746
Yeah? Great!

1082
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:01,624
Wait, it's cold.

1083
01:47:02,499 --> 01:47:05,336
