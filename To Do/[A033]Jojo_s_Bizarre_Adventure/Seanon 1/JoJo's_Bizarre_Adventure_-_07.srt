IN THE REGION I CALL HOME,

373
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,588
OUR CUSTOM IS
NOT TO SHAKE HANDS.

374
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,223
IN THIS WAY,
WE GREET EACH OTHER.

PASSED BEYOND THE VEIL.

WE HAD ARRIVED EARLIER,

00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:23,890
HIS FATE WOULD STILL
HAVE BEEN THE SAME.

382
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,860
HIS DEATH IS PROOF

383
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:31,297
THAT THE STRENGTH
THIS DIO WIELDS IS DEVASTATING.

384
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:37,871
