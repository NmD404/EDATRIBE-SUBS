Von Stroheim:
YOU DREW BLOOD FROM ME, NO?

349
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:11,244
DON'T MAKE ME ORDER YOU
TO LICK MY WOUND CLEAN.

350
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:12,513
Woman: YES, SIR.

351
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:16,049
Von Stroheim: GENTLY NOW.

352
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:19,252
I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO HURT ME AGAIN.

353
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,322
GOOD. SLOWLY NOW. SLOWLY.

354
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:25,659
MMM. I THINK THE PAIN
IS GOING AWAY.

355
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,861

HE IS NOW AWAKE,
MAJOR VON STROHEIM.

363
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,579

366
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,553
CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME?

367
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,354
ALLOW ME TO ESCORT YOU HOME.

368
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,856
EH?

369
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:57,791
WHY IN THE HELL
DID YOU DO THAT?!

370
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,225
Reporter: YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE

371
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:00,794
CALLING ME A FLOOZY,
YOU BIG BRUTE!

372
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:03,369
JUST WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE, ANYWAY, HUH?

373
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:05,305
JoJo: WHAT? I NEVER SAID THAT.

374
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:06,940
Smokey: NO, YOU DID.

375
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:09,810
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD NEVER
FIGHT FOR A FLOOZY LIKE HER.

376
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,646
JoJo: REALLY?
WOW, I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

377
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,648
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

378
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:16,449
IT JUST HAPPENED KINDA‐‐

379
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:17,751
AGH!

380
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:19,452
Reporter: YEAH,
I'M SURE IT "JUST HAPPENS"

381
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:21,121
EVERY TIME
YOU TALK ABOUT A WOMAN.

382
00:18:21,154 --> 00:18:22,889
( JoJo groans )

383
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:24,625
YOUR MOUTH OKAY?

384
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:28,161

385
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:29,996
( JoJo sighs )

386
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:33,333
LOOKS LIKE THE ADRENALINE
FROM HER FEAR JUST WORE OFF.

387
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,001
NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT

388
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:38,171
ABOUT THIS PILLAR MAN
STRAIZO WAS TALKING ABOUT.

389
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:41,141
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MEXICO.

390
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,110
( fly buzzing )

391
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:47,514

coughing )

392
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:54,487
HOW ARE YOU FEELING‐‐

393
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:56,590
( coughs ) SPEEDWAGON?

394
00:18:56,657 --> 00:19:00,193
THERE IS A SAYING IN EUROPE
THAT COMES TO MIND.

395
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,269
"THE VILLAGE IN WHICH
THE ELDERLY KILL EACH OTHER

396
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:05,338
IS NOT LONG FOR THIS WORLD."

397
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,840
YOU HAVE A SECRET,

398
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:10,844
A SECRET THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS
AND COULD KILL US ALL.

399
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,784
I WANT ANSWERS NOW!

400
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:19,185
( Speedwagon gasps )

401
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,393
Von Stroheim:
THERE APPEARS TO BE A MAN

402
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,729
TRAPPED INSIDE THIS PILLAR.

403
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:31,632
WE EXTRACTED IT FROM
THE LOCATION WE GOT FROM YOU.

404
00:19:31,698 --> 00:19:34,067
( Speedwagon groans )
WHY, GOD? WHY DO THIS TO ME?

405
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,903
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST
HAVE LET ME DIE BACK THERE?

406
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,805
WHY DID YOU MAKE ME LIVE?!

407
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:41,742
Von Stroheim: IT WASN'T GOD.
AT LEAST, NOT YOUR GOD.

408
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:45,646
I WAS THE ONE WHO MADE YOU LIVE,
BUT I CAN CHANGE THAT.

409
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:49,415
THE WEHRMACHT WOULD LIKE
SOME INFORMATION FROM YOU

410
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:51,084
BEFORE ANYTHING DRASTIC HAPPENS.

411
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:52,418
( Speedwagon gasps )

412
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,888
Von Stroheim:
YOU ARE STUBBORN, OLD MAN.

413
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:56,990
I'M SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT TORTURE ALONE

414
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,693
WOULD NOT GIVE US
WHAT WE WANT OUT OF YOU.

415
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,602
I ALSO KNOW
THAT YOU WERE PENNILESS

416
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,336
WHEN YOU FIRST GOT TO TEXAS.

417
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,105
YOU WERE NEARLY DEAD
IN THE DESERT

418
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,008
WHEN YOU FOUND THE OIL FIELDS
THAT WOULD SOON CAUSE

419
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,877
A MASSIVE OVERHAUL
OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMY.

420
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,045
GET READY!

421
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,781
GERMAN MEDICINE IS
THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD,

422
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:15,782
DON'T YOU THINK?!

423
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,518
WE CAN DO ANYTHING!

424
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,052
Speedwagon: A TRUTH SERUM?

425
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,188
FOR WHAT? WHAT MORE COULD
YOU POSSIBLY WANT FROM ME?

426
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,391
Von Stroheim: EVERYTHING!
I WANT TO KNOW IT ALL.

427
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,893
GIVE ME A HISTORY LESSON.

428
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:30,163
TELL ME ABOUT STRAIZO
UND ABOUT THIS JOESTAR.

429
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,568
TELL US SO THAT WE CAN
FINALLY AWAKEN THE PILLAR MAN.

430
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:36,036
Speedwagon: NO. NO, YOU CAN'T.

431
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,704
YOU DON'T KNOW THE FORCES
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH.

432
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,172
( Von Stroheim gargling )

433
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,007
Speedwagon: HE'S POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO DESTROY US ALL.

434
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,711
Von Stroheim:
MAKE THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS

435
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,680
FOR THE BLOOD FEEDING
EXPERIMENT,

436
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,215
UND DON'T SCREW ANYTHING UP.

437

( prisoners murmuring )

443
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:01,768
Von Stroheim: WE NEED BLOOD

444
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:04,605
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT,
HISTORIC EXPERIMENT.

445
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:06,106
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL AGREED

446
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:09,075
ON WHO WILL BE THE ONE
TO SACRIFICE HIS LIFE,

447
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:12,445

YOUR FREEDOM IMMEDIATELY.

YOU PROMISE THAT YOU'LL
LET EVERYONE ELSE GO, RIGHT?

452

Von Stroheim:
YOU ARE QUITE BRAVE.

453
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:25,926
COURAGE LIKE YOURS IS A THING

454
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:28,128
THAT MUST BE CULTIVATED
LIKE A LUSH GARDEN.

455
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:31,031
HERE, WE WILL ALLOW
ONLY THE MOST FIT TO LIVE.

456
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:34,635
