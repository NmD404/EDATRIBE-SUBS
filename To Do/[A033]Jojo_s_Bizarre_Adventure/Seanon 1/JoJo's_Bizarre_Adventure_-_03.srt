I HAVE ALL THE PROOF I REQUIRE
AND THEN SOME.

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,688
HE'S FOUND HIS PROOF. SO BE IT.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,025
THIS MOMENT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME COMING, JOJO.

8
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:29,763
NOW I FINISH WHAT I STARTED.

THE ANTIDOTE.

FATHER TOOK IT MOMENTS AGO.

13
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:15,616
DIO, THIS PAINS ME GREATLY.

14
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:17,617
FOR YEARS, YOU WERE MY BROTHER,

15
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,453
AND NOW I HAVE NO RECOURSE
BUT TO TURN YOU IN.

16

I'M SORRY, REALLY.

17

I'M SURE YOU DON'T BELIEVE
A WORD OF IT,

18

YOU SHOW COMPASSION.

JOJO, I'VE BEEN A DEVIL,
BUT GRANT ME THIS ONE WISH.

21
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:42,008
ALLOW ME TO DO THE RIGHT THING
FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE

22
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:43,610

WHAT'S THIS?

24
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:47,347
I THOUGHT ONCE I CONFRONTED HIM,

25
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:51,084
HE'D FIGHT ME TOOTH AND NAIL
LIKE A CORNERED BEAST.

26
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:52,152
Dio: JOJO.

27
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:55,355
YOU SHOULD BE DEAD
IN A GUTTER RIGHT NOW.

28
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:57,190
I MUST DISTRACT HIM LONG ENOUGH

29
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:59,693
FOR THE KNIFE AND MASK
TO FIND THEIR MARK.

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,702
MY WICKED DEEDS GNAW AT ME.

31
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:05,706
THE POVERTY I KNEW AS A CHILD
ATE AWAY AT MY MORAL COMPASS

32
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:07,440
UNTIL GREED
WAS ALL THAT REMAINED.

33
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:09,042
I'M THE LOWEST OF THE LOW.

34
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:11,545
YOUR FATHER TOOK ME IN
OFF THE STREET,

35
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:13,680
AND I REPAID HIS KINDNESS
WITH POISON.

36
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:17,551
THE ONLY REASON I CAME BACK
WAS TO SURRENDER MYSELF.

37

IF I'D WANTED TO FLEE,

38
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:21,655

LIKE AS NOT.

WONDERING WHO I AM.

48
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,377
SO I FOLLOWED HIM BACK HOME.

I LIKE YOU, JONATHAN,

50
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:49,182
SO I'M GONNA OFFER UP
THIS LITTLE TIDBIT PRO BONO.

00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:52,553
LIVING IN THE GUTTER, YOU LEARN
TO SPOT LOWLIFES PRETTY QUICK

52
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:54,087
IF YOU WANT TO SEE TOMORROW.

53
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:57,223
I'VE TRAINED MY NOSE TO SORT OUT
THE BAD ONES FROM THE GOOD

54
00:03:57,257 --> 00:03:58,191
JUST FROM A SNIFF.

55

WORSE THAN ANYONE
I'VE EVER LAID EYES ON!

57
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:08,108
HE IS PURE EVIL
RIGHT DOWN TO HIS VERY BONES!

58
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,711
IS HE A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCE,
YOU'RE WONDERING?

59
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:12,779
NOT ON YOUR LIFE!

60
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:15,682

62
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,951

YOU USED ON FATHER.

70
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,133
YOU BREAK MY HEART.

71
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,869
WHY, DIO?
FROM THE DAY YOU ARRIVED,

72
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:39,305
I HAVE LOVED YOU AS THOUGH
YOU WERE MY OWN SON.

74

JoJo: FATHER, YOU'RE TOO WEAK
TO BE DOWN HERE.

75
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:46,913
George: YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL RETURN TO MY CHAMBER.

76
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,551
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
MY BOY IN CHAINS.

77
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:53,153
DO WHAT YOU MUST, JOJO.

78
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:54,788
JoJo: I WILL.

79
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,057
Dio: IS THIS HOW IT ALL ENDS?

80
00:04:57,123 --> 00:05:00,727
Apothecary: HE WON'T SEE
THE INSIDE OF A CELL THIS NIGHT.

81
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:04,638
I READ HIS FACE AND THE TRIO
OF MOLES ON HIS EAR.

82
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,641
THE DEVIL SMILES ON HIM
AND GRANTS HIM LUCK.

( George grunts )

84
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:14,515
Dio: JOJO, I WANT YOU TO BE
THE ONE TO PUT THE CUFFS ON ME.

85
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,683
PLEASE, BROTHER.

86
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,118
JoJo: ALL RIGHT.

Speedwagon: BE CAREFUL.
HE'S A CRAFTY ONE.

89
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:27,193
Dio: JOJO, IT WAS HUBRIS THAT
LED ME TO THIS IGNOMINIOUS END.

90
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,931
THIS FALL FROM GRACE
HAS TAUGHT ME WELL.

91
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,466
HOWEVER ONE MAY SCHEME
AND DISSEMBLE,

92
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:37,437
MY DOWNFALL THIS NIGHT
IS PART OF THE HUMAN CONDITION,

93
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,173
A CONDITION I NOW FORSAKE.

94
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,776
JoJo: WAIT. FORSAKE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

95
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:47,047
Dio: YOU SEE, I AM
ABOUT TO BECOME SO MUCH MORE!

96
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,517
HELP ME SHED THIS MORTAL SKIN.

97
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,519

( JoJo gasps ) FATHER.

112
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,008
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

113
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:44,077
I SHOULD HAVE BLOCKED HIS KNIFE.

114
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,080
THE MASK.
WHEN I SAW IT, I FROZE UP,

115
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:49,850
AND YOU PAID THE PRICE.

116
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,051
( George grunts )

117
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,254
TAKE THIS RING.

118
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,759
IT WAS YOUR MOTHER'S, JOJO.

119
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,701
JoJo: FATHER.

120
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:01,968
Speedwagon: DAMN IT.

121
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:03,970
AIN'T A DOCTOR ON EARTH
WHO CAN FIX THAT.

122
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,906
HOW'D THAT DEVIL
GET THE DROP ON US?

123
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:07,373
Inspector: IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

124
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,310
IF ONLY I HADN'T LISTENED
TO YOU, SIR JOESTAR.

125
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:13,580
IF I HAD RUN HIS FATHER
OUT OF TOWN YEARS AGO

126
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:14,948
LIKE I'D A MIND TO,

127
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:16,917
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

128
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,919
Speedwagon: HOLD ON.
WHOSE FATHER?

129
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:21,622
Inspector: BACK WHEN I
FIRST JOINED THE FORCE,

130
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:25,325
THERE WAS A NE'ER‐DO‐WELL
WHO TRIED TO PAWN THAT VERY RING

131
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:27,994
YOU NOW SEE
ON JOESTAR'S FINGER.

132
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:32,298
THE SUSPECT WAS DIO'S
BIRTH FATHER, DARIO BRANDO.

133
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:34,635
George: IT'S MINE.

134
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:36,169
OF THAT, THERE'S NO DOUBT.

135
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,073
MY LATE WIFE AND I HAD THEM
MADE TO CELEBRATE OUR BETROTHAL.

136
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,843
Inspector: A LOCAL CUTPURSE
BY THE NAME OF DARIO BRANDO

137
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,778
‐ WAS TRYING TO SELL IT.
‐ George: HMM?

138
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:47,347
CAN IT BE?

139
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:50,751
Inspector: SIR JOESTAR THOUGHT
HE OWED HIS LIFE TO DARIO,

140
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:52,986
BUT HE WAS SADLY MISTAKEN.

141
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,856
DARIO HADN'T SCRAMBLED DOWN
TO THE MANGLED CARRIAGE

142
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:58,158
THAT FATEFUL NIGHT
TO LOOK FOR SURVIVORS,

143
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,527
BUT TO ROOT
FOR ILL‐GOTTEN RICHES.

144
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:03,469
Dario: HUH? YOU STAY BACK.

145
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:07,841
George: THIS MAN,
WHAT HAS HE SAID, INSPECTOR?

146
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:10,343
DID HE EVER TELL YOU
THAT I GAVE HIM THE RING?

147
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:12,312
Inspector: AYE.
HE SWORE UP AND DOWN.

148
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:13,880
YOU FILTHY LIAR.

149
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:15,348
George: HE SWORE
WITH GOOD REASON.

150
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:18,051
I GAVE HIM THE RING,
JUST AS HE TOLD YOU.

151
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:19,886
Inspector: YOU HAVE
GOT TO BE KIDDING!

152
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:20,887
Dario: EH?

153
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,689
George: HE IS INNOCENT.

154
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:25,125
LET HIM GO AT ONCE, INSPECTOR.

155
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:27,360
Inspector: BUT, SIR,
THIS MAN STOLE FROM YOU.

156
00:08:27,393 --> 00:08:30,196
George: BUT FOR
PROVIDENCE'S HAND IN MY LIFE,

157
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,133
I MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE DONE THE SAME.

158
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:36,036
SELL THIS RING

159
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:38,739
IF YOU MAY EASE
YOUR FAMILY'S BURDEN BY IT.

160
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:44,310
WALK AN HONEST PATH HENCEFORTH,
AND I GIVE IT GLADLY.

161
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,682
Inspector: HE KNEW HE DIDN'T
OWE DARIO A DAMN THING,

162
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:51,084
AND HE TOOK DIO IN ALL THE SAME.

163
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:52,919
JoJo: FATHER, HANG ON.

164
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,088
THE DOCTOR IS ON HIS WAY NOW.

165
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:59,760
George: JOJO, DON'T HATE DIO
FOR WHAT HE'S DONE.

166
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,035
I AM TO BLAME FOR THIS.

167
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:06,707
I WAS HARD ON YOU,
BECAUSE YOU ARE A JOESTAR.

168
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:11,444
I WENT TOO EASY ON DIO, AND HE
MIGHT HAVE FELT I DIDN'T CARE.

169
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:16,249
PERHAPS HE DID THIS
FOR WANT OF A FATHER'S LOVE.

170
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:20,621
PLEASE, SEE THAT HE'S BURIED
NEXT TO DARIO.

171
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:23,724
JoJo: FATHER.

172
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:29,563
