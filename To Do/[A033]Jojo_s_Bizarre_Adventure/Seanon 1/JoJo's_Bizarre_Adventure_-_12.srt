00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,440
I THINK HE'LL GO
STRAIGHT FOR THE ATTACK.

176
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:08,909
WHO WILL WIN?

177
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,111
I CAN HARDLY WAIT.

178
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:15,115

179
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,416
Von Stroheim: WHAT? THAT'S ALL?

180
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,251
HE DIDN'T EVEN PUT UP A FIGHT.

181
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,420
HE'S AN ORDINARY MAN AFTER ALL.

182
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,723
Scientist #2: WE DON'T
HAVE ANY OTHER SUBJECTS

183
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,190
FOR THIS TEST,
MAJOR VON STROHEIM.

184
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,626
Scientist #3:
WE PLANTED EXPLOSIVES

185
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,628
IN THE PRISONER'S HEAD
FOR THIS EXACT SITUATION.

186
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,531
JUST GIVE US THE WORD, AND WE'LL
ACTIVATE THEM IMMEDIATELY.

194
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,446
I RESCIND THE ORDER!

195
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,480
HIS JAW, LOOK.

196
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,716
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE
WITH HIS JAW?

197
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,718
HIS HANDS, HIS ARMS.

198
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:54,588
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIS ARMS?

199
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,591
I'D GIVEN HIM UP FOR DEAD
IN THE BEGINNING,

200
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:01,668
BUT LOOK. SANTVIENTO IS
SOMEHOW ABSORBING THE PRISONER.

201
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:03,604

Von Stroheim: HE'S PULLING HIM
STRAIGHT INTO HIS BODY.

204
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,612
HE'S DEVOURING HIM!

205
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:17,250
WHAT A MARVELOUS CREATURE.

206
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:20,521
THE MASKED MAN WAS NO MORE
THAN FODDER FOR HIM.

207
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:23,123
SANTVIENTO FEEDS
WITH HIS ENTIRE BODY,

208
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:24,691
SO‐‐SO NOTHING IS LOST.

209
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,794
HE CAN ABSORB EVERY BIT
OF HIS PREY'S LIFE FORCE

210
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,129
DOWN TO THE LAST DROP.

211

( Speedwagon gasping )

212
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,866
Soldier #1: HE ATE HIM!

213
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:34,868
HE ACTUALLY ATE THE MASKED MAN.

214
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:37,170
Soldier #3: HOW IS THAT
EVEN POSSIBLE?!

215
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,039
Soldier #4: UND NOW LOOK!

216
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,374
HE'S‐‐HE'S GROWN SOMETHING.

217
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:42,643
Von Stroheim: GET A GRIP.

218
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,845
AS LONG AS HE'S
STILL IN THAT CHAMBER,

219
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,179
HE CAN'T HURT YOU.

220
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:48,682
HE JUST GAINED A LITTLE WEIGHT
AFTER HIS FEEDING.

221
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:49,850
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

222

HIS‐‐HIS INTELLIGENCE?

00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:53,987
AND WHAT ABOUT
HIS INTELLIGENCE?

224
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,557

IS HE CAPABLE OF?

00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:58,725
Von Stroheim: HUH?

HE SAID‐‐
HOW DID HE KNOW MY NAME?

SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE

LEAD DIRECTLY INTO THIS ROOM?

I'LL BE KNOWN

364

POINTING AT US?

Von Stroheim: NOBODY MOVE.

DON'T YOU SEE HE'S IMITATING
ONE OF YOUR MACHINE GUNS?

383
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:55,922
LOOK. HE'S JUST COPYING
WHAT HE'S SEEING.

384
00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:59,492
SO WHEN HE SPOKE EARLIER,
HE ONLY SAID MY NAME,

385
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:01,502
BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT,

386
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:03,870

HE'S NOT INTELLIGENT.

IF HE'S ONLY CAPABLE
OF ACTING LIKE A MONKEY,

390
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:13,714

FOR USING HIM LIKE ONE.
