346
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,505
DAMN. HE GOT ME THERE, TOO.

347
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,773
( mine car clatters )

348
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,774
Pillar Men: HMM?

349
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,511
Wamuu: THE TIME
ON YOUR HOURGLASS WRIST

350
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:11,745
IS JUST ABOUT UP.

351
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:13,580
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE

352
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:16,349
THAT YOU WILL SURVIVE THIS
ANY LONGER.

353
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:19,019
I FOUND YOUR TRICKS
TO BE VERY QUAINT.

354
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:21,955
BEFORE YOU DIE, TELL ME,

355
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,191
WHY DO I STILL NOT SEE DEFEAT
IN YOUR EYES?

356
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:27,027
JoJo: I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU WANT,

357
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:29,095
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SAY, "PLEASE," FIRST.

358
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:31,364
Wamuu: MORE GAMES.
YOU'VE TESTED ME LONG ENOUGH.

359
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,934
‐ PREPARE TO DIE.
‐ JoJo: SUCH A SHAME,

360
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,135
BECAUSE A MONTH FROM NOW,

361
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:38,705
I CAN GUARANTEE THAT I
WOULD BE ABLE TO DESTROY YOU.

362
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,041
Wamuu: WHAT WAS THAT?

363
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:43,544
JoJo: WITH JUST
ONE MORE MONTH OF TRAINING,

364
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:44,711
I WOULD ANNIHILATE YOU.

365
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:46,680
I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO HIT,

366
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:49,282
AS WELL AS THE FIRST
TO SCAR YOUR FACE.

367
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:50,984
WHEN I PUT MY MIND TO SOMETHING,

368
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,886
I CAN ACCOMPLISH
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.

369
00:16:54,454 --> 00:16:55,989
OH, WELL.

370
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,725
I GUESS NONE OF THAT
REALLY MATTERS NOW.

371
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,994
SO CAN WE JUST
GET THIS OVER WITH?

372
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:05,138
IT WILL BE AN HONOR TO BE KILLED
BY A WARRIOR LIKE YOU,

373
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:06,139
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

374
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:08,074
Wamuu: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS?

375
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:10,844
JoJo: OH, I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF ALL THIS TALKING.

376
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,013
JUST HURRY UP,
AND MAKE IT PAINLESS, WAMUU.

377
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,049
Wamuu: EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO GET AT?

378

379
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,927

BUT HE'S STILL ALIVE.

380
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:29,362
JoJo: IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU PILLAR MEN

381
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:30,897
OFTEN LIVE FOR MILLENNIA?

382
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:33,600
THAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE
WALKING AROUND WITH THE SHAME

383
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,902
OF HAVING YOUR FACE
REARRANGED BY A LOWLY HUMAN.

384
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:39,606
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ONLY WAY
YOU COULD REGAIN YOUR HONOR

385
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:41,708
WOULD BE
BY DEFEATING ME IN A FIGHT

386
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:43,544
AFTER I'VE UNDERGONE
PROPER HAMON TRAINING.

387
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,445
Wamuu: I DO NOT
HAVE TO DEFEAT YOU

388
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,848
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN MY HONOR.

389
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:50,383
JoJo: HIS ENTIRE BODY
IS SHAKING WITH RAGE.

390
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,619
I HAVE A CHANCE
IF I CAN MAKE HIM THINK

391
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:53,954
HIS INTEGRITY IS AT STAKE.

392
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,790
HE GAVE HIMSELF AWAY
AS THE PROUD WARRIOR TYPE

393
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,792
THE MOMENT
HE CALLED ME A COWARD.

394
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,393
PRIDE IS HIS ACHILLES HEEL.

395
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,537
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED,
BUT I'M STILL NEW AT THIS.

396
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:05,872
HOWEVER, IF I TRAINED
WITH MY HAMON FOR A MONTH,

397
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:08,074
I KNOW I COULD GIVE YOU
THE FAIR FIGHT

398
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,142
A WARRIOR LIKE YOU DESERVES.

399
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:11,712
THE FIRST PERSON
WHO EVER HIT YOU IN THE FACE

400
00:18:11,778 --> 00:18:13,146
GAVE YOU A NASTY SCAR.

401
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:14,480
IT WOULD BE A SHAME

402
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:16,750
IF YOU KILLED THAT PERSON
BEFORE HE'S WORTHY.

403
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:19,820
BUT IF YOU FEEL
THE NEED TO KILL ME

404
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:22,556
BEFORE I HAVE A CHANCE
TO BATTLE YOU AS AN EQUAL,

405
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:25,125
THEN GO AHEAD AND DO
WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO.

Esidisi: YOU GAVE
THIS HUMAN ONE MINUTE.

411
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,803
WHY MUST YOU INSIST
ON LETTING HIM TOY WITH YOU? EH?

412
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:39,506
JoJo: JUST GO AWAY.
I ALMOST HAD HIM.

413

MASTER ESIDISI,
I HAVE GROWN FOND

418
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:55,021
OF THIS PARTICULAR MEMBER
OF THE HAMON TRIBE.

419

JoJo: I GOT HIM.

420
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:58,692
Wamuu: JOJO,
YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO KNOW

421
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,694
THAT I HAVE DECIDED
TO ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSITION.

422
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:02,803
IF YOU SWEAR THAT YOU
WILL TRAIN YOUR HARDEST

423
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,137
TO FULFILL YOUR POTENTIAL,

424
00:19:04,204 --> 00:19:06,773
THEN I WILL GIVE YOU
EXACTLY ONE MONTH TO DO SO.

425
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,342
JoJo: SO YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO KILL ME NOW?

426
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,544
Wamuu: THAT'S RIGHT.

427
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:12,278

TO FIGHT AGAIN?

428
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:13,446

YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

430
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:17,217
I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE
TO TAKE IT BACK.

431

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S WORKING.

433
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:22,656
I WILL NEED ASSURANCES

434
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:25,491
THAT YOU WILL NOT TRY
TO RUN AWAY AGAIN, OF COURSE.

435

Esidisi: HEH HEH. NICE, WAMUU.

436
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,962

WOULD FINALLY PROPOSE.

437

TO THE WEDDING RING OF DEATH.

439
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,736

TO DISSOLVE IN 33 DAYS.

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE,
AND ONCE DISSOLVED,

444
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:49,015
IT WILL RELEASE
A VIRULENT POISON.

ANY ATTEMPT
TO REMOVE OR DAMAGE IT

446
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:53,554
WILL ALSO RELEASE
THE LETHAL POISON.

THERE IS ONE CERTAIN WAY

449
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,759
TO DISSOLVE THE RING
WITHOUT HARM.

450
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,434
SIMPLY BATTLE AND DEFEAT ME
WITHIN 33 DAYS,

451
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,637

THE ANTIDOTE

452

OF MY LIP RING.

ON THAT WEDDING RING

DO US PART," JOJO.

456

AS EQUALS, JOJO.

00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,786
( Esidisi chuckles )
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T THINK

460
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:22,188
YOUR PALTRY TRICKS
WOULD HELP YOU ESCAPE, HUMAN.

461
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,025
I DON'T IMAGINE
THE TWO OF US WILL FIGHT,

462
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,493

HERE'S A GIFT FOR YOU...

QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WAMUU'S,

POISON IN MY NOSE RING.

Kars: I DON'T THINK SO.

471
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,749
IMMORTALITY
CAN BE BORING AT TIMES.

472
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,584
TO ENCOUNTER A WORTHY OPPONENT,

473
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:53,687
THAT IS BOTH SUCH A RARE
AND TANTALIZING THOUGHT,

474
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,422
A GIFT THAT WOULD GIVE
OUR LIVES MEANING.

475
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,391
I CAN SEE WHY YOU DO THIS.

476
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,426
HOWEVER, DO NOT FORGET
THAT OUR GOAL

477
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,769
IS TO OBTAIN
THE RED STONE OF AJA.

478
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:04,938

TRAIN LONG AND HARD, JOJO,

480
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,576

TWO WEDDING RINGS WITH POISON?

485
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:20,120
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND
OF SICK JOKE OR SOMETHING?

486
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:22,789
I'VE GOT ONE AROUND MY THROAT
AND ONE AROUND MY HEART.

487
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,191
