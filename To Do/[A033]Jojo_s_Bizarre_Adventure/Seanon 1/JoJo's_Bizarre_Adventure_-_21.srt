347
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:40,907
THAT HORRIBLE DAY,

348
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:43,510
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
SAVED THE LIFE OF A BABY GIRL.

349
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:45,612
THAT WAS ME.

350
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,515
I AM THE BABY
IN THAT PHOTOGRAPH.

351
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:52,519
JoJo: W‐WAIT A MOMENT HERE.
THAT WAS 50 YEARS AGO.

352
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:55,622
SO IF YOU WERE A BABY
50 YEARS AGO‐‐

353
00:17:55,722 --> 00:17:58,625
HOLD ON NOW.
JUST HOW OLD ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

354
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:02,869
Y‐YOU'RE 50?!

355
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,705
( stammers )

356
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:08,241
OH, MAN. IF YOU'RE 50,
THAT MEANS THEN...

357
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:11,144
YOU'RE REALLY OLD!

358
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:13,379
( swallows )

359
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:15,982
IS THAT RIGHT? NORMALLY‐‐

360
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:19,152
Y‐YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
IN YOUR LATE 20s. HMM.

361
00:18:19,252 --> 00:18:20,821
THEY SAY THAT HAMON ENERGY

362
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:23,990
IS LIFE ENERGY
AND KEEPS YOU YOUNG.

363
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,760
I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS
WHY YOU REALLY DON'T ACT

364
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:29,095
LIKE A YOUNG WOMAN
WOULD BEHAVE AT ALL.

365
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:33,166
AH. I THINK I SEE A LITTLE
WRINKLE BACK THERE. YUP.

366
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:34,467
( Lisa Lisa grunts )

367
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,169
JoJo: HEY, I'M JUST KIDDING,
ALL RIGHT?

368
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:40,507
Kars: VAMPIRES,
PREPARE THE ARENA.

369
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,843
LIGHT THE FIRES!

370
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:48,515
( vampires yelling )

371
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:53,687
Lisa Lisa: THERE IS NOT
ENOUGH TIME FOR US TO TALK NOW,

372
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:56,590
BUT WE REALLY DO NEED
TO FIND THE TIME,

373
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:59,960
BECAUSE OUR ROOTS
ARE DEEPLY CONNECTED.

374
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,467
JoJo: OUR ROOTS?

375
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:04,705
Lisa Lisa: THE STONE MASK
KILLED MY PARENTS.

376
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:06,006
ERINA WAS PREGNANT

377
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,709
WHEN SHE RESCUED
THE LITTLE GIRL ON THE SHIP.

378
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:10,443
SHE COULDN'T RAISE TWO CHILDREN,

379
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:12,879
SO STRAIZO
BECAME A FATHER TO ME.

380
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:13,714
( JoJo gasps )

381
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:15,549
STRAIZO AS A FATHER?

382
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,150
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

383
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:20,721
Lisa Lisa: EVERYTHING I KNOW
ABOUT HAMON, STRAIZO TAUGHT ME.

384
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:24,658
HE EVEN GAVE ME
THE RED STONE OF AJA.

385
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:26,159
JoJo: HE DID THAT? WOW.

386
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:29,530
THIS IS ALL JUST SO UNBELIEVABLE
AND HARD TO ACCEPT.

387
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:31,397
Lisa Lisa:
IT'S TRAGIC BEYOND WORDS

388
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:33,166
THAT THE FEAR OF GROWING OLD

389
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,802
DROVE HIM TO COMMIT
SUCH ACTS OF MADNESS.

390
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:38,872
JOJO, MY FEELINGS
ABOUT YOU DEFEATING HIM

391
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:41,341
ARE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED,

392
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:44,645
BUT I BELIEVE
THAT IT WAS DESTINY.

393
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,715
JoJo: WHAT IS THERE TO SAY?

394
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:52,719
EVERYTHING, ALL OF IT,
IS SO COMPLICATED.

395
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:56,089
WHAT A BIZARRE RELATIONSHIP.

396
00:19:56,189 --> 00:20:01,034
LISA LISA, SHE CARRIES WITH HER
A PAST PAINTED BY SADNESS.

397
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,603
‐ ( rumbling )
‐ Lisa Lisa: IT'S TIME.

398
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,871
THE REST OF IT
WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

399
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,507

THAT RUMBLING NOISE?

400

401
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,719

IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT.

AH, THESE ARE FINE STEEDS.

WORKED EXTREMELY WELL.

I WILL FIGHT YOU ON ANY FIELD
OR IN ANY CAGE,

437

BUT VAMPIRES ARE YOUR MINIONS,
EVEN HORSES,
