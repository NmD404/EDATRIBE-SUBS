JoJo: THERE WE GO.

340
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:33,199
IT SEEMS I'VE FOUND
WHAT YOU PREFER.

341
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,669
THAT'S IT. REACH FOR IT.

342
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:38,939
JUST A LITTLE BIT HIGHER NOW.

343
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:41,041
STRETCH UP
JUST A LITTLE MORE THERE.

00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:44,044

350

♪

352
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:57,658
( sighs )

353
00:16:57,724 --> 00:16:59,693
THAT WAS PRETTY MEAN.

354
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:03,704
I DON'T KNOW WHY I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

355
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:06,907
IT'S JUST BECAUSE
I'M REALLY ON EDGE.

356
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:10,544
WE ONLY HAVE FIVE DAYS
UNTIL THE RING DISSOLVES,

357
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:13,647
AND KARS IS ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS
ABOUT KILLING ME.

358
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:15,916
I CAN FEEL THE THREATS
CLOSING IN.

359
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:17,417
THEY'RE ALL AROUND.

360
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:18,985
I HAVE TO RELAX.

361
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:21,722
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I'M THE ONE WHO'S ALWAYS SAYING

362
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:23,824
YOU CAN'T SIT AROUND
MOPING ABOUT STUFF.

363
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,560
Lisa Lisa: JOJO, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING JUST SITTING THERE?

364
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:27,861
GET UP OUT OF THAT CHAIR,

365
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,530
COME OVER HERE,
AND LOOK AT THIS.

366
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:32,599
JoJo: RIGHT.
BE THERE IN A SECOND.

367
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:36,870
Lisa Lisa: THE BUILDING
ON TOP OF THAT HILL

368
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:39,840
IS THE ADDRESS
ESIDISI PUT ON THE PACKAGE.

369
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:42,108
Meshina: IT LOOKS LIKE
THE ABANDONED CORPSE

370
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:43,777
OF A SHUTTERED HOTEL.

371
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:47,347
IT WOULD MAKE A PERFECT HIDEOUT
FOR KARS DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS.

372
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:49,916
EVERY DOORWAY AND WINDOW
IS BOARDED UP.

373
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,918
NO SUNLIGHT
COULD GET IN THERE.

374
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:53,620
Caesar: THAT'S GOT TO BE IT.

375
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,789
I'M SURE KARS
HIDES IN THERE DURING THE DAY.

376
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:59,092
I BET HE'S JUST SITTING INSIDE,
WAITING FOR WAMUU TO SHOW UP.

377
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,968
Lisa Lisa: ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT IS THE PLAN?

378
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:03,970
Caesar: HUMPH.
THAT'S A NO‐BRAINER.

379
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,472
WE SHOULD ATTACK NOW.

380
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:07,908
Meshina: YES, I AGREE.

381
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:10,944
KARS CAN'T GO OUTSIDE
AS LONG AS THE SUN IS UP,

382
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:12,879
AND THAT GIVES US
A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE.

383
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:15,048
Lisa Lisa: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

384
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,985
JoJo: SORRY, BUT...

385
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:21,622
‐ I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH YOU.
‐ ( all gasp )

386
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:23,223
JoJo: YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THIS WRONG.

387
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:25,959
I THINK IT'S MORE DANGEROUS
TO ATTACK WHEN THE SUN IS UP.

388
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:27,160
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

389
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,796
KARS HAS BEEN LIVING LIKE THIS
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

390
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,164
HE WOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED

391
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,466
IF HE HAD LEFT HIMSELF
DEFENSELESS DURING THE DAY.

392
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,467
Caesar: OH, PLEASE!

393
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,936
JoJo: WALKING INTO HIS HIDEOUT

394
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:38,805
AND TRYING TO TAKE HIM DOWN
RIGHT NOW WOULD BE SUICIDAL.

395
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,440
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

396
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:44,010
IT WOULD BE LIKE A BUG WALKING
INTO A SPIDER'S WEB ON PURPOSE.

397
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:46,412
Caesar: HAH! COME ON.

398
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:50,517
JOJO, THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU.
ARE YOU SCARED OR SOMETHING?

399
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:53,954
JoJo: I THINK I'M GOING TO TAKE
SUN TZU'S ADVICE THIS TIME.

400
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,489
ONLY ENGAGE IN A FIGHT
WHEN VICTORY IS ASSURED.

401
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,759
LIKE I SAID, I'M NOT GOING IN.

402
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,801
Caesar: OH, YEAH?
SO YOU'RE CHICKENING OUT?

403
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,202
JoJo: I'M NOT AFRAID.

404
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:03,704
I'M JUST THINKING STRAIGHT.

405
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,006
I'VE GOT A COOL HEAD,
UNLIKE YOU.

406
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,109
CAESAR, WE HAVE TO WAIT
FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS MOVE FIRST.

407
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:11,177
Caesar: AN ASSURED VICTORY
IS WHAT YOU WANT?

408
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:14,615
KARS IS ALL ALONE THERE.
IT'S HIM AGAINST ALL OF US.

409
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:16,049
THAT'S A FOUR‐TO‐ONE ADVANTAGE.

410
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:17,551
WE HAVE TO STRIKE NOW,

411
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,653
BEFORE WAMUU ARRIVES,
CUTTING THAT IN HALF.

412
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,854
JoJo: CALM DOWN.

413
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:22,956
DON'T GO OFF ALL CRAZY NOW.

414
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:24,891
TRY AND KEEP YOUR HEAD TOGETHER.

415
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:26,693
JUST FOCUS,
AND THINK IT THROUGH.

416
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:29,129
IF WE GO NOW,
HE'LL CUT US TO PIECES.

417
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:30,731
YOU CAN'T APPROACH THIS
HALF‐COCKED.

418
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:32,566
Caesar: I AM NOT HALF‐COCKED!

419
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,900
I'M GONNA END THIS!

420
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,670
I AM GOING TO FINALLY
FINISH THE FIGHT

421
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:39,806
THAT CUT SHORT THE LIVES
OF BOTH OF OUR GRANDFATHERS!

422
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:41,575
I'M GONNA DESTROY KARS!

423
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:43,009
YOU'RE GOING TO FINISH IT?

424
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:45,746
RIGHT, AND WHY BRING OUR
DEAD GRANDFATHERS INTO THIS?

425
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:47,247
WHO THE HELL CARES?!

426
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:50,584
DON'T DRAG THE DEAD INTO
YOUR LITTLE DRAMA, YOU MORON.

427
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:52,653
( Caesar grunts )
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

428
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,154
JoJo: FAMILY YOU'VE NEVER MET

429
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,757
AND THAT CAME LONG BEFORE
YOUR TIME DOESN'T MEAN CRAP.

430
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:58,258
IT'S JUST FOOLISH.

431
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:01,167
ONLY A COMPLETE IDIOT WOULD DIE
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

432
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,504
( Caesar growls )

433
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,639
‐ ( both gasp )
‐ Meshina: CAESAR?

434
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:09,543

YOUR MOUTH, JOJO!

435

436
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:12,713
HEY, WHAT WAS THAT FOR, YOU‐‐

437
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:14,648
A SUCKER PUNCH, HUH?

438
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:15,849
Caesar: OH, IT'S ON.

439
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,651
JoJo: WHAT THE HELL, CAESAR?!

440
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,819
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!

441
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,555
Caesar: JUST SHUT THE HELL UP!

442
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,724
Lisa Lisa: CAESAR, STOP IT. NOW.

443
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,025
Meshina: YOU TOO, JOJO!

444
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,027
Lisa Lisa: CAESAR!

445
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,864
JoJo: YOU BASTARD,
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

446
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,000
HAVE YOU COMPLETELY LOST IT?

447
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,537
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE SOME KIND OF A MADMAN.

448
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,673
Caesar: JOJO, I GUESS YOU WON'T
EVER UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT

449
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,408
OF FAMILY HONOR AND
INHERITING A BATTLE LIKE THIS.

450
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,409
JoJo: HUH?

451
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,578
( Caesar scoffs )

452
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:45,646
ENOUGH. I'M GOING.

453
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,648
Lisa Lisa: CAESAR,
JOJO IS RIGHT.

454
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,249
IT'S FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

455
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,817
WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING

456
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,753
WHAT MIGHT BE WAITING
FOR US IN THERE.

457
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,921
WE'LL WAIT FOR KARS
TO MAKE HIS MOVE.

458
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:57,924
THAT IS AN ORDER, CAESAR.

459
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,660
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS NOW

460
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,435
IS PROTECTING
THE RED STONE OF AJA.

461
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:04,605
Caesar: NO, COACH, I'M SORRY.

462
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:06,339
I CAN'T OBEY THIS TIME.

463
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:10,343
YOU KNOW THIS IS A MATTER
OF BLOOD AND FAMILY HONOR.

464
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,613
IT'S A ZEPPELI PROBLEM.

465
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,781
I JUST CAN'T LEAVE IT UNSETTLED

466
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:17,551
WHEN I KNOW
EXACTLY WHERE KARS IS HIDING.

467
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:19,620
I CAN'T SIT HERE
TWIRLING MY THUMBS,

468
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,955

Meshina: WHAT DO WE DO?

471
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,459
Lisa Lisa: FOLLOW HIM,
AND DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO

472
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:30,797
TO STOP HIM FROM ENTERING,
EVEN IF IT MEANS USING FORCE.

473

( JoJo sighs ) CAESAR,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

WHY ARE YOU SO DAMN GRIM
AND HOTHEADED ALL OF A SUDDEN?

AND JUST WAIT A WHILE?
