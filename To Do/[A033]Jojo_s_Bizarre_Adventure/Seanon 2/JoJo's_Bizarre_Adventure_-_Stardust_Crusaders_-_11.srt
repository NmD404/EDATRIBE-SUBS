by reflecting over and over.

179
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,824

for how he caught up to us.

Kakyoin: Reflecting?

181

nature of his stand is light?

Polnareff: I am. I just saw him
in the car’s bumper.

184

He’s going to reflect
off that surface

185
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:23,704
and onto something else.

186

Polnareff: I don’t
really understand how,

00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,574
but he essentially moves
at the speed of light.

243

No one can normally see
speed like that.

244
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,245
But then, I knew that
if the kid closed his eyes,

245
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,747
the next move
would be to my eye.

246

There was no other place
for him to go,
