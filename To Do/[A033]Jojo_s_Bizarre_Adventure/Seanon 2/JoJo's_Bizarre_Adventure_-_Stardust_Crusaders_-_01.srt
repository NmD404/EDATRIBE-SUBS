Joseph: Hey, you’re
my one and only daughter,

174
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,178
and if you tell me you
need me to be somewhere,

175
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,981
then just give me a day,
and i’ll cross the globe.

176

177
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,118
Joseph: She didn’t
like me leavin’,

178
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,186
but I just told Suzie
that it was

179
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,023

183
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,732
The greeting’s over.
Let go of me already.

184
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,001
Holly: No. I don’t wanna.

185
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,436
It’s been forever
since you’ve held me.

Joseph: Look at yourself.

187
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,139
Come on.

188
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,374
You’re a 45-year-old woman.
Let go.

189

Holly: Oh, now you’ve done it.

190
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,911
I’m gonna tickle you.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

191
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,046

192

about jotaro...

( Holly gasps )

200
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,460

the word "evil spirit"?

201

( Holly whimpers )

202
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,098
Oh, my poor little boy.

203
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,934
Yes. The policemen said
they couldn’t see it,

204
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,537
but I saw it.
It’s like he had a third arm,

205
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,173
and then he reached out
and grabbed the gun.

206
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,175
Joseph: And when
this arm came out,

207
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,177
no one else there
could see it but you?

208
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,244
Holly: That’s right.

00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,980
Joseph: And aside from jotaro

210
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,848
saying that he’s been possessed,
you’re okay?

211
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,417
Did anything happen to you?

212
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,853
Holly: I feel totally fine,
but what do I do about jotaro?

213
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,455
He says he won’t leave that cell

214
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,190
until he finds
the cause of all this.

215
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,858
What am I gonna do, papa?

216
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,293
There, there,
my darling daughter.

217
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,795
You’ve got Joseph joestar
with you now.

He’s got more stuff
in his cell now,

you can help me,

Sorry you came
all the way from New York,

251

00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,955
That’s the pinkie
from my prosthetic left hand.

00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,458
When was he able to take it?

255
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,928
Jotaro: So did you see it
or even feel it?

256
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,063
That’s the evil spirit.

257
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:35,302
Stay away from me, or you’ll
lose what’s left of your life.

258

Joseph: I’ve never
seen anything like this.

259

He was able to deceive me
right off the bat.

260
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,343
That’s unbelievable.

261
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,579
I’m afraid I know exactly
what jotaro’s evil spirit is,

262
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:49,149
but I don’t think explaining it
to him will do any good.

263
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,052
He’ll understand
his situation much better

264
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,053
if he sees it with his own eyes.

265
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,957
Actually, in order for him to
truly know the danger he faces,

266
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,392
he needs
to experience it physically.

267
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,962
( Snaps fingers )
All right, avdol.

268

friend I met a few years ago.

to leave this damn cell.

You look strong enough,

276

but do you really think i’d
let someone chase me outta here

277
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,718
just ’cause
you told them to do it?

278
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,387
I don’t work like that.
In fact,

279
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:31,292
all you’ve done now is made me
wanna stay here even more.

this may get a little bit rough.

be riddled with so much pain,

321
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,304

00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,553
which causes
the evil spirit to weaken.

343
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,154
And now for the truth.

344
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,157
This may seem
like an evil spirit,

345
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,491
but it’s far from it.

346
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,694
Jotaro, this thing
you believe has possessed you

347
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,898
is actually a powerful vision
created by your own life energy.

348
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:28,269
This vision will always appear
standing by your side,

349
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,304
and because of that,
we call it...

350
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,906
A stand!

351
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,442
Jotaro: A stand?

352
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,676
Avdol: Remember aesop’s fable.

353
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,214
The cold wind made the traveler
pull his coat tighter,

354
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,549
but the heat
forced him to admit defeat.

355
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,386
Ready to leave
your cage now, jojo?

356

without even knowing
i’m doing it.

360
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,362
Until that stops,
i’m stayin’ here.

361
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,664
It’s nice to meet
someone like me,

362
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:01,802
but if you keep this up,
you’ll die.

363
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,309

broke the damn toilet.

366

Avdol: Not exactly.

381
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,668
I did have every intention
of sending you to the hospital,

382
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,803
but you’re stronger
than I had expected.

383
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:12,707
Jotaro: And if I had kept going
with this steel rod,

384
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,941
just what would you have done?

385
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,945
Avdol: Do not underestimate
my stand, magician’s red.

386
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,681
It could have easily
melted that rod midair

387

388
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,653
Joseph: The power avdol has
is exactly the same as yours.

389
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,858
If you want to know more
about this evil spirit,

390
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:33,293
you’ll need to leave this jail.

Holly: Thank you.
Thank you, jotaro.

392
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,837
I’m glad you finally left
that awful jail cell.

393
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:46,173
Jotaro: Why are you
such an annoying bitch?

394
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,175
- Holly: Okay. I don’t know.
- Joseph: Hey,

395
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,777
how dare you address
your own mother that way?!

396
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,379
And what kind
of language is that?

397
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,315

You’ll only encourage it.

Holly: Okay.

399
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,518
Jotaro: Hey, grampa,
one question.

400
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,855
There’s something that I can’t
quite wrap my brain around.

401
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,358
You seem to know
all about this...

402
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:07,794
Evil spirit, the stand,
whatever you wanna call it,

403
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,229
but how do you know this?

404
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:11,098
Joseph: Hmm. How do I know?

405
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,034
I guess I did come
all the way from New York

406
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,268
to explain it to you.

407
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:16,537
But in order for you

408
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,405
to fully understand
the whole history of it,

409
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,106
I must start
from the beginning.

410
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,876
This is part of the legacy
of the joestar family.

411
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,380
Take a look at these pictures.

412
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,185
Jotaro: What are these about?

413
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,820
That coffin’s
a hundred years old,

414
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,422
and four years ago, it was
pulled out of the Atlantic

415
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,190
off the coast of Africa.

416
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,392
Jotaro: Okay. So?

417
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,127
Joseph: I did a little research.

418
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,496
My grandfather,
Jonathan joestar,

419
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,232
your great-grandfather,
died while at sea.

420
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,300
Turns out this exact same coffin

421
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:51,171
was on that boat with him
when he died.

422
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:55,009
When they discovered it
four years ago, it was empty.

423
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:58,078
But I know
exactly what was inside it.

424
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,281
Avdol and I are trying
to locate him as we speak.

425
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:03,450
Jotaro: Hold on.
Did you say, "him"?

426
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:06,853
Are you suggesting there was
a person inside that thing?

427
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,589
Come on. How could a human being

428
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,491
stay buried underwater
for a hundred years?

429
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,626
Joseph: Because that person
is evil incarnate,

430
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,861
and his name is dio!

431
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:17,131
And now that he
has been awakened

432
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,399
from his hundred-year slumber,

433
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,235
it is our fate
to fight that man!

434
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,637
( Jotaro sighs )

435
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,505
Joseph: What the hell
does that face mean?

436
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,408
And don’t you
turn your back on me

437
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,143
like this has
nothing to do with you!

438
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,145
Jotaro: Look, you old man,
this face means

439
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,647
your story is so lame,
I don’t know what to say.

440

- ( Avdol chuckles )

Jotaro: Avdol, was it?

442
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:40,554
I don’t know you, but you
are one arrogant bastard.

443
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,622
- And as for you, old man...
- Joseph: Huh?

444
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,125
Jotaro: Did you
really expect me to fall

445
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,994
for an unbelievable story
like that?

446
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:50,230
Avdol: Heh. I know
the story sounds far-fetched,

447
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:51,966
but wouldn’t you also say

448
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:55,603
our evil spirits
are equally unbelievable?

449
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,438
( Joseph scoffs )
Think what you want,

450
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,541
but soon you will have no choice
but to believe it.

451
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:03,277
If you want me to tell you
how I know that dio exists

452
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,978
and why i’ve chosen
to go after him,

453
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:08,582
the best way to explain it
is to show you.

454
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,317
See, the truth of it

455
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,019
is I myself had
a rather startling revelation

456
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:14,922
that prompted all of this.

457
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:18,091
About a year ago, I suddenly
obtained a stand of my own.

This is my stand.

466

It can reveal faraway visions
and place them on film.

467
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,518
The only downside
is I have to bust

468

never thought much about it,

when I was young,

so I asked my mother about it,
and she said he had one, too.

It’s four years
since he’s revived,

515
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,494
and the reason
my spirit photography

516
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:37,297
and your evil spirit
have manifested since

517
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:39,300
is most likely connected to dio.

518
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,835
Avdol: To society in general,

519
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:43,838
our gifts are considered
a kind of psychic power.

520
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:47,208
I’ve had my stand
since the day I was born,

521
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,710
but your powers
seem bound to dio’s body,

522
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,613
or, rather,
Jonathan joestar’s body.

523
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,515
There’s some sort
of invisible string

524
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:56,417
that connects you all to him.

525
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,853
His rebirth is also your own,
awakening your sleeping powers.

526
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:02,623
Joseph: Avdol,
does this photograph

527
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,292
give you any indication
to where he might be now?

528
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,828
Avdol: No, nothing.

529
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:10,230
There’s hardly anything of note
in the photo at all.

530
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:11,532
Joseph: I see.

531
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,867
Avdol: I’ll take
a closer look later.

532
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:15,469
Joseph: Thank you. Hmm?

533
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:18,572
Oh, Holly.

534
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:21,641
I’m sorry I sprang this all
on you out of the blue.

535
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,577
- Let’s head home now.
- Holly: All right.

536
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,279
Joseph: I think i’ll be sticking
around for quite some time.

537
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:28,715
You mind if I stay
at your place while i’m here?

538
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:32,286
Holly: No, of course not, papa.
Let’s go, jotaro.

539
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,524
( Footsteps echoing )

540
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:39,560
♪

541
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:45,198
( Dio sighs )

542
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:47,301
Again...

543
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:48,535
Just now...

544
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:50,471
A most intense feeling

545
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:53,807
like someone somewhere
is watching me.

546
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,610
It is jonathan’s descendants.

547
00:22:56,643 --> 00:23:00,580
This body is sending out
some kind of spiritual signal

548
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:01,615
to his offspring.

549
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:06,253
Fine. It must be my fate.

550
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:10,824
But fate must be purged.

551
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:12,326
It’s all set.

552
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,928
I’ve taken the first step.
