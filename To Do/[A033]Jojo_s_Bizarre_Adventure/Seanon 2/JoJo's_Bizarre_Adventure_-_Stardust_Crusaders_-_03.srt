is doing damage to her.

that dio’s body

there will inevitably
be an effect from dio.

own mental strength,

with my family in Egypt.

351
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,577
We were there touring the nile.

352
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,412
Avdol: You were in Egypt, too.

353
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,846
It seems for some reason,

354
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,183
dio wants to remain
in that area.

355
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,186
Kakyoin:
So when are we leaving?

356
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,188
Because i’ll be going with you.

357
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,189
( Both gasp )

358
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,757
Jotaro: Seriously?

359
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,859
Why would you want to do that?

360
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,294
Kakyoin: To be
completely honest,

361
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,831
I have no idea
why I want to either.

362
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:46,300
It’s just something
I feel compelled to do.

363
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,702
( Jotaro scoffs )

364
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,172
Kakyoin: Let’s just say
that you opened my eyes.

365
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,708
It’s that simple.

366
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,651
Joseph: Holly, we’re gonna
save you, no matter what.

367
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:05,119
You have my word.

368
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:08,489
There’s nothing
for you to worry about.

369
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,725
We are gonna make you better.
I promise.

370
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,494
Just take it easy, and rest.

371
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,300
Kakyoin: Jojo’s mother,
Holly, has the ability

372
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:23,571
to calm a person’s soul
and put their minds at ease.

373
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,474
People feel relaxed
just by being near her.

374
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:30,578
This may sound strange,
but if I ever fall in love,

375
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,746
i’d want it to be
with someone like her.

376
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,748
I’d feel the need
to protect her.

377
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:39,619
I’d do anything to see her
feeling better and smiling.

378
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,421
Avdol: Indeed.

379
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,924
Joseph: There’s no time!

380
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,926
We leave immediately!

381
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,961
♪

382
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,768
We can trust ’em.

383
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,703
They’re doctors from
the speedwagon foundation.

384
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,439
They’re going to stay with her

385
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,308
and take care of Holly
around the clock.

386
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,844
Avdol: Jojo, since I am
a fortuneteller by trade,

387
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,279
i’d like to name your stand
before we go.

388
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,481
Joseph: Huh? Name it?

389
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,417
Avdol: With the tarot,
the cards of fate.

390
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,286
Do not look, but let chance
guide your choice.

391
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,356
It will not only suggest to us
your destiny,

392
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,293
but also the abilities
of your stand.

393

The star card.
