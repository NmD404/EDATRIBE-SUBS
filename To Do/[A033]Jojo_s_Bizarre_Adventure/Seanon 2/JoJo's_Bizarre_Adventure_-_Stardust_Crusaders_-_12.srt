on the ground like an idiot.

359
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,173
Now I can shove it
right in your carotid,

360
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,843
and you’ll bleed out
like a stuck pig.

361
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,845
Did you actually believe
i’d suffocate

362
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:20,447
if you stuck me in here,
you fool?

363
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,382
Die!

364
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:28,755
I may be made of your flesh,
but i’m nothing like you.

365
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:31,025
Forget the rules already, chump?

366
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:34,228
Only a stand can
hope to defeat another stand.

367
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,930
Oh, yeah, didn’t you say
you were gonna show me

368
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:39,767
all that fighting experience
you have?

369
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,769
Was I supposed to be impressed?

370
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:42,836
Some plan.

371
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,939
You’re just a helpless geezer

372
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:48,209
who’s gotten too old
to help anyone, even himself.

373

Joseph: My prosthetic hand,

374
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:53,347
it was on the verge of breaking
from her attack earlier,

375
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,449
and now I can’t get
any strength into it.

376
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,317
Empress: Just one more push.

377
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,354
Your life as an invalid
is about to come to an end.

378
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,855
Chu-mi-min.

379
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,058
There’s not a single way
you can defeat me.

380
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,226
You might as well surrender.

381

I’m sorry. My hearing
isn’t exactly what it once was.

387
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,216
Run that by me
one more time, will you?

388
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,284
( Empress gasps )

389
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,487
It’s coal tar!

390
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,256
That was your plan all along.

391
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,058
It wasn’t to suffocate me.

392
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,760
You were trying
to keep me from moving!

393
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,262
But how?

394
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:45,466

there was coal tar in there?

395

( Joseph laughs )

396
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,370
With my stand’s power.

397
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,305
Hermit purple
told me everything.

398
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,175
Man: H-hey, everyone, look.

399
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,543
Man #2: What is this?

400
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,278
Man #3:
The ashes that foreigner

401
00:17:57,311 --> 00:18:00,281
spilled everywhere
when he wrecked the place.

402
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:04,285

a perfect map of the city.

403

( Empress gasps ) You drew
a map with hermit purple?

404

406
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,062
Joseph: Yeah.

407
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,230
Now I think even
a glorified pimple like you

408
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,399
should see the difference
in our fighting experience.

409
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:24,004
When your opponent starts
boasting, he’s already lost.

410
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,973
That, shrew,
is a line from my Wilder days.

I just get better with age.

as much as it hurts you,

on their parents forever.
