Lucky them, don’t you think?

178
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,414
I’m yellow temperance,
of the temperance card.

179
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,918
Gaze upon my handsome face
with envy!

180
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,155
Come now, jotaro, old pal.

181
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,857
Take a good look at your hand.

182
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,626
See that little bit of me?

183
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,127
It latched on when you hit me

184
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,829
and really
doesn’t want to let go.

185
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,965
I advise you not to touch,

186
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,734
or it’ll go after
your left hand, too.

187
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,837
You should save your left hand
for picking your nose.

188
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,673
This stand is a slow eater,

189
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,676
and the more it eats,
the bigger it gets.

190
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,044
You’ll never get it off.

191
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,445
Jotaro: Crap!

192
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,046
Damn you.

193
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,181
Ora!

194
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,582
Temperance:
What do you mean, "ora"?

195
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,418
When I digest you,

196
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,187
i’ll shove your own crap
down your measly throat!

197
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,988
Jotaro: Enh! The hell?

198
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:42,990
This stuff burns.

199
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,892
( Temperance laughs )

200
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,895
( Jotaro gasps )
Damn bastard.

Girl: Hey, is this
Mr. Jojo’s grandpa?

204
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,901
He needs your help!

205
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,136
Joseph: Anne?
Tell me what’s wrong.

206
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,905
Anne: It’s Mr. Kakyoin!

207
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,506
Joseph: What about kakyoin?

208
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,942
Avdol: It’s true.
Seems he has betrayed us.

209
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:05,111
Anne: Mr. Kakyoin’s face split,
and now he’s a giant!

210
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:09,116
But Mr. Kakyoin wasn’t
Mr. Kakyoin. He’s a fake,

211
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,119
and jojo got attacked by some
weird slime on the cable car,

212
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,720
and now it’s eating his finger!

213
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,724
Joseph: Calm down, Anne.
Where are you now?

214
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,860
Anne: I’m at the cable car
station at the train center!

215
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,862
He’s being attacked!

216
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,498
Mr. Kakyoin went crazy
and is attacking jojo!

217
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,867
Joseph: Hurry, and come back
to the hotel as fast as you--

218
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,602
kakyoin: Did someone
say my name just now?

219
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,736
Avdol: Hmm?

220
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,705
Joseph: Where the hell
have you been?

221
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,940
Kakyoin: Hmm?
Jojo left me behind,

222
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,176
so I was sunbathing by the pool.

223
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,045
Avdol: With your
school uniform on?

224
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,112
Kakyoin: Yes. Why not?

225
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,881
Joseph: It’s all right.

226
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,550
We have the real one
here with us.

227
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,854
Anne, be careful. This means
your kakyoin is a fake!

228
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,722
Anne: I told you that!

229
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,056
( Screams ) Oh, no!

230
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,626
Jojo just jumped
out of the cable car!

( Jotaro sighs )
Good freakin’ grief.

234
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,582
A stand that fuses with flesh?

235
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,816
It’s devouring my finger.

236
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,317
This could get bad.

237
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,655
First, i’ve gotta
get this stuff off me.

238
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,291
Might be easier said than done.

239
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,294
It might mean
I have to cut off my finger.

Temperance: Ha! Do you
really think you got away?

Sorry to burst your bubble,

Now dig that earwax
out of your ears,

and listen up, hotshot.

244
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,339
Your time’s run out,

245
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:42,643
’cause yellow temperance
has no weaknesses!

You didn’t escape!

247
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:47,347
It’s just that I
don’t have to chase you.

My stand is armor
that can also absorb power,

you think you are,

you are helpless!

you can defeat me.

you really don’t have
any weaknesses.

Maybe you are
the world’s strongest,

324
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,432
and that’s terrifying,

325
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,434

326

no, wait. I mean joestars.

our way past any obstacle.

still have one strategy left.

334
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,923
You’re in the middle
of being eaten alive,

335
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,860
you dumb-ass! My stand’s got
a hold that you can’t escape,

336
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,629
and you say you’ll run away?
Don’t make me laugh.

337
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:24,832
Jotaro: When I said run away...

338
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,836
I meant into the water.

Jotaro: You let your stand’s
guard down to take a breath.

00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,217
Your stand may be invincible,
but you sure as hell aren’t.

His name is centerfold.

388

He’s unmistakable,
because he has two right hands.

about his powers.
