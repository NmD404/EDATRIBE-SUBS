that’s developed
into a bout of pneumonia.

116
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,446
She tried convincing me
that it wasn’t serious,

117
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,414
but i’m thinking
about going to visit her.

118

Joseph: No, don’t.
There’s no need for that.

she’ll recover quickly.

he meant by a delicate matter?

Avdol: Indeed. Madam joestar
is still as effervescent

123

so he checks in now and again

124
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,064
to ensure she doesn’t visit
miss Holly in Japan.

125
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,634

wearing your blue dress
to the event?

145
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,306
If I remember correctly,
it’s in the back of the closet.

146
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,942
Suzie q: Hmm. That’s right.

147
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,177
I’ll go and have a look at it.

148

( Door opens )

149
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,448
Rosas: Hello, master Joseph.

150
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,616
- It’s me, rosas.
- Joseph: Where’s Suzie?

151
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,620
Rosas: She left the room, sir.
There’s no chance

152
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,488
of her overhearing
our conversation now.

153
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,723
Joseph: I see.

154
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,958
I’m actually calling
from the submarine

155
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,495
that the two of us spoke of
a while back.

156
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,097
Rosas: Oh. Then I take it
you were successful

157
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,465
in reuniting
with master avdol?

158
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,368
Joseph: That’s right. Now, then,

159
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,335
tell me about holly’s condition.

160
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,171
Surely by now you’ve gotten hold

161
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,673
of the doctors
from the speedwagon foundation.

162
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,543
Rosas: Well, actually...

163
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,045
When speaking
to her mother on the phone,

164
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,416
miss Holly says that her illness
is nothing more than a cold.

165
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,085
She’s quite insistent
that there’s no cause for alarm,

166
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:01,521
but her condition
worsens by the day.

167
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,691
Master Joseph, don’t you think
the time has finally come

168
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,694
to tell madam joestar the truth?

169
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,296
( Joseph sighs )

170
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:14,635
No. There’s no need
to get her riled up.

171
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,504
We’re going to put an end
to all this very soon.

172
