quite taken aback by this.

179
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,566
I really should explain
before I destroy you.

180
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,703
Otherwise it wouldn’t
be chivalrous. Don’t you agree?

181

I’m sure you were
expecting nothing less.

182
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,607
If you don’t mind,

183
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,209
may we take a short timeout
for an explanation?

184
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,711
( Avdol groans )

185
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:31,878
Very well.

186
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,382
Let’s hear this explanation.

187
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,651
Polnareff: First,
the explosion you saw

188
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,352
was not my stand
self-destructing.

189
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,823
What you took as
silver chariot’s body was armor,

190
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,025
armor that was cast off.

191
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,695
But before it did, it absorbed
the brunt of your flames.

192
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,397
That’s how
I escaped further harm.

193
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,200
And bereft of armor, it has
significantly more agility.

194
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,404
Were you able to see my stand
as it held me up?

195
00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:01,741
That’s right. Silver chariot
can now move faster than before.

196
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,877
Avdol: Hmm. Illuminating.

197
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,846
You’re suggesting
it only stood there

198
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,848
and took
my crossfire hurricane head-on,

199
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,818
because the armor didn’t
allow it to dodge. Is that it?

200
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:15,656
But, bereft of armor,
it is also far more vulnerable.

201
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,192
It may have survived
my attack once before,

202
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,893
but if it were hit again,

203
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,296
its destruction
would be absolute.

204
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,199
Polnareff: Hmph. That may be.

205
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,735

352
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,889
who murdered my younger sister.

Polnareff:
I don’t know his face.

355
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,429
But he definitely has
two right hands

356
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,196
instead of one of each.

357
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,138
Joseph: Here.
I lost the real thing

358
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,240
in a horrible battle
some 50 years ago.

360
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,845
I apologize for the rudeness.
Please forgive me.

Joseph: If it’s not
too painful to talk about,

362
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,448
i’d like to know what happened.

364
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,491
It’s been three years now.

365
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,029
My younger sister
and a classmate of hers

366
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:38,432
were walking home from school
in the rain

367
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,233
back in our native France.

368
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,203
It was a country road,
much like any other.

369
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:47,842
On the side of the road, a man
stood with his back to them.

370
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,445
Oddly enough,
the mysterious stranger was dry.

371
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,014
The rain fell
in torrents around him,

372
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:57,083
as though
an invisible shell guarded him.

373
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,319
Suddenly her friend
fell to the ground

374
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,955
in a fountain of blood,

375
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,524
as though her chest
was cut by the wind.

376
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,332
My sister was alone.

377
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,137
He stole her innocence,

378
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,906
and then he killed her.

379
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,509
That was all the man wanted.
For that, she died.

380
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,845
Her friend escaped with her life

381
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,314
to tell me what she saw
that fateful day.

382
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,584
She didn’t get a good look
at their tormenter’s face,

383
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:34,521
but saw that both of his hands
were right hands.

384
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:38,259
No one believed the poor girl’s
testimony about the man,

385
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,261
no one but me, that is.

386
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:43,364
I had already been keeping
my own strange powers a secret

387
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,467
by then, and he sounded
like a fellow stand user.

388
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,269
Joseph: He’s a stand user,
all right. I’m sure of it.

389

Polnareff: I swore an oath!

390
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:54,107
I promised my sister’s soul
that I would avenge her,

391
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,845
to hunt down the killer
and make him pay with his life!

392
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:01,148
I would use my own stand as
a tool of righteous vengeance!

393
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:05,252
