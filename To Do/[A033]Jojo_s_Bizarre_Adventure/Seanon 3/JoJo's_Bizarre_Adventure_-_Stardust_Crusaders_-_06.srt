for over 10 years.

I’ll vouch for every single man.

177

I’m not sure why
you’re so worried about that,

178

from the very beginning.

that you not smoke on deck.

What were you planning on doing

183
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,660

after you were done?

184

into these pristine waters?

185

You may be a guest on this ship,
but you will abide by my rules.

to smoke aboard ship,

192

completely impossible, jotaro.

with verification
by the speedwagon foundation.

to differentiate stand users
from others.

- Joseph: What?
- Jotaro: The trick is

220

to watch a possible stand user
around cigarette smoke,

but I know the truth, boy.

348
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,314
The real terror of all this

349
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,482
is starting to sink in
to your thick skull.

350
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,985
I can even tell
what you’re thinking.

351
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,087
"How long can he
stay underwater?

352
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,356
"I can probably last
about two minutes,

353
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,825
but can he last
longer than me?"

354
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,093
Am I right, brother?

355
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,295
( Laughs ) Let me answer you.

356
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,998
My lung capacity is three times
that of a normal human’s.

357
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,333
( Jotaro gasps )

358
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,803
Captain: See, for years,
i’ve been training.

359
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:39,073
Six minutes and 12 seconds
is my best submerged time.

360
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,343
You must be dizzy just hearing
that number, right, brother?

361
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,078
And...

362
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:47,881
Dark blue moon’s fins
are cutters

363
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,151
that move faster
than a ship’s propeller,

364
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:52,286
far sharper, too.

365
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,221
Before you
get overconfident again,

366
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,891
you might wanna take
a good, hard look at your stand.

367
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,460
Seems dark blue moon’s barnacles

368
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,296
have taken a liking
to absorbing your stand’s power.

369
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:05,299
How does it feel
to have your life energy

370
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,501
slowly draining away
from your body?

371
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,002
( Chuckles )

372
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,472
Trying to run away
by swimming back up?

373
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,308
Take a good look around you.

374
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,176
( Laughs )

375
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,079
Haven’t you realized, brother,

376
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:21,047
dark blue moon has created
an underwater whirlpool?

377
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,917
There’s no way
you can possibly escape.

378
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:25,352
That’s right. Swim faster.

379
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,821
You’ll just make it
harder to breathe

380
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:29,990
while your power keeps draining.

381
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,458
But it’s little too early

382
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,995
to kill a stupid, smartass punk
like you just yet.

383
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:38,365
Joseph: It’s been too long!
He’s still not coming up!

384
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,434
Avdol: A giant whirlpool!
It must have him trapped.

385
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,404
Polnareff:
Where the hell is jojo?

386
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,273
Kakyoin: Let’s go and save him.

387
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,244
( Hierophant green grunts )

388
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,512
( Kakyoin groans )

389
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,781
These are scales.

390
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,984
That guy’s stand
has scales as sharp as razors.

391
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,218
Avdol: There are
countless scales

392
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,286
swirling in that whirlpool.

393
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,887
He wasn’t bluffing when he said

394
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:02,956
he could beat
all five of us at once.

395
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,426
It’s like a watery ant-lion pit.

396
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,161
If we dive in,

397
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,163
it’s very possible
we’ll be sliced to pieces.

398
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,298
( Star platinum yells )

399
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,133
Jotaro: His scales?

400
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:20,975
Captain: I’ll take another guess
at what you’re thinking.

401
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,944
"In a whirlpool,
only one spot stays still."

402
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,178
( Laughs )

403
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,346
Such mundane logic.

404
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,048
"It’s the eye.

405
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,284
If I jump into the center
where he is, I can attack him."

406
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,953
( Laughs )

407
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,754
That’s what you’re thinking,
right?

408
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:38,058
If you believe you can hit me
with that punch of yours again,

409
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,893
then come and give it a shot.

410
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:42,329
Throw your worthless stand
at me.

411
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:45,131
It’s power’s so drained,
it doesn’t have a chance.

412
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,401
See if you can manage an attack,

413
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,137
one that’s even sharper
than these underwater cutters.

414
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,538
I’m waiting, brother.

415
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,476
Avdol: Damn him!
We’re completely helpless.

in the whirlpool.

I don’t think
he’s moving down there.

Joseph: So he went limp?

421
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,454
He wasn’t struggling
against the whirlpool?

422
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,157
Well, that might
actually be a good thing.

turn me into sashimi, boy?

who’s gonna be sliced up.

Captain: But your power
was being drained.

You let yourself go limp
on purpose, didn’t you?
