I’ve given a bit of thought
to the route we should take.

71
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,598
About 100 kilometers northwest
is a village called yarpline.

72
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:51,999
The desert and mountains

73
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,868
make taking a direct route
near impossible.

74
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,605
It normally takes two days
to reach by car,

75
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,340
so to expedite the travel time,

76
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,809
the locals use a cessna
to get there.

77
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,177
If you want my opinion,

78
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,813
we should go to the village
and buy a cessna

79
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,948
in order to cross
the vast Saudi arabian desert.

80
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,250
You know, i’ve been apprehensive

81
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,186
about getting
anywhere near a plane.

82
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,788
If a stand user attacked
and the plane went down,

83
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,790
we’d be putting innocent lives
in harm’s way,

84
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,626
but if we had a cessna,
I could be the pilot.

85
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,962
We’d be able to save
a couple of days for sure.

00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,268

That comment notwithstanding,

91
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,609
our priority
should be crossing the desert

92
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,078
and hightailing it
to the village of yarpline.

93
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,313
It’ll take us one day
on camelback.

105
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,372

a life-or-death situation here,

107

whatever it takes.

108

a trade for that car?

112
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,989

to buy such
a fancy, expensive car?

115
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,863
It’s true an off-road vehicle
would perform better here,

116

but we’re not in the big city.

Damn it, you stubborn animal!

161
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,191
Polnareff: Mr. Joestar,
you have ridden

162
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,793
one of these before,
haven’t you?

163
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,028
Joseph: I will have you know

164
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,829
that i’ve watched
"Lawrence of Arabia"

165
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,798
three times now
from start to finish!

166
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,835
I know all too well
how to ride a camel!

167
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,838
Although, two of those times,
I slept through half of it.

168
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,539

to ride from a movie?!

169

Listen up.
When you’re handling an animal,

176

it’s absolutely imperative to
understand exactly how it feels,
