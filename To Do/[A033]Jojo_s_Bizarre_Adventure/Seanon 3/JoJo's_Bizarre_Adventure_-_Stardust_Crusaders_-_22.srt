00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,150
Tum-ta-da-da!

355
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:32,887
Here he is!

356
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,924
That sly bastard avdol was
still alive! Isn’t that great?!

357
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:39,660
( Hums fanfare )

358
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:42,896
Joseph: Well, we should
probably get going.

359
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,933
Avdol: Here. Allow me
to help you carry your luggage.

360
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,601
Jotaro: Avdol,
how you been doing?

361
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,269
Kakyoin: It’s been a while.
How goes it?

362
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:51,105
Joseph: So, avdol,
is the wound on your back

363
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,706
- healing up all right?
- Avdol: It’s fine,

364
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,741
though my joints do get
a little stiff sometimes.

365
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,876
Polnareff: Hey!

366
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,711
Jotaro: Has it
really been two weeks

367
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,279
- since we last saw each other?
- Polnareff: Hey!

368
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,248
Jotaro: We’re lucky
to all be alive.

369
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,283
Avdol: Jotaro, you’re still
wearing your uniform?

370
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,719
Don’t you ever get hot?
( Laughs )

371
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,255
Polnareff: Hey,
just hold on a second, guys!

372
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,689
( Groans )

373
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,291
Didn’t you hear me?!

374
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:13,661
I told you to hold on a second,
you assholes!

375
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:16,597
What’s the deal with
those laissez-faire attitudes?!

376
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,099
A man we thought was dead
just waltzed onto the beach!

377
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,167
How the hell
can you just brush it off

378
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,803
and act like
nothing has changed?!

379
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,072
Joseph: Oh, yeah.
I’m sorry about that, polnareff.

380
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,808
When I told you
i’d taken it upon myself

381
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,776
to Bury avdol in India,

382
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,712
I may have lied.

383
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:34,314
Polnareff: Wh-wh-what the hell?!

384
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:37,051
Avdol: Mr. Joestar and jotaro
were the ones

385
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:39,286
who tended to the wounds
on my head back in India

386
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,921
after I was shot by hol horse.

387
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,789
( Polnareff sputters )

388
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:46,727
You assholes have known avdol
was alive the entire time,

389
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,062
and never once did it cross
any of your deceitful minds

390
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,264
to let me know?!

391
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,266
I’m most surprised
at you, kakyoin!

392
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,935
Kakyoin: I only found out
the day after it all happened.

393
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,170
But it was imperative
to not let the enemy know,

394
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,640
and since you have
such a big mouth, I suggested--

395
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:01,108
pardon. What I meant to say

396
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,744
was since it’s not easy
for you to lie on command,

397
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,679
I suggested
we keep it a secret from you.

398
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:06,913
( Polnareff gasps )

399
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:09,216
Jotaro: If you’d
let the secret slip,

400
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:12,185
avdol wouldn’t have been
able to recuperate in peace.

401
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,054
Kakyoin: We were
planning to let you know

402
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,022
the very moment
we knew that he was safe,

403
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,325
but we didn’t think
you’d run into him first.

404
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,660
Polnareff: Oh, yeah.
Avdol, we found your dad

405
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,296
living in a hut on this island!

406
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,031
Come on.
Let’s let him know you’re here!

407
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,333
Avdol: Oh, that was
just me in disguise.

408
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,438
Polnareff: Say what?!

409
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,673
Then you were in on it
from the very start?

410
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:36,009
Everything that happened
was a ruse you created?

411
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:38,345
Avdol: Don’t talk to me!
No one ever comes to visit

412
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,413
when they have
good news to report!

413
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,915
Just shut up!

414
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,117
Joseph: Don’t go there.

415
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,786
Avdol’s death wasn’t your fault.

416
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,754
Polnareff: You didn’t
have to go that far!

417
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,857
How dare you leave me
out of the loop?!

418
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,259
I think that’s the cruelest
thing you’ve ever done to me!

419
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,127
Joseph: Now, now, chin up.

420
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,429
There’s no reason
for you to cry.

421
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,164
Kakyoin: I’m sorry, polnareff.

422
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,299
I truly didn’t think
you’d be this hurt.

423
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,002
- ( Jotaro growls )
- Avdol: I apologize as well,

424
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,403
but I had a very good reason

425
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:05,072
for coming to this island
in disguise.

426
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:06,807
Polnareff: Yeah? What is it?

427
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,209
Joseph: It was partially
so the enemy wouldn’t find out,

428
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:11,912
but I also had avdol
do some shopping for me

429
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,146
while he was laying low.

430
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,082
Polnareff:
What kind of shopping?

431
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,517
Avdol: Since it was
a very conspicuous acquisition,

432
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:21,155
I disguised myself
as a wealthy arab gentlemen.

433
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:24,825
Joseph: All right, everyone,
let’s climb aboard and head out!

434
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:26,293
Come on, polnareff.

435
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,094
For the love
of everything that’s sacred,

436
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,796
- cheer up already.
- Polnareff: Huh?

437
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,465
Joseph: It’s almost here. Look.

438
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,333
Polnareff: I don’t understand.
What’s almost here?

00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,803
