who attacked polnareff?

Avdol: Yes.

191
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,136
He is soul sacrifice.

192
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,004
According to rumors,

193
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,073
he’s a native-American shaman
who is also an assassin,

194
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:03,477
but he’s an utterly
terrifying stand user.

195
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,912

196

197

I’ve seen him before,

198
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,919
and he looks as fierce
as his reputation.

199
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,854
His body is covered in scars,

200
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,057
scars he receives by cunningly
provoking his enemy to attack.

201
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,526
That’s how he gets
the upper hand.

202
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,796
He uses
the so-called power of vengeance

203
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,764
to fully control his stand.

204
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,632
That’s why, to ordinary people,

205
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,569

killed the victims.

206
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,571

must have fallen

207
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,072

208

of stand is it?

210

211

are dead.

212

how we’re handling this.

for polnareff to be alone

to kill us one by one.

he might be able to do.

a strategy.

218
