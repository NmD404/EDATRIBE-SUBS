I was angry that day,

352
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,580
but no matter what,
i’ve always loved you

353
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,717
more than the stars in the sky,
and I still do.

354
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,720
Sherry: Really?
You’ve always loved me,

355
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,455
no matter what I did?

356
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,856
Polnareff:
Yes, of course I have.

357
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,959
Sherry: And does that feeling
hold true to this day?

358
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,628
Polnareff: I will always
love you, no matter what,

359
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:44,765
and I can clearly see now
that you’re the real Sherry.

360
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,802
You have no idea how much
i’ve missed you, little sister.

361
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:50,171
Sherry: I see.

362
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:53,974
I feel the same, big brother.

363
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,042
Polnareff: Sherry,
please look this way.

364
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,712
I’m begging you to show me
that beautiful face of yours.

365
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,914
( Sherry crying )

366
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:02,983
Polnareff:
Why are you crying, Sherry?

367
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,818
Are you still sad?

368
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:08,055
Sherry: Sad? No, brother.

369
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,691
These aren’t tears of sadness.

370
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,125
I’m crying, because...

371
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,528
Polnareff: What?
What is it, then?

372
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,829
Sherry: I’m--

373
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:19,133
i’m happy, brother,

374
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,201
’cause I can finally eat you!

375
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,040
( Polnareff screaming )

376
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,779
Ch-chariot.

377
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,085
( Gagging )

378
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:45,693
Sher...ry.

379
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:49,196
Sherry: I’m sorry
that I bit you, brother.

380
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:53,567
I’m afraid my body is
still underdeveloped.

381
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,437
But if I eat your flesh,
i’ll return to normal.

382
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,407
It’s okay if I eat you, right?

383
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,908
What am I saying?

384
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,645
You always did
what I asked you to.

385
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:05,946
( Growling )

386
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,180
( Polnareff screams )

387
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,588
Cameo!

388
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,790
Cameo: You rang?

389
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,993
Polnareff: You bastard!

390
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:20,761
Cameo: What’s all
the fuss about?

391
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:24,665
Do you have a complaint?
I granted your wish, didn’t I?

392
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,634
Granting wishes
is my power, after all.

393
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:30,604
What you do with them
is completely up to you.

394
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:31,671
( Polnareff gasps )

395
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,674
Then let me
use this opportunity

396
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,676
to tell you my third wish.

397
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,580
Ma-make my sister...

398
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,983
♪

399
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,585
Make her...

400
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,960
Make my sister
return to her grave

401
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:55,796
so she can rest in peace!

402
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,141
Cameo: I don’t think so.

403
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:10,177
( Polnareff gasps ) Why not?

404
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,113
Cameo: You still don’t get it
do you, polnareff?

405
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,082
If you haven’t figured it out,
i’m a stand

406
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,818
and not just any stand,

407
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,821
the one represented
by the judgment card.

408
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:23,957
You see, my powers allow me
to extract wishes

409
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,560
from the deepest corners
of the human mind

410
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,995
and manifest it
from the soil below.

411
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,999
You created your sister
from your own yearning.

412
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:34,067
Polnareff: How dare you?

413
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:38,472
Cameo: And since you
created her, I cannot undo it.

414
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:39,806
( Laughs )

415
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,210
It looks like the winner
of this battle is me.

416
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,212
( Polnareff gasping )

417
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,616
Cameo: By the way,
I seem to recall

418
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,652
you saying something
about a third wish.

419
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,187
But don’t you remember,
polnareff?

420
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,989
You’ve already made
your third wish.

421
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:57,024
Polnareff: Oh, no.

422
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:59,426
( Cameo laughs )
