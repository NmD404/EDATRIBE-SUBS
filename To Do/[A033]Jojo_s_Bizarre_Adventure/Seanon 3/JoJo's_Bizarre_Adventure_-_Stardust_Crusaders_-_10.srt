that’s what they call me.

354
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,820
I’m a stand user
just like you are,

355
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:28,989
and my card is the emperor.

356
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,491
Lord dio paid me
to get rid of you guys,

357
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,794
so say your prayers,
and get ready for a beating.

358
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,429
Polnareff: Look here, cowboy,

359
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,597
I don’t give a rat’s ass
who you say you are.

360
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,966
Hol horse: Hmm?

361
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,034
Polnareff: Where is the man
with two right hands?

362
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,636
Hol horse: That was pretty rude.

363
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,838
You asked who I am,
so I answered you.

364
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:46,640
Well, whatever.

365
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,608
I came here with that guy.

366
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:49,776
( Polnareff gasps )

367
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,078
Hol horse: He’s nearby.

368
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,180
Polnareff: What? Where is he?!

369
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,115
Hol horse: There’s really
no point at all

370
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,916
in you asking that.
I, hol horse,

371
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,686
will have the pleasure
of snuffing you out.

372
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,123
Polnareff: Arrogant morons
like you always talk trash,

373
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,092
and it always ends up
the other way around.

374
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,160
( Hol horse laughs )

375
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,530
Polnareff: Oh, was that funny?

376
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,165
Hol horse: Lord dio
had you pegged.

377
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,133
"Polnareff has the fatal habit

378
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,136
"of underestimating
his opponents.

379
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,072
Beating him into a corpse
won’t be any trouble for you."

380
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:21,642
He was exactly right,
so I couldn’t help but laugh.

381
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:22,809
( Chuckles )

382
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,078
( Polnareff scoffs )

383
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,113
If I can’t face him
until I defeat you,

384
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,882
then that’s
just what i’ll do, chump.

385
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,184
Bring it on.

386
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,720
Hol horse: Ever heard
of military chess?

387
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,989
The tank is stronger
than the soldier,

388
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,491
and the tanks are weak
against the mines.

389
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,793
See, it’s pretty much
the basics of battle.

390
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:43,831
My emperor is stronger than you,
so I thought i’d be a gentleman.

391
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,999
I’ll let you know
my stand’s abilities

392
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,002
before we fight
so we’re square.

393
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:50,838
The gun is mightier
than the sword.

394
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:53,607
Heh. Such a brilliant quote.

395
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,810
Polnareff: What are you
trying to say, exactly?

396
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:59,280
Hol horse: That I have
a stand that shoots,

397
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,749
and a sword
simply can’t beat that.

398
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:04,018
Polnareff: So, what?
A peashooter?

399
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:05,286
( Laughing )

400
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,521
( Hol horse laughing )

401
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:17,164
Both: Prepare to die!

402
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,165
( Hol horse spits )

403
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,967
You underestimated me!

404
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,871
And now, polnareff, you’re dead!

405
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,575
Polnareff:
If I take off my armor...

406
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,811
I can knock down a bullet!

407
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,615
Wait. What the?!

408
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:35,949
That’s impossible!

409
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:38,619
It bypassed my sword! Oh, crap!

410
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:41,054
Hol horse:
The bullet is also my stand,

411
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:44,792
and underestimating me
just cost you your life.

412
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,032
Avdol: Polnareff!

413
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,633
( All gasp )

414
00:18:57,171 --> 00:18:59,206
Polnareff: What? Avdol!

415
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,074
Avdol: I’ve been
worried about you,

416
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:02,876
and now look where you are!

417
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,879
Your ego will end you,
polnareff.

418
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:06,580
Polnareff:
You’re worried about me?

419
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,282
Damn you! You came here
to lecture me again?

420
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,585
Avdol: The enemy already knows
everything about you!

421
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,854
You said you’re a loner,
but from now on,

422
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,655
you won’t be able to win alone!

423
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,057
Hol horse: Hmph.

424
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,859
What bad timing
for an outsider to interfere.

425
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,732
Avdol: Polnareff, move!
The bullet’s coming back!

426
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:28,068
Go, magician’s red!

427
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,302
( Magician’s red shrieks )

Joseph: Damn that avdol.

431
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:38,712
He went
after polnareff himself.

Kakyoin: Where are you,
Mr. Avdol, polnareff?

433
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,654
I have a terrible feeling.

434

going on over there!

435

My gun and centerfold’s mirror

00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:37,037
don’t do very well against
avdol’s flames, you see.

445

We were sure he’d be
our most formidable enemy.

446

Talk about luck.

447
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,978
With him gone,
the game is in the bag!

H-he’s just hurt. That’s all.

It’s just a minor wound. See?

452
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,826
He’s going to start speaking.

453

for help? Because I never did.
