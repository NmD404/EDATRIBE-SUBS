1
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:53,679
In the ancient times,
the land lay covered with deep forests,

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:01:00,769
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

3
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:50,652
PRINCESS
MONONOKE

4
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,999
Yakul! Come on, boy!

5
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,881
Ashitaka!

6
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,301
Just in time! The wise woman wants
everybody back to the village at once.

7
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,720
- We just came from Ji-San.
- Did he see something?

8
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,846
Yes, in the forest.

9
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,890
- The birds have all gone!
- And the animals, too!

10
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,061
I'll go to the watchtower to see Ji-San.
You hurry back home.

11
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,437
All right!

12
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,059
Something's there.

13
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,984
Ji-San, did you see it too?

14
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,028
I did. It isn't human.

15
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,948
The wise woman's calling
everyone back to the village.

16
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,617
There, look!

17
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,816
- It's some kind of demon!
- A demon?

18
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,671
Run, Yakul, run!

19
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,158
It's headed for the village.
I must stop it.

20
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,993
Prince Ashitaka, wait!

21
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,205
Be careful, the thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!

22
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,081
Here, Yakul!

23
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,899
Calm your fury, oh mighty Lord!

24
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:20,237
Whatever you may be, god or demon,
please, leave us in peace!

25
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,381
- A monster!
- Come on!

26
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,177
Go back!
Please leave our village alone!

27
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,429
Stop, please, stop!

28
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,451
- He killed it!
- Ashitaka!

29
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,621
- Fetch the wise woman!
- Don't put out the fire yet!

30
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,956
Ashitaka!

31
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,004
Kaya, don't touch it! This wound is evil.

32
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,007
The prince has been hurt.
Where is the wise woman?

33
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,594
Keep away from him!
Everyone stay back!

34
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,515
- What shall we do?
- Pour this over his wound, slowly.

35
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,783
Nameless god of rage and hate,

36
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,577
I bow before you.

37
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,497
A mound will be raised
and funeral rites performed

38
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,958
on this ground where you have fallen.

39
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,211
Pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.

40
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,049
Disgusting little creatures,

41
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,637
soon all of you will feel my hate
and suffer as I have suffered.

42
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,887
I'm afraid this is very bad.

43
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,267
The stones tell me the boar-god came
from far to the west.

44
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,730
He had some kind of a poison inside
him, driving him mad.

45
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,441
A poisonous hatred that consumed his
heart and flesh

46
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,527
and turned him into a demon-monster.

47
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,031
- Prince Ashitaka.
- Yes?

48
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,575
Show everyone your right arm.

49
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,626
What does it mean?

50
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,879
My Prince,

51
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,758
are you prepared to learn what fate
the stones have foretold you?

52
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,636
Yes. I was prepared the moment I let
my arrow fly.

53
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,224
The infection will spread throughout
your whole body, bone and flesh alike.

54
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,143
It will cause you great pain,
then Kill you.

55
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,733
Is there no way we can stop it?

56
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,195
He got that wound defending our village
and saving our lives!

57
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,405
Do we just sit and watch him die?

58
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,825
You cannot alter your fate, my Prince.

59
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,662
However, you can rise to meet lit,
If you choose.

60
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,498
Look at this.

61
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,045
This iron ball
was found in the boar's body.

62
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,423
This is what hurt him so.
It shattered his bones

63
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,801
and burned its way deep inside him.

64
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:56,179
This is what turned him into a demon.

65
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,476
There is evil at work in the land to
the west, Prince Ashitaka.

66
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:06,940
It's your fate to go there so you can
see with eyes unclouded by hate.

67
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,944
You may find a way to lift the curse,
you understand?

68
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,153
Yes.

69
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,907
We are the last of the Emishi.

70
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,869
It's five hundred years
since the Emperor destroyed our tribe

71
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,790
and drove the remnants of our people
to the east.

72
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,043
Some managed to survive here for all
these years.

73
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,171
But the blood of our tribe has grown

74
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,215
weaker and thinner
with each generation.

75
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:37,929
Now our last prince must cut his hair
and leave us, never to return.

76
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,432
Sometimes I think the gods
are laughing at us.

77
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,784
Our laws forbid us from
watching you go, Ashitaka.

78
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,329
Whatever comes to pass now,
you are dead to us forever. Farewell.

79
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,944
What are you doing here?
You know it's forbidden.

80
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,696
Do you think I care about that?

81
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,449
I came to give you this so you won't
forget your little sister.

82
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,748
Your crystal dagger? I can't take this.

83
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,209
Please keep it with you, brother,
to protect you.

84
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,961
You must take it. I want you to have it.

85
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,130
So you won't forget.

86
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,050
Kaya, you know
I could never forget you.

87
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,765
A battle?

88
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,568
They're unarmed! Move in!

89
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:44,741
- Look, up there on the hill!
- It's a warrior!

90
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:56,878
You, stop!

91
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,928
My arm! What's happening to me?

92
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,141
Hurry! Stop him before he gets away!

93
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,769
Let me pass! I'm warning you!

94
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,202
A demon?

95
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,883
The mark's getting bigger.

96
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,106
Are you selling soup or donkey piss?

97
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,861
There he is now.

98
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:11,953
Will this be enough?

99
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,705
What are you trying to pull?
This isn't money.

100
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,958
Give me back my rice, you little thief!

101
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,544
Excuse me, but might I inspect that?

102
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,634
My God! This is a lump of pure gold,
you silly woman!

103
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,638
However, if it's money you want,
I'll pay for the rice

104
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,932
and take this nugget off your hands.
What do you say?

105
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,602
Is there a money changer who could tell
us how much this is worth?

106
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,396
No? All right.

107
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:44,026
Now, I'm just a monk, but I'd say
three bags of rice at least.

108
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,738
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- Give me back my gold!

109
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,158
Hey!

110
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,743
What's your hurry?
You can't just rush off now.

111
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,705
Don't you even think of thanking me.
It was my pleasure.

112
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,291
In fact, I should be thanking you.

113
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:03,296
You see, I was caught in that battle.

114
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,009
I saw what you did to that samurai.
You fight like a demon.

115
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,097
You noticed we're being followed.

116
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:18,853
That's what we get for waving that gold
nugget around.

117
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,023
They'll wait till we're asleep
and then they'll slit our throats.

118
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,316
Shall we run?

119
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,413
So, the demon-monster turned out to be
a giant boar.

120
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,457
I followed its trail westward through
the mountains

121
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,502
to where the samurai were attacking
those villagers, but then...

122
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,671
You lost it. That's life.
See this place here?

123
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,636
When I came here last, a few years
back, this was a lovely little village.

124
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,514
But then there must have been a flood
or a landslide, or a fire.

125
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,350
The only sure thing is that everybody
is dead.

126
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:02,355
These days, there are angry ghosts all
around us.

127
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,484
Dead from wars, sickness, starvation,
and nobody cares.

128
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:11,280
You say you're under a curse, so what?
So's the whole damn world.

129
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,117
Mmm... Delicious.

130
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,748
I was wrong to fight in that village.
Two men are dead because of me.

131
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,334
Samurai thugs.
You win some, you lose some.

132
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,546
Hand me your bowl.

133
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,716
My point is, everybody dies.
Some now, some later.

134
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,427
Beautiful bowl.
I've seen one other like it.

135
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,682
Have you ever
heard of the Emishi people?

136
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,060
They were said to ride red elks.

137
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,481
They also used stone arrowheads,
just like you.

138
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,699
The most important things do not
get defeated by death.

139
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,286
My master told me that once, you know.

140
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,163
Well, here's your rice. Eat up my boy!

141
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,209
Have you ever come across
anything like this before?

142
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,007
Is this...

143
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,301
It came from the giant boar.
It was inside him.

144
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,554
I'm sure it was that little ball of
iron that killed him.

145
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,692
There's a place high in the mountains
far to the west of here.

146
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,402
It's where the spirit of the forest dwells,

147
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,113
but it's a dangerous place for humans.

148
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,615
To enter there is certain death.

149
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,991
The spirit of the forest?

150
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:42,371
The beasts there are all giants,
like they were at the dawn of time.

151
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,740
See you there, my friend.

152
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,776
The sooner we get this rice home,
the sooner we eat. Let's move!

153
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,613
Coming this way! Wolves!

154
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,749
Don't let the oxen panic! Stay calm!
Take up your positions.

155
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,793
Keep your powder dry.

156
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,254
Make sure you wait for them to come
within range.

157
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,638
Ready? And fire!

158
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,991
Second round, fire!

159
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,208
That was it? They weren't so big.

160
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,879
They're just pups. Wait till
you see their mother. Where are they?

161
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,720
It's Moro!

162
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,352
Come on.

163
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,618
We killed her!

164
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,038
You forget she is a god.
It will take more than that.

165
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,756
She certainly did some damage.

166
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,466
We move out now.

167
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,426
What about the men
she pushed over the cliff?

168
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,303
They're dead. Let's get the living home.

169
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,616
He's still breathing.

170
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,368
Hang on!

171
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,307
My name is Ashitaka!

172
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,143
I've traveled far from lands to the east.

173
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:18,147
Are you ancient gods? Have I come to
the realm of the spirit of the forest?

174
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,831
Go away!

175
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,604
A Kodama! I never thought I'd see one
of them here.

176
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,525
Easy, there. You don't want to make
your injuries worse, do you?

177
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,950
He's a tree spirit. He brings good luck.

178
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,868
It's a sign this forest is healthy.

179
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,995
But they'll lead their lord and master
right to us!

180
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,414
Who do you mean?
Those wolves I just saw?

181
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:21,251
No, I mean a real monster,
like a huge enormous deer...

182
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,797
Where did it go?

183
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,807
If Yakul is not afraid,
we have nothing to worry about here.

184
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,104
Would you be kind enough to grant us
passage through your forest?

185
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,076
Sir, I really think we should turn
around now.

186
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,745
Did I mention no human has ever
made it through the woods alive?

187
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,039
There's a lovely trail back across the
river.

188
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,875
The current is too swift for us
to get across

189
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,752
and your friend's injuries are very bad.

190
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,588
If we don't get him back soon,
he doesn't stand a chance.

191
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,888
Little fellow, are you showing us
the way or getting us more lost?

192
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,948
Please, sir. I'm pretty sure they're
not trying to help us get home.

193
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,908
My God, there's thousands of them!

194
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,807
Look at that, it must be their mother.
A fine old tree.

195
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,142
The tracks of those wolves
and the girl with them!

196
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,978
This place must be
where the four of them live.

197
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,189
Sir, I think maybe we took
a wrong turn somewhere.

198
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,399
This is a place for gods and demons!

199
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,027
I think we're safe. We'll rest a bit.

200
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,623
More tracks?

201
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:15,092
Whatever made these made them
recently.

202
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,397
Sir! What's going on? Are you all right?

203
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,682
Sir, what just happened there?

204
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,976
You went white as a sheet
all of a sudden.

205
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,687
I warned you about this place.

206
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,314
Did you see anything just then?

207
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,482
- Like what?
- Forget it.

208
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,237
Hang on just a little longer.
You're almost home.

209
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,364
I failed her.

210
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,663
It's gone.

211
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,294
That's strange.
Suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.

212
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,256
My arm! It doesn't hurt!

213
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,426
Yes! Ouch! It's still broken.

214
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:31,687
Sir, you were right! We made it back
home, just like you said.

215
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,014
- It's a fortress!
- It's Lady Eboshi's Iron Town.

216
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,766
We make iron here
from the ore in the sand.

217
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,146
Hey, there! Hello! It's me!

218
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,358
- Someone's come out of the woods!
- Is it the wolf-girl?

219
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:23,280
Look! It's me, Kohroku, the ox driver!

220
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,953
It's true, Kohroku is still alive!

221
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,455
He can't be!

222
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,084
Quiet! Stop that noise! I'm trying to
tally these accounts, so shut up!

223
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,254
Haven't you heard?
Kohroku has come back from the dead!

224
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,422
What?

225
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,479
- This is unbelievable!
- Where are the others?

226
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,022
There were two others who fell there.

227
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,524
I'm afraid we're the only ones
who made it.

228
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,404
It's never the gods that die.

229
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,031
Stand aside.

230
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,785
That man in the weird costume, sir,
who do you think he could be?

231
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,870
He's obviously an outsider.

232
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,791
Listen to me!
This stranger saved our lives!

233
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,543
He carried the rifleman
all the way back here.

234
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,462
You should be grateful to him!

235
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,799
Hey, watch the arm!

236
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,595
Hold it right there!

237
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,735
I'm very grateful to you for bringing
these men back to us, stranger.

238
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,487
But something doesn't smell right.

239
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,449
You got back here almost as fast as we
did, and through the forbidden forest!

240
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,327
On top of that, you did it with
two badly injured men

241
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,745
and you want me to believe...

242
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,414
Kohroku! You're alive!

243
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,498
Toki, my love!

244
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,709
That's just great.

245
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,673
How are you gonna drive the ox now,
all banged up and mangled?

246
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,259
- But, my little flower...
- You scared me half to death!

247
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,178
Don't you "little flower" me!
I wish the wolves had eaten you.

248
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,389
Then maybe I could have found
a real husband!

249
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,183
Sweetness, can we discuss this later?

250
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,770
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time!

251
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,190
As for you, Gonza, a fine captain of
the guard you are,

252
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,694
strutting and throwing your weight
around once the danger is over!

253
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,779
You never do a lick
of work around here.

254
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,364
That's unfair and untrue.

255
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,699
Thanks, stranger.

256
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,535
My husband is an idiot but I'm glad
he's safe and sound.

257
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,828
That's a relief. I was starting to think

258
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,414
I'd done something wrong by bringing
him back home.

259
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:45,547
Say, why don't you take the mask off,
I bet you're really handsome.

260
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,673
<i>Gonza!</i>

261
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,761
Bring the stranger to me later.
I would like to thank him personally.

262
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,430
Kohroku.

263
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:57,309
- Yes?
- I'm happy you're back and I apologize.

264
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,602
Okay.

265
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,354
Milady, you shouldn't
tell him things like that.

266
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,148
If you're too nice,
he will walk all over you.

267
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,400
I hope you'll forgive me too, Toki.

268
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,195
I was responsible,
I should never have let it happen.

269
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,822
That's all right, Milady,
if you hadn't been there

270
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:14,826
the wolves would have eaten everyone
and we'd have to find new husbands.

271
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,581
Get some rest, traveler.
I will see you this evening.

272
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,796
You're not handsome, you're gorgeous!

273
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,543
- Is he there?
- There he is!

274
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,711
Toki was right, he is handsome!

275
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,713
- Yeah, not bad.
- But he's so young!

276
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,966
That never stopped you before!

277
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,553
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today!

278
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,055
There's lots of gorgeous men
in here, honey!

279
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,848
I've seen cattle that looked better.

280
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,768
Listen, stranger, why don't you
come over to our place?

281
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,187
You don't want to stay
in this stinky old barn.

282
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:27,566
We risked our lives to bring you
the rice you're all eating tonight.

283
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,775
So, watch your mouth.

284
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,903
And who made the iron
that paid for the rice?

285
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,489
We're pumping those bellows while you
pigs are in bed.

286
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,493
Actually, if it's not too much trouble,
I would like to see where you work.

287
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,413
- You would?
- We'll have to work in make-up tonight.

288
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,875
Don't be a stranger! Don't forget now,
we'll be waiting for you!

289
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,006
It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

290
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,218
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten,
that's why they're like that.

291
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,804
They say that happy women
make a happy village.

292
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,474
Happy? These kind of women,
working here?

293
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,519
Women like that, it's a disgrace!
They defile the iron.

294
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:09,149
Lady Eboshi buys the contract of every
brothel girl she can find.

295
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,276
Milady has a kind heart, that's all.

296
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,361
You got rice on your chin, old man.

297
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:17,657
That's true! Everything here has turned
upside down since she showed up.

298
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,619
She's not even afraid of the gods,
that woman.

299
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,413
You should have seen
the way she dealt with Nago.

300
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,539
Who's Nago?

301
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,710
The gigantic boar-god.
He used to rule this whole forest.

302
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,338
We couldn't even get near
the mountains with him around.

303
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,924
Nothing to do but sit around,
staring at a bunch of angry boars.

304
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:39,179
See, the iron in the sand under this
town had all been dug out.

305
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,931
We tried to get at the iron
under the mountain

306
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,808
but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.

307
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:48,313
But before we could get to the iron,
we had to clear away the forest.

308
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,106
And that's what made the boar angry.

309
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,957
He's feeling no pain!

310
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:14,673
One day, Lady Eboshi came along with
her warriors and their rifles.

311
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,326
Young man, what's wrong?

312
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,248
Is something hurting your arm?

313
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,793
No.
I was just thinking about the boar-god.

314
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,797
I was thinking how he must have died
filled with hate.

315
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,472
Forgive me for keeping
you waiting, stranger.

316
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,015
That's good iron.

317
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,185
We were running behind with
tomorrow's shipment.

318
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,482
Let's have a rest.
You may tell the others.

319
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,734
Yes, ma'am.

320
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,988
Some think you're a spy for the wolf-girl
or for Lord Asano and his samurai.

321
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,491
There are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.

322
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,161
Why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?

323
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,586
I believe you'll recognize this.

324
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,131
It shattered the bones of a giant boar,

325
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,258
rotted his flesh and turned him
into a monster.

326
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,012
I fought with him, and for that I was
cursed with this mark on my arm.

327
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,097
And soon, it will kill me.

328
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,849
Where is it you come from?

329
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,059
I've never seen a red elk
like that before.

330
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,272
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

331
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,776
Answer Milady's question
or I'll cut you in half!

332
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,614
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?

333
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,366
To see with eyes unclouded by hate.

334
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,368
Eyes unclouded?

335
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,878
That explains it.
Come, I'll show you all my secrets.

336
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,046
Is that wise, Milady?

337
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,465
Gonza, take over for me.

338
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,028
This is my garden. None of the
townspeople dare to come here.

339
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,948
Follow me if you wish
to learn my secret.

340
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,165
Good evening.

341
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,134
We've only just finished it, Milady.

342
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,387
It's still too heavy.

343
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,848
Perhaps if you didn't
hold it so delicately?

344
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,059
Milady, if we make them any lighter,
they'll fall apart.

345
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,355
They're not for me,
they're for the other women here.

346
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,317
That will be something to see!

347
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,112
This is the latest rifle
that I've asked these people to design.

348
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,781
The ones we brought here
turned out to be too heavy.

349
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,410
These will kill forest monsters and
pierce the thickest samurai armor.

350
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,287
You'd better watch out there,
young man.

351
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,789
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world!

352
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,835
I'm sorry to have to push you all so
hard. I'll have wine sent down later.

353
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,545
That would be nice!

354
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,926
First you steal the boar's forest from
him, then transform him into a demon.

355
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,512
Now you make even deadlier weapons.
How much hate and pain do we need?

356
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,307
Yes. I'm the one who shot the boar.

357
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,352
I'm sorry that you suffer. I truly am.

358
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,522
That brainless pig! I'm the one he
should have put a curse on, not you!

359
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,543
Does that right hand of yours wish to
kill me now, Ashitaka?

360
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,129
If it would lift the curse,
I'd let it tear you apart.

361
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:08,257
But even that wouldn't end the killing
now, would it?

362
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,969
No, it wouldn't. You would have to
kill all of us to be at peace.

363
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,306
Milady, Osa has something to say.

364
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:21,020
Forgive me, Milady, but you must not
make light of the boy's strength.

365
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:26,025
Young man, like you,
I know what rage feels like,

366
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,195
and grief, and helplessness.

367
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,616
But you must not take your revenge
on Lady Eboshi.

368
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:40,206
She's the only one who saw
us as human beings.

369
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,835
We are lepers.

370
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,462
The world hates and fears us,

371
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,841
but she took us in and washed our
rotting flesh and bandaged us...

372
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,552
Osa.

373
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:56,639
Life is suffering. It is hard.
The world is cursed.

374
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,102
But still, you find reasons to keep living.

375
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,105
I'm sorry. I'm making no sense.

376
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,667
They just keep coming back.

377
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,004
Every night they're out there
planting trees.

378
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,673
Trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again.

379
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,302
Stay here. Help me
kill the forest spirit, Ashitaka.

380
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,680
You would do that?
Kill the very heart of the forest?

381
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,724
Without that ancient god,

382
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,143
the animals here would be nothing
but dumb beasts.

383
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,980
When the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out,

384
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,899
this desolate place
will be the richest land in the world.

385
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,692
And Princess Mononoke will become
human.

386
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,861
Princess Mononoke?

387
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,323
Princess of the spirits of ghouls,
beasts and ancient gods.

388
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,326
The wolves stole her soul
and now she lives to kill me.

389
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:07,001
The legends say the blood of the great
forest spirit can heal anything.

390
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,004
Perhaps it could cure my poor lepers.

391
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,840
It might even be able to lift your curse.

392
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,217
Milady?

393
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,346
- How does the action feel to you?
- Better.

394
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,765
Smooth as silk.
The perfect thing for ruling the world.

395
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,767
But still too heavy for the girls.

396
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,435
All right.

397
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,798
Well, look who's here.

398
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,842
Evening.
All right if I work the bellows for a while?

399
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,844
I guess so.

400
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,390
Excuse me. May I try it?

401
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,184
It's okay. Might as well let him try.

402
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,074
I can't believe he came here.

403
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,826
Yeah. What a catch, huh?

404
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,079
That guy really cares about us!

405
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,749
I'm impressed.
But you'll never keep that pace up.

406
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,127
It's hard work, isn't it?

407
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,838
You bet.
And our shifts are four days long.

408
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,465
You must lead hard lives here.

409
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:41,262
I suppose. But it sure beats working a
brothel in the city, huh?

410
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:45,016
Here we get to eat as much as we want,
and the men don't bother us.

411
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,356
No! You can't leave tomorrow!

412
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,317
- Couldn't you stay a little longer?
- You can stay and work here!

413
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,820
Thank you all, but there's someone
I have to find out there in the forest.

414
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,245
She's here.

415
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,127
The wolves are coming!
It's the wolf-princess!

416
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,333
Hurry!

417
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,459
Stop!

418
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,462
I don't want to fight you. I'm a friend!

419
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,007
She's over here!

420
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,969
Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!

421
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,565
Keep stoking those fires!

422
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,401
Riflemen to the stockade!
We've got her right where we want her.

423
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,738
A weapon for every man!
Everyone defends Iron Town!

424
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,614
Toki, she's on the roof!

425
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:09,035
Now don't get excited.
Keep those bellows working.

426
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,245
Whatever happens,
we can't let those fires go out.

427
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,539
- Is she alone?
- Yes.

428
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,416
She can't escape,
we have her cornered.

429
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,877
We know she means
to kill you this time.

430
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,087
We'll see about that. Come on!

431
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:33,351
Can you hear me, princess of beasts?
If it's me you want, here I am.

432
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,687
If you seek revenge for all the animals
we've Killed,

433
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:41,442
there are two women down here
I'd like you to meet.

434
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,819
They want revenge as well,
for husbands killed by your wolves.

435
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,655
Come on out, you little witch!
My husband is dead because of you.

436
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,671
Everybody out of the way!

437
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,465
Riflemen, get ready to fire!

438
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,474
It's a trap. No, wait!

439
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:18,604
Princess of the wolf-gods, don't go
down there! Go back to the forest!

440
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:25,027
Listen to me, please,
don't throw your life away!

441
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,529
Shall I stop him?

442
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,614
Leave him be. Let him do as he likes.

443
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,054
She's down! We got her!

444
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,431
Stay back.

445
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,017
Cut off a wolf's head and he still has
the power to bite.

446
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,477
What?

447
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,020
Take aim where she falls.

448
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,583
Open fire!

449
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,093
No! Stay back!

450
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,187
Wake up!

451
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,651
No!

452
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,255
Kill her, Milady!

453
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,349
Are you all right? Can I help you?

454
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,277
- Get away from me! Be gone!
- Yes, Sir.

455
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,119
Traitor!
You're a spy for the wolves, aren't you?

456
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,122
Stay back!

457
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,169
Step aside.

458
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,480
What do you think you're doing, boy?

459
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,108
Stay your hand,
the girl's life is now mine.

460
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,861
I'm sure she'll make
a lovely wife for you.

461
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:16,365
There is a demon inside of you.
It's inside both of you.

462
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:26,041
Look, everyone!
This is what hatred looks like.

463
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,795
This is what it does when it catches
hold of you.

464
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:33,048
It's eating me alive.
Very soon, it will kill me.

465
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,634
I'm getting a little bored of this
curse of yours, Ashitaka.

466
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,803
Let me just cut the damn thing off!

467
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,851
Milady!

468
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,814
Someone come here
and take her from me.

469
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,359
Milady!

470
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:57,156
Don't worry, she's just stunned.
She'll be all right.

471
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,538
As for me, I'm leaving.
And I'm taking the wolf-girl.

472
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,626
No, you're not!
Nobody treats Lady Eboshi like that.

473
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,047
Move and I fire!

474
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:25,934
Kiyo, what are you doing?

475
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,400
How can he still be walking?

476
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,076
- Is she all right?
- Yes, Milady is safe, sir.

477
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:46,246
Someone bring me my gun! Riflemen
to the square, now, on the double!

478
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,582
They're not getting out of here alive.

479
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:50,959
Toki, come here!

480
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,425
What's happened?

481
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:14,983
Sir, I can't let you pass.

482
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,195
The gate's been ordered shut.
It can't be opened!

483
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:22,908
Turn back, please!

484
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,536
We're grateful to you for bringing
those men back to us.

485
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,621
- We don't want to hurt you.
- Please!

486
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,873
I walked in through this gate
this morning.

487
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,792
Now I'm going to leave the same way.

488
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,672
Don't be a fool.
It takes ten men to open this gate.

489
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,932
Stop it! You'll kill yourself.

490
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,119
Out of the way!

491
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,707
The wolves are attacking!

492
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,791
Flint!

493
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,753
Stop! She's all right.
Your princess is safe with me.

494
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,715
Stay and I will bring her.

495
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,799
Come on, Yakul.

496
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:26,972
You have my thanks.

497
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,231
Good luck, stranger.

498
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,047
Stop it!

499
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,634
Leave him, he's mine!

500
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,730
His own people shot him.

501
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,066
He's dying.

502
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,823
Why did you stop me from killing her?
Tell me while you're still alive!

503
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,410
I did not want to let you die.

504
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:34,832
I'm not afraid of death. If I want to
drive away humans, I don't need my life.

505
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,168
I knew it from the very first time we met.

506
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,129
You're bothering me
and dying for nothing!

507
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:49,096
I'll cut your throat for you so I don't
have to listen to any more of this.

508
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,723
Live.

509
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,184
That's enough!
I'm not listening to you anymore.

510
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:58,063
You're beautiful.

511
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:05,779
What is it, San?
Want me to crunch his face off?

512
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,458
The ape tribe.

513
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,712
All right, what do you want here?

514
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,464
Apes! How dare you show such
disrespect to the wolf clan!

515
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,885
This is our forest.

516
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,095
The human, give him to us.

517
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:33,390
Give us the human and go.

518
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,143
You go, before my fangs find you.

519
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,228
We will not go.

520
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,397
We will eat the human.

521
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,942
Yes, let us eat the man-creature.

522
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:48,614
Are you crazy? What happened to make
the ape tribe change this way?

523
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:51,158
Since when do apes
eat the flesh of a man?

524
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,410
If we eat the human
we will steal his strength

525
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,579
and we will drive
the other humans away.

526
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:59,708
Give us the man-creature.

527
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,629
Stop this! You know you can't possess
the humans' strength by eating them.

528
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,340
All that will do is make you
into something else.

529
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,133
Something even worse than human.

530
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:12,346
We plant trees. Humans tear them up.

531
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,724
The forest does not come back.

532
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,976
If we kill the humans,
we will save the forest.

533
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,479
You mustn't give up. He'll find a way.

534
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,064
The forest spirit is with us.

535
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,691
Go on planting your trees and
someday we'll beat them.

536
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,237
The forest spirit will not fight.
We will all die.

537
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,866
Wolf-girl does not care. She is human.

538
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:38,121
Enough! I'll bite your head off,
you chattering ape!

539
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,000
Stop! Come back!

540
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,386
Leave them alone!

541
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,262
Don't worry about them. It's all right.

542
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,974
You go on ahead now.
I'll stay here and deal with the human.

543
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,227
What about the elk? Can we eat him?

544
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,273
No, you may not. Go home!

545
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,242
Come over here!
Don't worry, I'm a friend.

546
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,246
Don't be shy, now. I won't hurt you.
I need you to help me carry him.

547
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:18,406
You are very wise. You know better
than to set foot on this island.

548
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,118
I smell like a human.

549
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,381
You can go wherever you want to.
You're free now.

550
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,100
Finally!

551
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,145
There he is! Come and see. Hurry!

552
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,648
Quick, you idiots! It's the Nightwalker.

553
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:18,652
He's the reason we've been sitting
around in these stinking animal skins.

554
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,321
But sir, we can't. It's a sin to look at it.

555
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,407
And you call yourself the greatest
hunter in the west!

556
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,410
Look, we've got a letter of pardon
from the Emperor

557
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:30,580
forgiving us for cutting off the
head of the great forest spirit.

558
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:38,838
The legends tell us
that when day becomes night,

559
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,758
the forest spirit
turns into the Nightwalker.

560
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,010
And at sunrise, it changes back.

561
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,930
Look! See there? It's happening.

562
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,348
- Take a look. Master Jigo.
- What is it?

563
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,267
Over there.

564
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,949
Look! There must be hundreds of them.

565
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,160
These boars are not from this region.

566
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,455
They must have been traveling for
months to get all the way up here.

567
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,547
That one is Okkoto!

568
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:47,342
It can't be!
They say he died a hundred years ago.

569
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,719
It's him all right! I know those old tusks!

570
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:52,472
And it looks like he brought along
his whole tribe.

571
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,019
He's seen us, let's get out of here.

572
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,618
Come on, you cowards! Move, quickly!

573
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,298
The bullet wound is gone!

574
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:19,726
Yakul!

575
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,919
Finally, you're awake.
You really should thank Yakul.

576
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,921
He hasn't left your side this whole time.

577
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,841
How do you know his name is Yakul?

578
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,719
He told me. And he told me about you.

579
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,764
About your village,
your people and your forest.

580
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:02,435
The forest spirit brought you back
to life again. He wants you to live.

581
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:07,607
I had the strangest dream.
There was a golden creature.

582
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:08,900
Eat this.

583
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:15,823
Chew.

584
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,499
We're here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

585
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,169
Why are there humans here, Moro?

586
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:53,421
The girl is San, my daughter.

587
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:56,257
Humans are everywhere these days.

588
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:59,260
Go back to your own mountain.
Kill them there.

589
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:03,014
We will kill them here!
We will save this forest.

590
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,059
What is that other human doing here?

591
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,978
He was shot. And then the great spirit
healed his wound.

592
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,772
This man is not our enemy.

593
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,691
The forest spirit saved him?

594
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:16,110
Saved the life of that loathsome runt?

595
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,614
Why didn't he save Nago?

596
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:24,077
Is he not the guardian of the forest?
Why?

597
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,039
The forest spirit gives life and takes
life away.

598
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:32,085
Life and death are his alone.
Or have you boars forgotten that?

599
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:36,631
You lie! You must have begged the
forest spirit to save his life.

600
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,758
But you didn't beg for Nago, did you?

601
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:43,471
Nago was afraid to die.
Now I, too, carry within my breast

602
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:48,935
a poisoned human bullet.
Nago fled, and the darkness took him.

603
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,021
I remain and contemplate my death.

604
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,148
Mother, please ask the
forest spirit to save you.

605
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,360
I have lived long enough, San.

606
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:01,197
Soon the forest spirit
will let me rest forever.

607
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,575
All these years you've defended the
forest spirit. He must save you.

608
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:08,162
You are not fooling us!
Nago was beautiful and strong.

609
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,664
He would not have run from anything!

610
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:13,376
You wolves must have eaten him.

611
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:16,295
Quiet!
Watch what you say, you filthy pig!

612
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:19,841
Gods of the mountain,
please listen to me.

613
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:23,302
Nago died far from here,
and I was the one who killed him.

614
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:25,722
He had become some kind of demon.

615
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,890
One day, he attacked our village.

616
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:32,019
If you want proof, look at my hand
where he touched me.

617
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:41,612
I came here to beg the forest spirit to
lift Nago's curse from me.

618
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:46,367
He healed the bullet wound in my side,
but the demon mark remains.

619
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:52,165
First it will tear my soul apart,
and then it will kill me.

620
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:01,549
Okkoto.
Finally, a boar who will listen to reason.

621
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,096
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!

622
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,056
Please, you mustn't eat him.

623
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,227
You are Moro's human child,
aren't you?

624
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,521
I've heard of you.

625
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:17,982
You're blind!

626
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:22,195
Stand back. I will not eat him.

627
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,529
It's all right, San.

628
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:28,034
Lord Okkoto, what I said about
Nago's death was the truth.

629
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:44,258
I believe you, and I thank you for it,
young one.

630
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:50,223
I'm only grieved and ashamed that such
a demon has come from our tribe.

631
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:56,896
Oh mighty Lord, is there a way to lift
Nago's curse from me?

632
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:03,694
Leave this forest, or the next time
we meet, I'll have to kill you.

633
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:08,574
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.

634
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:11,035
Look on my tribe, Moro.

635
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:14,163
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

636
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:17,333
We will soon be nothing
but squealing game

637
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,294
that the humans hunt for their meat.

638
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,130
You'd risk everything on one last battle?

639
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,258
That's just what the humans want.

640
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:29,136
I do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe.

641
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:32,473
Even if every one of us dies,

642
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:36,060
it will be a battle
the humans will never forget.

643
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,461
The forest spirit!

644
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,981
Come on. Keep your oxen together.
Hurry!

645
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:27,236
Get ready now. A little bit closer...

646
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:28,905
Fire!

647
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,244
My arm!

648
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,495
Reload. Fire!

649
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,289
Attack!

650
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,171
Ready?

651
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:55,306
I see somebody is going to have to go
play the peacemaker.

652
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,516
Take our riflemen
and hide behind the cliffs.

653
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,832
There they are,
coming around the pass!

654
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,130
The hunters are ready, sir.

655
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,466
Excellent. Well done, my boy.

656
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,594
Go and spread the word.
We'll be moving out presently.

657
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:34,762
Yes, sir.

658
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:39,809
Greetings, Jigo.

659
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,353
Well, I've got the Emperor breathing
down my neck

660
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,189
and you're busy playing war
with Lord Asano.

661
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:49,235
And you would have nothing to do with
Lord Asano being here now, would you?

662
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,904
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?

663
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,448
He'll call a truce
If 1 give him half my iron.

664
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:56,784
Is that right? He's a greedy bastard,
isn't he?

665
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,912
But all the same, you might as well let
him have his iron.

666
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:03,416
The boars are gathering for battle,
and you know what that means.

667
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,210
You made me a promise.

668
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,212
Once you get me the head of the forest
spirit,

669
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,256
we can come back and destroy
Lord Asano together.

670
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:14,260
Watch out, Milady, there are some
horsemen coming, get in!

671
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,101
Speak of the devil.
A messenger from Lord Asano.

672
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,228
We have guests.
Mind your manners, ladies.

673
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,438
We will.

674
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:29,233
Welcome back, Milady!

675
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,447
Wait, won't you even talk to the man?

676
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,660
Lady Eboshi, mistress of Iron Town.

677
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:43,330
I bring a message to you
from my Lord Asano.

678
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,751
You have fought valiantly and well.

679
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,211
Now open your gates,
that we may speak with you.

680
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,839
We can hear you just fine
from down there!

681
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:55,217
Milady took this mountain away from
the gods, the boars and the beasts!

682
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,636
And now that it's worth something,
you want it!

683
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,889
- You won't get it!
- The brazen impudence!

684
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,099
You ladies need to be
taught some respect.

685
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:03,517
"Respect"? What's that?

686
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:07,146
We haven't had any respect since
the day we were born!

687
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:11,317
You want some of our iron?
Here you go!

688
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,660
They are really something!

689
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,997
They'll fight forest gods or samurai,
it doesn't matter to them.

690
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:29,126
They're an amazing bunch, your girls.
They were wasted in the brothels.

691
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,755
Impressive for a piece of paper.

692
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:36,342
It's gotten me all the best hunters
and trappers around.

693
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:39,095
Remember, my dear lady, we're after a
god, not just a beast.

694
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,515
Yes, Milady, what is it?

695
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,851
Do you have any idea
who this paper has come from?

696
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,019
From the Emperor himself.

697
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,272
- The Emperor?
- Did you say the "Emperor"?

698
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,733
- His Imperial Majesty.
- His Imperial Majesty?

699
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,611
Yes, they're really something.

700
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:58,280
- Thank you.
- Yes, Milady.

701
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:02,034
Every day that we cut trees
and dig for iron,

702
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,744
the forest and its creatures
grow weaker.

703
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:06,247
My way. There is no loss of life, Jigo.

704
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,250
Listen, you owe me
and I've come to collect.

705
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,293
When you needed riflemen, I sent them.

706
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,504
And without those riflemen,
you lose Iron Town.

707
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:16,549
I'm sorry, did that sound like a threat?

708
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,093
Don't tell me the Emperor
believes that old wives' tale

709
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,554
about the great spirit's head
granting immortality.

710
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:24,431
I'm sure I don't know
what the Emperor believes.

711
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:27,393
I'm just a humble monk.
I'm just trying to get by.

712
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,937
I keep my promises.

713
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,149
Anyway, we have fought
the boars before.

714
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,900
They are much easier to kill than Moro
and her wolf cubs.

715
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:39,572
You can call out that shady bunch
you've got hidden under the cliff.

716
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:46,620
So, I've been found out!
Just one more thing, Milady.

717
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:49,331
Did a stranger come through here,
by any chance?

718
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,668
He's a young man riding
a great big red elk.

719
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:54,295
Came and went.

720
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,774
A bad-looking bunch, if you ask me.

721
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,861
Those men are no ordinary hunters.
They're Killers.

722
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,112
Killers?

723
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,489
Milady, at least let some of us go
with you!

724
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,783
You can't trust these men,
they're strangers!

725
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,786
What if something goes wrong and
we're stuck here? We can't help you!

726
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,955
You said yourself we're better shots
than the men are.

727
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:33,626
That's precisely why I want you all
here in Iron Town.

728
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:37,171
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

729
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:41,091
Once the forest spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

730
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,427
Will Jigo be satisfied
with the creature's head

731
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:46,055
or will he be after
my ironworks as well?

732
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,515
Jigo's riflemen might turn on us.

733
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:51,518
If that happens, I'll need every one of
you here to fight them.

734
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:54,146
Remember, you can't trust men.

735
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:59,276
Don't worry about Her Ladyship.
I'll be right at her side, protecting her.

736
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,029
- That's what we're afraid of.
- What?

737
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:04,490
Even if you were a woman,
you'd still be an idiot.

738
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:14,667
In the moonlight I felt your heart

739
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:19,505
Quiver like a bowstring's pulse

740
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:25,928
In the moon's pale light
You looked at me

741
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,765
Nobody knows your heart

742
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:36,897
When the sun has gone I see you

743
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:42,611
Beautiful and haunting, but cold

744
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:48,575
Like a knife in the dark
That cuts so deep

745
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:54,498
Nobody knows your heart

746
01:19:55,207 --> 01:20:00,629
All of your sorrow, grief and pain

747
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:06,302
Locked away in the forests of the night

748
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:13,058
Your secret heart belongs to the ghosts

749
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,560
And the things that cry in the dark

750
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:15,728
Is it too hard?

751
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:20,482
You know, you could always jump, boy.

752
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:21,567
End it all.

753
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:23,485
As soon as your strength returns,

754
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,404
the mark will spread and destroy you.

755
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,657
It feels like I must have been
asleep for weeks.

756
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:32,494
I had a dream that San was
by my side, nursing me.

757
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,581
I was hoping you'd cry out
in your sleep.

758
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:39,209
Then I would have bitten your head off
to silence you.

759
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,128
It's a beautiful forest.

760
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,672
Are Okkoto and the boars
on the move yet?

761
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,507
Yes, the boars are marching.

762
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:51,055
The trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.

763
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,933
I live here.
I listen to the pain of the forest

764
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,852
and feel the ache
of the bullet in my chest.

765
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:59,188
And I dream of the day
when I will finally

766
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:03,233
crunch that gunwoman's head
in my jaws.

767
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:06,820
Moro, why can't the humans and the
forest live together?

768
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:08,989
Why can't we stop this fighting now?

769
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:11,325
The humans are gathering
for the final battle.

770
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:14,286
The flames of their guns will burn us all.

771
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:17,831
And what happens to San? What's
your plan, to let her die with you?

772
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:21,794
Typical. Selfish.
You think like a human.

773
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:26,048
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.

774
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,675
When the forest dies, so does she.

775
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,136
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf, she's human.

776
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:36,266
Silence, boy!
How dare you speak to a god like that?

777
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,936
I caught her human parents
defiling my forest.

778
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:42,940
They threw their baby at my feet
as they ran away.

779
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:46,568
Instead of eating her,
I raised her as my own.

780
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:50,155
Now my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter
is neither human, nor wolf.

781
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:51,990
How could you help her?

782
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:57,496
I don't know.
But at least we might find a way to live.

783
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:04,753
How? Will you join forces with San
and fight the humans?

784
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,090
No. All that would do
IS cause more hatred.

785
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:13,011
There is nothing you can do, boy.

786
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:16,390
Soon the demon mark will spread
and Kill you.

787
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,934
Now leave this place at sunrise.

788
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,199
You're feeling all right?

789
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:39,705
I'm fine, thanks to you
and the forest spirit.

790
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:28,629
Right.

791
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,809
Yakul, sorry if I worried you.

792
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:50,150
I guess my legs are still pretty weak.

793
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,018
It's so quiet. I wonder where our
friends the little Kodama went.

794
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,652
I can smell the ironworks.

795
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,578
Thanks for showing us the way!

796
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,496
I have another favor to ask.

797
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,042
Will you please give this to San for me?

798
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:58,760
Let's go.

799
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,419
It stinks!
I think my nose is going to fall off.

800
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:37,591
That's what they want.
They're trying to kill our sense of smell.

801
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:38,717
It's that damn woman again.

802
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,728
She knows we're out here.

803
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:52,314
It's a trap, and a stupid one.

804
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:53,523
What?

805
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:57,611
They're trying to lure the boars
out of the forest.

806
01:25:57,861 --> 01:26:00,072
The humans are planning something.

807
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:02,741
Then we have to find Okkoto while
there's still time to stop him!

808
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,201
Or else, they'll all be killed!

809
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:07,079
Okkoto is too stubborn. He won't listen.

810
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:11,249
None of them will.
They may even know it's a trap.

811
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,002
The boars are a proud race.
The last one left alive

812
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:18,715
will still be charging blindly forward.

813
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,514
Why chop the trees down?

814
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:26,932
To make them angry,
which makes them stupid.

815
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,270
Mother, I have to go.

816
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:37,442
Okkoto is blind, I must be his eyes.
You understand?

817
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:39,277
Do as you must.

818
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:43,615
You know, that boy wanted to share his
life with you.

819
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,283
I hate all humans.

820
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,881
From Ashitaka? For me?

821
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:05,429
Pretty.

822
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,056
You two, stay with San.

823
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,684
I must go to the forest spirit.

824
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:12,144
Right. Let's go.

825
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:34,708
The Moro tribe has come
to fight with you.

826
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,835
Where can I find Lord Okkoto?

827
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:40,672
Good luck, my friend!

828
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:07,759
It's coming from Iron Town.

829
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,641
Let's go!

830
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:20,146
Halt! Who goes there?

831
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:21,898
Samurai again!

832
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:24,609
Halt, I said!

833
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,611
Out of the way!

834
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:45,463
What the devil was that?

835
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,343
He stopped it!

836
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:51,428
Great!

837
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,389
Don't waste your arrows. Cease fire!

838
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:19,372
Toki, come and look!

839
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,124
It can't be. It's Ashitakal

840
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:22,500
So it's not a ghost.

841
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,879
- Ashitaka!
- Tokil!

842
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:27,297
Are you all right?

843
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:28,965
We're all right.

844
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:33,261
Lord Asano and his samurai thought
they'd try and ambush us

845
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:35,263
while our men were away.
Thought we'd just roll over.

846
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:37,182
But we showed them!

847
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,391
Where's Lady Eboshi?

848
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:42,646
She took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the forest spirit.

849
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:45,440
We're cut off here, we can't even get a
message to Lady Eboshi.

850
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:48,109
The forest spirit!
That explains the explosions.

851
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:51,279
Sir, I've still got your bow and arrows.

852
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:53,782
Aren't you gonna tell him you've got
his cloak and saddle, too?

853
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:55,825
- I do?
- You're useless!

854
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:57,369
Many thanks, Kohroku!

855
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,204
I'll try and bring you some help.

856
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,538
Can you hold out?

857
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:03,875
Don't worry.
We can always pour hot iron on them.

858
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,962
- Bring back Lady Eboshi!
- And don't take too long!

859
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:16,179
I missed.
They're bringing boats across the river.

860
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:19,891
Go and get Lady Eboshi.
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

861
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:24,020
I'll be back, I promise!

862
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:29,067
We'll be here!

863
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:33,655
Get him! Stop that man!

864
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,750
Looks like they're gonna try
to cut us off. Run, Yakul!

865
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:29,711
Burning animal flesh.

866
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:37,469
Yakul!

867
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:17,926
Stay back!

868
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:31,731
Show me your wound.

869
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:37,320
You'll have to stay here. Wait for me.
I'll come back for you.

870
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:41,116
I said, stay!

871
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:53,878
We're almost there, my friend.

872
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:39,424
Who goes there?

873
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:43,720
My orders are,
no outsiders permitted here.

874
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,139
All right, but I just
came from Iron Town.

875
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,434
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
Tell me where I can find her.

876
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:51,477
The Eboshi woman is not here.

877
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,563
Give me the message,
I'll make sure she gets it.

878
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,441
I must speak with her.
Now, where is she?

879
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,693
It's really you?

880
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,278
You're still alive, lad?

881
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:02,655
It looks like you men
had a worse time than I did.

882
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,741
We've been burying our friends all day.

883
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,117
It was horrible!

884
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:07,994
Iron Town has come under attack.

885
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:09,078
What?

886
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:11,748
The women and the lepers have fallen
back to the inner wall.

887
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:13,458
We haven't got a lot of time.

888
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,043
Those samurai bastards!

889
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,879
Asano must have just been waiting for
us to leave Iron Town.

890
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,631
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

891
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,258
She's off hunting down the forest spirit.

892
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:24,427
Then someone has to stop her.
Call her back!

893
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:27,472
If you're all done, I want you out of here.

894
01:35:27,597 --> 01:35:29,057
The rest of you, keep digging!

895
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,851
- Wait! What about Iron Town?
- That's right! It's our home!

896
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:34,896
What do they expect us to do,
just abandon Iron Town?

897
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,732
You heard the boy,
we haven't a moment to lose!

898
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:39,317
Send a message to Lady Eboshi!

899
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,779
The forest is too big. No messenger
would have a chance of finding her.

900
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:45,782
One of your hunters could find her!
What else are they good for?

901
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,952
Lady Eboshi is just being used by Jigo.

902
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:52,497
When you fought with the boars,
were there any wolves with them?

903
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,832
Did you see San, the wolf-girl?

904
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:58,169
I have no idea. It was pitch black
when the animals came at us.

905
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,505
She was there. I saw her.

906
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:04,092
I was right in the front line,
I saw everything!

907
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:05,260
What happened?

908
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:09,514
I'm not sure. Everything started
happening so fast! It was a nightmare!

909
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:13,226
Jigo's troops put us in front as bait
to lure the boars in.

910
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:15,770
They didn't tell us about live landmines
under our feet

911
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:18,189
or the grenades coming in on top of us.

912
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,577
Where is she? Where's San?

913
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:19,375
Take it easy, I'm trying to get you out!

914
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:26,215
There's a wolf over there. Hurry!

915
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:27,925
Young master, what are you doing?

916
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:33,931
- What's going on?
- Move!

917
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:35,600
What do you think you're doing?

918
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:40,438
I've got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf is gonna help me find her.

919
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:43,441
You're on their side, aren't you, boy?

920
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:45,193
Stand aside!

921
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:46,778
What's more important to all of you?

922
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:49,614
The head of the forest spirit,
or saving your town?

923
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:51,532
Those darts are poison!

924
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:58,956
That's enough now!

925
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:07,590
Come on, let's get this thing off of
them, all together now!

926
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:19,060
Look out!

927
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:31,823
After you've come through the swamp,

928
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,241
take cover by the lake
until we get there.

929
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:34,409
Right!

930
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:36,994
Be careful. Those riflemen
with Milady belong to Jigo.

931
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:40,456
Take these. Where I'm going,
they won't be of any use.

932
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:44,168
You go with them, Yakul.

933
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:45,753
Look after him.

934
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,634
Find San!
That's where we'll find Eboshi.

935
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:07,191
Come on, keep moving, straight ahead.
Today, we finish this.

936
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:11,446
Sir.

937
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:13,197
Have you spotted them?

938
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:15,908
Okkoto is badly wounded,
but he and the wolf-girl

939
01:39:15,992 --> 01:39:18,202
are making their way to the realm of
the forest spirit.

940
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:21,122
So, they're going to beg him
for his help, are they?

941
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:22,248
Keep after them.

942
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:25,293
But stay out of sight, or you'll
frighten the forest spirit away.

943
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,378
Yes, sir. I understand.

944
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:31,466
That was boar's blood painted on his
face, wasn't it?

945
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:34,719
A little trade secret.
Don't want to smell human.

946
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:43,603
We're almost to the pool.

947
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:46,355
Just a little farther, keep going.

948
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:05,249
What was that?

949
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:11,088
Okkoto, there's something wrong!
We have to keep moving.

950
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:13,591
Something is out there.

951
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,886
But what? There's so much blood
in the air, I can't smell it.

952
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:22,892
I should have known it was you!

953
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:24,560
You did this!

954
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:27,104
Because of you, the forest will die!

955
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,607
You're wrong!
We've both been fighting to save it.

956
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:31,609
This is the thanks you give us?

957
01:40:31,776 --> 01:40:33,569
You bring bad things.

958
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:36,489
Bad things coming,
neither human nor animal.

959
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:39,617
What do you mean,
neither human nor animal?

960
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:48,251
- They're coming!
- It's the end for us.

961
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,771
They're warriors.

962
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:13,776
They've come back.

963
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:16,988
My warriors!

964
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:20,825
They have come back to me
from the land of the dead.

965
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:25,913
Forward, my warriors!

966
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,959
Forward to the pool of the forest spirit!

967
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:40,344
No, Lord Okkoto, your warriors
haven't come back to you!

968
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:47,852
Those are humans wearing the skins of
your warriors to hide their scent!

969
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:49,812
It's a trick!

970
01:41:52,189 --> 01:41:54,233
Don't you understand?
It's just a human trick

971
01:41:54,317 --> 01:41:56,652
to get us to lead them
to the forest spirit.

972
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:02,575
Come out, forest spirit!

973
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:04,619
If you are truly master here,

974
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:09,373
give my warriors the power to slay
the humans and be victorious!

975
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,627
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please!
You've got to listen.

976
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,547
San, they're all around us.
Okkoto's done for, leave him!

977
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:19,634
No! I won't let him turn into a demon,
like Nago did.

978
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:23,512
Tell Mother that the humans are setting
a trap for the forest spirit.

979
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:26,349
She'll know what to do.

980
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:32,313
You'll have to hurry, or it could mean
the end of all of us!

981
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:34,065
Go on now.

982
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:54,335
Stay back or you die!

983
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:57,838
And then this whole forest will see
just what you are.

984
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:09,517
Ashitaka?

985
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:26,242
I burn.

986
01:43:26,992 --> 01:43:29,912
There are flames growing inside of me!

987
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:35,584
You must fight it!
Don't let yourself become a demon.

988
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:38,838
Lord Okkoto!

989
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:42,800
What is it?

990
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:47,346
Is it San?

991
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,432
- She's in danger.
- Let's go!

992
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:18,878
Fire!

993
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,890
No! I don't want to become a demon.

994
01:44:31,056 --> 01:44:32,683
Please, stop, Okkoto!

995
01:44:43,736 --> 01:44:45,696
You're too slow. Get on!

996
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:01,337
A wolf!

997
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,299
Eboshi!

998
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,225
You keep going!

999
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,686
Eboshi! I have something to say!

1000
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:18,854
Hold your fire!

1001
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:20,231
What is it you want?

1002
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:22,942
Lord Asano's samurai have attacked
Iron Town!

1003
01:45:23,108 --> 01:45:25,820
The women are outnumbered,
they can't hold them up for long!

1004
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:27,530
Forget about the forest spirit.

1005
01:45:27,696 --> 01:45:29,990
Your men are already
back to Iron Town

1006
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:32,076
but they need you to lead them.

1007
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:34,578
What proof is there this isn't a lie?

1008
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:38,582
Lie? Don't be ridiculous.
What reason do I have to lie?

1009
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:40,709
So it's, "Don't kill the forest gods?"

1010
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:42,711
Now you want us
to kill samurai instead?

1011
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:47,550
No! What I want is for the humans and
the forest to live in peace.

1012
01:45:49,677 --> 01:45:51,387
Whose side is he on anyway?

1013
01:45:51,554 --> 01:45:52,763
Shouldn't we go back?

1014
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:56,183
The women are on their own now.
I've done all I can for them.

1015
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:59,019
They can take care of themselves.

1016
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:02,648
There's the pool Kohroku told us about.

1017
01:46:02,731 --> 01:46:04,358
The creature must be
somewhere nearby.

1018
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:07,570
It's the moment of truth, boys.
So keep your eyes peeled.

1019
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:09,905
Why do we need that woman, sir?

1020
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:13,951
When you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do the dirty work.

1021
01:46:40,477 --> 01:46:42,021
Moro, what happened to you?

1022
01:46:42,187 --> 01:46:45,441
San! It's me, Ashitaka!

1023
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:47,443
San!

1024
01:46:50,946 --> 01:46:52,281
San!

1025
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,160
Ashitaka!

1026
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:04,960
Okkoto! Turned into a demon!

1027
01:47:12,885 --> 01:47:14,303
Leave, boy.

1028
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:17,973
Fight me,
and the forest spirit will never come.

1029
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:25,606
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!

1030
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:31,862
Oh mighty Lord, let me have the girl,
I beg of you.

1031
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,572
Please, let her go.

1032
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:35,449
San, are you there?

1033
01:47:35,616 --> 01:47:37,451
It's me, Ashitaka!

1034
01:47:43,248 --> 01:47:44,416
San!

1035
01:47:52,049 --> 01:47:53,550
Let's put him down!

1036
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,224
Stop him, he'll ruin everything!

1037
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:25,624
San!

1038
01:48:28,043 --> 01:48:29,044
San!

1039
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:32,965
Ashitaka!

1040
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:38,971
San!

1041
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,556
Ashitaka!

1042
01:48:48,313 --> 01:48:50,482
Here I was,
saving the last of my strength

1043
01:48:50,649 --> 01:48:52,943
to bite off that damn woman's head.
But I must save San.

1044
01:48:54,945 --> 01:48:57,573
Close ranks! Use your grenades!

1045
01:49:13,922 --> 01:49:18,510
Don't touch him. He's no longer a god.

1046
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:29,813
You can't even speak, can you?

1047
01:49:31,065 --> 01:49:34,026
Well done, man. Now fall back and get
the wounded out of here.

1048
01:49:34,193 --> 01:49:35,611
Go on.

1049
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:39,364
What a revolting spectacle.

1050
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,041
It's him.

1051
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:04,389
Give me back my daughter, demon!

1052
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:26,912
Ashitaka.

1053
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:29,414
Can you save the girl you love?

1054
01:50:39,675 --> 01:50:41,260
The forest spirit!

1055
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:53,689
Eboshi, hold your fire!

1056
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,120
Eboshi!

1057
01:51:08,495 --> 01:51:11,415
Your enemy is not the forest spirit.

1058
01:51:11,874 --> 01:51:13,250
But that should have killed it!

1059
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:15,085
He's a god,
it will take more than one shot.

1060
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,263
San!

1061
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:36,940
Don't die!

1062
01:52:04,176 --> 01:52:07,304
I don't get it! The great forest
spirit took their lives away.

1063
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:29,451
Quick! He's starting to change.

1064
01:52:29,618 --> 01:52:31,411
Now watch closely, everyone.

1065
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:33,914
I'm going to show you how to kill a god.

1066
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:36,667
A god of life and death.

1067
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:39,419
The trick is not to fear him.

1068
01:52:55,978 --> 01:52:57,729
No, stop!

1069
01:53:00,232 --> 01:53:01,692
Eboshi!

1070
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:16,498
You will die!

1071
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:28,677
She did it! Quickly, go get the head!

1072
01:54:07,632 --> 01:54:10,719
Quick, Jigo! Bring me that box of yours.

1073
01:54:11,011 --> 01:54:13,096
The porters are all dead.

1074
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:14,598
Hurry, hurry!

1075
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,726
Be careful not to touch the spirit's body.

1076
01:54:17,893 --> 01:54:19,686
It will suck the life out of you!

1077
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:25,901
Here it is. One head, as promised!

1078
01:54:27,486 --> 01:54:28,487
Watch out!

1079
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:35,619
Milady!

1080
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:38,663
I told you a wolf's head can still bite.

1081
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:39,873
Come on!

1082
01:54:40,499 --> 01:54:42,250
We've got to get out of here. Hurry!

1083
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:43,919
It's coming, sir!

1084
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:48,507
Run!

1085
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:06,650
Gonza, we've got to get to the island!

1086
01:55:06,733 --> 01:55:08,235
Island? I can't swim!

1087
01:55:08,318 --> 01:55:09,653
Then walk along the bottom.

1088
01:55:37,973 --> 01:55:39,808
Give her to me. I'll cut her throat!

1089
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:43,520
Your clan has been avenged.
Your mother saw to that.

1090
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,398
- Lady Eboshi!
- Help me.

1091
01:55:50,152 --> 01:55:52,154
Don't waste your sympathy.

1092
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:55,740
I promised Toki that I'd bring you back
to Iron Town.

1093
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,914
He's searching for his head.

1094
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:04,332
We can't stay here.

1095
01:56:04,499 --> 01:56:06,960
San! You have got to help us.

1096
01:56:07,127 --> 01:56:09,963
No!
You're on their side, you always were!

1097
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:11,965
Take that damned woman
and just go away!

1098
01:56:14,009 --> 01:56:14,968
San.

1099
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:17,179
Never! I hate all of you, humans!

1100
01:56:18,138 --> 01:56:21,641
Yes, I'm human, San. But so are you.

1101
01:56:22,058 --> 01:56:24,686
Stop it! I'm a wolf, you hear?

1102
01:56:25,562 --> 01:56:27,772
- San.
- Stay back!

1103
01:56:33,153 --> 01:56:36,323
I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.

1104
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:48,043
It's over. Everything is over.
The forest is dead.

1105
01:56:56,927 --> 01:57:00,222
Nothing is over.
The two of us are still alive.

1106
01:57:00,388 --> 01:57:01,598
Now, will you help me, San?

1107
01:57:28,124 --> 01:57:29,626
Help us! Come back!

1108
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:31,920
A little crisis and they panic.

1109
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:37,634
What are you doing? This way!

1110
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:44,808
Look! The head is moving.

1111
01:57:47,644 --> 01:57:49,688
It's calling him to us!

1112
01:58:31,813 --> 01:58:34,107
There you go, Toki.

1113
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:35,191
Thanks.

1114
01:58:35,775 --> 01:58:37,193
It's awfully quiet.

1115
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,987
Asano is waiting for sunrise.

1116
01:58:40,155 --> 01:58:42,866
I wonder if that young man
ever found Lady Eboshi.

1117
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:45,243
Don't worry about him,
he found her all right!

1118
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:48,163
They'll be marching
over that hill any minute now.

1119
01:58:50,206 --> 01:58:53,001
Big dope! Don't ask me why I love him.

1120
01:58:53,168 --> 01:58:54,502
Hey, Kohroku!

1121
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:57,631
Let him sleep, Toki. While he can.

1122
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:08,767
What's that?

1123
01:59:08,933 --> 01:59:10,518
I don't like it.

1124
01:59:22,906 --> 01:59:24,240
It's the Nightwalker!

1125
01:59:38,338 --> 01:59:40,799
Everybody, hold your positions!

1126
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:43,968
- It's coming right at us!
- Run! We gotta go!

1127
01:59:44,344 --> 01:59:48,473
No! We promised Lady Eboshi
we would defend Iron Town.

1128
01:59:54,562 --> 01:59:56,564
Look, over there! He's come back!

1129
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:03,029
Get everyone out!

1130
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:06,574
The great spirit's head has been cut
off, and he wants it back!

1131
02:00:06,908 --> 02:00:09,327
If that black ooze touches you,
you're dead!

1132
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:12,497
Run for the lake,
the water will slow it down.

1133
02:00:12,872 --> 02:00:16,167
Lady Eboshi and the men are on their
way from the other side.

1134
02:00:16,334 --> 02:00:19,796
I'm going to try to return his head
before he kills us all.

1135
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:21,256
Hurry!

1136
02:00:21,423 --> 02:00:22,882
It's too fast!

1137
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:24,634
It will kill us all!

1138
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:26,302
That's enough!

1139
02:00:26,594 --> 02:00:28,972
Get everyone down to the lake
and stay calm.

1140
02:00:29,139 --> 02:00:30,932
We can carry the sick and the wounded.

1141
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,485
Not that way! Stop!

1142
02:00:59,836 --> 02:01:00,837
There it goes.

1143
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:08,595
We're done for.
Once the forge burns, that's it.

1144
02:01:08,762 --> 02:01:09,929
That will be the end of Iron Town.

1145
02:01:10,305 --> 02:01:14,434
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow. Now let's go!

1146
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:33,703
There they are!

1147
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:47,300
Go!

1148
02:01:47,967 --> 02:01:49,552
Stop right there.

1149
02:01:51,054 --> 02:01:53,556
You're both alive. How nice.

1150
02:01:53,723 --> 02:01:55,391
I'm giving the creature back its head.

1151
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:57,101
Put the box down and back away.

1152
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:59,729
Give the head back now?
Come on, boy, don't be silly.

1153
02:01:59,896 --> 02:02:01,523
Now, when the sun is
about to come up?

1154
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:05,151
Look, he's a brainless, swollen,
life-sucking god of death.

1155
02:02:05,235 --> 02:02:07,654
But at sunrise,
he'll vanish like a bad dream.

1156
02:02:07,737 --> 02:02:09,989
Sir, it's coming.
We've got to get out of here!

1157
02:02:10,073 --> 02:02:13,159
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

1158
02:02:13,243 --> 02:02:14,994
But I might actually get it.

1159
02:02:15,245 --> 02:02:16,871
Don't force me to kill you.

1160
02:02:17,205 --> 02:02:20,750
You make it sound so very easy.
You really ought to

1161
02:02:20,917 --> 02:02:22,502
relax!

1162
02:02:28,258 --> 02:02:30,051
Get going!

1163
02:02:49,112 --> 02:02:50,572
Ashitaka!

1164
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:51,781
I got it!

1165
02:02:58,371 --> 02:02:59,664
This is bad.

1166
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:04,460
Master, we're surrounded!

1167
02:03:04,794 --> 02:03:07,630
- Come on, sun! Rise!
- Open the box!

1168
02:03:07,797 --> 02:03:09,841
Don't you see? It's too late for that now.

1169
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:12,552
Why are you wasting
your breath talking to him?

1170
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:14,971
Human hands must return it.

1171
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:18,850
Don't say I didn't warn you!

1172
02:03:33,281 --> 02:03:35,283
Forest spirit!

1173
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:37,869
I give you back your head!

1174
02:03:37,952 --> 02:03:40,830
Take it, and be at peace!

1175
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:52,717
Well, that got its attention all right.

1176
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:25,124
I think it's over.

1177
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:26,417
Look, it's the men!

1178
02:04:29,212 --> 02:04:33,007
I can't believe we made it! I never
thought I'd live to see home again.

1179
02:04:39,555 --> 02:04:40,640
Milady!

1180
02:04:41,224 --> 02:04:42,934
Be careful,
Her Ladyship has been injured.

1181
02:05:11,087 --> 02:05:13,589
Look! It's falling on Iron Town.

1182
02:05:19,095 --> 02:05:21,556
Hang on tight, everybody! Don't let go!

1183
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:32,168
I didn't know the forest spirit made
the flowers grow.

1184
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:05,326
San! Look!

1185
02:07:35,481 --> 02:07:38,901
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest anymore.

1186
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:41,487
The great forest spirit is dead now.

1187
02:07:41,821 --> 02:07:43,656
Never. He's life itself.

1188
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:48,327
He's not dead. He's here right now,
trying to tell us something.

1189
02:07:48,411 --> 02:07:50,580
That it's time for both of us to live.

1190
02:07:59,046 --> 02:08:00,464
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me.

1191
02:08:00,548 --> 02:08:02,925
But I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

1192
02:08:03,009 --> 02:08:04,177
I understand.

1193
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:07,013
You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Iron Town.

1194
02:08:07,889 --> 02:08:09,015
I'll always be near.

1195
02:08:09,849 --> 02:08:13,102
Yakul and I will come and visit you
whenever we can, all right?

1196
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:28,784
Amazing. The wolves and that crazy
little wolf-girl helped save us all.

1197
02:08:29,035 --> 02:08:32,788
Ashitaka! Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

1198
02:08:33,039 --> 02:08:35,124
We're going to start all over again.

1199
02:08:35,291 --> 02:08:37,460
This time, we'll build a better town.

1200
02:08:38,044 --> 02:08:41,714
Well, I give up.
You can't win against fools.
