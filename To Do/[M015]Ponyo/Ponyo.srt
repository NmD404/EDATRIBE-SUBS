A goldfish!

00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,811

A boy! This is very bad.

43
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,637
Is it already dead?

44
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,314
You are alive!

Look, Mom, I found a goldfish!

48
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,542

- It was right down by the rocks.

00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:54,005
- Yeah?
- [metal squeaking]

50
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,135

but we don't use weedkiller
around here.

54
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,285
Hm? What? This is not weedkiller.

55
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,204
This is the purest ocean water,

56
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,664
and it keeps me
from drying out on land.

57
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,875
Whatever.
As long as it's not weedkiller.

58
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,044
- Excuse us.
- [man] Please wait.

59
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,009
Uh-oh.

60
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,345

[engine revving]

62
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,391
Wow. That guy was a freak show.

63
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,186
But don't you call people "freak show."
We never judge others by their looks.

64
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,771
I know, Mom. I don't.

65
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,732
- Oh. Another experiment for school?
- Mm-hm.

66
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,859
Your teacher doesn't really like
show and tell.

67
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,486
I think it'll be fine.

68
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,530
Don't worry, I'll take good care of you.

69
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,615
Huh! She sure is pretty.

70
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,957
There's a ship headed for dry dock.

71
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,627
Hurry up. Eat your breakfast.

72
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,548
I wonder if she would eat this.

73
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,758
[Sosuke] Want some?

74
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,595
Hey! My cut is all gone!

75
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,143
Mom, I think I'll call her Ponyo.

76
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,270
- Mmm?
- She came to me.

77
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,105
She might be magic.

78
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,859
[Sosuke] I saved her.
She's my responsibility now.

79
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,495
Want ham instead?

80
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,888
Mom, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.

81
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,598
So she thinks she's human?

82
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,935
Ouch!

83
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,651
[grunts]

00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,664
<i>Whoa! Turn!</i>

85
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,960
Humans are disgusting!

86
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,879
Come on, Lisa, hurry!

87
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,933
[man] All this waste, filth.

88
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,770
[Lisa] Morning, Shima-san!

89
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,445
Ponyo, look. You can see our house.

90
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,844
- Ask about the fish.
- I will.

91
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,805
- Love you, Sosuke.
- [Sosuke] Goodbye.

92
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,474
Morning! Seems like I'm always late.

93
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,810
- Can you get me another wheelchair?
- [Lisa] Sure.

94
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,828
- Good morning, Sosuke.
- Excuse me.

95
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,873
- I'm in a big hurry, Yoshie.
- Is that so?

96
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,293
- And me, Sosuke?
- Not now, Toki. I'm concentrating.

97
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,377
Ah...

98
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,883
[engine starts]

99
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,761
Maybe the teacher will get mad.

100
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,764
I got it.

101
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,646
You'll be safe here, Ponyo.
I'll be back soon.

102
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,277
Hm. I wonder if there are
any cats around here.

103
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,582
That should do it, Ponyo.
Stay put. I'll be right back.

104
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,968
- See you later.
- Hello there, Toshi.

105
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,596
[woman] I'll call if her cough
gets worse, but she looks fine.

106
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,224
- You good, little sweetie?
- Oh, thank you. Good.

107
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,310
- Bye-bye.
- Good morning, sensei.

108
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,522
- [woman] Good morning, Sosuke.
- [woman 2] Hi, Sosuke.

109
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,612
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko!

110
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,114
Look at me!
My mother made me a new dress.

111
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,200
- Isn't it pretty?
- Hm...

112
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,410
Hey, Sosuke, let's go play.

113
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,287
Can't now. I'm busy.

114
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,164
You're not busy. You're five.

115
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,960
- I am too! I have a job.
- You're so weird.

116
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,337
Yeah. Hm!

117
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,892
Oh!

118
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,854
Ponyo?

119
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,858
Ponyo!

120
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,364
[sniffling]

121
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,826
- [girl] Sosuke!
- [gasps]

122
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,328
- Oh, Kumiko.
- What is that?

123
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,872
There are rules about
bringing things to school for a reason.

124
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,000
I know. This isn't school.

125
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,460
These bushes are on
the senior center property.

126
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,837
Let me see!

127
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,214
Oh, a goldfish?

128
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,883
She's not just a goldfish. She's Ponyo.

129
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,261
Ponyo? Let's see!

130
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,013
[Sosuke] OK, but don't tell she's here.

131
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,933
- [Kumiko] I won't.
- The rules are: look but don't touch.

132
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,102
Look at her. Isn't she pretty?

133
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,821
That's the most boring goldfish
I've ever seen in my entire life.

134
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,656
[screaming]

135
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,617
[gasps]

136
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,205
[sobbing]

137
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,511
That one was Kumiko's fault.

138
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,348
You should never judge others
by their looks.

139
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,895
Let's get you some more water.

140
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,192
[straining]

141
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,085
Ponyo!

142
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,134
Ah! [laughs] That was my fault.

143
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,598
[giggling]

144
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,809
[Yoshie] There it comes again.

145
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,062
I hear old Sosuke's voice.

146
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,274
But I know our boy
is in school right now.

147
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,569
[laughs] So it must be only in my head.

148
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,863
Look, Yoshie. I'm right over here.

149
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,784
Oh, that's a relief.

150
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,245
[Yoshie] I haven't
lost my mind quite yet.

151
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,497
Are you ready to see my big surprise?

152
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,458
- What is it?
- I'll show you.

153
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,086
But first, guess what color she is.

154
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,590
- Hm... She... She's red!
- Red!

155
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,300
That's right!

156
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,722
- How did you both guess that?
- [Noriko] Come on, show us!

157
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,473
OK.

158
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,979
- Well, look!
- Very pretty.

159
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,356
Her name is Ponyo. She likes to eat ham.

160
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,984
- And she can do magic!
- [Yoshie gasps]

161
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,444
I got a cut on my thumb,

162
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,488
and it went away
because she licked it.

163
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,490
[both] Oh!

164
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:45,411
Maybe she could use some of her magic
to fix my hips and back.

165
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,498
I'd let a fish lick me
if it'd get me out of this wheelchair.

166
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,626
Well, I don't know
about all that licking.

167
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,046
- I'd have to ask Ponyo...
- Let me have a look in that green pail.

168
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,423
Yes, Toki-san.

169
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,970
[shrieking] It has a real face on it!

170
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,558
Hurry up! Put it back in the ocean.
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?

171
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,644
Oh, you. It's always tsunami,
day and night.

172
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,523
Fish with faces
who come out of the sea cause tsunamis.

173
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,650
[Toki] That's what they always say.

174
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,694
[shrieking]

175
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,864
Tsunami! Tsunami! It's here!

176
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:27,369
Ah! Oh! Sosuke, put her back
in the ocean where she belongs!

177
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,705
[gasps]

178
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,708
Toki, what's the matter?

179
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,085
I'm soaking wet. Look at my clothes!

180
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,762
[Lisa shouting] Sosuke!

181
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,519
Sosuke!

182
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,981
Sosuke!

183
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,527
Sosuke!

184
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,321
Come back here and apologize!

185
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,865
[sighs]

186
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:15,084
Don't worry, Ponyo.
No matter what, I will protect you.

187
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,919
[Sosuke] I promise.

188
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,295
Sosuke!

189
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,923
[gasps]

190
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,425
Sosuke!

191
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,053
[gasping, laughing]

192
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,806
Ponyo!

193
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,561
Ponyo. Sosuke.

194
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:38,190
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

195
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,573
I will love you, too.

196
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:50,286
- Ponyo loves Sosuke!
- [laughing]

197
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,182
[gasps]

198
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,895
[waves moaning]

199
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,069
Ponyo?

200
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,243
Ponyo!

201
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,289
Ponyo! Ponyo!

202
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,373
Ponyo!

203
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,086
Ah! Ponyo! Ponyo!

204
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,590
- [Sosuke shouting] Ponyo!
- Sosuke!

205
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,178
[Sosuke] Ponyo! Ponyo!

206
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,013
Ponyo!

207
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,015
Ponyo!

208
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,060
Ponyo!

209
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,605
[Sosuke sobbing]

210
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,779
[continues sobbing]

211
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,741
Listen, Sosuke, you know,
this could be for the best.

212
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,202
I know you tried, but Ponyo is a fish.

213
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,914
[Lisa] She wasn't meant to live
in a bucket. The ocean is home to her.

214
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,249
Anyway, let's get home.

215
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,628
Hopefully, that spritzing weirdo
is gone. Whoo!

216
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,630
Can I have a lick?

217
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,591
Hurry, it's starting to melt.

218
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,013
Dad's favorite. Me, too!

219
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,438
I'm really sorry, Sosuke.
But Dad is finally coming home tonight.

220
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,357
[Lisa] You can tell him all about Ponyo.

221
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,888
- No more ocean today, OK?
- [Sosuke] Mm-hm.

222
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,208
- [window opening]
- [Lisa] Sosuke?

223
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,335
Sosuke? Time to come in now.

224
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,587
Maybe if I leave the pail,

225
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,340
Ponyo will know where we live
when she comes back.

226
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,843
Do that. I think that's a lovely thing
to do for Ponyo.

227
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,762
Mm-hm.

228
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,689
[phone rings]

229
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,692
Sosuke, can you get that?

230
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,195
- It must be your dad.
- [ringing continues]

231
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,033
Hello? Yep. She's fine.

232
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,452
- [Sosuke] Are you at the dock?
- [man] I caught a second run,

233
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,538
so I have to take lit.
! won't be home tonight.

234
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,207
I'll signal you when we pass.
Can you help me out with Mom?

235
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,043
No, you should tell her.

236
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,713
[Lisa] Hi, honey. Uh-huh.

237
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,466
What?! Too many in a row, Koichi!

238
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,884
Let someone else take it!

239
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,096
Go ahead, abandon your wife
and child up here on a cliff all alone.

240
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,098
Oh, jerk!

241
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,397
Uh! Come on, Sosuke.
Let's get out of here.

242
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,316
What if Ponyo comes back?

243
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,319
Mm!

244
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,200
Ah!

245
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,639
There's Dad. Turn off the lights, Mom.

246
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,517
- Don't you wanna signal him?
- Mm-mm.

247
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,584
Hey, my son is working
the signal all by himself!

248
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,795
- Can you believe that?
- Your wife must be pretty mad.

249
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,799
[Sosuke] S... O... R...

250
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,260
...R... Y.

251
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:44,306
- Dad says he's very sorry.
- B-U-G...

252
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,725
- [Lisa] O-F-F.
- B...

253
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:51,230
[Lisa] B-U-G O-F-F.
B-U-G O-F-F.

254
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,529
Mom, Dad says he loves you.

255
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:03,116
[Sosuke] He says, "Lots and lots."

256
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,590
Wow! Nice, Dad!

257
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,500
[Sosuke] Don't cry, Mom.

258
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,129
I know Dad
breaks his promises sometimes.

259
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,715
But he does his best for us.

260
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,676
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.

261
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,678
Then I lost her.

262
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,474
I wonder if she's crying now.

263
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,564
- Ah!
- You are so good! Mmm!

264
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,524
[both laughing]

265
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,068
<i>3 Happy as can be</i>

266
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,864
- Mm! Ah!
- Don't you worry, Sosuke.

267
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,784
You did your best
and Ponyo will be just fine.

268
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,953
- OK.
- [chuckles]

269
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,331
[Lisa] I say we start with dessert
and go backwards!

270
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,041
It's been a backwards kind of day.

271
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,678
[man] It's not your fault.

272
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,098
I exposed you to the magic
and you're too young to understand.

273
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:54,227
I have to keep the sea in balance.
It's a great responsibility.

274
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,480
You must promise me something:

275
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,232
You will never go back
to the surface. Yes?

276
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,361
Come on, now. Eat, Brunhilde.

277
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,030
I want ham!

278
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,744
Ham! You ate their food.
What else did you do?

279
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,454
Did you taste blood, Brunhilde?

280
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,124
My name is not Brunhilde. It's Ponyo.

281
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,921
- Ponyo?
- Ponyo! Ponyo loves Sosuke!

282
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,924
I will be a human, too!

283
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,302
Human? What do you know
about humans, Brunhilde?

284
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,762
They spoil the sea.

285
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,307
[man] They treat your home
like their empty, black souls.

286
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:36,061
I was once, long ago, a human myself.

287
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,313
I had to leave that all behind
to serve the Earth.

288
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,483
Hands! I want hands!

289
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,111
I don't want these flippers anymore!

290
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:48,031
[Ponyo] I want feet, like Sosuke!

291
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:52,077
- That's enough!
- [straining]

292
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,540
[squeaking]

293
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,501
[straining] Ah!

294
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,503
Oh!

295
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,505
[all squeaking]

296
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,675
[straining]

297
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,347
I made hands! I made feet, too! Ha!

298
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,016
- Yes!
- What? No, no!

299
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,519
Don't tell me.
You have tasted human blood!

300
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,229
I'm going to Sosuke!

301
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,231
Enough!
You're making a terrible mistake!

302
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,025
Don't do it! Stop it. Stop it!
Stop changing now.

303
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,737
Revert. Revert. Revert! Revert!

304
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,198
- [moaning]
- Revert!

305
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:34,035
[straining] Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it!

306
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,206
- Don't change!
- [Ponyo straining]

307
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,376
- [Ponyo grunting]
- I need more power!

308
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,922
[Ponyo] Let me out! Let me out!

309
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,926
[grunting] Let me out!

310
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,888
I want to see Sosuke! Let me go!

311
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,974
Let me out!

312
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,810
You can't be human and magic
at the same time, sweetheart.

313
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,897
Be still, be still,
be still, be still, be still.

314
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,815
[all chattering]

315
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,991
[sighs] She's already so powerful.

316
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,993
Just like her mother.

317
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,668
[man] If you could only remain
innocent and pure forever.

318
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,216
[all chattering, squeaking]

319
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,526
I don't have the power
to hold her for very long.

320
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,903
I need to ask for her mother's help now.

321
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,029
...What?

322
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,915
Huh! They're headed for my elixirs.

323
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,459
Shoo! Shoo!
Get out of here! Shoo!

324
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,962
That was too close.

325
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,257
I must be careful not to upset
the balance of nature.

326
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,384
Calm. I must remain calm.

327
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,387
When [ think of leaving her again,
my heart won't stop pounding.

328
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,764
Right, then. Focus on work.

329
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,558
This batch should be ready.

330
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,485
At least there aren't leaks down here.

331
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,243
This door still doesn't fit right.

332
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,540
I'll fix that next.

333
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,008
If even one living creature
got in here...

334
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,701
Ah, yes.
I can feel the power of the ocean

335
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,704
in the furthest reaches of my DNA.

336
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,581
When this well is full,

337
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,626
then the age of the ocean
will begin again.

338
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,712
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian age.

339
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,174
An end to the era
of those abominable humans.

340
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,847
[man grunting] This cursed door!

341
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,678
[squeaking]

342
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,062
[all squeaking, chattering]

343
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,409
[all chattering]

344
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,718
[kissing]

345
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,974
Teeth!

346
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,184
[all chattering]

347
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,401
Let's find Sosuke!

348
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,628
[creaking]

349
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,935
[all shouting]

350
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,991
I'm free!

351
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,388
- Waterspout!
- Captain, look over there!

352
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:57,520
- [man] It must be a tsunami!
- [Koichi] Turn the ship into the wave!

353
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,732
Look! What is that?

354
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,781
[man] Captain, all our instruments
just went dead!

355
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,914
It's a little girl.
Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.

356
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,264
- Thanks again.
- Sure. See you tomorrow.

357
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,849
It's raining so hard, Sosuke.

358
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,893
I'll call your mother
and have her pick you up.

359
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,938
That's all right. I'll take
the shortcut. Goodbye, sensei.

360
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:44,150
Bye, Sosuke. Be careful out there.

361
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,277
Sosuke, I'm sorry.

362
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,239
The door didn't open, right?
The power just went out.

363
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,157
- Everything OK at school?
- Mm-hm.

364
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,744
Lisa, if your shift's over,
you can go home.

365
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,121
Sure you don't need my help?

366
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,915
[woman] Don't worry. We'll be fine.

367
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,876
A little rain storm
keeps the seniors entertained.

368
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,255
If I were you, I'd get out of here
while you still can.

369
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,799
Wait here, sweetie. I'll be right back.

370
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,426
OK.

371
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,855
Hi, Yoshie.

372
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,566
Oh, Sosuke. Is that you?

373
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,651
It's so dark I can barely see.

374
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,571
Here, Yoshie. I made this for you.

375
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,492
Oh! What do we have here?

376
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,286
There's one for you, too, Noriko.

377
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,079
Thank you, Sosuke.

378
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:23,958
I can't see a thing.
I don't know why we're still here.

379
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:29,380
It's just a little rain.
I wanna go back to my own house.

380
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,218
There we go. That's more like it.

381
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,138
Let's see. Your goldfish!

382
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,476
I bet the lights came back on
because Sosuke's here.

383
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,645
They're now calling the bizarre event
a micro-typhoon.

384
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,398
Ship... [static]

385
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,193
Ah, this stupid TV.

386
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,820
Nobody understands weather anymore.

387
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,448
Might as well look at shadows
and listen to crickets.

388
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,492
You should take your mother home now.

389
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,703
With our lucky goldfish
to keep us company,

390
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,664
- we'll be just fine.
- OK.

391
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:07,043
[man on TV] ...landslides,
flooding and tidal surges.

392
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,004
People trying to evacuate...

393
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,925
This is for you, Toki.

394
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,515
I can't tell. What is it? It's wrinkled.

395
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,599
It goes like this.

396
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,354
I got it. It's a grasshopper.

397
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,439
No, it's the Koganei Maru.

398
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,526
That's the name of your father's ship,
isn't it, Sosuke?

399
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,654
- Mm-hm.
- Now, it looks like a party hat.

400
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,198
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.

401
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,908
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.

402
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:43,371
OK. Ladies, good evening.

403
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,082
[both] Good evening, Mr. Sosuke.

404
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,751
Be careful the wind
doesn't blow you away.

405
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,504
Let's go. Slide in.

406
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,136
They said the phones are out, too.

407
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,494
The ocean looks all puffed up.

408
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,126
You think the storm
could sink the ships?

409
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,920
No. Ships can handle a storm.
They go out to sea.

410
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,922
That's what your father's doing
right now.

411
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,010
[yelping]

412
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,769
I saw a fish! Did you see that, Mom?

413
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,104
Put your seatbelt on!

414
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,117
Hold on, Lisa! You can't cross here!

415
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,953
We've just gotten word.
They're gonna evacuate this side.

416
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,455
It's not mandatory.

417
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,332
There are some people
up at the senior center.

418
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,583
You should get them out.

419
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,501
They're fine.
They're on the leeward side.

420
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,629
You need to go back
and seek shelter there.

421
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,090
OK. But right now, I need to get home.

422
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,843
- Well, you can't cross here.
- Take the mountain road.

423
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,723
- Hold on, kiddo.
- Mm!

424
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,601
No! Stop! Don't do it!

425
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,810
Watch out! Here it comes!

426
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,569
Lisa, you gotta get out of here!

427
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,540
- [Lisa] Hold on.
- [engine revving]

428
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,028
The fish are following us now!

429
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,613
[Lisa] Turn around. Sit down.

430
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,499
Ah!

431
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,583
Ah!

432
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:38,004
Try to hang on to something!

433
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,387
[yelling]

434
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,932
That wave is just after us.

435
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,487
- Mom, the little girl just fell in!
- What?

436
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,322
She was running on a fish and she fell!

437
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,079
Where?

438
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,464
I've never seen the ocean like this.

439
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,633
Sosuke, where did you see
a little girl?

440
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,469
She was out there,
running on top of a huge fish!

441
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,762
[Lisa] That's impossible.

442
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,726
Sosuke, we have to go!

443
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,814
[screaming]

444
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,402
[grunting]

445
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,828
It's OK.
There was no little girl out there.

446
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,079
We're almost home.

447
00:48:58,936 --> 00:48:59,937
[gasps]

448
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,386
There is a little girl. Come over here!

449
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,555
We'll help you! Come here!

450
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,764
Stay there, Sosuke.

451
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,977
[gasping]

452
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,648
What?

453
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,126
Sosuke, do you know her?

454
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,902
- Ponyo?
- Mm-hm! It's me, Ponyo!

455
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,447
- It is you!
- [laughs]

456
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:38,077
Mom! Ponyo came back
and she's a little girl now!

457
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,912
Who?

458
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,211
[all shouting, laughing]

459
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,631
I found Sosuke!

460
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:14,655
All right. Sosuke, Ponyo,
life is mysterious and amazing.

461
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,448
But we have work to do now.

462
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,159
And I need both of you to stay calm.

463
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,911
Me, too.

464
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,542
You can take off
your rain coat now, Sosuke.

465
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,587
I've got a job for you, Ponyo.
Will you hold the light?

466
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,677
- Huh?
- Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.

467
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,650
- [turns on radio]
- [flipping stations]

468
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,068
[turns off radio]

469
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,363
- Here, this way!
- [laughs]

470
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,325
- [laughs]
- Smells like you in here!

471
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,330
- Ow!
- Ponyo!

472
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,169
- Oof!
- There, got ya.

473
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,338
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.

474
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:16,008
[mumbling]

475
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,386
Look at that pretty red hair.
It's almost dry.

476
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,472
- Huh!
- Huh?

477
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,098
[Lisa] And your clothes are dry.

478
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,060
That's because Ponyo was a fish, Mom.

479
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:30,439
- Water can't make her wet.
- Mm-hm.

480
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,108
I really like this thing.

481
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,612
So let's calm ourselves down
with a hot drink.

482
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,490
Ponyo, will you hold the light for me?

483
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,575
- [Ponyo] Coming!
- OK.

484
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,578
- Who wants to bet the water is working?
- I do!

485
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,829
I do!

486
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,752
- Water!
- Water! [laughs]

487
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,630
We have our own water tank
outside in the yard.

488
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,133
And who thinks the stove will light?

489
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,886
And light! Al right.

490
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,348
- All right!
- We have our own propane tank.

491
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,479
- OK. Let's all sit at the table.
- [both] OK!

492
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,315
Ponyo, the table's over here.

493
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,197
Now, sit down like this.

494
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,035
Now, put your stuff down.

495
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:30,833
- You need to use your hands.
- No, I'll use feet!

496
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,546
Look at that!

497
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,175
Uh... what are you guys doing?

498
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:43,345
Look at her feet.
They're just like hands.

499
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,075
[Lisa] Here you go.

500
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,910
It's hot.

501
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,625
This is the best.

502
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,643
Mm!

503
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,607
[blowing]

504
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:42,738
[spitting]

505
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,656
[chuckles]

506
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,912
[gulping]

507
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,585
[hiccups]

508
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,462
Hm...

509
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,176
[sighs] That hit the spot.

510
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,221
So, what would the two of you
like to do now?

511
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,181
Ponyo wants ham!

512
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,518
All she thinks about is ham, Mom.

513
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,270
I better make some dinner then.

514
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,315
First, we should start the generator
so we can call Koichi.

515
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,403
That's my dad. We need power
to talk to him on the radio.

516
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,532
He's out at sea right now,
but he'll be fine.

517
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,576
- Is he an evil wizard?
- No, of course not.

518
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,079
[Sosuke] He's the captain of a ship.

519
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,540
So, Ponyo, what's your dad like?

520
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:38,168
He hates humans!
He keeps me in a bubble!

521
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,754
- Huh?
- So I swam away from home.

522
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,130
Huh?

523
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,132
So, what's your mother like then?

524
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:47,928
She's big and beautiful!

525
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:52,057
- But she can be very scary.
- Just like my mom.

526
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,601
[laughing]

527
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,897
Ponyo, over here, please.

528
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:07,447
[Lisa grunting]

529
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,997
Mm! [sighs]

530
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,791
Looks like something must have
gone wrong with the fuel line.

531
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:21,128
- Maybe it's clogged.
- It's clogged.

532
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,380
It's clogged over there.

533
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,973
[straining, bell chimes]

534
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:36,226
- [gasps]
- [engine starts]

535
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,442
- It's on!
- It's light now! Yeah!

536
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,694
Ponyo, you're amazing.

537
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:06,173
- Antenna, antenna!
- Hey, Mom.

538
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,258
Did all the ships out there sink?

539
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:11,970
I don't see any lights out there.

540
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:17,976
All right.

541
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,734
[static on radio]

542
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:29,696
[feedback]

543
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,699
- Too loud!
- What's wrong?

544
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:37,287
I can't get any reception.
That's really weird.

545
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:41,708
Transmitting from JA4LL. JA4LL.

546
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,210
[Lisa on radio] Come in, Koichi.

547
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,963
This is Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.

548
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,715
We wanted you to know
that we're all doing fine.

549
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,469
I'm taking care of everyone, Dad!

550
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,762
Ham!

551
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:01,937
[laughs]

552
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,564
Got your noodles all ready?

553
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,400
Be careful. It's really hot.

554
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,417
You have to wait a little bit.

555
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,044
It takes three minutes.

556
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,269
[Lisa] OK, close your eyes.

557
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,646
Keep 'em shut.

558
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,152
- Ponyo, uh! No peeking!
- [gasps]

559
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,032
Get ready to look now.

560
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:59,870
- Abracadabra!
- [shouting]

561
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:03,832
[Ponyo] Mm!

562
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,085
- It's ham!
- Careful, it's hot.

563
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:10,756
Oh! [yelping] Hot, hot, hot!

564
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,470
Mm...

565
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,103
[moaning]

566
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,567
Mom, Ponyo fell asleep.

567
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,993
Do you think Ponyo
came from far, far away?

568
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,120
Yeah, I do.

569
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,555
[Lisa] Look outside. It looks like
the waves have calmed down.

570
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,350
Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.

571
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,768
Do you see that light?

572
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:15,320
It's moving. There must be
somebody still over there.

573
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,447
That's the senior center.

574
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,581
- I don't see it now.
- Did they evacuate?

575
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,792
[Lisa] I'm worried about the seniors.

576
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,088
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, OK?

577
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,600
I've gotta go help them.

578
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,103
I can get there
if I take the mountain road.

579
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,400
Sosuke,
I should go to the senior center.

580
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,734
I'm coming, too.

581
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,029
I'd feel better if you stay up here.

582
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,575
But why can't I come? We'll wake up
Ponyo and take her with us.

583
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,827
I wanna go with you!

584
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:09,749
Sosuke, right now,
our house is a beacon in the storm.

585
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,252
Our light can be seen
by the town and by the ships,

586
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,129
and every place else is dark.

587
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,047
You know I need to help the old people.

588
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,259
So I'm going to leave you
here in charge.

589
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,761
You'll do the right thing. I know it.

590
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,347
[Lisa] You have to be
the man of the house tonight.

591
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,766
Let Ponyo sleep, wait for me.

592
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,436
You're only five,
but you're very smart.

593
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,564
Sometimes, we take a leap. Be brave.

594
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,357
You can do it, and I'll be back.

595
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:36,860
Promise?

596
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,115
- I promise.
- You promised.

597
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,783
I love you, Sosuke.

598
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,430
[orchestral music plays]

599
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:16,316
[snoring]

600
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,050
Captain, I can see the lights
of a city up ahead.

601
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,220
Finally, we can get
our bearings again.

602
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,098
We're some place I've never seen before.

603
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,142
[man] Did the storm blow us to China?

604
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:56,606
What mountains are those?
I have no idea where we are.

605
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:06,324
[Koichi] That is a huge wall of water.

606
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,868
Why is the moon so close?

607
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,540
Hm...

608
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,709
That's no mountain we're looking at.

609
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,544
And that's no town, either.

610
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,337
Those lights are ships.

611
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,182
[Koichi] The moon is so close,

612
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:34,269
its gravity is forcing
the ocean to rise.

613
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,105
- What's going on here?
- [rumbling]

614
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,815
[gasping]

615
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,405
- The engine stopped!
- Try to hold her steady.

616
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,991
<i>- Aral, drop the sea anchor.
- Yes, Sir.</i>

617
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,298
Something's coming this way.

618
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:16,353
[men shouting]

619
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,660
I just saw the Goddess of Mercy!

620
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,037
Ah!

621
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,840
- The engine's working.
- It was her.

622
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:49,094
So you saw her, too?
I thought maybe I was hallucinating.

623
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:52,013
Thank you for protecting us...
[prays indistinctly]

624
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,961
- Higher, higher.
- [moaning]

625
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,259
Huh?!

626
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,851
[gasps] That has a powerful spell on it.

627
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,228
How has she learned
to do something like that?

628
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,664
What? I can't believe it! I No!

629
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:03,585
She's turned into a human!
Whoa! Hold still!

630
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:07,005
- You... What are you doing?
- [giggling sound]

631
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:12,677
- [man] Hold still!
- [squeaking, giggling]

632
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,388
Girls! Girls... Whoa!

633
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,391
[man] Stop, stop! Please!

634
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,852
Stop now! No! Stop! Ah!

635
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,229
[man] Respect your father!

636
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,862
This was serious.
I'm trying to save your sister.

637
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,532
[squeaking]

638
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:39,245
At last, she has finally come.

639
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:20,328
- Fujimoto.
- It's been a long time, my love.

640
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,705
Look at my ocean.

641
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,627
Something has changed.

642
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,256
It's like my ancient Devonian Sea,
full of magic and power.

643
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,967
You're going to be very upset, my dear.

644
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,303
Ponyo got into my elixirs,
and she has tasted human blood.

645
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:42,392
Ponyo? What a lovely name.

646
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,313
Hm.

647
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,315
Of course, it's all my fault, really.

648
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,276
She's become so powerful

649
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,445
that she's opened a hole
in the fabric of reality.

650
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,156
She's too young to understand,
and she wouldn't listen to me.

651
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,827
She's now a little girl.
And she loves a little boy.

652
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,954
And the whole world is out of balance.

653
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:07,500
Please, please, remove the human
in her, or the planet is doomed.

654
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:10,253
Huh? [gasps]

655
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:19,345
Already the Earth
is pulling satellites from the sky.

656
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,015
And the moon pulls the sea closer...

657
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,101
Be calm, dear.

658
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:36,070
Sosuke. The boy's name is Sosuke.

659
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,906
[squeaking]

660
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:43,453
We love your sister,
and we all want her to be happy.

661
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:50,752
Listen, my darling, why don't we
let Ponyo become human for good?

662
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,880
We must test the boy.
If Sosuke's love is true,

663
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,132
Ponyo will be permanently transformed

664
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,217
and the balance of nature
will be restored.

665
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:02,555
But if his love isn't real,
then Ponyo will turn into sea foam.

666
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,768
True. That is where
we all originated, my darling.

667
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,020
The boy is so young, so innocent.

668
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,481
- What does...?
- Shh.

669
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,445
[woman] Let them sleep.

670
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,447
They'll need their rest.

671
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,002
Sosuke!

672
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:38,341
- Sosuke!
- [both grunting]

673
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,762
Ponyo, you OK?

674
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,890
Good morning, Sosuke.

675
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,437
Huh?

676
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:54,232
Look at that. The ocean is at our door.

677
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,424
How come your mom's not here?

678
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:22,844
The water's so high. She must be stuck.

679
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,929
Too bad we don't have a boat.

680
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,434
There's a boat, right there!

681
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,605
- It's a little small.
- No, it's not.

682
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,571
[blowing]

683
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,573
Ah!

684
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,413
Uh! Huh?

685
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,165
Thank you!

686
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,753
Wow! You even made
the candle bigger.

687
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,297
- We can fit!
- This is fantastic.

688
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,966
- Fantastic!
- You take that end, please.

689
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,301
OK!

690
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,181
- Ready?
- Let's go!

691
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,974
[grunts] Whoa!

692
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:13,019
<i>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</i>

693
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,979
Ah!

694
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:24,030
It actually floats!

695
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,032
[laughing]

696
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,326
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.

697
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,661
Now, we have to fill the boiler.

698
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,831
The water gets sucked in
through this pipe.

699
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:36,834
Then it gets heated up
here in this round thing.

700
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,505
[inhaling]

701
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:51,307
[panting, inhales]

702
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,822
[giggling] Well, that worked.

703
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,912
[Ponyo laughing]

704
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,664
Looks like everything's shipshape.

705
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,666
- Shipshape!
- Yep.

706
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,085
- Shipshape! [laughs]
- Shipshape.

707
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,588
Shipshape! Shipshape!
Shipshape! Shipshape!

708
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:23,673
Shipshape!

709
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,363
What's that? [gasps]

710
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,369
- Ow!
- Ow!

711
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,792
- Look at that!
- It's burning.

712
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:03,212
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

713
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,431
- Is it working?
- Hm...

714
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,443
It's working!

715
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,322
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?

716
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,656
- Yep.
- This is a good boat.

717
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:31,741
Mm-hm.

718
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,663
Ah!

719
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,209
- Hey, Sosuke! Look at me!
- Mm-hm.

720
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:45,046
- Hey, this is even more fun!
- Mm-hm.

721
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,673
[laughs] That thing makes my nose hot.

722
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,343
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.

723
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:54,764
- And I'll do the steering, OK?
- Mm-hm. I'm the lookout!

724
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:22,875
There's the road.

725
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,169
That's the road my mom took last night.

726
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,549
- I don't see her anywhere.
- We'll see her.

727
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,969
She promised me she'd come back.

728
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:41,185
Those are ancient fish.
They lived during the Devonian Age.

729
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:44,814
I know that one. It's Bothriocephalus.

730
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,611
- And that one is...
- Dipnorhynchus.

731
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:52,405
Dipnorhynchus!

732
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,199
Wow! That one's really huge!

733
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:58,327
- That's Devonynchus!
- Devonynchus!

734
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,336
[man] Ahoy!

735
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,089
[woman] Ahoy!

736
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,091
- [man] Ahoy...
- Whoa, there's a boat!

737
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,844
[woman] Ahoy!

738
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:18,639
I'm gonna say that.

739
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:20,891
Ahoy!

740
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,103
Ow!

741
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,107
Whoa, that's fast!

742
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,528
- Hey!
- I'm getting the hang of this.

743
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,867
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.

744
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,452
- [spitting]
- [coughing]

745
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:46,125
- Hello, you two.
- Hello.

746
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,128
Hey, that is quite a boat you got there.

747
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,256
I've seen you before.
You're Lisa's little boy, aren't you?

748
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:55,134
He's not a little boy. He's Sosuke!

749
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,719
She's Ponyo.

750
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,847
And I used to be a fish.

751
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,475
Is that right? [giggles]

752
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,351
I like your name, Ponyo. It's cute.

753
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,562
Mm-hm.

754
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,981
By the way, have you seen my mom?

755
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:12,485
Your mother?
Why isn't your mother with you?

756
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,529
- She went to the senior center.
- Wow, way up there?

757
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,448
My baby likes you.

758
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:40,346
[cooing]

759
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:49,021
- [fussing]
- Oh, sweetheart.

760
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,483
[crying]

761
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,030
Oh, is that for us?

762
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,337
Can I have the cup?

763
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,220
Well, thank you. It smells good.

764
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,017
- [crying]
- Wow, that's good soup. Thanks.

765
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:31,272
- My mom made it from scratch.
- The soup's for him!

766
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:35,067
Oh, I'm sorry. He's a little too young.

767
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,278
He can only drink milk at this age.

768
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,988
But I could eat the soup instead,

769
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:41,282
and it would help me
to make milk for him.

770
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,200
Huh?

771
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,786
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.

772
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:50,416
Ponyo, what do you say?
Is it all right if I eat the soup?

773
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,918
- That's fine.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

774
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,672
- [Sosuke] Huh?
- [chanting]

775
01:17:56,755 --> 01:18:00,509
[chanting]

776
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:14,315
People from the town!
It's just like a parade!

777
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:19,236
Ahoy! Are any of you
in need of assistance at this time?

778
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:24,450
We're all good here!
But thanks for checking on us, captain!

779
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,870
[man] We are taking everyone
to the Mountain Peak Hotel!

780
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,706
For your safety,
we request that you follow us!

781
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,459
Aye, aye! Will do!

782
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,962
[Sosuke] Looks like
the whole town is here.

783
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,130
I don't see your mom.

784
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:41,258
- I hope she's OK.
- Ponyo, time for us to cast off.

785
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,384
Hold on a second.

786
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:53,187
- Here, have some milk.
- Oh. Uh...

787
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,313
It's for milk.

788
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:57,149
She already ate all the ham
off those sandwiches.

789
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:00,152
Thank you.
That's very generous of you, Ponyo.

790
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,987
Sosuke, here.

791
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,156
I brought you the biggest candle I have.

792
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,243
Thanks. Ponyo will make it bigger.

793
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:09,954
- See you later.
- Take care.

794
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,122
Be careful.

795
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:19,296
- [crying]
- Oh! What's the matter?

796
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:27,179
[woman] Shh, shh, shh. You have a cold.

797
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,855
[gasps]

798
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,899
[crying]

799
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:44,363
[cooing]

800
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,115
Ponyo!

801
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,788
[Ponyo laughing]

802
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:55,833
- [baby laughs]
- [mother laughs]

803
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,754
[Sosuke] Hey, are you guys OK?

804
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,298
[woman] Hey, Sosuke.

805
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,301
- What are you doing out here?
- Sosuke, where's your mother?

806
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,386
[Sosuke] She went
to the senior center last night!

807
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,679
We're on our way to find her!

808
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:12,016
You know, I still can't believe
Lisa beat that wave.

809
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:15,394
- That's Lisa.
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?

810
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,480
I can't. I'm busy.
I have a job to do now.

811
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:22,151
[man] Check the park.
The seniors should be there by now.

812
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,570
- [man 2] Good luck, kid!
- [woman] You'll find her!

813
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:29,199
We'll send a boat for the seniors
as soon as we drop this group off!

814
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:33,162
- Good luck, captain!
- [chanting]

815
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,230
[cawing]

816
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:23,712
Ponyo, our candle is just about out.

817
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:30,719
We'll be OK.
The fisherman gave me another one.

818
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:34,139
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

819
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,647
Bye-bye.

820
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,900
Here, Ponyo. Can you make this bigger?

821
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,861
All right.

822
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,869
Hey, are you OK?

823
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,746
Hm?

824
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,504
- [Sosuke] Ponyo.
- Hm?

825
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:08,715
[grunts]

826
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,895
Ponyo. Ponyo!

827
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:25,607
[snoring]

828
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:22,164
Oh, good. I can walk from here.

829
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,275
There's the road.

830
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:01,453
[Sosuke grunts]

831
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:04,706
[gasps] It's shrinking!

832
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,042
Ponyo!

833
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,063
Ponyo!

834
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,191
Ponyo, wake up!

835
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:36,071
Sosuke.

836
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:39,908
[yawns]

837
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,120
You scared me.

838
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:46,248
Don't turn into a fish again.
I'd miss you.

839
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,256
[gasps]

840
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:02,097
My mom's car! Ponyo, come on!
She might be there!

841
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,520
Hey, Mom! Mom!

842
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,107
Mommy!

843
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,530
Mommy!

844
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,367
Mom!

845
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,789
Mommy!

846
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,336
Mom!

847
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:36,632
Mom!

848
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:07,746
Here, I've got your boat.

849
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,540
There's water coming from your eyes.

850
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,467
- Let's go find your mom.
- Mm-hm.

851
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,343
[laughter]

852
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:09,433
- [Noriko] It's so beautiful!
- You forgot your cane!

853
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:11,977
Look, here comes a whale again!

854
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,645
I think he sees us.

855
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,689
The other side is nice, isn't it?

856
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,734
- And my knees don't hurt.
- This is the other side?

857
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:22,195
- Where do you think we are, Las Vegas?
- [laughter]

858
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:27,451
- It's like a dream.
- Ladies, can we gather around, please?

859
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:30,996
- [all] Coming!
- Why don't we run?

860
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,831
Come on!

861
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:36,793
- It's so nice to run.
- Beat you there!

862
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:40,338
[women laughing]

863
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,383
Winner!

864
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,181
Everyone, quiet, please.

865
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:52,309
The time has come
for you to bear witness

866
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,187
to a sacred test of love.

867
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,732
- Oh, how exciting!
- Are they too young for this?

868
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:00,942
- Are we too old?
- When are they coming?

869
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,905
Please, ladies,
the children are coming now.

870
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:07,908
And remember,
this is a very important moment.

871
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,285
[man] A crucial moment.

872
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:14,706
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm
come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?

873
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,584
[woman] It's not in his nature.

874
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:20,337
Of course I wouldn't.

875
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,799
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep.
Excuse me.

876
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,935
Do you think we can trust him?

877
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,437
I wonder what Lisa is thinking.

878
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:38,897
She's with that woman,

879
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,359
and they've been talking
all night and day.

880
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,953
Poor Lisa. Must be hard on her.

881
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:55,914
I wish we could hear
what they're talking about.

882
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,458
Oh, why don't we just ask. Lisa!

883
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:01,878
[all] Lisa!

884
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,593
[all] Lisa!

885
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,388
We wanna know
what you're talking about!

886
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:12,764
Come tell us!

887
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,072
- My dear!
- Lisa!

888
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:30,240
What's going on?

889
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,701
Lisa, are you sure
you can trust that man?

890
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:33,952
It's so exciting.

891
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,037
Tell us what's going to happen next.

892
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,832
Whatever happens,
I'm just glad you're all here for this.

893
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:41,877
- It's going to be fine.
- [all chattering]

894
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,320
I think I've been here before.

895
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,947
Ponyo?

896
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:13,199
Don't like this place.

897
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:19,456
Don't let go of my hand.

898
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,166
Mm...

899
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:43,688
[rattling]

900
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:54,658
[gasping]

901
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:59,037
Ponyo!

902
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,831
[snoring]

903
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:18,556
Ponyo!

904
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:27,816
Ponyo!

905
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:31,319
[gasping]

906
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,788
[grunting]

907
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:52,090
Ponyo! Please don't die!

908
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,759
Ponyo!

909
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:58,596
- Ponyo, wake up!
- Shh.

910
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,765
Be careful not to wake her.

911
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:04,978
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.
We've all been waiting for you.

912
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:08,773
- The old ladies, your mother...
- My mother?

913
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:12,402
Won't you come with me
and join them, Sosuke? Ponyo, too.

914
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,446
[man] Come with me.

915
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,657
I promise I'm not
going to take Ponyo away from you.

916
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,452
- We have to go now.
- [Toki] Sosuke!

917
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,455
Sosuke, don't listen to that wacko!

918
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:26,124
He tricked all the others
into going with him,

919
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,334
- but he couldn't fool me!
- Toki!

920
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,336
Did you hear me? Nobody fools me!

921
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,632
There is so little time!
My choice has to be made!

922
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,802
If the moon comes any closer...
Can't you see it?

923
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:40,346
The world is out of balance!
We will all be underwater!

924
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,725
That's the best excuse you can
come up with? A falling moon?

925
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:46,644
- [moaning] Humans!
- Sosuke, come to me!

926
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,772
Sosuke, please listen.
You have to trust me.

927
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:52,400
You're the only one who can
save the planet. Do it now. Do it!

928
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:55,236
Ponyo!

929
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:59,240
Brunhilde, respect your father!

930
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:07,290
Ponyo!

931
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:10,126
Sosuke, come on!

932
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,212
Bring them to me!

933
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,177
Faster!

934
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:22,639
Jump for it!

935
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:02,220
[squeaking]

936
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,304
Now what?

937
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:46,431
[squeaking]

938
01:34:58,276 --> 01:35:00,612
- Mama!
- Sosuke.

939
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,405
Ponyo!

940
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:09,454
You don't have to swim.

941
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,581
I don't know why we're here.

942
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:24,510
- So this is Sosuke.
- How do you do?

943
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:27,639
- Are you Ponyo's mother?
- Yes.

944
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,308
You brought my daughter safely here.

945
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,644
- [all] Shh!
- [woman] Thank you.

946
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:36,272
Sosuke, Ponyo opened a magic well

947
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:41,569
because she wants very much
to be human, to become a real girl.

948
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:46,783
She needs you to accept
and love her as she truly is.

949
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:51,329
You know that Ponyo was a fish,
don't you?

950
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:52,664
Mm-hm.

951
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,707
[woman] And you know her as a human.

952
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,961
- Your drop of blood did that.
- Oh, that's it!

953
01:35:58,044 --> 01:36:01,297
I cut my thumb.
Then Ponyo licked it and made it better.

954
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:03,883
So that's how she changed into a human.

955
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:08,680
Could you love her
if she moved between two worlds?

956
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,349
Mm-hm. I love all the Ponyos.

957
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:16,062
It's a big responsibility,
but I really love her.

958
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:20,566
[giggling]

959
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:23,486
[chuckling]

960
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:28,366
- [all laughing] - Ooh!

961
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:32,078
Ponyo, come here, please.

962
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:51,139
Ponyo, Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

963
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:57,603
To become human,
you must choose to abandon magic.

964
01:36:57,687 --> 01:37:01,149
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hm.

965
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:13,328
Kiss the bubble, child,
when you return to land,

966
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:17,665
and Ponyo will become a girl,
growing up just like you.

967
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:23,588
I accept, Ponyo.

968
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,966
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.

969
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:35,516
Everyone,
the balance of nature is restored.

970
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,686
- Life begins again.
- [cheering]

971
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:41,439
I'm so proud!

972
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:45,693
[all chattering]

973
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,113
My Sosuke.

974
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:53,951
[squeaking]

975
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,881
[gasps]

976
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,349
- Good luck, Lisa.
- Thank you.

977
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,226
I'll take care of her.

978
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:32,532
There you are! Are you all right?

979
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,997
Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!

980
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,208
Don't bother, Shima-san.
We like to walk.

981
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,460
Life begins again.

982
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:49,715
This is yours, I believe.

983
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:55,680
- Thank you.
- Try to remember me kindly.

984
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:57,765
If you will. May I?

985
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:05,440
Take care of Ponyo.

986
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,068
[gasps] It's your father!

987
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:17,452
Koichi! Hi!

988
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,203
Over here!

989
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:22,957
Ah! Lisa and Sosukel!

990
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,750
Ahoy!

991
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:28,045
Look, Ponyo, there's my dad's ship!
