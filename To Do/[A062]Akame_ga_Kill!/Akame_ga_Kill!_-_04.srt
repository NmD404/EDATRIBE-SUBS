00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:10,500
[Woman crying]

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,866
Please! Don't kill me!

3
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,633
[ZANKU]
No can do, sweetie,

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:18,000
this is what you two get
for being out at this hour.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,500
Didn't your parents
ever teach you

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,766
that dangerous men roam
the streets at night? Hm?

7
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:25,633
Please let me go.

8
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,400
I'll do anything you want!

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,966
Is that so?
Well, I'm a bit of a talker.

10
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,866
Will you have a little chat
with me?

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,233
Yes! I will! I'll talk!

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,466
Great!

13
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,633
Then tell me, how does it feel
to be without a body?

14
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,333
What's wrong, feeling torn?

15
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:48,400
Mmm, simply delightful!

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,400
The perfect end
to a perfect day!

17
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,733
[Grunting]

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
[Panting]

19
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,900
That's enough for me, Bro.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,533
My arms really hurt.

21
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,100
Hm?

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,300
Come on! You've still got
some excess movement

23
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,700
in those muscles of yours.

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,966
[Straining]

25
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,433
Just concentrate.

26
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,233
You have to sharpen up
your focus.

27
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,133
If you can cut out all that
extra movement

28
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,633
you'll be able to hang in
there twice as long.

29
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:03,533
I got it...

30
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,766
You'll be an unstoppable force
before you know it.

31
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,500
You just need a firm touch.

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,633
Oh... OH!

33
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:11,000
[AKAME]
Tatsumi.

34
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,600
It's time for you to
help me make breakfast.

35
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,033
Ah!

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,566
Hm...

37
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,066
[Chopping food]

38
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,233
What are we making?

39
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,233
It's croquettes and rice.

40
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,600
<i>Croquettes and rice</i>
<i>for breakfast?</i>

41
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,666
<i>She really is a psychopath.</i>

42
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:29,666
Whooo!
That hit the spot!

43
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:32,200
Ah gawd.
My poor stomach.

44
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,700
Hold on.

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,333
Are Mine and Sheele
still in bed?

46
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:38,300
[AKAME]
Yeah. They always
sleep this late.

47
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:43,366
[Clears throat]

48
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:46,766
I just witnessed the speed
of a true assassin. No doubt.

49
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,033
Tatsumi.

50
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,533
We'll be serving tuna
and rice for lunch.

51
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,266
Akame, behind you...

52
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,800
[SHEELE]
Hm? What happened to
my breakfast?

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,466
[An eagle screeches]

54
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,700
[NAJENDA]
You did well.
What about the others?

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,500
I think I'm the only one who
was able to make it this far.

56
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,700
I see.

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,733
This is a list of everyone
in power

58
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,833
who swears to help us
when we rally.

59
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,500
It's in my hands now.

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
You can rest easy.

61
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,100
Please, help the revolution...

62
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,400
Right. I promise.

63
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,433
Your next target is the
serial killer everyone's
been talking about.

64
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,900
He appears at night

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,900
and decapitates people
seemingly at random.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,933
Right now, the number of
victims is unknown.

67
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:36,433
I'm pretty sure a third of
the people he killed
were guards...

68
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:37,766
must be strong.

69
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,100
No doubt about it;

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,900
definitely sounds like
Headhunter Zanku's work.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Huh? Who's Zanku?

72
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,366
You don't know?!

73
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,366
Wow, you really are from
the sticks, aren't you?

74
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,433
Sorry, but I don't think
I've ever heard of him either.

75
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,366
[MINE]
Seriously, you probably
just forgot, Sheele.

76
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:53,200
Ahh...

77
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,533
Okay, so what's so terrible

78
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,133
about this guy anyway?

79
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:59,166
It's worse than you can imagine.

80
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,500
Headhunter Zanku used to be
the executioner

81
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,266
at the biggest prison
in the Empire.

82
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:07,600
The Minister orders a lot
of decapitations.

83
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:11,800
Over and over,
day in and day out.

84
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,400
And one by one,

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,966
Zanku chopped off their heads
as they begged for their lives.

86
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,166
Over the years it became
an addiction...

87
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:22,300
and now he can't stop.

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,366
[TATSUMI]
That's enough to drive
anyone crazy.

89
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:27,666
Uh‐huh. And eventually killing
prisoners wasn't enough anymore,

90
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,100
so he took it to the streets.

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,733
Zanku disappeared shortly after
a subjugation force

92
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,300
was organized to catch him.

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,833
I never thought he would
turn up in the city.

94
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,066
Then what are we waiting for.

95
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,666
Let's take this bastard out!

96
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,433
Whoa, easy, tiger!

97
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,566
Yeah, but‐

98
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,566
Zanku's also equipped with
an Imperial Arms

99
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,666
he stole from the warden
a few years ago.

100
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:49,266
We'd better travel in
teams of two...

101
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,300
in case it's a rough ride.

102
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,866
Jeez, why did he have to
say it like THAT?

103
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,266
By the way...

104
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:57,600
do we have any idea
which Imperial Arms

105
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,066
he might be fighting with?

106
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,133
No, we're still looking
into that.

107
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,966
Not about to reveal his
hand then, is he?

108
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:05,233
That's annoying.

109
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,633
So uh... what IS an
Imperial Arms anyway?

110
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,566
Ah!

111
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,000
Something like this.

112
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,933
That's... not that helpful.

113
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,400
Very well then.

114
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,100
Why don't we get Tatsumi
up to speed?

115
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,500
A thousand years ago,

116
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,466
the Emperor who built the Great
Empire was deeply troubled.

117
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:26,066
[Emperor]
<i>I wish I could defend this</i>
<i>nation until the end of time,</i>

118
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,900
<i>but someday I will die.</i>

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,400
<i>However, weaponry and armor</i>
<i>can last generation</i>
<i>after generation.</i>

120
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,733
We will combine our wisdom and
create weapons to protect
my empire forever!

121
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,400
[NAJENDA]
He gathered materials from
S‐Class Danger Beasts

122
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,800
and rare metals such
as Orichalcum.

123
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,366
Artisans from around the world
were summoned to help him.

124
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:54,200
The Emperor's wealth and power
allowed him to forge 48 weapons‐

125
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,266
a feat that would be
impossible today.

126
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:00,166
He called them the
"Imperial Arms."

127
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:03,033
Each one is equipped with
amazing abilities,

128
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:06,766
and some are able to
wipe out entire armies.

129
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,966
Ministers who used the
Imperial Arms

130
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,666
were quite successful
on the battlefield.

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,400
But a large civil war
500 years ago

132
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,666
caused nearly half of the
weapons to be scattered
across the land.

133
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,766
And that's how it all began.

134
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:27,000
[TATSUMI]
Is Akame's sword really
one of those 48 weapons?

135
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,333
[NAJENDA]
The One‐Hit Killer: Murasame.

136
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,200
When someone is cut
by this sword,

137
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,066
a poisonous curse enters
the body and kills
within seconds.

138
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,500
There is no antidote.

139
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,766
Hundred‐Beast King
Transformation Lionel.

140
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:45,033
This belt gives the wearer all
the strength and swiftness
of a wild animal.

141
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,800
It also enhances the
sense of smell,

142
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,700
making it perfect for recon.

143
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,533
The Adventurous Bunker, Pumpkin.

144
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:56,266
A gun that fires mental energy
in the form of a shockwave.

145
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:58,733
The more danger its
wielder is in,

146
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,766
the more deadly it becomes.

147
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,100
The Demon Armor, Incursio.

148
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,966
A suit of armor with
impregnable defense.

149
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:09,200
Wearing it causes such
great strain

150
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,066
that any normal person who
attempts to put it on will die.

151
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,300
The Protean Cross‐Tail.

152
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
A string‐based Imperial Arms

153
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,966
that can be used to set
traps and barriers,

154
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,800
as well as attack
enemies directly.

155
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,000
It's just as versatile and
dangerous as the name suggests.

156
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:29,400
The Shears of Creation, Extase.

157
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,566
A giant pair of scissors sharp
enough to cut anything in half.

158
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:37,600
They are also strong enough
to be used defensively.

159
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,566
Some Imperial Arms also
have trump cards.

160
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,466
Incursio maximizes the abilities
of the beast used to create it,

161
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:48,733
allowing its user to become
temporarily invisible.

162
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,533
Most importantly...

163
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:54,700
the Imperial Arms have followed
one iron‐clad rule from
time immemorial.

164
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,100
These weapons are so incredible
that whenever two of them clash,

165
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,833
it always ends in death.

166
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:05,900
Therefore, if two Imperial
Arms users choose to fight...

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,700
one of them will
definitely perish.

168
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,700
We know Zanku has
an Imperial Arms.

169
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,633
While mutual death is a
possibility, mutual survival
is clearly not.

170
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,433
Okay, I see...

171
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:23,133
Uh‐oh! Looks like we've
revealed way too much to
let you outta here now.

172
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,433
So unless you wanna die,

173
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,100
I guess you're just
stuck with us for life.

174
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,266
Uh... yeah!

175
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,866
That's a good thing, Tatsumi.

176
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:31,800
It means that the Boss considers
you a part of the team now.

177
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,533
While it's true that Night Raid
is lacking in numbers

178
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:37,533
we make up for it with our
individual abilities.

179
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:40,066
I believe we're the
heart of the revolution.

180
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,500
What about me?

181
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
Do I get one?

182
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,533
What?! You really think we have
a weapon we can just give you?

183
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,000
Huh? You don't?

184
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,600
Haha... If the
opportunity arises,

185
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,966
I'm sure you'll be getting
your own soon enough.

186
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,866
Hm...

187
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,200
Nothing further at this time.

188
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,966
Now let's go punish this
scumbag. Move out!

189
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,066
Roger that!

190
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,566
This is the area we're
supposed to be checking out.

191
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,300
All the locals are
so terrified of Zanku

192
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,733
that they're staying inside.

193
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,433
But he could still get‐

194
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:21,366
‐Keep an eye out for guards.
‐Hm‐hm...

195
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,666
Hey, Akame, can I ask
you something?

196
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:25,166
Not to worry.

197
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,066
I made sure to bring
enough food for both of us.

198
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh... no, not that.

199
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,000
Is it true that your sword
kills with one strike?

200
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
That's right.

201
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,966
Oh, man... it's a miracle
I'm even alive right now.

202
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,233
I've been using Murasame for
a very long time...

203
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:45,066
and over the past few years
it's built a reputation as
the "One‐Hit Kill Sword".

204
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,600
Shouldn't that be a secret?

205
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,633
Well I guess it's invincible
either way though, huh?

206
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,500
No. It still has some drawbacks.

207
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,766
Some drawbacks?

208
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,833
It's almost impossible to clean.

209
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:59,600
If I cut my finger, I'm dead.

210
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,966
I must cut directly into my
opponent's flesh

211
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,766
or the curse won't
get into the body.

212
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:07,933
It must be tough if the enemy's
got thick armor. Like Bro does.

213
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:11,100
For me everything depends
on one‐hit‐kills.

214
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,400
That's why I can't afford to
rely on just my Imperial Arms.

215
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,333
<i>Akame is probably somewhere</i>
<i>near the same age as me...</i>

216
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:22,500
<i>but I have to wonder</i>
<i>how many battles she's</i>
<i>already had to fight?</i>

217
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,233
Hmm!

218
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,633
Now we have some assassins

219
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:30,400
and a serial killer running
loose in the Capital.

220
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,833
My, what a jungle
this city can be!

221
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:35,537
How exciting!

222
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:38,037
Good evening, Night Raid!

223
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:41,904
I wonder, which head should
I go after first?

224
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:45,537
Ooh, look at the sense of
purpose in those eyes!

225
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,437
I'm impressed.

226
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:49,304
I know what I'll do!

227
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:53,304
I'll go after the tastiest
morsels first.

228
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:55,704
It's not like he's just
gonna waltz right up to us.

229
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:58,104
Guess all we can really do
is be patient.

230
00:11:58,204 --> 00:11:58,904
Uh...

231
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:00,337
I'll be right back.

232
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:02,437
Is nature calling?

233
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,804
[Tatsumi sighs]

234
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:07,804
I must be nervous.

235
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:09,137
Huh?

236
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,604
Sayo!

237
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:17,604
Hey! Where're ya going?!

238
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,371
What's taking so long?

239
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:28,204
[Panting]

240
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:32,271
I can't believe it.
It's really you!

241
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:34,871
I‐I thought you were dead.

242
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,404
Thank God, you're okay.

243
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,604
Oh how touching!

244
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:40,904
Uh?

245
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:43,204
I must've shown you
something very nice.

246
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,304
Oh?

247
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:46,204
Good evening, my friend.

248
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:48,837
Wh‐what the hell did you
do with Sayo?!

249
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:52,104
I would prefer you to call me
a different name...

250
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,971
and please say it with love.

251
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,837
My name is Headhunter Zanku.

252
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:58,771
So you're the one.

253
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:01,137
I've been looking for you.

254
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:06,671
"Uh‐oh! Looks like he managed to
separate me from the others!"

255
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:08,904
"Maybe I'll be able to
stall him for a minute!"

256
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,537
Is that what you're thinking?

257
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:14,571
<i>Did he just read my mind?!</i>

258
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,471
<i>That must be his Imperial Arms.</i>

259
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:17,804
Bingo!

260
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:19,837
You're right,
it's called Spectator.

261
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:22,837
And one of its five special
gifts is known as "Insight."

262
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:24,837
It allows me to read
your every thought

263
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,071
by gazing at your
facial expressions.

264
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:30,471
Obviously, it's blessed me with
keen powers of observation.

265
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:33,771
Should I give you a shiny gold
star for guessing correctly?

266
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:35,171
Don't bother!

267
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:37,604
And you can stop
talking any time now!

268
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:40,437
Oh no, I love a good chit‐chat.

269
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:42,904
Do you want to know how I
managed to find you?

270
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:45,071
No matter how dark or
how foggy it is,

271
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:48,404
my "Far‐Sight" can see
clearly for miles!

272
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:50,771
Delightful!

273
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,437
Did you think you could
land a hit

274
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,571
if you attacked me
mid‐monologue?

275
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:55,904
Only one problem.

276
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:58,004
I'm still reading your mind
like an open book;

277
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,171
have you forgotten that?

278
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,537
[Roar]

279
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:03,771
First you're gonna come right
at me with a downward slash!

280
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,571
Then you're going to try
your finishing move!

281
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,937
Then try to fake me out and
go straight for my throat!

282
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:14,271
Heh! You really are
so predictable.

283
00:14:16,237 --> 00:14:17,604
[Gasp]

284
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:20,471
<i>He's on a different level</i>
<i>than anyone else I've faced!</i>

285
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:23,637
I love the look on people's
faces when I remove
their heads...

286
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,471
it never ceases to give me
such a rush!

287
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:26,471
[Grunt]

288
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:27,837
The thing that gets me most.

289
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,371
Is how they always look
so surprised.

290
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:35,937
I wonder what kind of delightful
expression you'll make?

291
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:39,071
You're not gonna live
long enough to find out!

292
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,304
Huh?

293
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:42,237
Tatsumi...

294
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:45,171
[Screaming]

295
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:48,204
Ooh, I do appreciate ambitious
young people like you!

296
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,837
In fact, I think you're gonna be
a perfect new addition

297
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:52,771
to my collection of
shrunken heads!

298
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:55,271
[Crazy laughter]

299
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,804
Just delightful!

300
00:14:56,904 --> 00:15:00,771
I must say I've really done
a number on that firm
resolve of yours.

301
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:02,071
Agh... what?

302
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:04,137
That pitiful sound of a
"tough guy" like you

303
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,671
begging for mercy is
music to my ears.

304
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:09,504
That's why I'm compelled
to take my time.

305
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:10,537
[Grunt]

306
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,471
Yes! Please feel free to beg!

307
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:16,437
Maybe you can buy enough time
for your little friend to
catch up with you, eh?!

308
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:19,871
[Spit]

309
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,437
Don't hold your breath.

310
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:23,971
You're just some filthy bastard
who gets his kicks

311
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:25,804
from chopping off heads.

312
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:28,804
There's no way in hell
I'm begging you for anything!

313
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:33,971
<i>If he can read my mind, I'll</i>
<i>have to keep things simple.</i>

314
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,937
<i>I'll try one more attack...</i>

315
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:37,871
<i>and give it everything</i>
<i>I've got!</i>

316
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,771
Oh... aren't you courageous?

317
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,971
And you're in so much pain too!

318
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:46,904
It's a good thing you're in the
hands of an expert executioner.

319
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:48,237
This is it!

320
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:49,137
Huh?

321
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:50,071
Ugh!

322
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:51,371
Ah!

323
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:54,937
<i>Uh! That little shit.</i>

324
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,504
<i>He's quicker than</i>
<i>I anticipated.</i>

325
00:15:57,604 --> 00:16:00,204
Ha! It's about time
I got one in.

326
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:01,504
Ugh!

327
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:04,337
An expert executioner, huh?

328
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:06,637
An expert wouldn't have
missed my neck!

329
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:08,671
Some Headhunter
you turned out to be!

330
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:10,104
Shut your mouth!

331
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:22,837
He looks pretty upset.

332
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:25,604
You must've used some of your
own psychological tactics.

333
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:26,537
Akame!

334
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,071
Glad I got here in time.

335
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:30,237
Just sit tight while I
finish him off

336
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,104
and then I'll tend to those
wounds of yours.

337
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:33,337
Hehe...

338
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:38,637
Well if it isn't Akame and
her infamous Murasame.

339
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:41,571
How delightful!
Nice to meet you, dear.

340
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:43,704
It's so nice to
meet you as well.

341
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:45,404
Since you're my target.

342
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,804
X‐Ray!

343
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:50,637
Hmm... she's not concealing
any weapons.

344
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,771
Ugh... Be careful, Akame!

345
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:55,237
That eyeball thing can
read your mind!

346
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:56,537
I see.

347
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:59,504
I wondered which Imperial Arms
he'd be using. No matter.

348
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,437
It makes no difference whether
he can read my mind,

349
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,371
if he can't keep up!

350
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:10,771
<i>He's good. He's seen</i>
<i>his share of combat.</i>

351
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:14,437
<i>She's not just fast,</i>
<i>she's powerful too!</i>

352
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:16,137
[Grunts]

353
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,937
<i>Wow, so this is what combat</i>

354
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:22,271
<i>between two Imperial Arms</i>
<i>users is like.</i>

355
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:25,537
<i>If he can read my mind,</i>
<i>we're evenly matched.</i>

356
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:28,404
<i>In that case...</i>

357
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:31,837
<i>Well done, you've</i>
<i>cleared your mind!</i>

358
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:35,537
<i>But Spectator has</i>
<i>"Foresight" as well.</i>

359
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:39,037
<i>I already know what your</i>
<i>next move will be...</i>

360
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:42,104
<i>Exactly!</i>

361
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:42,537
Uh!

362
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:44,037
Ah!

363
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:46,871
[Crazy laugh]

364
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,871
<i>He actually put a</i>
<i>scratch on her!</i>

365
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,304
Come on, now!

366
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:56,204
It wouldn't be very fair
if I didn't get to

367
00:17:56,304 --> 00:17:58,971
rough you up a little bit,
now would it?

368
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,904
You can see what I'm thinking
and what I'm about to do.

369
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:03,571
I'd say we're even.

370
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:05,104
So, Akame.

371
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:07,371
Tell me, how do you deal
with the voices?

372
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,904
Huh? Voices?

373
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,337
[Haunting whispers]

374
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:13,604
Listen! When it's quiet
you can hear them.

375
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:17,404
The people I've killed are
screaming at me from Hell.

376
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:19,804
They sound so angry

377
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:22,571
and they're constantly telling
me to hurry and join them
down there!

378
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:26,737
I've been hearing them every day
since I became an executioner

379
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:28,837
and it keeps getting worse!

380
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:31,204
I just keep talking
to drown out the noise.

381
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:33,304
So tell me what you
do about the‐

382
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,704
I don't hear them.

383
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:35,904
Your voices.

384
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:37,771
I don't hear anything like that.

385
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:39,437
Interesting.

386
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:41,304
You're such an
experienced assassin,

387
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:43,971
I thought for sure
you'd understand.

388
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:47,804
You have disappointed me!

389
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,504
[Gasp]

390
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,971
Kurome.

391
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,737
[TATSUMI]
What's wrong, Akame?

392
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,071
Hey, snap out of it!

393
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:05,704
She can't. "Illusionary Sight"
creates a mirage

394
00:19:05,804 --> 00:19:08,904
of the person you care
most about in this world.

395
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:11,071
Right now she's looking at
a vision of someone

396
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:14,237
so important to her she can't
bring herself to do harm to me.

397
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:17,237
Huh? So that's why
I thought I saw Sayo!

398
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:18,504
Akame please!

399
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:20,337
Don't let him get to you!

400
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:21,604
It's not real!

401
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,304
Don't bother!

402
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:26,071
It may only work on one target
but it's extremely hypnotic.

403
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:29,071
Besides, no matter how much
skill you have...

404
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:32,937
Nobody can make themselves
kill the one they love
the most, can they?!

405
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:36,371
This is the last thing you'll
see before you die, Akame...

406
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:38,071
enjoy it!

407
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,371
What the...?!

408
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,204
She didn't even hesitate!

409
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:52,137
What the hell?!

410
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:55,637
You were supposed to see the
one person you love the most!

411
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,537
My desire to kill her.

412
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:59,637
Is because I love her so dearly.

413
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:00,937
[Panicking]

414
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:03,104
What is she saying?

415
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:05,271
Now it's time for
this battle to end.

416
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,471
[Gasping]

417
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,404
<i>No, it's about to break!</i>

418
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:10,437
I'll destroy that weapon first!

419
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:11,771
[Screams]

420
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:13,904
I refuse to die!

421
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:16,904
<i>Reading her mind gives me</i>
<i>the upper hand!</i>

422
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:19,671
<i>No, I can't kill her</i>
<i>quick enough!</i>

423
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:21,571
<i>My sword won't</i>
<i>last that long!</i>

424
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,537
<i>Ah!</i>

425
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:25,304
<i>Gah!</i>

426
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:29,337
<i>Ugh!</i>

427
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:33,071
You are done.

428
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:36,771
[Gasps]

429
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,437
You did it!

430
00:20:43,604 --> 00:20:46,571
<i>Akame. She saved me ...</i>

431
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:49,171
<i>I need to get stronger.</i>

432
00:20:50,404 --> 00:20:51,337
Zanku...

433
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:54,471
those voices will never
haunt you again.

434
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,137
The voices...

435
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:03,337
they're gone.

436
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:08,304
It's delightful...

437
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:10,804
I thank you...

438
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,404
Akame.

439
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:26,318
Sayo.

440
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,151
What are you doing?

441
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:29,618
It's time for dinner.

442
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:32,451
You may be injured but you can
still pull your weight.

443
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:34,385
Hey, Akame?

444
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:37,285
Who was it you saw when you
were hypnotized by Zanku?

445
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:38,518
Hm?

446
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:42,751
I'll tell you when
the time comes.

447
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,718
I will tell you this much:

448
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:47,818
Everyone in Night Raid.

449
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:50,451
They're all important to me.

450
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:52,518
That includes you too.

451
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:53,851
Gah!

452
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:54,851
Let's go.

453
00:21:54,951 --> 00:21:56,885
Uh, hey, wait up!

454
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:58,818
It's all meat dishes tonight.

455
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,618
No way; that can't be healthy!

456
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:02,651
Can't you throw in a few
vegetables here and there?

457
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:04,285
‐Nope.
‐Come on!

458
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:40,351
