1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,733
[SAYO]
Let's make a pact, that when
we die, we die together!

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:08,566
[IEYASU]
We're gonna be leaders in
the Imperial Capital!

3
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,466
[TATSUMI]
And make enough money to save
the village! We'll be heroes!

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,133
<i>So much for that.</i>

5
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:19,333
<i>Now I'm out here all alone.</i>

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,433
Huh?

7
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,133
Hehehe...

8
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,366
Whoa! Don't sneak up
on me like that!

9
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,066
So, have you decided to
officially join yet?

10
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,566
I told you guys‐

11
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,766
You really do have the makings
of an assassin, you know!

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,533
It's not a matter of whether or
not I'd be good at it, alright.

13
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:39,000
I just don't...
wanna kill people.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,233
Well, I'm gonna introduce you
to the guys anyway!

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,533
Let me go! Agh! My neck!

16
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,600
Oh? He still doesn't want to
be part of the team in spite
of all that's happened?

17
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,733
He's a bit hesitant.

18
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,800
So I was hoping maybe you
could give him a few words
of encouragement, okay?

19
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,533
Hmm...

20
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,766
Well, since we showed you the
location of our hideout...

21
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:42,200
if we can't convince you to join
the team, then you'll be dead.

22
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,200
Uh, is that supposed to be
encouragement or a threat?

23
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,833
Just give it plenty of
thought, okay?

24
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,666
Huh? "Mend Your Airheaded Ways"?

25
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:53,066
<i>Oh my god these guys are</i>
<i>a bunch of circus freaks.</i>

26
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,500
[MINE]
What the hell?

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,166
Hmm?

28
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:59,033
Leone! Why'd you bring this
loser back to the hideout?

29
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,400
He's one of us now.

30
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,933
And did no one think to
ask for MY opinion?

31
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,400
[TATSUMI]
Uh... Okay.

32
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,866
I won't allow it.

33
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:12,833
It's obvious you're not
cut from the same professional
cloth as the rest of the group.

34
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,133
I mean, just look at you.

35
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:16,133
Wha‐?! What's that
supposed to mean?!

36
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:20,200
[LEONE]
Aw, don't let it get to you;
that's Mine's way of
saying hello.

37
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,633
Hmph!

38
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,366
This is our practice field where
we go to let off some steam.

39
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:28,833
Oh! And look who's already out
here trying to work up a sweat.

40
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,266
That's Bulat.

41
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:31,400
Hyaaaaa!

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,533
Incredible. He's really
good with that spear.

43
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,633
[Grunting]

44
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh...

45
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:39,766
Oh...

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,533
Hey! Oh!

47
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:48,433
Aren't you the fella we
picked up the other day?

48
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,333
Wait, how do you know
about that?

49
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:54,300
Huh? Oh... I should've known you
wouldn't recognize me like this.

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,733
I was wearing my armor
the first time we met.

51
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,366
Uh... Oh!

52
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:01,033
Name's Bulat.
Pleasure's mine.

53
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,400
Uh... hi there.

54
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,433
And yes he's gay.

55
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,900
Geh!
Haha...

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,433
Now don't give him the
wrong idea...

57
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:09,400
Yet.

58
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,133
I can think of a lot
of wrong ideas.

59
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:16,833
[LUBBOCK]
Hehe... It's almost time
for Leone's bath.

60
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:20,833
I'd do just about anything
for a sneak peek at that
smokin' hot body!

61
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,266
[LEONE]
In that case...

62
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,966
‐Huh?
‐How about you give up
two fingers?

63
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:25,733
[Gasps]

64
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,800
[Screams]

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,500
[LEONE]
You never learn, do you?

66
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,033
[LUBBOCK]
Owowowowow!

67
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,766
[LEONE]
Next time I'll break your arm.

68
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:37,500
‐Owww!
‐This is Lubbock.
As you can see, he's an idiot.

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,833
[LEONE]
Let's see, who's next?

70
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,133
[TATSUMI]
I don't know how many
more I can take.

71
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,533
Hehe. The next one's a cutie,
so try not to stare.

72
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,900
She's stuffing her face
over there by the fire.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
[LEONE]
Hey, Akame!

74
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,400
‐Hm?
[TATSUMI]
<i>‐And there's this freak!</i>

75
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,300
I'm just now realizing she's
eating a giant bird.

76
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,100
Did she kill that
thing herself?!

77
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,500
[LEONE]
Akame's our resident wild child.

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,833
Leone, have some.

79
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,200
Huh? Thanks!

80
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,466
[AKAME]
Well? Have you joined us yet?

81
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:11,366
Uh, no...

82
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:14,700
Then I'm sorry but I won't
be sharing any of my
dinner with you.

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm okay with that!

84
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,366
<i>This chick's already tried</i>
<i>to kill me twice.</i>

85
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,166
<i>I'd better watch out for her.</i>

86
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:23,966
Is it just me or is everyone
a little extra jacked up today?

87
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,200
That's 'cause the boss is back.

88
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,100
Uh? The boss?

89
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,266
‐Boss!
‐Hey!

90
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,966
Welcome back!
Did you bring me anything good?

91
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,866
[NAJENDA]
Now why would I do that?

92
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,066
About one of your most
recent assignments...

93
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,700
I was told you completed it
three days overdue.

94
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,233
Ah, crap!

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
[Whining]

96
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,866
When facing a powerful opponent,
it's unwise to get caught up
in the fun.

97
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,733
Shouldn't you know better
than that by now?

98
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,966
[LEONE]
Okay, I've learned my lesson,
now please let go of me!

99
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:58,033
Anyway. Tell me about the boy.

100
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:01,100
Oh! That's right!
He's going to be joining us.

101
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,633
I haven't agreed to anything!

102
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,533
Does he seem promising?

103
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:06,366
Absolutely.

104
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:12,300
See? All we want you
to do is try. 'Kay?

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,500
S'not what you said before!

106
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,333
Akame, go get everyone together.

107
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to hear about everything,
including that boy.

108
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:26,757
Thank you all. I think I
understand the situation here.

109
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:29,791
Tatsumi! How would you like
to be the newest member
of Night Raid?

110
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,491
You're gonna kill me if I
refuse to join, right.

111
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,157
[NAJENDA]
No, we won't KILL you.

112
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,121
‐Huh?
[NAJENDA]
‐But we wouldn't
let you leave, either.

113
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:39,554
You'd have to remain here
and work in our factory.

114
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:42,187
Either way, we won't
take your life,

115
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:44,354
but I do encourage you to join.

116
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,487
Your choice.

117
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:48,121
I, uh...

118
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:50,787
I just wanted to make a lot of
money in the Imperial Capital

119
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:53,621
so that I'd be able to save
my village from starvation.

120
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,521
But the Capital wasn't
what I thought.

121
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:57,487
[BULAT]
‐Tatsumi.
‐Huh?

122
00:06:57,587 --> 00:07:01,421
Corruption in the Capital
is creating mass‐poverty
all over the countryside.

123
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:05,921
Don't you want to uproot all
that corruption at the source?
Like a man would?

124
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:09,387
Bulat used to be a high‐ranking
officer in the Imperial Army,

125
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:14,087
but he joined us when he
realized what was really
going on in the Capital.

126
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:16,987
If we don't do something
about the scum terrorizing
the Capital,

127
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,987
then it's never gonna
get cleaned up.

128
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:22,487
So it's our job to take out
those bastards whenever
we get the chance.

129
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,021
That's fine...

130
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:26,087
But I don't think you can make
a real big difference

131
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,487
by just eliminating a couple
of rotten eggs here and there.

132
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:32,487
I mean, doing things this
way won't save places
like my village.

133
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:36,654
That's correct.
And that's exactly why Night
Raid's the perfect fit for you.

134
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:38,887
[TATSUMI]
Uh... why is that?

135
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:41,954
[NAJENDA]
There's an anti‐Empire group
called the Revolutionary Army

136
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:44,321
that has a hideout
south of the Capital.

137
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,021
A whole army?

138
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:48,087
They started out small,

139
00:07:48,187 --> 00:07:51,354
but they've grown in to a
rather formidable organization.

140
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:54,921
They needed a separate unit to
specialize in covert operations,

141
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:57,987
such as recon and
assassinating targets.

142
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:02,054
That's why they created
Night Raid!

143
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:04,887
We're only putting out one fire
at a time right now...

144
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:07,554
but when the Revolutionary Army
decides to make its move...

145
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,954
amidst the chaos we'll head
straight for the cause
of this mess...

146
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:11,754
the Minister!

147
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:14,054
So you're gonna... kill him?

148
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:18,054
Only then will our nation
truly see change.

149
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,287
So if our nation had
a new start...

150
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:24,254
you really think all of
the people would be safe
and happy again?

151
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:25,354
[NAJENDA]
I am certain.

152
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:27,521
[TATSUMI]
I... I love it.

153
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,587
It's like you guys are
taking out the trash...

154
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:32,054
killing off the
bad guys one by one.

155
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:35,521
You're a rogue team of assassins
for the sake of justice!

156
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:38,087
[Others burst out laughing]

157
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:41,321
Huh? What'd I say?!
Why's everyone laughing?

158
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,421
Tatsumi, no matter how
you describe it,

159
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,354
we're still murderers.

160
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:49,487
And there's no justice to be
found in the way we do things.

161
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:51,321
Any given moment...

162
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:54,487
every one of us could be forced
to atone for the blood
that we've spilled.

163
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:56,354
Man! He has no idea.

164
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:59,787
It'll be a thousand years
before he can handle it.

165
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:00,921
Hold on.

166
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,021
Uh?

167
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:03,721
I, uh...

168
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:05,987
Every team member fights
for a different reason,

169
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,554
but each bares
a strong resolve.

170
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:12,454
Are you prepared
to risk your life?

171
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:14,287
You guys are gonna pay me
for this, aren't you?

172
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,121
Yes. And if you work
hard enough,

173
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,554
I think you'll make more than
enough to save your village.

174
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:19,987
Then I wanna do it!

175
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:21,954
Please allow me to be
part of Night Raid!

176
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:24,554
You probably won't be going back
to them as some hero, you know.

177
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:29,054
I know. But that doesn't matter
to me as long as they'll
be taken care of.

178
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:30,054
Hmph.

179
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,721
Works for me.

180
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,587
Prepare yourself for a life
unlike any other.

181
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,187
Welcome to Night Raid.

182
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:38,287
You're dismissed for the night.

183
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:39,221
Akame...

184
00:09:39,321 --> 00:09:40,521
Hm?

185
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,087
You're in charge of
training him for now.

186
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:43,554
Ugh?

187
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:45,554
If he becomes a nuisance,
feel free to kill him.

188
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:46,987
No problem.

189
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,621
<i>No problem?!</i>

190
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,154
Better do a good job
if you wanna live!

191
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:52,587
Uh...

192
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:56,054
[TATSUMI]
<i>It HAD to be her...</i>
<i>I am so dead.</i>

193
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,654
The more skills we can start
learning right now

194
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:02,987
the quicker we'll be able to
get ahead in the military!

195
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,021
And if we ever run out of
provisions or something,

196
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:08,454
maybe knowing how to prepare
food might actually
save us someday.

197
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:10,287
<i>Sayo... Ieyasu...</i>

198
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:13,587
<i>Who knew learning to cook</i>
<i>with you guys would</i>
<i>come in so handy?</i>

199
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,387
[MINE]
I said I want seconds!

200
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:16,887
‐Oh! Me too!
‐I'll take some!

201
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:19,154
Oh yes if you don't mind!

202
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:21,387
<i>They're running me ragged!</i>

203
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,854
Come on...

204
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,221
I thought I was supposed
to become an assassin,

205
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:25,254
not a stupid chef!

206
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:26,421
Don't look at me.

207
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,621
I just put food on
the plates. M'kay?

208
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:32,087
Oh, so they won't let you cook
because you kept sampling
the food, is that it?

209
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:33,754
I don't know what you mean.

210
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:35,921
You are not a very good liar.

211
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:40,021
[MINE]
Aww, look, you're right at
home in the kitchen,
aren't you, rookie?

212
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:41,021
What?!

213
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,221
Later, Sunshine!

214
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:43,321
Bulat?

215
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,587
Wait a sec...

216
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,887
are you guys heading out
on a mission?

217
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:48,187
Yeah, this one's a
special request.

218
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:49,654
Shouldn't I come too?

219
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:51,121
You stay here in the kitchen!

220
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:53,954
Now you be a good cook and
chop a few cucumbers for me.

221
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,421
Why does she always
have to be like that?
[Mine mocking laughter]

222
00:10:57,521 --> 00:10:58,854
See ya!

223
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:00,187
Grrr...

224
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,187
Wow, this place is great!

225
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:09,187
Today we'll start by
catching fish for dinner.

226
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,787
Whoa!

227
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:17,887
What seems to be the problem?

228
00:11:22,454 --> 00:11:24,121
Thank god it's just a swimsuit.

229
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:25,521
The target is Koga Tuna.

230
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,287
See how many you can get.

231
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,721
Aren't those things extremely
rare and stupidly hard to
get a hold of?

232
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:42,754
Wha‐?

233
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:48,754
First you have to swim all
the way down to the bottom.

234
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:51,587
Then conceal your aura
and make your attack.

235
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:53,887
You have to act very quickly.

236
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:55,321
Give it a try.

237
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:57,454
Hmm... Whatever you say!

238
00:11:57,554 --> 00:12:02,154
Wow. So in the end our
little Tatsumi caught
two whole fish, huh?

239
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,754
Akame said you ripped off
your shirt and said some
shit like "I got this!"

240
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,487
This'll take some time.

241
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:12,187
[TATSUMI]
<i>Man... why the hell would she</i>
<i>say something like that?</i>

242
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:13,587
<i>I can't stand her.</i>

243
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,721
Anyway Leone.
What did you find out?

244
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:21,387
Here's the deal. The targets are
Ogre of the Imperial Guard
and Gamal the Oil Merchant.

245
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:25,087
And according to the client...

246
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:29,021
[CLIENT]
Ogre has been accepting
bribes from an oil merchant
named Gamal.

247
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:32,187
So whenever he manages to get
himself into trouble...

248
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:36,721
Ogre finds a way to pin all of
the blame on someone else.

249
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:39,121
My fiancé fell victim to this.

250
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:41,121
And he was sentenced to death.

251
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:44,854
Please... I'm begging you,
you must do something.

252
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:49,187
[LEONE]
Understood. That son of a bitch
will get what he deserves.

253
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:52,954
Thank you! Thank you so much!

254
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,221
Here it is.
She paid it all up front.

255
00:12:57,321 --> 00:13:00,421
I'm amazed she could
give us that much.

256
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,521
She smelled sickly.

257
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:05,021
I think she's been
selling her body.

258
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:06,887
Huh? Is that right?

259
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,587
[NAJENDA]
Sure she's not lying?

260
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,121
My senses have never
steered me wrong yet, Boss..

261
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:13,487
He's guilty.

262
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:16,521
Hmm. Then Night Raid
accepts this assignment.

263
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,054
In the new nation
we wish to create..

264
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:20,687
S'no room for his trash.

265
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:22,254
He needs divine punishment.

266
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:25,421
We shouldn't have too much
trouble with the oil merchant,

267
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:28,487
but I betcha Ogre'll be
a pain in the ass.

268
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,187
Ogre is a demon.

269
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:33,421
He's very skilled with a sword,
even the hit men are
scared of him.

270
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,221
And he's always surrounded by
a huge crowd of subordinates,

271
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:39,021
he's never seen alone.

272
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:44,425
He's so careful that Gamal
delivers all payments to
his personal chambers.

273
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:49,092
But on his days off he goes
drinking on Main Street,
right by the palace.

274
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:52,192
[TATSUMI]
Okay. Sounds like we know when
we'll have to strike.

275
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,259
[NAJENDA]
But, that area is
heavily guarded.

276
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:58,792
We can't send Akame;
they already know
what she looks like.

277
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:02,159
Hellooo! They don't have any
wanted posters of me yet!

278
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,359
Can you do it?

279
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:06,025
Targets like these pukes
are the ones I live for.

280
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,325
I think we should wait
'til the others are here.

281
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:12,292
But at the moment we still
have no idea when they're
coming back, am I right?

282
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:15,359
Fine! Then I say we set out on
this mission without 'em!

283
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:18,992
Oh? You think you're capable
of killing Ogre yourself?

284
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,092
‐What?
‐Careful how you answer that!

285
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:23,669
Keep pretending you're a bigshot
and we might just make you
back it up!

286
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:24,603
Oh!

287
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:26,503
As you are now, you can't do it.

288
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:27,403
Wha‐?!

289
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:28,903
But I'm an expert swordsman!

290
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:31,736
[AKAME]
What I mean is that you
can't kill people.

291
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:35,203
Uh... I did it once.

292
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:38,469
You were blinded by rage
that night.

293
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,003
Can you kill a person
under any circumstances

294
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:42,736
without stopping
to think about it?

295
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:46,403
I don't know, but what if
Ogre is framing another
innocent person

296
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:49,003
while the four of us are
sitting here arguing about it?!

297
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:50,836
That's why I don't
want us to wait!

298
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,236
I know how much it hurts to lose
someone for no good reason.

299
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:54,669
And it's not fun!

300
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,836
I don't want anyone else to
have to feel like that!

301
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:57,969
Then it's settled.

302
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,136
I admire your
conviction, Tatsumi.

303
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,703
Take him down.

304
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:04,769
Now that's what I like to hear!
You've got spunk, dontcha?!

305
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:08,103
I'd like you two ladies to
focus on the oil merchant.

306
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:09,536
You got it!

307
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:11,203
Understood.

308
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:15,403
See Akame, I can take care
of business when push
comes to shove.

309
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:17,469
I'll withhold judgement
of your ability

310
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:20,469
until you complete the mission
and report back.

311
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,703
If you begin with
over‐confidence and arrogance...

312
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:24,503
you'll die.

313
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:25,669
Uh!

314
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,603
<i>She'll change her tune.</i>

315
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:32,536
<i>I just have to prove myself</i>
<i>by killing Ogre.</i>

316
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,203
This is Main Street.

317
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:40,269
Did you memorize the map
like I told you?

318
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,603
Yeah. Yeah I got it.

319
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:45,836
If you begin with
over‐confidence and arrogance...

320
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:47,336
you'll die.

321
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:53,536
Tatsumi, I think I should
tell you a few things
about Akame's past.

322
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:59,803
When she was a kid, she and her
sister were sold to the Empire.

323
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:03,403
They were placed in an assassin
training camp with other
abandoned kids.

324
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:09,669
She learned how to survive
the harsh surroundings
as well as the art of murder.

325
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,103
She grew up an assassin, blindly
doing the Empire's dirty work.

326
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:17,703
But as Akame got older,
she started to see the darkness
the Empire was hiding.

327
00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:22,503
One day, she was sent to kill ‐
the Boss. But it didn't happen.

328
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:26,969
Somehow, she convinced her to
join the Revolutionary Army.

329
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,869
And join the side of the people.

330
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,636
But, by the time she
could do it,

331
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:35,603
most of the kids she had
grown up with were already dead.

332
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,036
Do you see what I'm
getting at Tatsumi?

333
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:39,969
Yeah yeah, as a
professional killer,

334
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:43,403
you're saying there are things
a rookie like me doesn't
understand yet.

335
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,303
Well, if you manage to
live through today,

336
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:48,636
then you'll know a little more.

337
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,836
Whooo! That bathroom
will never be the same.

338
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:57,403
Anyway,time to get back
to living the dream!

339
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:00,403
[LEONE]
Wait a second.
I've got a better idea.

340
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:06,203
Killed by two hot babes,
you lucky dog!

341
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:13,069
Now then, I wonder how the
newb's doing with his
part of the job?

342
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:18,369
Ahhh. Nothing like finishing off
a long day of torture than
knocking back a cold one.

343
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,169
Excuse me, Master Ogre.

344
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,503
Uh‐huh?

345
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,203
I have a matter of
utmost importance

346
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:24,703
I'd like to
discuss with you.

347
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,803
That so?
Let's hear it.

348
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:29,469
We need to speak privately.

349
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:30,736
Huh?

350
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:36,536
<i>This kid doesn't have an aura.</i>

351
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:40,036
Alright start talkin'.
I wanna get home.

352
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:42,069
Of course.

353
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:45,703
<i>Sayo, Ieyasu,</i>
<i>please watch over me.</i>

354
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:47,536
Huh?

355
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,736
Please, sir, I beg you to
let me join the Imperial Guard!

356
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,803
I have to earn money to
send back to my family
in the country!

357
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:56,836
Uh... I shoulda known
it was something like that.

358
00:17:56,936 --> 00:17:59,636
Follow the procedures like
everyone else, jackass.

359
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:01,103
I tried,

360
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:04,103
but they wouldn't
even take my application.

361
00:18:04,203 --> 00:18:06,736
That's not my problem.

362
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:14,803
It's not my fault you're
a puny little weakling!

363
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:18,236
<i>That was quick!</i>

364
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,603
<i>He acted without fear.</i>

365
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:23,503
<i>Been awhile since</i>
<i>somebody defied me.</i>

366
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,936
[Groan]

367
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:29,803
Just like that!

368
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:34,369
I'll withhold judgement
of your ability

369
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:36,969
until you complete the mission
and report back.

370
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:38,536
Oh! That's right.

371
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:40,669
I better be getting back
to base now.

372
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:43,536
[Growling]

373
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:44,503
Huh?

374
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:45,469
Ah!

375
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:46,603
Uh!

376
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:50,803
Did you really think you could
slay the mighty Ogre?!

377
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:54,403
A pathetic little snot‐nosed
brat like you?

378
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,169
Ugh!

379
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,703
Okay, lemme guess.

380
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,436
You're one of those
Night Raid punks

381
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:02,269
that goes around killing all
the people in power, right?

382
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,236
The weak can squeal
all they want,

383
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:07,469
but the strong will always
rule in this Empire, boy!

384
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:10,436
Who you deem worthy
means nothing!

385
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,869
I judge the fate of the people!

386
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,769
I won't let you kill
anyone else!

387
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:22,236
[Roar]

388
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:27,403
On whose order have you
come to me, boy?!

389
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:31,269
The fiancée of the little worm
I just had executed?

390
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:33,869
Guess I was right!

391
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:37,569
I told myself I shoulda
knocked off that wench
while I had the chance!

392
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,669
Well, I still could if
I really wanted to.

393
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:43,369
First thing I'll do is
chase that bitch down.

394
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:46,436
I'll find everyone she knows,
bring 'em up on charges

395
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:49,603
and take my time torturing them
to death while she watches!

396
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:52,803
But not until I kill you first!

397
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:54,603
[Gasp]

398
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:57,103
<i>These guys are all the same.</i>

399
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:58,569
<i>They throw their weight around</i>

400
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:02,103
<i>and use their power for</i>
<i>nothing but evil.</i>

401
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:06,036
<i>I want nothing more than</i>
<i>to take scum like him...</i>

402
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:08,003
<i>and slash it...</i>

403
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:10,269
<i>to pieces!</i>

404
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,769
[Groaning]

405
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:26,169
You've defeated a powerful
adversary on your own.

406
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:27,303
I'm impressed.

407
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:29,103
Yep!
Hear that, Akame?

408
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:30,569
I did exactly what
you wanted me to,

409
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:33,403
AND I came out without
a scratch on me!

410
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:35,903
Now, tell me how wonderful I am!

411
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:37,203
Hmm?

412
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,436
Ah!

413
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,036
What the hell are you
doing to me?!

414
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:42,136
Leone, Boss, grab him.

415
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:43,936
Ah!

416
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,336
Uhhmm...

417
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:52,069
Thank goodness.

418
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:53,336
Oh...

419
00:20:55,969 --> 00:21:01,169
I've seen people die from
infection because they were too
proud to report their wounds.

420
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:03,036
It's good you didn't get hurt.

421
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,769
It's hard for most people
to survive past their
first mission.

422
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,036
I'm glad you survived.

423
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:09,836
Uh... Hm.

424
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,469
The only reason Akame was
so hard on you before

425
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,769
was because she was worried
about your safety.

426
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:19,403
Learning to cook helped with
your communication.

427
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:21,936
And hunting taught you
basic killing techniques.

428
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:26,369
Do you not realize everything
we made you do was for a
very specific reason?

429
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:28,536
Oh, uh, I guess not.

430
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:33,103
Sorry Akame. I got...
I got the wrong idea.

431
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:34,569
‐It's okay.
‐Huh?

432
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,503
Just try to keep coming back
alive, Tatsumi.

433
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:40,836
Sure! S'long as you keep
looking after me, Akame.

434
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:43,236
[Giggles]
Oh my god this is so
adorable and cheesy

435
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,669
and the fact that you're
almost naked makes it
even more ridiculous.

436
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:48,336
Hey, you're the ones who
took my shirt off!

437
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:50,569
Well, you're working with Mine
on your next assignment

438
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,469
so I expect your best.
‐Ugh!

439
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:55,603
Yeouch,
out of the frying pan,
and into the fire!

440
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:56,936
Ah!

441
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,769
[TATSUMI]
She's even worse!

442
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:00,703
[Shivers]

443
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:03,903
I have a bad feeling
all of a sudden.

444
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:39,969
[Music playing]
