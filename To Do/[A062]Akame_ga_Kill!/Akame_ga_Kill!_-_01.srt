00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,776
[explosion]

2
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:10,811
Whoa!

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,045
[rumbling growl]

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,347
[MERCHANT]
It's an Earth Dragon!

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,682
[deep roar]

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,784
[horrified screams]

7
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:26,426
[TATSUMI]
Class One Danger Beast... Right.

8
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,594
An Earth Dragon.

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,395
This should be fun.

10
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,331
[rumbling growl]

11
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:36,036
Aah, don't be mad.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,139
I'll take care of ya!

13
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,455
[MERCHANT]
That was incredible, kid!

14
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,292
You took down a Class One
Danger Beast all by yourself!

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,695
Aww, it was nothing!

16
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,030
Kinda like taking candy
from a big, scaly baby!

17
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,331
...uhh...

18
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,200
Oh yeah, and the name's
Tatsumi by the way.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,435
The whole capital's gonna know
my name before too long,

20
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,471
so you might wanna remember it.

21
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,041
[MERCHANT 1]
So you're going to the Imperial
Capital to seek your fortune?

22
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,476
Yep! Where I come from,

23
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,912
everyone dreams of making
it big in the capital.

24
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,683
[MERCHANT]
Look kid, the Imperial Capital
isn't some perfect dreamland.

25
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,985
Sure it's the big city,
but it's been overrun

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,921
with monsters even more vicious
than this Earth Dragon here.

27
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,189
[TATSUMI] I don't get it;

28
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,191
how can the city be full
of Danger Beasts?

29
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,293
Not those monsters.
They're humans,

30
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,161
but with the hearts of monsters.

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,198
Damn place is
crawling with them.

32
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,733
[TATSUMI]
Thanks for the warning, guys,

33
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,069
but there's no way I'm gonna
turn around and go back now.

34
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,138
You see, me and my friends,

35
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,707
we have a mission:

36
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,274
to make a fortune,

37
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,211
and save our village!

38
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,015
[NARRATOR] All people must
one day turn to ash,

39
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,451
so too must nations
fall to ruin.

40
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,522
Despite the capital's wealth
and prosperity,

41
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,858
it has become mired
in corruption.

42
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,860
The pompous, and the vile,

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,329
run rampant
throughout the city.

44
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,098
These demons are
beyond salvation.

45
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:16,069
And are therefore silenced
in the darkness

46
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,606
by an elite group of assassins.

47
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,842
[music playing]

48
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,073
Oooh maaan...

49
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,776
The capital's even bigger
than I thought!

50
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,746
If things work out here,
I can just BUY the village!

51
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,582
All right, I better get
to the barracks.

52
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,586
[RECEPTIONIST] So you'd
like to enlist, would ya?

53
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,756
All right, just fill out the
form and bring it back to me.

54
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,658
[TATSUMI]
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

55
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,026
This says I'd be
starting as a private.

56
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,261
You think you're special?

57
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,530
[TATSUMI]
Not starting from the bottom!

58
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,198
I'm way too good for that.

59
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,935
I was thinking something
more along the lines of a,
say, captain!

60
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,304
[RECEPTIONIST] Get the hell
outta here!
[TATSUMI] WAAHHH!

61
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,306
Hey, c'mon, can I at
least take the test?!

62
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,675
There's a depression going on!

63
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,242
I already got more applicants
than I can handle!

64
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm not gonna waste a spot
on some stupid kid!

65
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,147
Huh? A depression?

66
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,949
[RECEPTIONIST]
Now get outta here! Beat it!

67
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,287
[sighs]

68
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,089
Maybe I could stage
like a kidnapping

69
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,191
and save the day just in time...

70
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,458
Nah, that's too obvious.

71
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,327
[LEONE] Hellooooo!

72
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,762
[TATSUMI] Hmmm?

73
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,898
[LEONE] What's with the long
face there, little guy?

74
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,333
It'll be all right, Big Sis is
here to cheer you up!

75
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,036
[TATSUMI] Aaaahhhh...

76
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,606
<i>I think I love this place!</i>

77
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:06,372
[LEONE] Hm?

78
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,141
Try to focus here, buddy.

79
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,209
[TATSUMI] Ahhhhh...

80
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,343
So, let me guess!

81
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,612
You came in from the countryside

82
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,346
in search of fame and fortune,
didn't you?

83
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,480
[TATSUMI] How'd you know that?!

84
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,282
I've lived here for a long time.

85
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,885
By now, it's super easy
to spot a new face.

86
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:23,557
Hey! I know the secret to
becoming an officer in
the army super quick.

87
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,390
Tell me!

88
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,626
[LEONE] You really wanna know?

89
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:26,793
Ahuh, ahuh.

90
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,796
Well... first you gotta
treat me to lunch.

91
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,532
[gulp, gulp]

92
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,370
Man! Never too early in the day
for some hooch, am I right?!
(belch)

93
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,305
Go ahead, drink up! There's
still a little more left.

94
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,743
Look just forget the drinks
and tell me how to become
an officer!

95
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,580
[LEONE]
Yeah... well, about that, uh...

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,915
First you're gonna need
a lot of money.

97
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,250
Money?

98
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,484
[LEONE] Ya' see I...

99
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,920
just happen to know
someone in the army.

100
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
He could hook you up
if you make it worth his while.

101
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,825
Okay then.

102
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,526
Let's see...

103
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,661
Will this be enough?

104
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,529
Whoo! Whadda we have here?!

105
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,897
It's just some reward money

106
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,700
from killing a Class One
Danger Beast, no biggy.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,367
Hmmm?

108
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,802
Big guy...

109
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,871
You might just jump
straight up to captain!

110
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,140
Yeah? Let's hope so!

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,712
I believe our little
encounter's been educational
in more ways than you know, kid.

112
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,547
Right, I'm gonna talk to him.

113
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,748
You wait here, okay?

114
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,684
Seee yaaa!

115
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,723
[music playing]

116
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,397
Hey buddy, I'd like to go home
sometime tonight, ya know.

117
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,700
Oh, I'm just waiting here
for somebody.

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,167
Yeah, sorry to tell
you this son,

119
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,103
but she took your money and ran.

120
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,071
Huh?

121
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,439
HUH?!

122
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,774
Don't you know better than

123
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,375
to just hand some stranger
everything you got?

124
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,778
I gotta go find her!
Which way did she go?!

125
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,313
[BARTENDER]
Don't waste your time.

126
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,081
It's your own fault
you got scammed.

127
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,850
Aaaaaaaa...

128
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,120
[TATSUMI]
Aaww, this totally sucks!

129
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,055
That was every penny I had!

130
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,223
Damn that rack!

131
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,958
No wait,
better yet damn that girl!

132
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,794
I guess that was
my "educational experience".
[LEONE] (evil cackle)

133
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,329
(grrrrr)

134
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,031
Awww...

135
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,568
None of the people back at the
village are such liars.

136
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,570
Guess...

137
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,238
I'm sleeping outside.

138
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,040
Don't really have
a choice, do I?

139
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,975
[ARIA] (gasp) Stop right here!

140
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,113
[GAURRY] Are we really
doing this again, milady?

141
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,649
[ARIA] You know I can't help it!

142
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,017
This is just the way I am.

143
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,452
[ARIA] Excuse me.

144
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,521
Um, if you need someplace to
rest your head tonight,

145
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,690
you're welcome to
come home with me?

146
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,193
Uh... thanks, but I'm broke.

147
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,695
[ARIA](giggle)

148
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,530
Well if you weren't, you
wouldn't be here, now would you?

149
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,066
Lady Aria has a bit of a
weakness for helping

150
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,534
those with nowhere to go.

151
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,169
[BODYGUARD] You really
should accept her offer.

152
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,137
Pretty please.

153
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:55,075
Well, uh,
it's better than sleeping out
on the street I guess.

154
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,777
Great, let's go home!

155
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,513
[FATHER] Oh! Looks like Aria
brought home another guest.

156
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,782
[MOTHER]
Oh my! So it would seem.

157
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,717
How many does this make?
[ARIA] Mother!

158
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,753
Uh... oh!
Thank you so much for having me.

159
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,222
[TATSUMI]
Those guys are really big.
[FATHER] (laughs)
Don't be so nervous, young man!

160
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,957
[TATSUMI] Must make it easier
[MOTHER]
Would you like something to eat?

161
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,125
<i>to let complete strangers</i>
<i>stay at your house</i>

162
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,227
<i>with security like that.</i>

163
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,029
<i>You can feel pretty safe.</i>

164
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,732
And just when I thought
everyone in the capital
[Heavenly chorus]

165
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,702
<i>were all a bunch of</i>
<i>evil scumbags!</i>

166
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,037
[TATSUMI] I really
appreciate all of this!

167
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,012
So your plan is...

168
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,380
to make a name for yourself
in the Imperial Capital.

169
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,348
Is that correct?

170
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,650
Right!

171
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,984
[FATHER] As you may know,

172
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,220
the capital is a wonderful
and peaceful place.

173
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,991
However, it is bordered
by squabbling tribes
on three sides.

174
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,126
If you are to enlist,

175
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:49,195
you may be expected to go
and join the fight.

176
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,597
I'm prepared for that.

177
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,098
Yes, I'm sure you are!

178
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,333
Seems you've got spirit.

179
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,935
I like to see that
in a young man.

180
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,738
Did you come all the way here
by yourself, Tatsumi?

181
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,140
[TATSUMI] No, I'm not alone.

182
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,908
There's three of us.

183
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,681
[TATSUMI] We're gonna hit
the road now, Mayor!

184
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,183
[MAYOR] Well, you three have
been pushing each other

185
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,818
since you were just children.

186
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:12,986
It's time to use that energy

187
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,688
to make something good
of yourselves.

188
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:15,956
You can count on us, sir!

189
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,558
We'll bring fortune
back to the village.

190
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,493
That's right, nobody's
gonna starve on our watch!

191
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:21,995
Give it about ten years or so,

192
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,865
and everybody for miles
around'll know the name Ieyasu!

193
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,633
Sure, as long as you
don't get arrested

194
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,134
and have your head
chopped off before then.

195
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,871
Jeez, Sayo, do you always
have to be so morbid?!

196
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,973
[MAYOR]
They're as spirited as always.
[SAYO] At least I have
a sense of direction,

197
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,474
[SAYO]
you should try working on that!

198
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,042
Oh and Tatsumi,
I have something for you.

199
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,544
[IEYASU] Maybe you should try
shuttin' your big dumb face!

200
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,646
[MAYOR] It's a parting gift.

201
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,047
If times get tough...

202
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,550
I'll sell it.
[MAYOR] The hell you will!

203
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,287
[MAYOR] Look just keep it
on you at all times.

204
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,090
It ensures God will protect you.

205
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,694
[TATSUMI] Okay...
Thank you very much!

206
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,730
[TATSUMI] At first, it
seemed like everything was
going pretty smoothly.

207
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,566
But then we got attacked
by bandits, and well...

208
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,567
We lost each other.

209
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,835
Ooh...

210
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,436
Both of them are
decent fighters at least,

211
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,205
so I'm not TOO concerned.

212
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,642
It's just that Ieyasu still
can't navigate his way
out of a paper bag.

213
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,976
What was that?!

214
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,477
We planned to meet each other
at the capital,

215
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,146
but I don't think
he's gonna make it.

216
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,881
[FATHER] Then it's settled.
[TATSUMI](huh?)

217
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,818
I think I have a friend in the
military who can help you.

218
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,085
I'll give him your name,

219
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,321
and ask him to look for
your two friends.

220
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,256
That'd be great!

221
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,490
Again thank you so much!

222
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,893
I have an extremely
keen intuition.

223
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,463
So I just know you'll see
your friends again very soon.

224
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,232
That'd be great.

225
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,804
<i>I've been so lucky...</i>

226
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:41,007
<i>I ended up finding some great</i>
<i>people to look out for me.</i>

227
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,110
<i>Now there's just</i>
<i>Sayo and Ieyasu.</i>

228
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,781
<i>I hope they found their way</i>
<i>to the capital safe and sound.</i>

229
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,355
[ARIA] Oh! We should go
to that shop next!

230
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,691
[BODYGUARD] Please wait, milady!

231
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,327
Whoa, Lady Aria's a pretty
serious shopper, isn't she?

232
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,431
I mean, I don't think I've ever
seen so much stuff before.

233
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:06,733
The young lady does enjoy it,

234
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,570
but I assume all women
behave this way, yes?

235
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,637
I don't know.

236
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:11,905
I have this other female friend

237
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,674
and she just kinda wears
whatever she has.

238
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,141
That's because I'm poor,
you jerk!

239
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,743
Oh, and Tatsumi...
[TATSUMI] Yeah?

240
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,945
You see the castle over there?
[TATSUMI] Huh?

241
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,748
That is the center of
the entire empire.

242
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,751
It's where everything happens.
[TATSUMI] Whoa!

243
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,620
I've always wanted to see
where the emperor lives

244
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,789
and makes decisions
for the whole country!

245
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,291
Well... not exactly.

246
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,793
Uh...

247
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,962
There is an emperor,
but he's only a child.

248
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,398
Our land is plagued
by corruption.

249
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:42,569
It's the minister who controls
the emperor from the shadows.
[TATSUMI] Minister‐!

250
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,905
[GAURRY]
Do not let yourself be heard.

251
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,041
Those who oppose are beheaded.

252
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,876
So... he's the one who ordered

253
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,878
all those heavy taxes
on my village.

254
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,214
[GAURRY]
The entire capital knows.

255
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,182
(grrr...)

256
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,953
On top of that,
we're dealing with this scum.

257
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,289
[TATSUMI] Night Raid?

258
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,292
[GAURRY] A band of assassins
terrorizing the area.

259
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,830
As the name implies,
they tend to attack at night.

260
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,432
High‐ranking officials
and the upper class

261
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,100
make up most of their targets.

262
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,203
It's only wise
to be very cautious.

263
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,338
Right!

264
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,706
But for the time being...

265
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,042
let's do something about THAT.

266
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,478
What'm I s'posed to do?!

267
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,055
Well, well. Now I can add
another entry to my diary.

268
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:38,058
What an addicting
little hobby this is!

269
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,826
[swish]

270
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,461
Ah...

271
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,068
[splat]

272
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,508
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,142
Huh?!

274
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,477
What was that?

275
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,245
Trouble.

276
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,116
<i>There's no way...</i>

277
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,322
[TATSUMI] It's them.

278
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,137
It's Night Raid.

279
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,907
[TATSUMI] What do they want?

280
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,775
I can only assume they've
targeted this family

281
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,944
because they're rich.

282
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,478
<i>What do I do?</i>

283
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,481
<i>Help the guards fight,</i>
<i>or protect the family?</i>

284
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,384
Hey, Akame, those three
guards are targets too.

285
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,222
I'll take care of it.

286
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,193
[BODYGUARDS] Woah!

287
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,770
[GAURRY]
Do not let that sword touch you.

288
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,205
(growls) Let's go!

289
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:11,985
I knew of the corruption,
yet could not escape it's grasp.

290
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,656
Who the hell are these
monsters?! No!

291
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:18,391
(gunshot)

292
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,227
[MINE] Not much of a bodyguard,
if he's gonna just run away.

293
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,064
Yeah? I think anyone would
probably run from that.

294
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:27,133
[TATSUMI] <i>They were wiped out...</i>
<i>in seconds...</i>

295
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,670
I have to save Miss Aria!

296
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,772
[FATHER] (choking)

297
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,239
Please, spare me!

298
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,075
Please, I have a little girl.

299
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,978
[LEONE] It's okay.
You won't for much longer.

300
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,813
No, please don't kill her.

301
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,515
I beg you, have mercy on us!

302
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,049
[LEONE] "Mercy"?

303
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,586
I'm not sure I'm
familiar with that word.

304
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:48,522
[FATHER](choking)

305
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,891
[BODYGUARD]
Hurry, Milady, this way!
[ARIA] (frantic running)

306
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,426
[ARIA] What's happening?!
[BODYGUARD]
Just get to the shed for now,

307
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,596
you'll be safe there!

308
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,197
[TATSUMI] There you are!

309
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,565
(panting)

310
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,767
[ARIA] Tatsumi?

311
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,268
[BODYGUARD]
Okay, great, you made it.

312
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,370
I'll hide the young lady
and wait for the guards.

313
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,907
See what you can do to stall
the enemy until then.

314
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,074
Got it?

315
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,911
You really expect me
to take out‐

316
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,415
Well... Looks like it's
too late to complain!

317
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:18,785
[AKAME] You're not a target.

318
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,220
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

319
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,525
[BODYGUARD] Dammit!
(gunfire)

320
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,126
[AKAME] But you are.

321
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,299
[AKAME] You're done.

322
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,974
(small scream)

323
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,581
You deserve this.

324
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,349
[TATSUMI] Stop right there!

325
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,953
I told you, you're not a target.

326
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,487
You don't have to die.

327
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,790
Yeah? Well, I can't let you
murder a helpless little girl.

328
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,792
[AKAME] Mm‐hm.
[TATSUMI] Uh...

329
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,126
[AKAME] So you won't step aside?

330
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,428
Well, I'm not gonna
back down now!

331
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,165
[AKAME] Hmmph.
Then you've made your choice.

332
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,434
[LEONE] Ahhh, that was easy!

333
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,670
(huh?)

334
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,871
That's weird.

335
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,473
It's not like Akame
to take this long.

336
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:14,775
Wait, what?!

337
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,510
Ah, jeez.

338
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,345
That poor guy can't
catch a break can he?

339
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,382
[TATSUMI] <i>She's better than me.</i>

340
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,251
<i>I don't stand a chance</i>
<i>against her.</i>

341
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,621
<i>But I don't have time</i>
<i>to worry about that.</i>

342
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,189
<i>If I can't save one girl,</i>

343
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,458
<i>how can I possibly expect</i>
<i>to save my entire village?</i>

344
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,135
What the‐ (ugh)

345
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,772
(gasp) Tatsumi!

346
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,049
[TATSUMI] Why'd you
back off all of a sudden?

347
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,819
Because it felt like
I hit some kind of armor.

348
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,320
[TATSUMI] (laughs)

349
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,023
I guess the villagers were
looking out for me after all.

350
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,558
<i>Well now...</i>

351
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:07,794
<i>He's lasted quite a while</i>
<i>in a fight against Akame.</i>

352
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,630
<i>He must be pretty decent.</i>

353
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,599
She must die.

354
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,234
Hey, wait a minute, lady,
you just said you wanted

355
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,136
to steal this girl's money,
don't you?!

356
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,704
You don't have to kill her!

357
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,406
This isn't a war; there's no
reason to kill innocent people!

358
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,441
Please!

359
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,677
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>she's listening to me.</i>

360
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,148
[AKAME] (huh?)

361
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,150
What are you doing?

362
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,885
We've got some time left.

363
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,187
And I kinda owe
this guy a favor.

364
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,057
I'm pretty sure
he'd like to cash it in now.

365
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:38,859
(yells)

366
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,360
Hey, you're that girl
with the boobs!

367
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,529
(giggles)
Yep, that's what they call me!

368
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,597
(snarls)

369
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,031
[LEONE] Listen, earlier
you were concerned

370
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,300
we were here to kill
innocent people.

371
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,969
I think you might
see things differently

372
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,004
when you find out
what's behind that door.

373
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,773
(BAMMM!)

374
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,909
Here it is.

375
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,844
Welcome to the capital, kid.

376
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,817
[TATSUMI] What... is all this?

377
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,318
[LEONE]
We learned that they fancied

378
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,621
picking up out‐of‐town
newcomers from the countryside,

379
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:11,491
and then torture them to death
for their own sick, twisted
entertainment.

380
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,995
That's the reality of this
"poor, innocent, HAPPY
little family".

381
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,830
[TATSUMI] (gasps)

382
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,765
Sayo...

383
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,968
No... that's... that's Sayo...

384
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,137
Do you know who that girl is?

385
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,740
[LEONE] Oopsy!

386
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,709
You didn't really think we were
through with you yet,

387
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:29,976
did you, sweetie pie?

388
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,245
[TATSUMI]
These people really did this?

389
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,614
Yes, they did, and their guards

390
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,649
are just as guilty
for keeping it hidden.

391
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:36,783
She's lying!

392
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,185
I had no idea anything
like that was going on!

393
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,420
Who would you believe?

394
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,355
These... these murderers,

395
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,024
or the one who saved you?!

396
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,626
[IEYASU] Tatsumi?

397
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,129
Is that... Is it you?

398
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,731
It's me...

399
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,399
[TATSUMI] Ieyasu?!

400
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,969
[IEYASU] She invited us
to stay at her house.

401
00:18:56,069 --> 00:19:00,140
She gave us something to eat,
and then everything went black.

402
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,008
Then we woke up here...

403
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,077
And... and then that girl...

404
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:08,248
That GIRL tortured
Sayo to death! (sobs)

405
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,218
Fine, fine so I did it, okay?!

406
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,188
These trash are
just worthless filth.

407
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,422
They're nothing but, but...

408
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,859
livestock for me
to use as I see fit!

409
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:22,395
Garbage like her doesn't
have the right to such
beautiful hair.

410
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,997
Mine is always
giving me trouble,

411
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,432
so I treated her EXTRA special!

412
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,702
She should be honored that I
gave her so much attention!

413
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,604
Ungrateful PIG!
(hysterical breathing)

414
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:34,541
Sorry honey, I don't mean
to interrupt your
little tantrum here.

415
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,943
But you are kind of disturbing.

416
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:37,911
I'll kill her.

417
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,379
[TATSUMI] Wait.

418
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,115
You're kidding? You're still
going to defend her?

419
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,149
[TATSUMI] No.

420
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,285
(swish) I'LL do it!

421
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:05,238
<i>Hmm... Well, that was quick.</i>

422
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,373
<i>He didn't even hesitate.</i>

423
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,209
<i>Granted,</i>
<i>she was pretty heinous.</i>

424
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,778
[IEYASU]
(chuckles) Thank you, Tatsumi...

425
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,581
I needed to see that...
(coughs up blood)

426
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:16,049
Ieyasu!

427
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,018
(groaning)

428
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:19,052
No...

429
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,721
[AKAME] It's the Lebola virus.

430
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,690
The mother enjoyed poisoning
people with different medicines.

431
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,427
She even kept a diary detailing
each victim's reactions.

432
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,530
It's too late for him.

433
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,998
[IEYASU] Tatsumi...

434
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,099
Ieyasu!

435
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,300
You should know...

436
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,069
that Sayo never did break...

437
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,371
She never let herself give in...

438
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,007
She was incredible...

439
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,710
So, I wanted to...

440
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,346
to go out a hero...

441
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,652
His strong will was the only
thing that kept him alive.

442
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:55,522
(fighting tears) What the hell
is wrong with this place?!

443
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:57,591
Let's go.

444
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:58,692
Hey.

445
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,994
Don't you think we should
bring him with us?

446
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,829
Hmm?

447
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,798
[LEONE] We could use
an extra pair of hands.
[TATSUMI](gurk) (struggles)

448
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:07,200
Plus he seems to have potential
and a little luck on his side.

449
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,835
[TATSUMI]
Wait! I need to bury my friends!

450
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,171
Oh, if you want,
I can take the bodies
[TATSUMI] (struggles)

451
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,773
back to the hideout later, okay?

452
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,641
Just relax!
[TATSUMI] I told you,
I need to bury my frineds!

453
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,443
You're late!
What took you so long?
[TATSUMI] (struggles)

454
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,145
And who's this guy?

455
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,480
A new recruit!

456
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:23,750
HUH?
[LEONE] Oh, yeah,
I forgot to tell you.

457
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,286
[LEONE] Starting today,
you're part of the team!

458
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,890
Congratulations,
you just joined the Night Raid!

459
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:32,659
Wait,
don't I get a say in this?!

460
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,527
Just give up.

461
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,328
Leone always gets her way.

462
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:38,799
Look at that, my best friend
knows how it works!

463
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:40,934
Bulat, he's all yours.

464
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:42,569
Put me down!

465
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,237
I don't wanna murder people!

466
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,206
[BULAT] Aww! It gets easier.

467
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,074
Huh? What does?

468
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,810
The mission is now complete.

469
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,444
We're heading back.

470
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,850
[TATSUMI]
Huh?! Where are we going?!

471
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,057
Awww, how did I get
myself into this?!

472
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,492
[music playing]
