1
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,438
(gentle wind blowing)

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,311
Wait...

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,480
[IEYASU] Sorry. It's time for
us to be moving on, Tatsumi.

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,650
The two of us will be
going this way.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,351
And you should head back, okay?

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,986
But how could you say that?

7
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,655
We've always stuck
together right?

8
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,558
You've got yourself a new group
of friends to look out for you.

9
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:28,128
C'mon, Tatsumi, we can't keep
babying you forever!

10
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,896
[IEYASU] Take care, man.

11
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:33,634
[SAYO] If there is an afterlife,
I'm sure we'll meet again.

12
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,335
No! Wait up!

13
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,336
Don't go!

14
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,303
Please!

15
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:39,439
Don't leave me here alone!

16
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,244
(gasps)

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,046
(uh...)

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,414
(soft sigh)

19
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,055
What a terrible dream...

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,624
(soft snoring)

21
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,460
What's she doing here?

22
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,230
(sleepy mumbling)

23
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,200
[SHEELE] Today, you'll be
training under me, Tatsumi.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,870
I look forward to
working with you.

25
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,271
[TATSUMI]
<i>Guess now it's her turn.</i>

26
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,707
Okay, then... (huh)

27
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,243
(mmm...)

28
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,314
[SHEELE] (sigh)
Good morning, friend.

29
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,288
(waaah!) Where are my glasses?!

30
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,223
Oh!

31
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,427
Let's try this again, shall we?

32
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you sure it's okay to leave
Sheele in charge of him?

33
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,202
(mmm) Oh, they'll be all right.

34
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,938
I am positive Sheele will
take a liking to him.

35
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,272
So, what makes you say that?

36
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,542
Tatsumi's quite popular
with older women.

37
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,912
Yep! That's why I call dibs
on being his trainer next!

38
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,379
See? He's a natural talent.

39
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,683
Ah, dammit, that is
such bullcraaaap!

40
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,721
You may go so far as to say
he's a lady KILLER.

41
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,256
Y'get it right?

42
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,958
Because he's an assassin?

43
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,393
(uuuuhhhh...)

44
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,231
Oh well, maybe next time.

45
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,699
So then about lunch...

46
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,401
I was thinking that I might
make some mapo beef bowls.

47
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,171
Well, I'd prefer if you
decide between mapo tofu

48
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,741
and beef bowls‐ (urk!)
[WOMEN] Sounds good!

49
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,877
[AKAME] And I'll top it off with
a little fried chicken, okay?

50
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,178
Fried chicken, too?!

51
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,513
Don't you think that's
a little bit much‐

52
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,281
Sounds good!
[LUBBOCK] Come on...

53
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,451
(sigh) Where the heck
do they put it all?

54
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:20,060
(unh, ugh...)

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,630
Congratulations, you learned
how to swim in armor!
[TATSUMI] (heavy panting)

56
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,735
[TATSUMI] (ugh) So heavy...
Man, that was really hard!

57
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:33,106
[SHEELE] It's a requirement as
part of our "How to Train
Assassins" curriculum.

58
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,975
I don't really do
any chores or anything,

59
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,211
so I kinda specialize in
training new recruits like you.

60
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,514
So why don't you do any chores?

61
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,518
[SHEELE] I tried to cook...
(whoosh!)

62
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,353
...but I burned the meat,
which made Akame a little upset.

63
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,089
Not the meat...

64
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:54,127
[SHEELE]
And I caused trouble for Bulat
when I tried to clean...

65
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,397
(laugh) Just let me do it.

66
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:01,568
[SHEELE] And Leone laughed at me
when I went shopping and
bought sugar instead of salt.

67
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,505
[LEONE] (boisterous laughter)

68
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,206
Why'd you buy so MUCH?

69
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,374
We tried laundry...

70
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,546
but I sorta ended up
washing Mine along with
all of the dirty clothes.
[MINE] (baaahhh!)

71
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,247
[TATSUMI]
Aww, don't feel too bad.

72
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,416
<i>Yesss! Great job!</i>

73
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,118
Oh, hey, I just realized.

74
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,285
Huh?

75
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,554
[TATSUMI]
When I first met the team,

76
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,255
you were the only one
who wasn't there.

77
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,757
(ack!)

78
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:28,895
Um... I'm sure there was a
reason, but I don't remember.

79
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,864
I'm such an airhead.

80
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,165
That's for sure.

81
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,068
[SHEELE]
I really do apologize. Oh!

82
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,837
Aww, not again...

83
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,777
So, how did you get into
this line of work?

84
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,512
Hmm?

85
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,850
Well, it's kind of
a complicated story.

86
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,688
I grew up in one of the older
parts of the Imperial Capital.

87
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:03,530
I've never been able
to do anything right.
(breaking glass)

88
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,700
I couldn't take pride in
a single thing I did.

89
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,572
People would always make
mean comments about me...
(laughing)

90
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:15,408
Like... like, maybe I was
crazy or something.

91
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,014
But thankfully...

92
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:27,721
I had a friend who was...
very kind to me.

93
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:31,157
No matter what happened
or how badly I messed up,

94
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,894
she never once made fun of me.

95
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,097
The time I spent with her was
the only ray of happiness

96
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,132
in my entire life.

97
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,503
But it...
it didn't last for long.
(rain & thunder)

98
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,170
(knocking on door)

99
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,274
One day I was visiting her
house, like I always did...

100
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,644
when a man came to the door.

101
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,047
He was her ex‐boyfriend.

102
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:58,318
He was furious and yelling
and breaking things.
(crash)

103
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,722
Then he tried to strangle her.

104
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:05,058
I think he was drunk
or on something.

105
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,729
My first thought was,
"I need to save my friend!"

106
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,438
I was surprisingly calm.

107
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,441
I couldn't believe
how quickly he died.

108
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,912
My friend was so scared
she started shaking.

109
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,583
But my head
was completely clear.

110
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,820
When it was all said and done,
the events of that night

111
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,156
were written off as
self‐defense.

112
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,425
But I never heard from my friend
again after that.

113
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,460
(mmm)

114
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,228
And then...

115
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:48,001
A few days later, the man's
friends came to get revenge.

116
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,770
They told me they'd
killed my parents

117
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,506
and they were going
to kill me next.

118
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,275
Despite all the awful
things they said,

119
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,944
I was incredibly relaxed.

120
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,881
(attack scream)

121
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,084
(urk...)

122
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,088
I killed them.

123
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,455
All of them.

124
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,558
One‐by‐one.

125
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,395
[THUGS] (ah!)

126
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,698
(panicked cries)

127
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,536
(gargh)

128
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,008
(ungh!)

129
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:31,678
That was the moment
I realized what I must do.

130
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,415
I'm good at this. At killing.

131
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,251
Maybe because
I'm a little crazy.

132
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,823
If I kill bad people, I can
make the world a better place!

133
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,527
I was a solo assassin
in the capital

134
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,730
when the Revolutionary Army
scouted me out.

135
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,832
<i>I guess everyone</i>
<i>has a rough past.</i>

136
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,167
<i>Something to carry with them.</i>

137
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,169
Do you... think I can do this?

138
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,572
[SHEELE] You'll do just fine.
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

139
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,874
(giggles)

140
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,142
(small sigh)

141
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,512
[SHEELE] Well, unlike me,
you're a very talented cook!

142
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,013
<i>THAT'S what you</i>
<i>thought I meant?</i>

143
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,049
[BULAT]
You're doing great, Tatsumi!

144
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,283
Huh?

145
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,219
(confident laugh)

146
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,891
<i>Y'know, maybe I'm</i>
<i>NOT up for this.</i>

147
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,396
[NAJENDA] Tatsumi, it seems
you've made a full recovery.

148
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,332
We've acquired
Zanku's Imperial Arms.

149
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,968
I want you to try it on.

150
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,570
Wow, you sure?!

151
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,704
It's for me?!

152
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,405
That one's all yours, sugar.

153
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,708
Careful, these things are known
for putting a lot of pressure

154
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,043
on your mind and body.

155
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,646
[TATSUMI] <i>This eyeball thing</i>
<i>may not look all that cool,</i>

156
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,182
<i>but its abilities are</i>
<i>actually pretty amazing!</i>

157
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,519
It wasn't in my book anywhere,

158
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,654
so we still don't have
much information on it.

159
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,823
Zanku was reading
people's minds with it.

160
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,958
See if you can make it work.

161
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,928
You're thinking...

162
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,736
"I can't wait to
eat meat tonight!"

163
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,304
[AKAME] (gasps) That's amazing!

164
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,574
[LEONE] Nope. He hasn't even
activated the stupid thing yet.

165
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,043
Well, I sure don't want him
to read MY mind.

166
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,514
It's supposed to have five
sights so quit stalling
and try one out.

167
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,249
Jeez, take a chill pill.

168
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,684
Okay...

169
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,522
O, random ability that
I don't know about...

170
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,289
activate now!

171
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,496
Whadda'ya see?

172
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,233
(waaahhh!)
[MINE] Don't have a cow!

173
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,669
Whoever invented
Imperial Arms...
[MINE] What's your problem?

174
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,571
<i>was an absolute genius!</i>

175
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,405
(ungh)

176
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,542
[LUBBOCK]
Crap, it's rejecting him!

177
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:42,976
I'm taking it off.

178
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,778
Man, my head really hurts...

179
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,379
It's not a match.

180
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,048
Your affinity's a little off.

181
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,851
You probably just didn't
like the way it looked
with your sweater.

182
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,353
They say your first impression
of an Imperial Arm

183
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,256
shows how well
you bond with it.
[TATSUMI] (uh...)

184
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,825
[NAJENDA] Let's have
headquarters examine it.

185
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,828
I'm sure it'll be a great asset
once we know a little more.

186
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,698
[AKAME] Sometimes on our
missions, we come across targets

187
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,834
who have Imperial Arms,
just as Headhunter Zanku did.

188
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:11,404
Our superiors prefer we try to
steal ‐ or destroy ‐

189
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,074
as many of them
as we possibly can.

190
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,376
[TATSUMI] So with every
Imperial Arms we get,

191
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,712
we're helping to further
advance the revolution?

192
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,180
That's right.

193
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,283
Here's a book about Imperial
Arms I'd like you to read.

194
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,486
There's so many...

195
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:27,821
and they're all different!

196
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,556
It's really unbelievable.

197
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:33,426
[NAJENDA]
You should memorize the details
of every weapon in there.

198
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,561
[TATSUMI] Wow...

199
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,362
So which one is
the most powerful?

200
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,999
It depends heavily on the user.

201
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,068
That said,
if I had to make a choice...

202
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,405
One can manipulate ice.

203
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,173
Its owner is quite strong.

204
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,744
Fortunately for us, though,
she's not in the Capital
right now.

205
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,379
She's trying to subdue the
people in the north.

206
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,181
Why the people in the north?

207
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,619
[NAJENDA]
The prince of the northern tribe
is known as Numa Seika.

208
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:03,223
He's a legendary hero who fights
with a spear and has never lost.

209
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,892
Not only is he a master
strategist,

210
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,028
but his people trust him very
deeply,

211
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,031
which makes him a threat
to the Empire.

212
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,099
He took over the northern
fortress capital

213
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,236
and made it into a base
for his tremendous army.

214
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:21,274
Since then, his forces have
begun to invade more and
more aggressively,

215
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:26,246
so the Empire formed a special
unit to fight them off.

216
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,615
[LUBBOCK] I don't think we
need to worry about that.
[NAJENDA] (ungh)

217
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:32,619
It'll take a year to stop the
northern tribe's army,
even for her.

218
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,287
We can only hope.

219
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,623
(smirk) (confident laugh)

220
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,091
Well, I say bring it on!

221
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,326
Let's go and get as many of
these things as we can!

222
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,564
You're in an awfully good mood.
What's gotten into you?

223
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:46,800
There's still some Imperial Arms
out there that we don't
know about, right?

224
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,869
Well, that gives me a
really great idea.

225
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,371
I mean they can do all
these amazing things!

226
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,406
So what if... maybe...

227
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:57,744
What if there's even an
Imperial Arms that can bring
people back from the dead!

228
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,713
Y'know? Right?

229
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,215
If there is, I can bring
Sayo and Ieyasu back!

230
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,750
All we have to do
is keep looking!

231
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,218
[BULAT] Oh, honey.
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

232
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,720
[TATSUMI] What?

233
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,157
Not even an Imperial Arms can
bring the dead back to life,
Tatsumi.

234
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,694
We only get one shot at life.

235
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,829
No! No, you don't know
that for sure!

236
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,263
We just have to find
it out there!

237
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,900
Then what about
the first Emperor?
[TATSUMI] (uh)

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,836
If he could've done that,
he'd still be alive.

239
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,370
He probably saw it
was impossible

240
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,373
and that's why he made Imperial
Arms in the first place.

241
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,975
(aaahhh...)

242
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,678
Just forget it.

243
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,714
If you don't let go
of that weakness,

244
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,849
the enemy will surely see it.

245
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,483
And if that happens,

246
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,319
it'll get you killed.

247
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,322
(grrr...)

248
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,808
Tatsumi, shouldn't you be
going to bed soon?

249
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:05,546
[TATSUMI]
I was so happy when I thought
they might come back to life.

250
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,113
I knew it was crazy,

251
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:11,117
but I thought there might be
some small chance.

252
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,452
(sobbing)

253
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:16,256
I'm really not gonna get to
see them ever again, am I?

254
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,592
I thought I had accepted that...

255
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,294
(sobbing)

256
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,732
Tatsumi...

257
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,034
(sobbing)

258
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,713
I promise not to tell
anybody else about this.

259
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,549
So go on and cry
as much as you need to.

260
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,985
(sniffling)

261
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,354
Is it okay...
for you to be this nice to me?

262
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,191
It's all right.
I don't see any problem with it.

263
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,193
Maybe.
[TATSUMI] (quiet laugh)

264
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,495
Yeah, you would say that.

265
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,567
Sheele...
[SHEELE] (huh)

266
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,002
Thank you...

267
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,740
<i>I should be thanking you,</i>
<i>Tatsumi.</i>

268
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,613
<i>Because of you, I've found</i>
<i>another way to make</i>
<i>myself... useful.</i>

269
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,360
(dog‐like panting)

270
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,935
[SOLDIER]
You conquered the northern tribe
incredibly quickly.

271
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,070
Most impressive,
General Esdeath!

272
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,607
[ESDEATH]
I can't believe you were the
best they had to offer.
[SEIKA] (dog‐like panting)

273
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:44,811
How very disappointing.
(smack!)

274
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:50,216
Will we ever find an enemy
out there who can
satisfy my appetite?

275
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,519
(smirk)

276
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,824
[TATSUMI] Look at this place.
There's a lot going on!

277
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,126
[LEONE]
Yep! It's a lively part of town.

278
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,696
When you're born poor,
you gotta keep yourself busy.

279
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:03,997
So how've you been, Leone?

280
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,132
I could use one of
your backrubs!

281
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,268
Hey, we should go and
get a drink sometime!

282
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,371
Leone! Will you come and
play with me later?

283
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,740
Man, you sure are popular
with these people.

284
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,610
That's because this is the part
of town where I grew up.

285
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,680
I know it sounds crazy
but I was famous around here
for my back massag‐ (huh?)

286
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,014
[ANGRY MAN]
Look, it's Leone!

287
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,849
(angry mob)

288
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,552
Oh, crap!
[TATSUMI] (wah?) Uh, hey, wait!

289
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,689
Come back here!
Where's my money?!
Where is it?!

290
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:31,157
So, what do you think about
my old neighborhood?
(angry mob)

291
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,693
I love it!
It's really freakin' great!

292
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:35,529
I hope I don't end up on one
of your friend's hit lists.

293
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,131
[SOLDIER] Reporting in!

294
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,267
It appears General Nakakido and
General Hemi have defected.

295
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,403
They've abandoned their posts
and joined the rebel troops!

296
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,172
But General Nakakido was
an expert at combat.

297
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,510
The number of rebel forces is
increasing at an alarming rate.

298
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,945
If we don't move,
they could destroy the empire.

299
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,814
We must not lose faith!

300
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:57,718
They're situated so far south
that we may contend with them
at our leisure.

301
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:01,021
If we want to completely clear
out the seeds of rebellion,

302
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,890
then we should begin by
rounding them all up!

303
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,992
Isn't that right, Minister?

304
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,929
(laughing)
Well said, Your Highness!

305
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,532
I see you're keeping
your composure.

306
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,634
Our current issue...

307
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,704
(gnawing & smacking)

308
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,642
...is the rogue group of
assassins, not the rebels!

309
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:25,979
They killed Captain Ogre and
my dear relative Yokal.
(splat) (gunshot)

310
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,751
They murdered Headhunter Zanku
and took his Imperial Arms!
(shwack)

311
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:35,321
Damn Night Raid is making
a mess of the capital!

312
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,960
I'm gaining weight from
all this undue stress!

313
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,061
(gnawing & smacking)

314
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,964
I'm calling back
General Esdeath.

315
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,866
(gasps)

316
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,233
Um, forgive me, Minister,

317
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,935
but General Budo is
already here.

318
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:52,105
[MINISTER] I'm sure the Great
General has better things to do

319
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,841
than hunt down
a gang of bandits.

320
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,577
Esdeath, huh?

321
00:17:56,677 --> 00:18:01,114
Her accomplishments ARE
equal to that of Budo.
We can trust her.

322
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:07,053
[MINISTER]
She slaughtered 400,000
tribesmen by burying them alive.

323
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,289
I don't need her
to capture them.

324
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:14,127
I want her to track down
and kill as many of them
as possible!

325
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,730
[TATSUMI] (panting)

326
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,269
Whew, I think we lost 'em.

327
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,639
You okay, Sis‐ (huh?)

328
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,840
Wait...

329
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,575
Where's...

330
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:29,810
Leone?!

331
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,780
<i>Oh no, I can't find her.</i>

332
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,149
<i>And I have no idea where I am!</i>

333
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:40,587
(confused babbling)

334
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:41,755
[SERYU] What's this?

335
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,758
Looks like my Justice Sensor
has found something!

336
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,326
You there!

337
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,594
Huh?

338
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,863
You seem to need
assistance, citizen!
(boing ‐ boing)

339
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,698
(uh...) That uniform...

340
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,268
Proud member of the Imperial
Guard, Seryu, at your service!

341
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,437
<i>She's a guard...</i>

342
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,909
(sad) Woorf... Woorf...

343
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,878
Koro, you hungry, buddy?

344
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:05,879
We'll eat soon.

345
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:06,880
[KORO] Woof, woof?

346
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,650
Sorry... what IS that?

347
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,153
He's my Imperial Arms,
Hekatonkeiru!

348
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,722
Don't worry,
he only bites bad guys.

349
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,659
<i>He was in that book.</i>

350
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,094
Oh, that's right,
you needed help, didn't you?

351
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,563
[TATSUMI] No, no, I'm fine!

352
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,497
I just got a little
turned around.

353
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,733
I think I remember the name
of the place I was before.

354
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,502
I'll help you find it!
[KORO] (surprised) Woof!

355
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:31,004
I'm on patrol right now anyway!

356
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,975
Let's go.
I won't let you get lost.
[TATSUMI] (uh...)

357
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:36,242
(angry) Wooofff!

358
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,344
[SERYU] (huh?)
[KORO] (angry) Woorf! Woorf!

359
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:42,348
[TATSUMI] So uh...
do all the Imperial Guards have
a weird angry pet like this?

360
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,017
[SERYU] Of course not!

361
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,787
I'm the only guard
who has an Imperial Arms.
[KORO] (whimpering)

362
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:48,254
Koro... um...

363
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,724
Well, that's the name
I've given him anyway.

364
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:53,093
He won't cooperate with anyone
unless he can tell

365
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,329
they have an extremely high
affinity with him.

366
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:00,634
Supposedly, none of the
top‐ranked officers were
able to click with Koro.

367
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:04,738
So they started running tests
on low‐level grunts like me.

368
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:09,810
I was told that he responded
to my righteous heart
while I was getting examined.

369
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,547
And he's been my cute,
little companion ever since.

370
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:14,581
Right, Koro?

371
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,750
[KORO] (excited) Woorf! Woof!

372
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,852
Oookaaay...

373
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:25,225
[SERYU]
Okay, I'm pretty sure this is
the place you're looking for.

374
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,427
[TATSUMI] (relieved sigh)
Thank you so much.

375
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:31,064
I'm honored. And let me know
if you see anything evil.

376
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,199
You can depend on us
to rip it to pieces!

377
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,503
(nervous laugh) That makes me
feel safe, I guess.

378
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,472
[SERYU] Time to go, little
buddy! You still hungry?

379
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:43,376
Let's pick out a few death‐row
prisoners for you to snack on!
[KORO] (painful) Woorf! Woorf!

380
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,583
(big sigh)

381
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:52,252
<i>A guard with an Imperial Arms?</i>

382
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,588
<i>This could get ugly.</i>

383
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,790
<i>I'd better tell the boss.</i>

384
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,959
[SERYU] <i>I know it's</i>
<i>important to help people,</i>

385
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,396
<i>but I must be vigilant,</i>
<i>and locate Night Raid!</i>

386
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,600
<i>I MUST... for Captain Ogre...</i>

387
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:12,072
(yah!)

388
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:13,339
[OGRE] (laughing)

389
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,441
Those are some nice
punches there, Seryu!

390
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,579
You're getting stronger
every day, aren't cha?

391
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:21,481
I was lucky an
Imperial Arms chose me.

392
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:24,618
So now I will make myself
more powerful!

393
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,553
(hyah!)

394
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,289
My father told me something
before he died!

395
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,825
"Justice must never
submit to evil!"

396
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,628
[OGRE] Oh? Well if you're
that eager to improve,

397
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,798
I could give you a trump card.
How'd ya like that?

398
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:38,832
You'd really do that?!

399
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:40,500
[OGRE] I know a doctor
who's been looking

400
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,569
to perform a few experiments.

401
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,204
But I should probably warn you,

402
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,006
the procedure's gonna
hurt like hell.

403
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:47,641
No problem at all!

404
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:51,612
I'm willing to do anything I can
to help the fight against evil!

405
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:55,315
<i>Those monsters murdered</i>
<i>Captain Ogre!</i>

406
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,650
<i>Night Raid...</i>

407
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,319
<i>you will pay with your lives!</i>
