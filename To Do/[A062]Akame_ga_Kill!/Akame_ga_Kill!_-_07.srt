1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,269
[EMPEROR] General Esdeath...

2
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:05,672
For your success in conquering
the northern tribe,

3
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,009
We have arranged a reward
of 10,000 gold coins.

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,777
I'm grateful, Your Highness.

5
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,278
I'll send it to
the soldiers

6
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:14,581
still fighting to
protect our land.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,982
They will be pleased.

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,119
<i>Esdeath truly doesn't care</i>
<i>for money or power.</i>

9
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,989
<i>She is only concerned with</i>
<i>war and victory.</i>

10
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,558
<i>As long as I'm in control,</i>

11
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,960
<i>she can destroy whatever</i>
<i>she wishes.</i>

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,262
<i>Our interests can coexist.</i>

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,165
<i>She is the ideal puppet.</i>

14
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,868
Now that I've returned to the
capital from the northlands,

15
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,437
Your Majesty can once again
rest at ease.

16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,040
I shall be terminating
Night Raid next.

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,374
Quite an undertaking.

18
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,343
We would like to
compensate you for such

19
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,112
an ambitious achievement
with more than just money.

20
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,548
Is there something else
you'd prefer?

21
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,917
Actually, there is.
If I could choose anything...

22
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,185
[EMPEROR] Go on.

23
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,621
I believe I'd like to
try falling in love.

24
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,422
(huh?)
[MINISTER] (huh?)

25
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,560
Uh, yes, that sounds reasonable!

26
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,763
You ARE a single woman of
marriageable age, after all!

27
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,464
I will serve as your matchmaker!

28
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,800
So what is your opinion
of the minister here?

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,401
Huh? Wait, what?!

30
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,004
[ESDEATH] The Minister doesn't
take very good care of himself.

31
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,338
He will not live much longer.

32
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,709
Preposterous!
I'm in perfect health. (chomp!)

33
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,912
Well then, would you be so kind
as to tell us what you'd like?

34
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,082
First, let me warn you that I
can be terribly selective.

35
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,619
Very few men will come close
to my expectations.

36
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,588
Once I'm ready, I will
present you with

37
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,256
an extensive list of
my preferences.

38
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,926
(gritting teeth in pain)

39
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,196
(surprised)
[AKAME] Here.

40
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,931
I don't need you to
spoon‐feed me!

41
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,733
But it'll get cold.

42
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,967
(uh‐)

43
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,472
Okay, I guess you win.

44
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,374
(chomp)

45
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,145
[TATSUMI]
<i>Even after what happened...</i>

46
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,947
<i>Akame's so calm.</i>

47
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,650
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,985
<i>I can't believe that</i>
<i>girl killed Sheele.</i>

49
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,956
<i>I'm finally starting</i>
<i>to realize...</i>

50
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,491
<i>how painful this</i>
<i>job really is.</i>

51
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,562
[ESDEATH]
You know, it's strange.

52
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,764
I don't normally take an
interest in anything

53
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,232
besides war and bloodshed.

54
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,168
[MINISTER] Oh, we're talking
about love, I presume?

55
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,403
I don't even understand
this myself,

56
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,740
but I'm feeling a
desperate need for romance.

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,508
[MINISTER]
Desire for the opposite sex

58
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,477
is something all
living creatures feel.

59
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:08,081
I don't know if I'd use the word
"romance" in your case.

60
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,352
It's interesting, yet it's
still an animalistic instinct.

61
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,555
But for the moment, I must
channel all my energy

62
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,322
into eliminating Night Raid.

63
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,625
[MINISTER]
Ah, while we're on the subject.

64
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,629
I've come up with a new idea
that I think you'll like.

65
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,501
I have a special assignment for
you, my precious Three Beasts.

66
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,671
We will do anything you command
us to do, General Esdeath.

67
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,474
Yes ma'am, all of us
are your loyal and devoted
servants forever!

68
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:38,512
No matter what you wish, we will
carry out any order at any time.

69
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,746
Good.

70
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,184
Man, it's cold.

71
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,820
How am I supposed to
sleep like this?

72
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,954
I'll get some water.

73
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,790
(huh?) Akame?

74
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,526
Late‐night snack?

75
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,896
No, but they were always one
of Sheele's favorites.

76
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,363
<i>It's an offering.</i>

77
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,766
Since our work's always been
done behind the scenes,

78
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,604
Sheele's name probably isn't in
the Revolutionary record books.

79
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,572
So if I don't hold on
to her memory,

80
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,709
then it'll be just like
she was never here.

81
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,644
She might have been
absentminded,

82
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:14,380
but she was the kindest
person on the team.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,382
(choked up)
[TATSUMI] I agree.

84
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,884
And I see you still
leave flowers

85
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,053
at Sayo and Ieyasu's graves
sometimes too, don't you?

86
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,555
[AKAME] Yeah.

87
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,825
[TATSUMI]
Akame, you're pretty amazing.
[AKAME] (huh?)

88
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,594
You're handling your friend's
death so calmly.

89
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,362
I guess you're used to it.

90
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,032
I still can't‐ (huh?!)
(breaking glass)

91
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,800
You think that I'm...

92
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,368
I'm used to it?

93
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,804
[TATSUMI] Akame? (gurk!)

94
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,880
[AKAME] Sure... maybe
I've witnessed more deaths
than I care to count.

95
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,050
But this...
you don't ever get used to it!

96
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,020
Godammit! You just hide it
and you finish the mission!
[TATSUMI] (gasps)

97
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,390
I have to act like everything
is okay, but on the inside,

98
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,028
I've been falling apart!
(sobbing)

99
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,930
We're assassins, Tatsumi,

100
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,200
we have to be able to
switch things on and off.

101
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,604
You... You think that I'm calm?

102
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,674
(sobbing) Well you're wrong!
You don't know what it's like!

103
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,209
You don't know what
losing her means to me!

104
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,846
You don't know... (sobbing)

105
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,916
<i>I've never seen Akame</i>
<i>break down like this.</i>

106
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,786
<i>I guess I shouldn't</i>
<i>be surprised.</i>

107
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,922
<i>She was pretty worried about</i>
<i>me on my first mission.</i>

108
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,491
(ungh)
<i>What the hell's wrong with me?</i>

109
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,060
<i>Feeling sorry for myself isn't</i>
<i>gonna bring Sheele back!</i>

110
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,563
<i>I just need to move on and</i>
<i>remember why I'm here!</i>

111
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,999
<i>I need to grow up</i>
<i>and just be a man!</i>

112
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,767
(SMACK!)

113
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,770
(gasps)

114
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,573
<i>It's a dirty job,</i>
<i>but money is money,</i>

115
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:51,011
<i>and I have to keep my village</i>
<i>from starving until the</i>
<i>revolution is over.</i>

116
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:55,516
I have to do what I can for the
people I care about most!
(thump)

117
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,451
What did you do that for?!
Tatsumi, are you all right?

118
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,954
Yeah, I just needed to get
my head back together.

119
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,322
Don't worry about me.

120
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,425
I also wanna tell you
that I'm sorry.

121
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,893
That was insensitive of me.

122
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,995
And I wanna renew my
pledge to you:

123
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,967
I promise you I won't die
and I won't ever make
you sad again, Akame!

124
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,002
[AKAME] Tatsumi...

125
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,704
We're gonna make it
through to the end.

126
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,440
I want to see
the new nation together!

127
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,644
Yeah. I'd like that.

128
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:28,982
(hmph)

129
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,619
(ungh, uh)

130
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,026
YAH!

131
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,028
<i>Crap!</i>

132
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,931
(panting)

133
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,733
[TATSUMI]
One more round, all right?

134
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,402
Don't you think you might need
to rest up a little bit first?

135
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,471
[TATSUMI]
I don't have time for that!

136
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,574
Remember, we're pretending
this is a real fight,

137
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,008
so don't hold back!

138
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,376
Here I coooome...

139
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,377
(smack)

140
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,812
(arrrgggh!)

141
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,649
Dammit, Bro, what was that for?!

142
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,117
If you want to pretend
it's for real,

143
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,086
you should pay more attention
to what's around you.

144
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,455
There could always be another
enemy nearby. Understand?

145
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,524
(grrr...)

146
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:11,825
(chuckles)

147
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,360
Well, somebody seems
a little on edge today.

148
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,396
What's up?
[TATSUMI] Not much.

149
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,832
I just want to level up
as fast as I can.

150
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,701
I have to keep
my promise to Akame!

151
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,269
No matter what happens,
I have to survive!

152
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,540
I hope so...
[TATSUMI] (urk!)

153
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,775
[BULAT] Now that's the kind
of attitude I like to see!

154
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,644
You've come pretty far! Say!

155
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,113
Why don't you try sparring
with me for a little while?

156
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,414
I can whip you into shape!

157
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,116
Sure! Great!

158
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,885
You watch yourself!
I'm pretty good with a spear!

159
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:39,886
Heads up!

160
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:40,854
(ungh)

161
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,422
[BULAT]
Is that really all you got?!

162
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,790
[TATSUMI] (waaahhh)

163
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,593
Takes more than passion to
stay alive, you know!

164
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,394
Yeah! Yaaahhh!

165
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,730
[BULAT] Now come at me!

166
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,898
(Hah! Hyah!)
[AKAME] Good luck.

167
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,837
[CHORI]
Yet another devastated village.

168
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,905
A nation is nothing
without its people.

169
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,241
[SPEAR] You really do care,
don't you, Father?

170
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,511
Enough to return to the
snake pit of the capital.

171
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,712
It makes me proud.

172
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,681
This is no time
to cower in retirement

173
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,215
and let life pass me by.

174
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,185
I intend to fight that minister
till my very last breath.

175
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,121
And I intend to watch over you
every step of the way!

176
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,323
I'm lucky to have such
a brave daughter.

177
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,960
Now, if only you wouldn't scare
away all of your suitors.

178
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,029
Wha‐?! Now what does that
have to do with anything?!

179
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,130
(hearty laugh)

180
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,431
(loud disturbance)

181
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,200
What's happening out there?!

182
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,370
More bandits...

183
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,472
This area's getting worse
all the time!

184
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,008
Don't worry, Father.
I'll take care of this!

185
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,877
Everyone, ready!

186
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,412
Daidara...

187
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,047
Yep!

188
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,248
Take 'em out!

189
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,217
(YAAAHHH!!!)

190
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,953
YAH‐HA!

191
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,188
(gasps)

192
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,891
(ungh)

193
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,494
<i>I'm sorry, Father...</i>

194
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,330
[NYAU] Well, you're
a feisty one, aren't cha?

195
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,833
But considering everything
I'm about to do to you,

196
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,670
you're probably gonna wish you'd
been killed already. (giggles)

197
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,806
(waah ‐ ungh)

198
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,844
[CHORI] You...
you're an Imperial officer!

199
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,447
I am, and I once had a deep
respect for your diplomacy, sir.

200
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,618
Then why in God's name would you
do something like this?!

201
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:22,823
Because my master ordered it.
(snick ‐ sploosh)

202
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,895
And the wishes of my master
shall always be realized.

203
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,032
[DAIDARA] Look at this.
We took out like 15 guys.

204
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,435
Sweet, man! I'm gonna get so
many experience points for this!

205
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:38,004
Don't forget the notices.

206
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,574
If you ask me, the minister's
idea's a pain in the ass.

207
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,744
Why not pin it on his political
enemies like he usually does?

208
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,046
Because this plan would have
no effect on officials

209
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,281
under the protection of
Great General Budo.

210
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,016
[NYAU] Ah, are we done already?

211
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,752
[DAIDARA]
Nyau, stop screwing around!

212
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,154
[LIVER] You did make sure to
finish her off, didn't you?

213
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,457
(giggles) I was just in the
middle of skinning her face

214
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,925
when she died of shock.

215
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,762
[DAIDARA] You are one
messed‐up kid, you know that?

216
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,231
The mission is now complete.
Let's be on our way.

217
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,047
[NAJENDA]
Now that everyone is here, I'm
afraid I have some bad news.

218
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,016
Esdeath has taken
the northern tribe,

219
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,318
and has now returned to
the Imperial Capital.

220
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,453
(gasps)

221
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,090
Leone I would like you to make
your way to the capital

222
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,025
and figure out what
General Esdeath is up to.

223
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,028
You got it! I've been wondering
what that chick is like!

224
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,063
(sigh)

225
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,200
She's a disturbed psychopath
obsessed with killing.

226
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,134
Don't be careless.

227
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,469
All right, don't worry.
(chuckles)

228
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,206
<i>That means I can waste her if I</i>
<i>get the chance, doesn't it?</i>

229
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,475
<i>I heard that wackjob is</i>
<i>the strongest person</i>
<i>in the empire.</i>

230
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:53,279
<i>That puts her right up there</i>
<i>with the minister on</i>
<i>our hit list!</i>

231
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,284
Also, ever since her arrival
in the capital,

232
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,288
there's been an increase
in assassinations of
imperial officials.

233
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,660
As of today, four officers
and 61 bodyguards have
been murdered.

234
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,395
What concerns me are
these flyers they've
been scattering around

235
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,165
that claim Night Raid is
responsible for the homicides.

236
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,868
So they're trying to stick
the whole thing on us, huh?

237
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,704
But doesn't this sorta stuff
always get straightened out?

238
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,073
Those posters really don't
look all that legit.

239
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,342
[NAJENDA] That's how most people
felt about it at first.

240
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,712
But now, public opinion is
starting to change.
[TATSUMI] But why?!

241
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,382
[NAJENDA] All of the victims had
first‐rate guards when the
crimes were committed.

242
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,285
They couldn't have been
overpowered by ordinary thugs.

243
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,856
So basically, these guys
are going after the
big fish on purpose.

244
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,891
Only a few people
could pull that off.

245
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,426
That would only be us
or someone equally skilled.

246
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,428
It's safe to assume two things:

247
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,930
They probably have
Imperial Arms,

248
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,732
and they're working for
General Esdeath.

249
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,400
What is she trying
to accomplish?

250
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,902
She's trying to trick us.

251
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,505
She wants to lure us out in the
open so she can strike.

252
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,739
Now that we know it's a trap,

253
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,575
I want to throw one more
thing out there.

254
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:57,443
The people they're assassinating
are all competent individuals

255
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:01,682
who disagree with the minister's
policies and recognize the
need for revolution.

256
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,316
After we create the new nation,

257
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,687
allies like them will be
crucial to its success.

258
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,522
(exhales)

259
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,990
To put it simply:

260
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,159
We cannot afford to
continue losing them.

261
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,495
I'd like to hear
everyone's thoughts.

262
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,463
[TATSUMI] Listen...

263
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,600
I don't know very much about
all this political stuff,

264
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,402
but the idea of somebody abusing
Night Raid's name like that

265
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,738
really pisses me off!

266
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,206
Tatsumi...

267
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,874
You know, you're exactly right.

268
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:28,875
Thanks, man.

269
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,476
[ALL] (uh‐hmm)

270
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,046
Good! That settles it.

271
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,882
Show the bastards what happens
when they use our name.

272
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,418
Night Raid will not be sullied.

273
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,555
There are two of us that
they'll likely target next:

274
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,156
Akame and Lubbock.

275
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,492
Tatsumi and Bulat,
you will guard the person
I assign to you.

276
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,662
Sounds good to me.
Just tell us where to meet him,

277
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,030
and we'll take care
of everything.

278
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,132
Your charge will be boarding
a cruise ship

279
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,869
currently docked at the
grand canal near the
Imperial Capital...

280
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,337
the Ryusen!

281
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,406
[TATSUMI]
It's... IT'S HUUUUUUUGE!!

282
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,481
[TATSUMI]
<i>Looks more like a fortress</i>
<i>than a cruise ship.</i>

283
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:12,352
<i>Should be an interesting place</i>
<i>to intercept our targets.</i>

284
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:16,456
[LUBBOCK] Rice reserves, huh?
Must be pretty smart.

285
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:19,259
[AKAME] All that rice will
make a lot of people happy.

286
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,927
(stomach growls)

287
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,263
I guess I made myself hungry
just looking at it.

288
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,999
(sigh) You can have my rations
if you take out any enemies
that pop up.

289
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,001
We got a deal? (urk!)
[AKAME] (chomp!)

290
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,872
(stretching noises)
[LUBBOCK] No action here.

291
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,474
Looks like we completely
missed the mark this time.

292
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,776
Don't let your guard down yet.

293
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,612
I know, I won't.

294
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,847
<i>Tatsumi... Bulat...</i>

295
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:45,018
<i>If they're going</i>
<i>after your target...</i>

296
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,954
<i>Please... come back safe!</i>

297
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,632
[TATSUMI]
The guy we're protecting is
surrounded by bodyguards.

298
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,201
There's no way anyone could
even get close to him.

299
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,436
They probably aren't
gonna show up. (urk!)

300
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:06,773
The hell was that?
[BULAT] Don't be so quick
to assume, Tatsumi.

301
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,575
Wait... Bro?!

302
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,277
[BULAT] My trump card is
invisibility, remember?

303
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,747
And you never know
what our foes might do.

304
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,916
Yeah, you're right.

305
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,018
I guess I didn't think that
through, did I?

306
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,654
How many times would you say
you've smacked me in the head,
by the way?

307
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,724
[BULAT] Eh, sometimes you need
a little tough love.

308
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,391
(echoing) Love... LOVE...

309
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,694
Did you really have to
make it echo?!

310
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,297
Well anyway, I bet this armor is
really cool to have around.

311
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,534
It certainly made it easy
to sneak up onto the ship.

312
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:37,070
[BULAT] That's right.
Got me through the battle
with the southern tribe.

313
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,173
I kinda like to think
of it as my partner.

314
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,843
However, when it comes to
partnerships,

315
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,311
sometimes things aren't
always so simple.

316
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,482
[BULAT] (ungh)
Sir! I don't understand!

317
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,953
I mean how can they just
discharge you from the capital?!

318
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:57,524
I couldn't stand the thought
of having to bribe the new
minister, so I refused.

319
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,994
So if you want to move up in
rank, you just have to
give him some money?!

320
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,263
That's bullshit!

321
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,631
[LIVER] Calm yourself, Bulat.

322
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,234
I am going back to the capital
to plead my case.

323
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,504
Despite the position I'm in at
the moment,

324
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,038
I have done nothing wrong.

325
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,474
I am confident that
the court will see that.

326
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:15,842
[BULAT] General...

327
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,945
It wasn't fair that you were
placed under an officer like me.

328
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,081
I hope you can forgive me.

329
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:25,886
[BULAT]
Of course... I admire you.

330
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,187
But as you can imagine,

331
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,423
the court didn't end up
ruling in his favor.

332
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,859
And then some people who were
jealous of MY ability

333
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,161
started saying I was a criminal.

334
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,564
I was getting sick of it.

335
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,734
So I used Incursio to escape
before they could catch me.

336
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,469
Man, that's so messed up.
(huh?!)

337
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,972
[BULAT] Looks like my
invisibility's wearing off.

338
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,440
Better remove my armor.

339
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,242
But they know your face
from all the posters.

340
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,645
You can let me handle the
open public areas, okay?

341
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:55,181
[BULAT] Good thinking!
I'll go check the ship's hold.

342
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,455
I'd better keep an eye out for
anybody who looks suspicious.

343
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,091
Ha! Though I guess I look
pretty suspicious myself.

344
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,629
(flute music begins)

345
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:10,531
Who's playing a flute?

346
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,365
[ESDEATH]
I'll have your best dessert.

347
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,535
[VENDOR]
Uh yes, comin' right up.

348
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,206
<i>She's sitting right out</i>
<i>in the open.</i>

349
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,508
<i>I can sense it.</i>

350
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,644
<i>This is a trap to</i>
<i>draw us out!</i>

351
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:24,978
<i>That evil woman!</i>

352
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,814
<i>She's oozing with the</i>
<i>scent of hatred!</i>

353
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,084
<i>I can smell it all over her!</i>

354
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,053
<i>It was stupid of me to think</i>
<i>I could take her out</i>

355
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,321
<i>just because she was</i>
<i>easy to find!</i>

356
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,793
<i>It kills me, but I must follow</i>
<i>my instincts and withdraw.</i>

357
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,028
[ESDEATH] The aura's gone.

358
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,130
I guess they didn't
take the bait.

359
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,101
And I'd hoped to test out
some new torture techniques.

360
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,271
(hmm) My, that's pretty good.

361
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,875
Perhaps I'll treat everyone
when this job is done.

362
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:57,644
(flute music playing)

363
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,183
Your sweet melody sounds
as elegant as ever.

364
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,285
The cruise ship has left
the Imperial Capital

365
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,253
and no one can see us
from the shore.

366
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,155
It appears the timing
will be perfect.

367
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,124
[NYAU] I've been playing
for a long time now,

368
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,127
so all the passengers should
be nice and drowsy!

369
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,329
There may be people on board
who don't appreciate

370
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,031
the beauty of your music.

371
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,299
You'll have to be wary.

372
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,734
[NYAU] Of course...

373
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,135
[TATSUMI] (ungh)

374
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,270
What the heck is going on?

375
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,874
That flute must be causing this.
(ungh)

376
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,977
I gotta get outside!

377
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,914
(aggghhh)
I can still hear it out here!

378
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,849
It has to be an Imperial Arms.

379
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,385
[DAIDARA] Hey little fella,
it's supposed to be nap time.

380
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,556
And here I was gonna let you
live if you were sleepin'.

381
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,391
[TATSUMI]
You must be one of those Night
Raid posers I've heard about.

382
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,562
(laughing) Does that mean you
think you're the real deal?

383
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:49,863
This should be good.

384
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,497
Heads up!
[TATSUMI] (huh?!)

385
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,967
Hey, what's the sword for?

386
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,401
Gotta fight fair.

387
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,038
I wanna make sure I get
experience points for this.

388
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,706
Always looking to get stronger.

389
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,608
Come at me, little man!

390
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,743
Uh, fine.

391
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:04,344
I'll give you some experience.

392
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,346
But it's not gonna be pretty!

393
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,115
Ah, nice!
I like that confidence!

394
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,151
Man, it's gonna be fun
to crush you!

395
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,020
(eek)
(SMASH!)

396
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,289
Heh, heh!
[TATSUMI] (unh)

397
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,826
[DAIDARA]
Amazing you could dodge that
after the music debuff.
[TATSUMI] (breathing heavily)

398
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,995
That's okay.

399
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:25,799
Let's see how you handle THIS!

400
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,233
(uggghhh)

401
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,336
(uh!)

402
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,476
(nggghhh) Are those things
your Imperial Arms?

403
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,845
Yup! Double Great Axes Belvaac.

404
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:41,748
Bet a low‐level punk like you
can't even hit it!

405
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,517
(ungh!)

406
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,519
(grrr) In that case...
[DAIDARA] (huh?)

407
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:49,055
I guess I'll just have to
make it hit YOU!
[DAIDARA] (heh)

408
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,925
TATSUMI, YOU IDIOT!
[TATSUMI] (waaahhh!)

409
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,194
That guy was obviously getting
ready to finish you off

410
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,697
and you just barreled right in
there without even thinking
about it!

411
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,498
You need to learn
to be more responsible!

412
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:02,135
(ummm...) Hang on!
How do you have so much energy?

413
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:06,406
The Song of Lethargy was
supposed to put everybody
on the boat to sleep.

414
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:08,474
So that's what all that
racket was about?

415
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,311
Cheap crap like that
doesn't work on me.
[DAIDARA] What?

416
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,881
[BULAT] If you think playing a
little tune is enough to smother
the burning passion in my soul,

417
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,851
then you've got another
thing coming, my friend!

418
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,352
(huh?) Wait a sec...

419
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,522
Okay, I see what you did there.

420
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:25,191
You stabbed yourself
so you'd be too distracted
to hear the lullaby.

421
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,227
The name's Bulat of Night Raid.

422
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,862
You can also call me "Handsome".

423
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,564
Yeah, I don't think so, jackass.

424
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:33,066
I'm Daidara, servant of Esdeath.

425
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,735
[BULAT] Tatsumi...
[TATSUMI] (uh!)

426
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,203
[BULAT] It's very important for
you to pay close attention

427
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,339
to how I fight, okay?

428
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,775
Bro?

429
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,677
(hmph)

430
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:49,816
INCURSIO!

431
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,353
(swooshing sounds)

432
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,662
I am gonna get a ton of
experience points for this guy!

433
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,730
Behind you!

434
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,733
He's mine! I'm gonna crack
his skull open! (huh?!)

435
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,234
(urk!)

436
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,836
(ungh!)

437
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,606
(uuuhhh...)

438
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,075
(gasps)

439
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:16,276
[BULAT] See?
(patter of raining blood)

440
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,811
This is what I meant
when I told you

441
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:20,313
to always be aware
of your surroundings.

442
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:24,618
<i>He slaughtered the big guy</i>
<i>AND got the other two</i>
<i>off his back.</i>

443
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:28,522
<i>And... he did it</i>
<i>in a split second!</i>

444
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,459
Whoa, I always knew you were
a good fighter,

445
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,861
but that was awesome!

446
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,163
[BULAT] Damn straight!
Back in my soldier days,

447
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,633
they used to call me
Hundred‐Man Slayer.

448
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:43,136
[LIVER] I believe it was
a 128, to be exact.
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

449
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:44,838
You played a vital role
in getting rid

450
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:47,541
of covert operatives
back then, did you not?

451
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,310
I'd know that power and
that armor anywhere.

452
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,314
It truly has been a while,
hasn't it, Bulat?

453
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,916
[BULAT] (gasps)

454
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,351
<i>It's you...</i>

455
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,687
<i>General Liver!</i>
