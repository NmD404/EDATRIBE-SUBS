1
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:06,466
I am gonna get a ton of
experience points for this guy!

2
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,700
Behind you!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,833
Ugh!

4
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:11,300
Uh!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,100
[Gasps]

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,500
[TATSUMI]
<i>He slaughtered the big guy</i>

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,100
<i>and got the other two</i>
<i>off his back.</i>

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,066
<i>And... he did it in</i>
<i>a split second!</i>

9
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:25,866
[LIVER]
You played a vital role in
getting rid of covert operatives
back then, did you not?

10
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:29,000
It truly has been a while,
hasn't it, Bulat?

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,966
[BULAT]
It's you, General Liver!

12
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,466
[LIVER]
Former General, actually.

13
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,400
Ever since Master Esdeath
saved my life.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,100
I have been her devoted servant.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,500
[TATSUMI]
<i>Huh?</i>

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,700
<i>Is this the same guy Bro</i>
<i>was talking about</i>

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,066
<i>in the story from his past?</i>

18
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:04,033
[BULAT]
If things were different, I'd be
drinking a toast to our reunion.

19
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:08,533
But since they're not,
I'm going to have to kill you.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,933
The mission comes first!

21
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,466
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

22
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:18,466
General Esdeath's wishes
will be realized.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,700
And to ensure that
I am successful,

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,400
she gave me this Imperial Arms!

25
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:14,066
The Black Marlin,
it's a ring‐type weapon.

26
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,233
It was crafted from the
organs of aquatic Danger Beasts

27
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,766
with the power to control water.

28
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,700
As such, whoever wears it can
manipulate any liquid at will.

29
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,733
If this is our battlefield,
Lady Luck is certainly
smiling upon me.

30
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,000
[BULAT]
So you fight with water now.

31
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,633
Rather convenient that your
boss is an ice user.

32
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,133
[LIVER]
General Esdeath can create
ice out of thin air.

33
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,666
Do not elevate me to her level.

34
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:44,566
She is a god!

35
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,133
Water Fire!

36
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,566
Touchy, touchy...

37
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,133
[Grunts]

38
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,900
Son of a bitch...

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,966
And it looks like Liver's
got his hands full
with this guy, too.

40
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:59,766
Well, with all this water
around, I'm sure he
should be okay.

41
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,733
But a little backup
would be nice.

42
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,266
[TATSUMI]
Not if I can help it!

43
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,800
Aah!

44
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,533
You guys are frickin' crazy
if you think I'm just gonna
sit over there

45
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:09,733
and watch the whole time!

46
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,500
You're in the way.

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,266
Back off!

48
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,733
You Night Raid people are
really freakin' annoying!

49
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,633
[Grunts]

50
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:23,833
Uh!

51
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:25,500
Hehehe...

52
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,366
Ah!

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,533
Huh?

54
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,566
Heh...

55
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,233
Ahh!

56
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,033
Uh!

57
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,633
[TATSUMI]
<i>Damn, this kid is fast!</i>

58
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,200
Hehe...

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,433
<i>But I've trained for this.</i>

60
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:49,333
Akame is faster than you!

61
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,300
What?

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,600
Do not compare me to
some assassin!

63
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,100
[Panting]

64
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
[NYAU]
<i>If he hadn't gotten in</i>
<i>one lucky hit,</i>

65
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,533
<i>I'd have killed him already!</i>

66
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:07,033
[TATSUMI]
<i>How's he fighting like this</i>
<i>when he's injured?</i>

67
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,500
<i>These Three Beasts are so tough</i>

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,033
<i>they make guys like Ogre</i>
<i>look like child's play.</i>

69
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,133
[Growling]

70
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:26,066
Whoa! The fight's starting to
get pretty intense over there!

71
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,400
Of course!

72
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,133
But it's a battle near
a body of water.

73
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,600
Sir Liver has the advantage!

74
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,966
Ha! Bro's about to mop the floor
with that old geezer.

75
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,166
Liver shall prevail!

76
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,333
He doesn't stand a chance!

77
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,700
The water pressure
will destroy you!

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,000
Say goodbye, Bulat!

79
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,433
[Roaring]

80
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,433
[LIVER]
Snake from the Abyss!

81
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:50,133
[Roar]

82
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,100
Ahhh!

83
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,433
[LIVER]
Hehehe...

84
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,666
It seems I correctly assumed
you would attack the snake

85
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,400
head‐on rather than dodge.

86
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,633
You knew there'd be
countless casualties

87
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,333
if I destroyed the ship.

88
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:12,266
And perhaps, you'd be able to
avoid my next technique

89
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,900
if your feet were planted
securely on the deck,

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,466
but you can't dodge in midair!

91
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,466
[LIVER]
Dark Water Spears!

92
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,233
[BULAT]
Gah!

93
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:26,666
Aah!

94
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:31,300
Takes more than a
splash of water

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,033
to extinguish the fire
in my soul!

96
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,500
[LIVER]
But of course.

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,866
I would never finish you off
with such a simple strike.

98
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,366
After all, I know what
you're capable of.

99
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:47,466
The two of us have been
through many a battle
together, remember?

100
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,466
I know all your strengths
and weaknesses

101
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:53,000
better than anyone else
in the world.

102
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,200
And that's precisely why
I'd like to show you

103
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,633
the power of my trump card!

104
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,066
Water Dragons...

105
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,000
Conquer Heaven!

106
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,433
[Roaring]

107
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,833
[BULAT]
Gah!

108
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:12,200
Aaaaah!

109
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,933
Hmm, I think I got him.

110
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,466
Huh?

111
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,366
[BULAT]
I can't believe you
actually just said that.

112
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,700
You should know better old man!

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,366
How did you survive that?!

114
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:28,966
Haaaa!

115
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:29,866
[Grunt]

116
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,266
Ah!

117
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:32,466
Huh?

118
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:33,266
Ha!

119
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,766
Ugh!

120
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,900
What a joke.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
You realize what
you've done, right?

122
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,133
You just threw away your only
chance at defeating Liver.

123
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,833
[TATSUMI]
Bro...

124
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,066
[BULAT]
Tatsumi!

125
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,966
I'm sorry,
it's my fault.

126
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,133
I wasn't able to

127
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:56,133
hold him off long enough
for you to finish.

128
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,333
What is this?

129
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,466
You mean you can still move.

130
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,400
Why don't you just take
yourself a little nap,

131
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,033
so I can take my precious
time with you later?

132
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,566
[BULAT]
Don't sweat it, okay?

133
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,000
Huh?

134
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm just amazed you managed
to get through all this

135
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,566
without an Imperial Arms.

136
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,033
Uh, yeah, I guess...

137
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:17,166
<i>Even with his armor,</i>
<i>he got beat up pretty bad!</i>

138
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:20,200
I noticed your Imperial Arms
deactivates itself

139
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,966
after you've taken a certain
amount of damage.

140
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:25,200
We seem to have
a clear winner.

141
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,133
Hmm. You don't need
to play it tough.

142
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,033
That little drop of blood
coming from your ear

143
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,433
is a dead giveaway.

144
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,133
Uh?

145
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,366
[BULAT]
Your internal organs
must've taken a huge hit

146
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:38,366
when you used
your trump card.

147
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:42,633
So I doubt you're in any
condition to use your
Imperial Arms anymore.

148
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:43,800
Hmph.

149
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,500
Nothing gets past you, does it?

150
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,400
And here I was hoping to
have the upper hand
in the negotiations.

151
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,233
Well then! I must ask.

152
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,266
How would you like to become
a member of Esdeath's army?

153
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:59,266
I'm sure she would be willing to
bring you on as a Lieutenant.

154
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,833
Thanks, but I lost interest
in serving the Empire

155
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,600
a long time ago.

156
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,710
Don't think of it that way.

157
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,210
You'd be working for
Esdeath, not the Empire.

158
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,710
Doing so changed my life
for the better.

159
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,577
Since joining forces
with Esdeath,

160
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,777
people everywhere
cower before me.

161
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:16,610
In fact, my name is so feared

162
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,943
that all the bureaucrats
in the Capital

163
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:20,043
clamour to stay in
my good graces!

164
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,943
I've got every single one
of them under my thumb!

165
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:26,610
I emplore you to come with me!

166
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,377
If you do, the Master can erase

167
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:30,177
all of your crimes from
the record books!

168
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:31,943
I said no.

169
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,210
[BULAT]
Don't you get it.

170
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,977
I would find no joy
in becoming

171
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:39,043
the very thing we were
sworn to destroy.

172
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:41,810
Since I know Esdeath is
scratching the Minister's back.

173
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,743
How could I possibly
live with myself.

174
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:47,777
It'd tarnish my image
as a hero to the masses,
now wouldn't it?

175
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:49,643
A hero to the masses?

176
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:51,043
I can't believe a known assassin

177
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:53,510
would dare to say
something so arrogant.

178
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,477
I was trying to make it sound
like I was being modest.

179
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:58,777
[NYAU]
<i>Both of them have finally</i>

180
00:09:58,877 --> 00:10:02,510
<i>But what they don't know</i>
<i>is that we still have</i>
<i>our trump card...</i>

181
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,343
<i>then it's over!</i>

182
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:06,377
Ah, Bro, wait...

183
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:09,510
[TATSUMI]
<i>When Imperial Arms</i>
<i>users face off...</i>

184
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,010
<i>one of them always dies.</i>

185
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,577
Neither one of us can use
our weapons anymore.

186
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:17,377
Then we'll finish this
with our swords.

187
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,577
Ugh.

188
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:20,677
Huh?

[Grunting]

190
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,010
It's time for a
little enhancement.

191
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,577
I am about to
fight YOU after all.

192
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:31,910
Bro. Wait a sec!

193
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,810
Something's not right
about this guy!

194
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,110
Yeah, I'm painfully aware

195
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,343
he's not gonna be an
easy one to beat.

196
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:38,843
[Click]

197
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:42,777

[Swords clashing

200
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:52,377
Ah!

201
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:53,510
Uh ah!

202
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,010
That's crazy...

203
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,110
it's hard to believe these two
are both already injured.

204
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,577
[Screams]

205
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:03,410

Ahhh!

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,377
Gak!

211
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,543
You got him!

212
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,210
Argh!

213
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,677
Ha!

214
00:11:22,777 --> 00:11:23,610
Uh?

215
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,977
My real trump card,

216

Killer Blood Swords!

217
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,243
[BULAT]
Of course you had something
up your sleeve!

218
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:33,277
Keep after him!

00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:36,243
[Scream]

220
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:37,343
Aaah!

221
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:41,910
[BULAT]
Ugh!

222
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,910
Bro, you sure you're
gonna be okay?

223
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,377
I don't think I let him
land any fatal blows,

224
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:47,910
so I should be alright.

225
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,043
I put all I had left
into that final attack...

226
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,310
<i>and yet you still blocked it.</i>

227
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,943
<i>Well played.</i>

228
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:03,710
If I had hesitated
just a second,

229
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,077
he would have annihilated me
before I knew what hit me.

230
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,743
When I saw the spray pattern
of his blood,

231
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:12,843
I realized it was
another form of liquid.

232
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,543
You were incredible, Bro!

233
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:19,243
[TATSUMI]

[LIVER]
Bulat...

237
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:27,643
Huh?

238
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:30,277
There's one thing
I wanted to tell you.

239
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:34,010
There's a reason I decided to
join General Esdeath's army.

240
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,777
I didn't tell you before.

241
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:43,643
It's a shame to allow a treasure
like you to rot away in a cell.

242
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:47,777
I'm looking for an adjutant with
incomparable combat abilities.

243
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:50,177
I'd like you in my army.

244
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:51,543
[LIVER]
Huh?

245
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,043
No, I couldn't return to the
army even if I wanted to.

246
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,077
I'm charged with an offense.

247
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,377
Excuses are for the weak.

248
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:01,877
You may re‐enlist...

249
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:03,810
because I WANT you to re‐enlist.

250
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,777
To put it frankly,
I will not allow anyone
to raise an objection.

251
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:10,243
But the Minister will
never stand for it.

252
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:12,710
[ESDEATH]
I'm a great deal of help
to the Minister.

253
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,043
If you're an asset to my forces,
he'll be glad to have you back.

254
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,543
Please say you'll fight
with me, Liver.

255
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:21,777
And if you're still
feeling unsure,

256
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:24,110
allow me to ease your fears.

257
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:31,577
I have respect and
admiration for Esdeath.

258
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,977
That's the real reason.

259
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:35,843
Liver...

260
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:37,443
And as such...

261
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:41,110
I swear on my honor as a devout
servant of General Esdeath

262
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,343
that in mere moments I will be
taking your life as well!

[Bulat coughs]

264
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,377
Hang in there!

265
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:49,543
[BULAT]
Ugh... Uh...

266
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:52,077
That wasn't just an enhancement.

267
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:54,143
You injected poison
into your own blood!

268
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:55,843
[TATSUMI]
Uh...

269
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:58,077
You haven't developed
a resistance to it,

270
00:13:58,177 --> 00:14:00,643
so the poison is going
to kill you quickly.

271
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:03,110
It'll soon be over.

272
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,010
As for me...

273
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,310
I must be going on ahead...

274
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:17,477
[BULAT]
I should have expected
as much from you.

275
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,677
We have defeated each other.

We're not done yet sunshine;

281
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,843
I'm afraid this fight
isn't over.

[Flute playing]

283
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:33,610
Oh...

284
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,643
[NYAU]
Did you really think the Killer
Blood Swords were all we had?

285
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,810
Hm. So sorry.

286
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,977
The real trump card is me.

287
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:47,143
Trump Card:
Invite the Demonic Human.

288
00:14:47,943 --> 00:14:51,077
[Flute playing]

289
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:00,543
This weapon is called Scream.

290
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:04,010
And it can do much more than
just make people go to sleep.

291
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,143
Like one little trick is making
myself bigger and stronger,

292
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,343
so I can tear your ass
to pieces.

293
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:10,710
Oh, man.

294
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,877
He made himself double
in size automatically!

295
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:15,043
That is one hell of
a trump card!

296
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:16,077
Ah...

297
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:18,143
Well now, it's been
kind of a long time.

298
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:20,843
It feels pretty good
to be back in this body.

299
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:22,943
[TATSUMI]
<i>This is bad...</i>

300
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:25,610
<i>He was already</i>
<i>too hard to beat.</i>

301
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,577
<i>What the hell am I</i>
<i>gonna do now?</i>

302
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,610
[BULAT]
Tatsumi...

303
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,910
[TATSUMI]
Uh?

304
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,043
[BULAT]
Tatsumi, here.

305
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:35,343
I'm leaving this to you.

306
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,643
[TATSUMI]
Is that...?

307
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:40,043
[BULAT]
The key to Incursio.

308
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:44,043
The armor will always belong to
the one who possesses the key.

309
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,443
No, you can't do that!
You can't give me Incursio.

310
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:48,843
[Nyau laughing]

311
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:51,277
What good will it do you
if you can't put it on?

312
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:53,577
Not just anyone can
wear that armor.

313
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:55,710
The wrong person
will die instantly

314
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,610
if they even try using it.

315
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,943
You might as well
just give it up.

316
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,943
Wouldn't want you to die before
we get a chance to play.

317
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:06,143
So quit being a coward
and fight like normal?

318
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,410
Hm...

319
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,143
Huh?

320
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:10,943
Uhh...

321
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:14,510
Are you really gonna let your
opponent tell you what to do?

322
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,243
Don't be ridiculous!

323
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:20,277
Look. You've had a lot of
training and gained some
great experience.

324
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:23,243
That's everything you need
to equip Incursio!

325
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:24,810
Alright?!

326
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,343
I don't know.

327
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,010
[NYAU]
<i>Hmm.</i>

328
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,677
<i>I want to avenge my friends</i>
<i>by ripping this guy to shreds.</i>

329
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:34,510
<i>He can't just up and die on me.</i>

330
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,710
[NYAU]
You need an affinity for
an Imperial Arms.

331
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,843
Yours won't be enough,
it'll kill you instantly.

332
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:42,877
If you like the way
a weapon feels...

333
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:47,010
Or even if you simply
have a positive first
impression of it,

334
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,977
you can usually tell
if it's a match.

335
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,177
Hyaa!

336
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:58,077
Whoa, so cool!

337
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:00,743
I promise you can do this.

338
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:03,110
You can! I know you can!

339
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,277
Okay, Bro.

340
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:09,810
Heh.

341
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:17,377
There's no one in the world
I respect more than you.

342
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:18,910
So if you say I can do it

343
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,143
then there's no way in hell
I'll let you down!

344
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:22,743
Ahh, seriously.

345
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,477
So you're really
gonna put it on?

346
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,843
Guess I better hurry
if I wanna kill you myself.

347
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:29,977
Time to die!

348
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,477
Let go and scream, Tatsumi!

349
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:34,177
With all the fire in your soul!

350
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:36,810
[Huge scream]

351
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:42,843
Incursio!

352
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:49,677
[BULAT]
<i>Amazing...</i>

353
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,277
<i>The armor's changing its shape</i>
<i>to fit Tatsumi's physique!</i>

354
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,810
Where'd that thing come from?!

355
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,343
That armor... are all the
materials still alive?!

356
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:06,777
[BULAT]
<i>Incursio was created from parts</i>
<i>of a living dragon‐type Danger</i>
<i>Beast known as "Tyrant."</i>

357
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,810
<i>Its vitality is immensely high.</i>

358
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,243
<i>It can also adapt its body</i>
<i>to survive in any type</i>
<i>of environment,</i>

359
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,643
<i>from burning deserts</i>
<i>to the frozen tundra!</i>

360
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:20,077
<i>Even after becoming</i>
<i>an Imperial Arms,</i>

361
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:23,177
<i>the dragon's flesh is</i>
<i>still alive to this day!</i>

362
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:26,043
Such a... such a
terrifying weapon!

363
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:32,643
[BULAT]
Tatsumi, your emotions
are causing it to evolve.

364
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:35,410
Incursio's bonding with you!

365
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:43,743
[TATSUMI]
Esdeath's army commited
Murder‐after‐murder using
Night Raid's name!

366
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:46,310
Now it's time for you to pay!

367
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,410
Yeah? You must think you're
pretty special now, don't you?!

368
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:52,743
I can feel it...

369
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:56,377
this armor is making
my body grow stronger.

370
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,743
[Grunt]

371
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:01,043
I'm about to finish this!

372
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,543
Ahhh!

373
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,410
I dare you to try!

374
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,410
[Yelling]

375
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:10,777
[Screams]

376
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,143
Aaah!

377
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,077
[Yelling]

378
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,910
Ha, whaddya know?

379
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,610
If that's how strong you are
right here and now,

380
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,877
then there's not a
single doubt in my mind.

381
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:46,843
One of these days
you will surpass me.

382
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,077
Ugh... Uhh...

383
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,910
[BULAT]
Go as far as you can, Tatsumi.

384
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,043
I'll be watching over you.

385
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:18,410
[TATSUMI]
I won, Bro...

386
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:21,477
I won because of you.

387
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:26,110
I'm sorry for that little
part at the end...

388
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,343
when I made you punch
some sense into me.

389
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:32,177
I swear, I'll get strong.

390
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:36,410
I promise, I'll master Incursio
and make you proud.

391
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,310
[Tatsumi crying]

392
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,743
So, just for now...

393
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:45,043
Is it okay if I cry for you?

394
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,943
Okay, Bro...?

395
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:55,510
[Huge scream]

396
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,610
[Crying]

397
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,810
[Huge scream]

398
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:10,510
[Kurome singing]
La la la...

399
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,677
Hehe...

400
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:17,743
Human bodies,
they're so amusing. Hehe...

401
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,010
The only way to pluck out
the weeds of rebellion

402
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,510
is pull directly from the roots.

403
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,843
Sending supplies to a foreign
tribe is a serious crime.

404
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:27,010
We did what needed to be done.

405
00:21:28,277 --> 00:21:30,777
Kurome, I have a
message for you!

406
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:33,943
You're needed in the
Imperial Capital.

407
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:34,743
Huh?

408
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:36,443
They only ask for me?

409
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:39,110
That's right. Apparently you've
been personally selected

410
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,177
to be part of
a new group of six.

411
00:21:41,277 --> 00:21:42,443
Group of six.

412
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:44,677
I heard that they were
planning on forming a new unit.

413
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:48,270
[KUROME]
Hmmm...

414
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:54,470
The Capital, huh?

415
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,437
Maybe I'll get to see you
again after all...

416
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:02,637
Big Sister.

417
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:41,537
