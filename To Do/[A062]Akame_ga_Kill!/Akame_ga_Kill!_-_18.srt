00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:06,766
[TATSUMI]
<i>I wanted... to spend more</i>
<i>time with everyone.</i>

2
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,700
<i>I wish we could've kept</i>
<i>fighting together.</i>

3
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:18,600
<i>If only I was...</i>
<i>I don't know...</i>

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,366
[MINE]
Hey, Tatsumi, you
gonna sleep all day?

5
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:23,700
Oh!

6
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,700
No, I'm up!

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,166
Sorry you guys, I overslept.

8
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:33,100
It's time to infiltrate the
Path of Peace headquarters.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,133
Get it together!

10
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:35,666
[TATSUMI]
Yeah yeah, I know!

11
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,800
And after we clean out
the filth in Kyoroku,

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,166
that's when the Revolutionary
Army will make its move, right?

13
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:44,466
<i>There's no time to dwell</i>
<i>on the past right now.</i>

14
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:47,266
<i>I have to overthrow this</i>
<i>disgusting Empire.</i>

15
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:50,233
<i>This madness must be</i>
<i>stopped at the source!</i>

16
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,666
[Crowd chatter]

17
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:30,833
[ESDEATH]
Counselor Bolic.

18
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,766
Via direct orders from
Minister Honest,

19
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:37,433
the Jaegers Special Police force
is here to ensure your safety.

20
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,833
[BOLIC]
My my.

21
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,800
Who would've guessed he'd send
the one and only all‐powerful

22
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,666
General Esdeath of all people
to look after this great estate?

23
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,100
I must tell you I've never
felt safer in my life.

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,133
[ESDEATH]
We've received a report
stating that Night Raid
is already in the city.

25
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:55,400
We'll need to use your guest
rooms until the hunt is over.

26
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,733
It's my pleasure.

27
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:01,433
Heh, I think you'll find our
hospitality quite satisfying.

28
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:04,366
I have no interest in
playing with your pets.

29
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:08,866
But, as for those spies
watching my team since
we walked in...

30
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:10,000
I'd love to meet them.

31
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,700
[BOLIC]
Ooh, well played.

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,666
I should've expected
you'd notice.

33
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,200
[WAVE]
Who are those guys?

34
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,533
[BOLIC]
I borrowed these highly
disturbed individuals

35
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:24,066
from the Imperial Fist Temple
to keep this religion
under my control.

36
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,033
Say hello to the
Four Rakshasa Demons!

37
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,933
Oh! So that's why I hadn't
seen them in the Capital;

38
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,200
I wondered where they went.

39
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,100
[BOLIC]
It actually works out nicely,

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,166
they usually work
as my bodyguards,

41
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,466
but since you're here, I can
put them on the offensive

42
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,500
and let them handle those
assassins for you.

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,566
Wait a second!
How can they go against Night
Raid without Imperial Arms‐

44
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,433
Oh don't worry your
pretty little head!

45
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,300
Taking out Imperial Arms
users just happens to be
our specialty.

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,566
It's what I live for... [slurp]

47
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,533
No matter how unbeatable an
Imperial Arms might seem...

48
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,800
...you can't escape the fact
the wielder's only flesh and
blood underneath.

49
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,600
So like, there's a million
different ways to defeat
one, y'know?

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,100
These four just happen
to be the Minister's
personal executioners.

51
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,800
And as their name implies,
they're good at it.

52
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
He ain't lyin'.
We can handle this.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,433
So just sit back, relax,
have a few cocktails and‐

54
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,366
While it may be true
that you've built up
an impressive résumé...

55
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:21,584
you shouldn't let
your guard down.

56
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:23,351
Ooh, so sinister.

57
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:25,787
You're giving me chills,
General Esdeath.

58
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:27,220
I think I'm falling for you.

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,954
<i>That's strange...</i>

60
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,730
<i>if the Minister's favorite</i>
<i>pawns already had it</i>
<i>under control,</i>

61
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,530
<i>why did he choose to send us?</i>

62
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,097
<i>This religious group must</i>
<i>mean a lot more to him</i>
<i>than I thought.</i>

63
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,997
[Kurome breathing rapidly]

64
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:45,697
[WAVE]
Kurome!

65
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:46,963
Please no...

66
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:48,863
If only I'd gotten here
a little sooner...

67
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:50,997
Maybe Bols would
still be alive...

68
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:53,963
And and what about his
wife and his daughter?

69
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:57,430
God how in the hell am I
supposed to report this?!

70
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,397
I don't know...

71
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,097
but the reason you were
attacked was because

72
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:02,997
you were trying to save
Kurome, right?

73
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,397
That's why the Commander said

74
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:06,397
you wouldn't be held
responsible for what happened.

75
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:09,430
I understand how you feel,
but please stay calm.

76
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,463
[Wave crying]

77
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:13,463
[WAVE]
Damn it...

78
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,063
DAMN IT!

79
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:17,163
[ESDEATH]
How's Kurome?

80
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:19,063
She's still sleeping.

81
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:20,363
But the doctor believes
she's healed enough

82
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,030
that she can
recover soon.

83
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,930
That's good.
I'm trying to identify

84
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,330
the body of the girl who
attacked her, but I'm
coming up short.

85
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,597
[WAVE]
She was probably
one of Night Raid's
Imperial Arms users.

86
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:32,997
[ESDEATH]
I agree.

87
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:34,463
Commander?

88
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:37,230
Is it okay if I feed that
evil lady's remains to Koro?

89
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,497
[ESDEATH]
Sure, why not?

90
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:39,930
Haa!

91
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,330
Time to get up!

92
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,997
Ah!

93
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:44,163
[WAVE]
K‐Kurome!

94
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:45,930
I feel a lot better.

95
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,963
Now that I've had
a little nap.

96
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:49,363
[WAVE]
What? You're kidding me!

97
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:51,997
But your wounds...
they were... fatal.

98
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:53,597
[KUROME]
Commander!

99
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:56,663
If it pleases you, I'd like to
continue with my mission now.

100
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:02,630
As you can see,
I'm ready to fight!

101
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,097
[ESDEATH]
That's fine.

102
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,630
But if you're coming with us,
you can't fall behind.

103
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,397
In thirty minutes we're
leaving with or without you.

104
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:10,697
Right!

105
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,663
[RUN]
Wave? Is something wrong?

106
00:06:16,763 --> 00:06:19,030
Huh? Uh, no!

107
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,930
[Labored breathing]

108
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,963
[WAVE]
Hey, you okay in there?

109
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:26,097
You're not feeling
better at all, are you?

110
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:28,963
I'm really thinking you
need to sit this mission out.

111
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,830
[KUROME]
No! I'm fine.

112
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,430
[WAVE]
How can you say that?

113
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,297
I'm gonna let the Commander
know you're not ready for‐

114
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:35,797
Ah...

115
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:36,663
Uhh...

116
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,197
Kurome!

117
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:43,330
In my old squad,

118
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,430
if they find out you
can't fight anymore...

119
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,597
they simply killed you to be
sure that you'd never talk!

120
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:50,463
What?
Kill you?

121
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:52,863
If I get kicked out
of the Jaegers...

122
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:54,763
I might...
I might...

123
00:06:54,863 --> 00:06:56,263
You'll be okay!

124
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:58,197
If you tell the Commander,
she'll protect you!

125
00:06:58,297 --> 00:06:59,797
She can't help me
with this!

126
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:01,797
The only way is
to keep fighting.

127
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:03,863
I won't allow myself
to be discarded.

128
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:06,997
I didn't come into this terrible
world to go out like that!

129
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:09,330
If anyone kills me,
it will be in battle.

130
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,597
Just like my friends who
died when we were kids.

131
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:15,497
Kurome.

132
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,830
Sorry I made you
worry, Wave.

133
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,130
I really am alright.

134
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,963
Just let me recover
a little more;

135
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,730
and I should be back to
my old self again.

136
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,763
Hmm...

137
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:31,963
[TATSUMI]
Good news is ‐ we're pretty
far away from the Capital,

138
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:34,897
so we probably don't need
to worry about wanted
posters, do we?

139
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:38,130
We can't be sure the Jaegers
haven't been going around
posting new ones.

140
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,563
Let's try to be caref‐

141
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:41,063
Are you frickin' serious,

142
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:42,463
you couldn't even let me get
the words out of my mouth?!

143
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,563
Look I understand
what you're saying.

144
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,130
Hm...
Oh...

145
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,063
But isn't there such a thing
as being too careful?

146
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:52,930
The enemy might notice if
we start acting all jumpy.

147
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,430
So we have to be natural.

148
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,297
[MINE]
<i>He was crushed when</i>
<i>Chelsea died...</i>

149
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:01,030
<i>but now here he is, taking the</i>
<i>assignment with a brave face.</i>

150
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,297
<i>Hmph! He's growing up.</i>

151
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:06,763
Whatever, I guess you
do kinda have a point.

152
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:08,063
Oh!

153
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:09,630
Wow, this is really good!

154
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,197
Yep! You can't get
ice cream this good
just anywhere.

155
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:16,563
[TATSUMI]
Speaking of which,

156
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,730
have you noticed how much busier
it is here than the city?

157
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,530
[MINE]
Thanks to their underground
resources and that religion.

158
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,763
Religion?

159
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:24,197
Yeah, it's big bucks.

160
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,963
But the way they've got it
set up right now,

161
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:29,363
the vast majority of the
profits go straight to
the Minister's wallet.

162
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:30,497
That pig.

163
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:33,330
These people have no idea
they're being taken.

164
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,063
[MINE]
Everyone in the resistance
knows the truth,

165
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:38,330
but Bolic keeps their hands
pretty much tied.

166
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,497
That's why we're
gonna teach that
bastard a lesson.

167
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:45,930
Yep. But we can't do anything
until we figure out our way
around town, right?

168
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,163
[TATSUMI]
Oh yeah!

169
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:48,830
Let's see what's
outside the city next!

170
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,063
Sounds good.

171
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,630
Since Lubb was all
gung‐ho about it,

172
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,930
we'll let him handle the danger
zone around the cathedral.

173
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,963
[Drinking]

174
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,863
[LUBBOCK]
<i>Jeez! This place is</i>
<i>like a maze.</i>

175
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:04,463
<i>Well, at least it's fairly easy</i>
<i>to get lost in the crowd</i>
<i>and feel things out.</i>

176
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:06,763
<i>Oops, careful.</i>

177
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:09,963
<i>Luckily the Empire doesn't</i>
<i>know my face or my name.</i>

178
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:14,563
<i>And the more info I bring back</i>
<i>the more points I can</i>
<i>score with Najenda!</i>

179
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,497
You've made me so happy...

180
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:19,663
<i>Hehaheha...</i>

181
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:21,297
[MEZ]
Hey, Shuten.

182
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:24,063
That guy down there
totally looks like
he's sniffing around.

183
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:28,330
My intuition tells me,
he's got to be an
enemy for sure.

184
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,530
The way he's moving
is a dead giveaway.

185
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,130
The guy carries himself
as if he's already seen
a lot of action.

186
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,697
He probably thinks he's
being pretty cautious,
but he can't hide it from me.

187
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:37,897
Meaning he's guilty!

188
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:39,897
Are you ready to kill him then?

189
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,963
Don't call it that. Please.

190
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:44,063
I like to think of it as
'freeing his spirit.'

191
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:45,830
[SPY]
Based on our observations,

192
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,697
we believe there's an
underground path near
this cemetery

193
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,897
that passes through Bolic's
mansion to the cathedral.

194
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:54,063
So if we found the entrance
to the tunnel...

195
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:56,363
we could easily slip into
Bolic's basement.

196
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,497
It'll take a while
to find it.

197
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,997
Since there is quite
a lot of land to cover.

198
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,663
[AKAME]
Hmm...

199
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:05,430
We should also bear in mind
that it might be full of traps.

200
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,163
[Slice sound]

201
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:08,397
[IBARA]
Hehe...

202
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:10,097
Well, well, well.

203
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:14,230
Did you think no one would
notice you were here, Akame?

204
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,897
[AKAME]
Ibara. So you're in Kyoroku too.

205
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:21,463
[IBARA]
Oh, you mean you remember me?
I'm touched.

206
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:25,463
It's not like we really
knew each other back on
the assassination squad.

207
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:29,297
I knew we'd see the
Four Rakshasa Demons
by going for the Minister...

208
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:32,163
but I wasn't expecting this
until the final battle.

209
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:35,697
Hehe... Such a naughty girl
for betraying the Empire...

210
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:39,197
I'm kinda honored to be
the one to punish you!

211
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:43,363
I don't think so!

212
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:44,730
Oh, really!

213
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,630
Ha!

214
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,363
Haa!

215
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:53,763
[IBARA]
Haha...

216
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:55,330
On top of all our training,

217
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,563
we were given another
little advantage!

218
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,597
We drank a special broth made
from mountain Lake‐Krakens
living near the temple.

219
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:05,563
It lets me do some 'unusual'
things with my body!

220
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,697
Crap! He just came at me
out of nowhere!

221
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,297
How did I blow my cover?!

222
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:14,263
[SHUTEN]
Hehe... Come back and fight
like a man, you coward?

223
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,497
Uh‐oh, you dead already?

224
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:20,497
Well hell you're no fun.

225
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,963
[LUBBOCK]
<i>Come on, get outta here.</i>

226
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:24,997
<i>My string armor</i>
<i>blocked that attack,</i>

227
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:28,730
<i>but I managed to stop my</i>
<i>pulse by using Cross Tail</i>
<i>around my blood vessels.</i>

228
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,163
<i>It's not very comfortable,</i>
<i>so you can be on your</i>
<i>way now, alright?</i>

229
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:36,563
In the end, you were just
an insignificant little pest
not even worth my time.

230
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,797
Ah, well.

231
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,463
[LUBBOCK]
<i>That's it, walk away.</i>

232
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:41,463
<i>I'm getting a little tired of</i>
<i>playing dead in the street.</i>

233
00:11:41,563 --> 00:11:43,630
Hey Shuten there's another one
headed your way.

234
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,630
And it looks like she's a
revolutionary spy too.

235
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,197
<i>Uh‐oh...</i>

236
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:50,963
<i>I bet that's the girl I was</i>
<i>supposed to meet up with.</i>

237
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:53,330
<i>Sorry babe, you're on your own.</i>

238
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,863
<i>Well, if she's a spy</i>
<i>she should be prepared</i>
<i>for stuff like this.</i>

239
00:11:56,963 --> 00:12:02,263
[Girl panicking]
Well now, another poor lamb
lost in this frightening world.

240
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:04,397
I'd be happy to help you out

241
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:08,597
and free your spirit for you,
you should be thanking me!

242
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:11,497
Ah! Please let me go...

243
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,763
[Crying]
Hehe...

244
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,163
[Grunt]

245
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:17,263
Nope, I can't do it!

246
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:21,063
I won't let you kill an ally,
especially a cutie like that.

247
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:23,463
But I checked you,
you didn't have a pulse.

248
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:27,797
That was dumb!
If you had stayed still we
would've had like no idea!

249
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:29,363
Here's the thing.

250
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:31,763
Because of the role
I play on the team...

251
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:35,963
I usually avoid as many head‐on
confrontations as possible.

252
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:37,297
But...

253
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,563
When push comes to shove,
I don't play around.

254
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,663
And I don't hold back!

255
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:49,330
I'll kick both of your asses
at the same time!

256
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,763
[IBARA]
Hahaha!

257
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,863
That is one freaky
weapon of yours!

258
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:02,497
Murasame is the perfect sword
for damaged goods like you!

259
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:06,663
C'mon, c'mon, I know you
can move faster than
that little lady!

260
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:11,263
It's too bad you left before
completing your training!

261
00:13:11,363 --> 00:13:13,763
Thanks! I'll be taking that!

262
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:15,530
Hehe...

263
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:22,130
Huh? What the hell's
wrong with this thing?!

264
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:24,763
Huh? Ah!

265
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,930
Don't tell me...

266
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,130
you planned all this
from the beginning

267
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,530
and actually let me take
your weapon from you!

268
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,530
The answer was clear as
soon as you couldn't
understand Murasame.

269
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,763
There was no way it
would bond with you.

270
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:42,797
Arrrgh, damn you!

271
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:45,197
You little bitch!

272
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,630
Looks like my cursed blade
didn't take a liking to you.

273
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:59,130
[AKAME]
It may have something to do
with your winning personality.

274
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,330
[IBARA]
Heh. You're a pretty
messed up chick, aren't you?

275
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,897
Careful, I think I might be
falling in love.

276
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:09,597
I'm kinda into
that sorta thing...

277
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,363
Ugh...

278
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:16,230
[RUN]
Surprise attacks don't
work on you, I see.

279
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,830
A Jaeger I presume.

280
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,163
Yes.

281
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:22,197
Now I know Akame of
Night Raid is in the city.

282
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:24,263
Handling recon is my job.

283
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,630
I was watching you fight...

284
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,030
so I've just learned a
great deal about Murasame.

285
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,997
The Four Demons AND the Jaegers.

286
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:38,063
I hope everyone's okay.

287
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:39,930
Well? Come at me!

288
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,597
Yeah I don't think so!

289
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:45,063
That string will slice me to
pieces if I get too close to it.

290
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:49,197
Oh, I guess you noticed.

291
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:52,397
I'm gonna free your spirit
like I should've done before.

292
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,697
Fist Temple...

293
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:56,930
Hundred Fists! Aah!

294
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,963
Thanks, but I didn't
ask for that!

295
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:03,463
Whoa. You're very good
with your hands.

296
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:05,630
I guess that thread
is your Imperial Arms.

297
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,563
[MEZ]
[Cracks knuckles]
If it is, then that makes you
a member of Night Raid.

298
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:13,397
This time I'll split your
head open to be totally
positive you're dead.

299
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:17,097
Sorry, you're cute and all; but
I'm not into that kinda thing!

300
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:18,730
Hm...

301
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,063
[LUBBOCK]
Strings, bind together!

302
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,030
Now... centrifugal force!

303
00:15:26,597 --> 00:15:27,630
That was stupid.

304
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,563
You left yourself wide open!

305
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,930
Yeah, but it's no big deal.

306
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,063
Watch this!

307
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:37,397
Ultimate move: Wire Impact!

308
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:39,397
Aaah!

309
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:44,963
Is that all you got?

310
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:48,730
If this is your trump card, it's
the saddest one I've ever seen.

311
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,997
[LUBBOCK]
Oh, you think so?

312
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:51,363
Well if you haven't noticed,

313
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:53,963
it just let me accomplish
exactly what I wanted.

314
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:55,497
Take a look behind you.

315
00:15:55,597 --> 00:15:57,063
Hm?

316
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:58,297
Uh, wait...

317
00:15:58,397 --> 00:15:59,030
Aw crap.

318
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,763
See ya later, suckers!

319
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:02,063
Whoo!

320
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:04,297
That whole time he was
creating a diversion

321
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,930
so we wouldn't notice that
the other one was getting away.

322
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,130
I'm an idiot.

323
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,697
Well if nothing else,
I can at least chase you
down now can't I?!

324
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:19,397
You sure it's a such good idea
to come after me like that?

00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:53,230
My body has had
decades of training.

337
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,763
I won't die from this!

338
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:58,030
In a few seconds it won't matter
how strong your body is.

339
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,463
Cross Tail's already finding
its way around inside you,

340
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:02,797
and once it wraps around
your heart it's over.

341
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,297
Hmm?

342
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,463
[Heart beating]

343
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,030
Ugh!

344
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,163
Never thought much about
training your guts, did ya?

345
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:18,297
[MEZ]
Ooh, that was cool!

346
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:19,097
Huh?

347
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:20,430
You just killed Shuten.

348
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,030
The Minister's gonna
yell at me for like ever.

349
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,063
[LUBBOCK]
Nah, you won't have to
worry about that.

350
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:28,297
Sorry about this.

351
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,863
But you've seen my weapon,

352
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:31,630
so there's no way
I can let you live.

353
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,097
Aw, don't be sorry!

354
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:36,563
I'm an assassin too;
I totally get it.

355
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:37,597
[Clank]

356
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,230
Arrrh...

357
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,263
Huh?!

358
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:52,663
<i>What's all that liquid?</i>

359
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,897
<i>Crap! It's weighing down</i>
<i>my strings,</i>

360
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:57,963
<i>the barrier's ruined!</i>

361
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:00,530
It's my body oil,
more like sweat really.

362
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,430
The Rakshasa Demons are
experts at doing weird stuff
with our bodies.

363
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,663
So yeah, that's what happened
to your little web thingy.

364
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,463
Whoa! She's fast!

365
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:13,663
Uh, uh, ah!

366
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:14,997
Hehe...

367
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:22,797
<i>Ugh, I can't move...</i>

368
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:24,463
<i>If I take one more hit...</i>

369
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,497
<i>I'm a dead man.</i>

370
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:29,397
Uhh...

371
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:31,263
Hiya!

372
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:34,730
[MEZ]
Oh don't do that,
it's so desperate.

373
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:37,297
[LUBBOCK]
[Coughing]

374
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:39,530
Damn, you sure are pretty.

375
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,230
If things were different,
I'd totally ask you out.

376
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,363
Hehe... And you're just
the kinda guy I like,

377
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:46,463
so I probably would've
been interested.

378
00:18:46,563 --> 00:18:47,263
Hehe...

379
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:48,897
[MEZ]
But oh well!

380
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,997
Maybe in another life.

381
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,630
Good night.

382
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,463
[Stabbing sound]

383
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:57,097
Uh...

384
00:18:57,863 --> 00:18:59,263
Uuuh...

385
00:18:59,363 --> 00:19:00,963
[LUBBOCK]
I kinda used my strings

386
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:02,397
to grab those knives
from earlier.

387
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:04,997
And then I just bided my time
for the right moment

388
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:08,330
to rewind it back in and well,
you know the rest.

389
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:12,430
[Stabbed]
Ugh!

390
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,597
Sorry.

391
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,663
Guess I should get outta here.

392
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:22,730
Hm...

393
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,363
Aw, man, it's not fair!

394
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:29,697
The one time a girl
actually likes me!

395
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:31,997
[Tatsumi sighs]
We covered a lot of
ground today,

396
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:35,930
but we still need to check
all the backstreets and
byroads and everything else.

397
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,997
[MINE]
This city's way too big!

398
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:40,297
Yeah but isn't that why
we're searching it?

399
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:41,297
[sigh]

400
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,030
This would be a heck of
a lot more fun

401
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,763
if we included
some shopping.

402
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:46,497
[TATSUMI]
Maybe for you.

403
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:48,963
It's a nightmare to be the one
following you around.

404
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,397
[MINE]
Err! You got a problem with it?

405
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:55,330
If a man can't appreciate
a lady's retail needs,
he has poor character.

406
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,230
And I think women who
come up with stupid reasons

407
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,797
for calling a
man's character poor

408
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,063
have poor character,
how 'bout that?

409
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:01,397
Now you're asking for it!

410
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:03,163
Do I need to remind you
who's in charge here?

411
00:20:03,263 --> 00:20:04,797
You need to remember
your place!

412
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:06,663
Jeez, when are you gonna
get it through your head?

413
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:08,630
You're not in charge of me;
we're the same rank!

414
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,397
Grrrr...
[LORD]
Please, cease this
foundless quarreling.

415
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:12,663
Huh?

416
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:13,663
Who are you?

417
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:14,863
[LORD]
Apologies.

418
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,530
I know it's none
of my business...

419
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,797
but I simply could
not help but intervene.

420
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:21,097
[MINE]
By any chance are you with...

421
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:22,797
[TATSUMI]
...the Path of Peace.

422
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:23,863
I am.

423
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:25,397
In sooth I'm the Founding Lord;

424
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:28,197
on occasion I make
a sojourn to the city.

425
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:29,930
I have had a vision.

426
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,430
I see you two joined by
the red string of fate.

427
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,697
Cast off your differences
and confess your love!

428
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:36,830
Huh?
Huh?

429
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,430
Upon forming your bond..

430
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,097
the occasional healthy
disagreement can be
quite beneficial!

431
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,563
Huh?
Huh?

432
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:44,930
[TATSUMI / MINE]
Whaaat?!

433
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,063
[MINE]
I would never marry
a jerk like him?!

434
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,963
[TATSUMI]
Oh yeah, like you're
a trophy wife!

435
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:52,697
[LORD] You truly are made
for one another.
[MINE]
Oh you're one to talk.

436
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,063
[BOLIC]
Good news, dear.

437
00:20:58,163 --> 00:21:00,130
I'm bestowing upon you
the coveted honor

438
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,463
of serving as the
Lord's assistant.

439
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:03,463
Oh! Really?

440
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,663
I'm so happy I get
to see the Lord

441
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,563
performing his
miracles up close!

442
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,097
This is a dream
come true!

443
00:21:09,197 --> 00:21:10,463
[BOLIC]
However, you still haven't

444
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:13,097
completely cleansed your
mind of evil thoughts.

445
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:15,297
You're not yet fit
for the task.

446
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:16,730
O‐oh no!

447
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,497
Not to worry, child;

448
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:22,230
simply remove your clothes
and I will purify you
with a sacred ritual.

449
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,063
Yes, Counselor Bolic.

450
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:26,397
Please help me.

451
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:29,830
<i>Soon this religion</i>
<i>will be under my thumb.</i>

452
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,697
<i>I'm going to enjoy</i>
<i>this very much.</i>

453
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:34,030
[MONK]
Conselor Bolic!

454
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,330
[BOLIC]
What is it?

455
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,263
I'm in the middle
of a ceremony!

456
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,263
It's the Four Demons.

457
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:41,630
Uh...

458
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,330
[RUN]
It seems three of them were
eliminated in one night.

459
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,997
They underestimated Night Raid.

460
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,530
I knew it from the start;

461
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,263
we're the only ones capable of
crushing those nasty sinners

462
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:54,697
beneath the mighty
Hammer of Justice!

463
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:57,963
Najenda, I fell for your
tricks on the way here,

464
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:00,997
but I'll turn this place
into a slaughter house.

465
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:03,530
For you and your team.

466
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:40,297
