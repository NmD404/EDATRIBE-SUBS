1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:02,733
Is this some sort of dream?

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:06,966
[TATSUMI]
<i>Nope... unfortunately</i>
<i>this is not a dream.</i>

3
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:08,700
[Reel winding]

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,600
[LUBBOCK]
<i>Huh? Looks like someone's</i>
<i>coming up from the valley.</i>

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,000
<i>He's pretty fast too!</i>

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,033
<i>Who is this guy?!</i>

7
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,533
[SYURA]
<i>They practically wiped out</i>
<i>all of Stylish's creations!</i>

8
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:21,233
[LUBBOCK]
<i>I should probably hide for now.</i>

9
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,266
<i>Tatsumi's not back yet.</i>

10
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,133
<i>I'm starting to get</i>
<i>a really bad feeling.</i>

11
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,666
[SYURA]
<i>Hello, Imperial Capital?</i>

12
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:30,700
<i>So good to be back! Hehe...</i>

13
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:08,133
ESDEATH
Hehe... I'd know your
scent anywhere;

14
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,866
good to see you Tatsumi!

15
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,666
So tell me why you ran away.

16
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,066
I've missed you so much.

17
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,866
Wha?! What're you doing here?!

18
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,633
Silly boy.
I'm here to capture

19
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,233
the Danger Beasts
attacking the Capital.

20
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,633
Uh... Which leads me to the
question of why you're here.

21
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:23,733
Uh!

22
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,366
<i>She's onto me!</i>

23
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:28,300
<i>I'm dead if I can't come up</i>
<i>with something good.</i>

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,733
Oh yeah about that, um,

25
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,966
before I tell you do you think
maybe you could let go of me?

26
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,133
I will not.

27
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,833
Um, please it
makes me nervous

28
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:37,066
when we're close
together like this.

29
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,266
I'm not letting you go.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,533
Uh... I'm testing myself!

31
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:44,200
I heard that there were some
Danger Beasts on the mountain!

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,400
A man after my own heart.

33
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,700
Well? Did you join the
Revolutionary Army yet?

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,866
Uh...

35
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:52,300
No, not yet.

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,300
But I'm still planning to
enlist as soon as I can.

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
I guess you could say
that's the reason

38
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,333
I'm out here trying to
hone my skills.

39
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:01,400
Yes. I see that.

40
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,600
Judging by the amount of
muscle you've built up

41
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,400
I'd wager your abilities
have exponentially grown.

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,100
You've obviously been
working hard!

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,433
And with so much
room to improve!

44
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,833
You really think so?

45
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:15,400
<i>I do not have time</i>
<i>for any of this!</i>

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,400
[ESDEATH]
The Danger Beasts are
almost all gone.

47
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,266
They have really been
a nuisance...

48
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:24,700
But honestly, thanks to them
we're together again!

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,466
Love is a strange thing!

50
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,433
Uh, eh...

51
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:30,533
How can there be so
many interruptions

52
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:31,933
on a deserted mountain?

53
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:33,133
You there!

54
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:34,933
The coward trying to hide.

55
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,466
Show yourself.

56
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,366
If you refuse, you'll get
no mercy from me!

57
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,933
[SYURA]
Well shit, I thought you
wouldn't notice me.

58
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,500
Not too shabby.

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,822
Now I understand why everyone
is so bloody terrified of you.

60
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:52,789
Anyway, now that the two of us
have finally exchanged
pleasantries...

61
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:56,655
it's probably a good time
for me to stop playing
with my little toys.

62
00:03:56,755 --> 00:04:00,855
Sounds like you know something
about why Danger Beasts are
roaming this area.

63
00:04:00,955 --> 00:04:02,989
I'd be more than glad
to torture it out of you.

64
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:05,855
Sorry madam, but that's
not my cup of tea.

65
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,922
But if you're in need of
a little excitement

66
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:10,555
I'm willing to let you play
with my toys as well!

67
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:13,689
Behold my Imperial Arms!

68
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,389
Shambala!

69
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:19,489
What's happening?!

70
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,355
Now then...

71
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:30,922
I wonder what kind of game
we should play next.

72
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:34,822
Uhhh...

73
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:37,522
WHERE ARE WE?!

74
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:40,222
Uh.. Miss Esdeath...

75
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,789
could you hit me
really hard?

76
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,322
Tatsumi... I didn't know
you were into that.

77
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:48,622
We really are perfect for each
other, isn't it wonderful?

78
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,089
Oh god, that's not what I meant!

79
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,189
I just want to find out
if that guy trapped us

80
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,289
in some kind of illusion,
that's all!

81
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:57,922
So if you were to hurt me, maybe
I'd snap out of it, you know?!

82
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:58,822
Understood.

83
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:00,955
As you wish.

84
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:02,789
Uh!

85
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,989
Mmm...

86
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:09,255
It's not an illusion.

87
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:11,222
Our surroundings feel too real.

88
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:13,655
The cool breeze
blowing on the waves...

89
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,055
The warm sunshine...

90
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:16,989
Everything around us is true.

91
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,455
Then what happened?

92
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:21,589
I assume this was somehow
caused by that man we saw.

93
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,022
How did he manage
to teleport us?

94
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,789
That can't be possible, right?!

95
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:31,155
[ESDEATH]
The Empire has 48 legendary
weapons known as Imperial Arms.

96
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:34,155
Rumor has it that the
secret art of a lost nation

97
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:38,055
was used to create one that
could manipulate space itself.

98
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:40,389
Uh! That's crazy!

99
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:42,122
<i>Wait, hang on.</i>

100
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:43,989
<i>Isn't that basically</i>
<i>what Incursio does</i>

101
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,322
<i>every time I summon its armor?</i>

102
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:48,522
<i>Oh man...</i>

103
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:51,355
<i>when I think about it like that</i>
<i>it kinda freaks me out!</i>

104
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,589
[ESDEATH]
<i>Of all the Imperial Arms,</i>

105
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,422
<i>I can only think of a</i>
<i>handful with the power</i>
<i>to control space.</i>

106
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:01,055
<i>Who was that man?</i>

107
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:03,889
Let's take a look around.

108
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,455
[Tatsumi screams]

109
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:08,022
Ah!

110
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:10,289
Oh crap, there's
nothing but ocean!

111
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:12,955
But isn't this a
gorgeous view?

112
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:15,689
It's starting to feel
kind of like we're on a date,

113
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:16,955
isn't it, my darling?

114
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:19,089
I'd rather start
with dinner first.

115
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:22,055
You never know what can happen
when dealing with Imperial Arms.

116
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:25,289
In my line of work you have to
be able to adapt immediately.

117
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,789
I'm sure you do.

118
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:28,255
[ESDEATH]
Now, where were we?

119
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:31,422
Uh...
Right, we're on a date!
Wanna cuddle?

120
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:32,622
Hey, stop it!

121
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:35,122
[Rumbling]

122
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:36,989
[ESDEATH]
Well he's a big fella.

123
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,555
[TATSUMI]
<i>It looks just like Dr. Stylish</i>
<i>after he used that trump card!</i>

124
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:43,055
<i>Even with everyone in</i>
<i>Night Raid working together,</i>

125
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:44,555
<i>it was still a close fight!</i>

126
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,955
<i>Do the two of us</i>
<i>even stand a chance?</i>

127
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,989
He's after us!

128
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,122
I won't let him ruin
our time together.

129
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:55,989
You are interrupting!

130
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,889
You deserve to be impaled!

131
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:00,255
Weiss Schnabel!

132
00:07:06,022 --> 00:07:08,889
[TATSUMI]
She's even stronger
than I thought.

133
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:11,522
You're still standing.

134
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:13,122
This is getting interesting.

135
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:16,489
[TATSUMI]
Hey... you see that weird spot
on his forehead?

136
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:18,189
Doesn't it look kinda weak?

137
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,489
I was thinking the same thing.

138
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:22,455
We must be soulmates!

139
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,322
Grau Horn!

140
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:26,155
He's quite stubborn.

141
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,122
[TATSUMI]
Ahhhhh!

142
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:30,155
[ESDEATH]
Tatsumi?!

143
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:33,355
Ah!

144
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,189
Well done!

145
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,555
Though I had originally
planned on winning your heart

146
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:43,155
with my own skills...

147
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,655
you wound up deepening
my love for you.

148
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:48,689
And here I used some of my
favorite moves and everything!

149
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:49,655
[Crashing]

150
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:52,089
There's another one!

151
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:55,622
Leave it to me, Tatsumi,
I'll give him what he deserves!

152
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,055
Hagel Sprung!

153
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:09,789
Heh!

154
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,189
Wow, I cannot believe
the size of that attack.

155
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,189
She's on a whole
different level.

156
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,922
<i>So this is how</i>
<i>General Esdeath fights.</i>

157
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:23,089
<i>Akame... how the heck</i>
<i>are you going to kill her?!</i>

158
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,689
[TATSUMI]
Those two must have been
the last of them.

159
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,355
[ESDEATH]
So that was what he meant by
"picking up his toys."

160
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:35,889
Which means this was where
he was hiding that new breed
of Danger Beast.

161
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,755
So what do you want to do
after our break?

162
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,455
First we'll
explore the area

163
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:43,222
so we can develop a
better understanding
of our situation.

164
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,322
Good idea.

165
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:45,955
We still don't know what
we're dealing with.

166
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:48,855
We'll only make things
worse if we panic.

167
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:50,555
It's best to
remain calm.

168
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,955
Alright! Let's get to work!

169
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:55,522
<i>Wait, did I really</i>
<i>just say that?</i>

170
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:58,822
<i>She's the enemy, remember?!</i>

171
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:02,755
[ESDEATH]
<i>Mmm... not quite right.</i>

172
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:05,489
[Tropical music playing]

173
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:25,222
We searched the island for
so long the sun went down huh.

174
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:28,555
Yes... and it's been
a lovely time.

175
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,189
Uh... oh, yeah.

176
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:32,289
[ESDEATH]
Not only that,

177
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:34,522
but I also managed to
figure out where we are.

178
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:35,689
Oh!

179
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,255
This island is
several miles

180
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:38,989
to the southeast
of the Empire.

181
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,722
What? You've gotta be
kidding me.

182
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,989
Wow, I had no idea
we were so far away.

183
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,589
Which means...

184
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:49,655
You and I are the only
two people on this
island, Tatsumi.

185
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,922
So, then... what would
you like to do?

186
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:54,622
You're in charge.
Go ahead, choose your fate.

187
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:02,222
Well, don't all those options
mean about the same thing?!

188
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:04,422
Aw, you're no fun at all.

189
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,355
[TATSUMI]
How can you be so calm and
easy‐going about this?

190
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:08,589
Of course I'm calm;

191
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:10,089
I'm the one who knows
how to get back.

192
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,089
‐Don't worry.
‐Huh?!

193
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:15,355
However, I'll need
you to give me your
full cooperation.

194
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:16,522
Is that clear?

195
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:18,122
Uh, yeah!

196
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:20,755
<i>I've got a really bad</i>
<i>feeling about this.</i>

197
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:24,522
<i>But if things get chaotic</i>
<i>I might have a chance to</i>
<i>make a break for it.</i>

198
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:26,655
<i>All I can do is hope!</i>

199
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:38,855
[ESDEATH]
Just as I thought,
the secret was in
WHERE he transported us.

200
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:41,289
[TATSUMI]
So, does that mean
he can only teleport

201
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,089
to places that
have this mark?

202
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,855
[ESDEATH]
Based on the size of the light
when it activated,

203
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:48,322
I'd say it only works on
a few people at a time.

204
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,855
And it must use a large
amount of energy,

205
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:52,355
so he can't do it very often.

206
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:54,589
So you think..
if we stay by this spot...

207
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:57,289
[ESDEATH]
The gate should open
again eventually.

208
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:00,155
But this is only the
first way I found.

209
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:02,822
Now. Before I tell you
the second way back,

210
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:04,289
there's something
I'd like to do.

211
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,189
Sure, what is it?

212
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:07,789
Now that we're
all by ourselves,

213
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,455
let's learn more
about each other.

214
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:12,922
[gasp] Ugh...

215
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:14,622
Whoa whoa whoa, time out!

216
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:17,689
If that's all you want
then there's a lot of
other ways to do it!

217
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,089
Want me to stop?

218
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:22,022
Okay. Then you have to
answer my questions.

219
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:24,722
First off: where did
you learn to fight
with a sword?

220
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:28,322
Uh, well, there was
this veteran who used to
live in my village.

221
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,755
Apparently he was a pretty good
martial arts teacher.

222
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:32,855
Anyway, I trained under him.

223
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:34,322
[ESDEATH]
Interesting.

224
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:37,222
Did he teach you about
blacksmithing as well?

225
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,222
[TATSUMI]
I tried to master as many
skills as I could

226
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:41,389
so I'd make a lot of money.

227
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:44,589
To accomplish something
like that takes a
lot of diligence.

228
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,089
You're very talented!

229
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:48,055
I, uh, get the
feeling that YOU

230
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,989
could accomplish
just about anything.

231
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:54,389
Not true. For example, I'll
never have an appreciation
of say, the arts.

232
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:56,422
The first time I heard
Nyau play the flute,

233
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:58,755
I couldn't understand
what was so special.

234
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:01,255
[TATSUMI]
<i>This could be my chance</i>
<i>to get some information</i>
<i>out of her.</i>

235
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:04,355
<i>I mean, she's crazy about me,</i>
<i>how hard can it be?</i>

236
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:06,189
<i>Maybe I can find something</i>
<i>in our conversation</i>

237
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,522
<i>that'll help me convince</i>
<i>her to join our side.</i>

238
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:09,889
<i>To fight for us.</i>

239
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:11,355
<i>Let's face it...</i>

240
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:14,489
<i>I'd MUCH rather have her</i>
<i>as a friend than a foe!</i>

241
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:16,022
So uh, Miss Esdeath..

242
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:18,022
you didn't grow up in
the Capital, did you?

243
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:19,355
That's right.

244
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:21,155
I was born close to
the Northern border.

245
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:23,855
I don't suppose you've
heard of the Partas clan?

246
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:24,989
I haven't.

247
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:26,389
[ESDEATH]
They were a hunting clan

248
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,955
that specialized in
killing Danger Beasts.

249
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,622
And I was the daughter
of their chief.

250
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:34,455
Since you were kind enough
to tell me about your past..

251
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,289
I guess I'll share mine.

252
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:41,089
[Roar]

253
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:44,822
[ESDEATH]
Father!
I caught my prey!

254
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,189
[FATHER]
Ah! Well done!

255
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,289
You're a good little hunter
for your age...

256
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,689
but I think your old‐man's
got you beat!

257
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:51,989
Wow!

258
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:53,855
We're about to begin the
butchering process.

259
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:56,689
‐Are ya ready?
‐Mm‐hm...

260
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,089
I went ahead and
weakened it.

261
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:00,222
And it's tied down
so it can't hurt us.

262
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,655
But let's be quick
just in case, okay?

263
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:04,022
[Roar]

264
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:06,222
It hurts my ears when
they scream like that.

265
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:08,255
Yeah, I can't do
much for the pain,

266
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,089
but the eggs are more valuable
if the beast is still alive.

267
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:14,422
Y'see, it used to survive
by devouring our people.

268
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:17,289
Not anymore, this time
the predator loses.

269
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,055
The hunter may have
been strong,

270
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:21,022
but in this case the hunted
ended up being

271
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:23,122
just a little bit
stronger in the end.

272
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:26,089
It's what it deserves for
being weaker than me.

273
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:29,555
Esdeath. Carve out the eyes
and the crest.

274
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:30,522
Mm‐hm...

275
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:33,255
I'll do my best, Father!

276
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,255
<i>She never hesitates</i>
<i>to kill a target,</i>

277
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:37,955
<i>even if it's weak or</i>
<i>trying to run away.</i>

278
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:39,789
<i>She's a natural hunter.</i>

279
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,589
<i>But that being said...</i>

280
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:46,122
<i>I can't help but wonder</i>
<i>if she's missing something.</i>

281
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:49,122
<i>I can only hope it</i>
<i>won't be a problem.</i>

282
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:50,722
[ESDEATH]
Eat or be eaten.

283
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:54,055
That's the kind of wonderful
lifestyle in which I was raised.

284
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:56,289
It was just us and
the Danger Beasts.

285
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:00,789
The way both sides desperately
fought for their lives
was so much fun.

286
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:03,989
‐Oh, an insect war?
‐Yeah.

287
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,489
It seems to me like the
fighting's already over.

288
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:09,989
Look over there, the enemy
soldiers have dragged the
queen out of the fortress

289
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:11,855
and they're getting
ready to lynch her.

290
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:14,355
That's what happens
to the weak, right?

291
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:15,322
Yes, Esdeath.

292
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,055
This situation is
exactly the same

293
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:20,022
as it was when your mother
was eaten by the Danger Beast.

294
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:22,655
Make no mistake, this is
how the world works.

295
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:28,089
It may be sad, but your mother
died because she was weak.

296
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:32,055
[ESDEATH]
<i>The strong survive;</i>
<i>the weak become prey.</i>

297
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,989
Camping in the mountains
these past few days paid off!

298
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,055
I caught this guy
all by myself!

299
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:41,989
Father is gonna be
so proud of me!

300
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:44,589
[Gasp]

301
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:48,589
What happened...?

302
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,055
[Groaning]

303
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,689
[ESDEATH]
What's going on?!

304
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:53,855
[VILLAGER]
The northern tribe just came
from across the border

305
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,755
and started attacking
our people.

306
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:59,255
The chief took charge and
killed a few dozen
of the bastards,

307
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:02,589
but then they ganged
up on him all at once and
he couldn't hold 'em off.

308
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:03,655
[Gasp]

309
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:05,789
[ESDEATH]
Father!

310
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,622
Esdeath...

311
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:09,155
it's like I've told you...

312
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:12,422
We were defeated because
we weren't strong enough.

313
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:14,355
This was our fate.

314
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,622
Never let yourself be of
the weak, Esdeath.

315
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:21,489
Never become the prey.

316
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,355
[ESDEATH]
I continued to hunt
Danger Beasts on my own,

317
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,222
but eventually
I ran out of prey,

318
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:28,689
so I became an
Imperial officer.

319
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:30,389
So somewhere
along the line

320
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:33,222
I switched from
preying on monsters
to targeting humans.

321
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:35,755
And well,
that's my story.

322
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:37,022
I get it.

323
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:38,789
You wanted revenge on
the northern tribe.

324
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:40,955
I can understand why
you hated them so much.

325
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,255
Hmm? I suppose that's what
it must look like...

326
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:45,555
but I don't
necessarily hate them.

327
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:46,855
What?

328
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:48,389
Well then what about
all those rumors of you

329
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,455
burying hundreds of
northerners alive?

330
00:15:50,555 --> 00:15:53,722
I wanted to be
efficient when I made
an example of them.

331
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,055
Besides, I would
have done that

332
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,022
regardless of what
my feelings were.

333
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,589
I couldn't disobey
orders, you know.

334
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,722
Huh?

335
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,355
What happened to my father
was regrettable,

336
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:06,989
but it doesn't change the fact
that he was a weak man.

337
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:09,189
Is there anything else
you wanted to ask me?

338
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:12,422
I'm more than willing to
tell you whatever you
want to know, Tatsumi.

339
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,122
Uhh... actually...

340
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:18,922
I was kinda wondering if
maybe I could see what your
Imperial Arms looks like.

341
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:20,555
Oh, that?

342
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:22,289
My Imperial Arms...

343
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:23,122
Ahh...

344
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:24,389
[ESDEATH]
Look.

345
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:25,722
It's right here.

346
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:27,022
[TATSUMI]
What?!

347
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:29,622
It happened several years ago.

348
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,889
[MINISTER]
Hmm... I've offered
a variety of weapons,

349
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:36,522
but your affinity seems
poor with all of them.

350
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:39,755
Well, I am impressed with
how enormous this axe is...

351
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:42,155
but nothing's caught my eye.

352
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:43,522
Huh?

353
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:46,122
Is that an Imperial Arms
in that urn over there?

354
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,622
[MINISTER]
Yes, the Demon's Extract.

355
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:52,455
The blood of an S‐Class
Danger‐Beast from the far north.

356
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,355
A blood‐type weapon?

357
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:57,955
[MINISTER]
The legends say if you
drink the extract and
it resonates properly,

358
00:16:58,055 --> 00:17:02,189
you'll be able to obtain
the Danger Beast's ability
to manipulate ice.

359
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:05,189
However, every warrior
to attempt to do so

360
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:08,355
has lost his mind
in the process.

361
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,922
That all sounds rather
fascinating, doesn't it?

362
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:12,322
You're not going to drink that!

363
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,255
You may have a
dangerous reputation,

364
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:16,722
but that doesn't mean
it'll bond with you!

365
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:18,355
[ESDEATH]
I feel so drawn to it...

366
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,622
as if it's beckoning me
to drink.

367
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:22,089
That's a good sign.

368
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,589
Perhaps the Extract
is right for you.

369
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,022
Maybe.

370
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:28,989
For some reason I feel certain
I was meant for this.

371
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,722
I honed my intuition
out in the wild;

372
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:34,155
if I'm wrong,
I deserve to die.

373
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:37,022
[MINISTER]
It should only take a sip
to know for sure.

374
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,955
No reason not to drink
the whole thing.

375
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:41,389
I bet that'll make me
even stronger.

376
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:46,155
I guess it can't drive you
insane if you already are.

377
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:50,555
Ahh...

378
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:54,589
My, that tasted so...

379
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,055
Gah!

380
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:58,089
Huh?!

381
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:01,722
[Random voices]
Kill! Steal! Murder!

382
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:03,689
Destroy! Humiliate!

383
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,522
Break! Slaughter!

384
00:18:06,622 --> 00:18:07,855
[ESDEATH]
Hehe... HAHA...

385
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:10,389
The urge to destroy
is overwhelming!

386
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,755
Now I understand why
everyone else went crazy...

387
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:15,822
but I will NOT!

388
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:17,255
This is nothing!

389
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:21,022
I won't be bested by
a mere goblet of blood!

390
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,922
I will always be on top.

391
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:26,122
I will always be victorious...

392
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,189
no matter what gets in my way!

393
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:31,389
And I will answer to
no one but myself!

394
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,822
I'm feeling truly
delightful now, Minister.

395
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:39,222
The power's surging
through my entire body.

396
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:42,255
[MINISTER]
You seem to have
already merged.

397
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,589
To the birth of the world's
most powerful warrior...

398
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,555
Esdeath!

399
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:52,722
[TATSUMI]
So after all this time

400
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:54,655
that monster's blood
is still in your body?

401
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:56,122
[ESDEATH]
That's correct.

402
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,622
But I mastered it long ago,
you don't need to worry.

403
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,122
[TATSUMI]
So that's what made you
like to torture people?

404
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:03,355
Oh, no..
I've always enjoyed that.

405
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:05,589
[TATSUMI]
<i>She didn't do it for revenge,</i>

406
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:08,855
<i>and it's not because that</i>
<i>Demon's Extract thing</i>
<i>makes her go berserk.</i>

407
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:11,489
<i>Either of those would've</i>
<i>been better than this.</i>

408
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:15,122
<i>She's been true to herself</i>
<i>from the very beginning...</i>

409
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,255
<i>nothing could change someone</i>
<i>with a personality like that!</i>

410
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:21,955
<i>I can't believe I was gonna</i>
<i>try to win her over again!</i>

411
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:23,489
<i>I'm such an idiot!</i>

412
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:24,922
[SYURA]
Hmm.

413
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:27,055
I wonder how those
two are doing.

414
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:29,622
I'm sure they haven't gotten
themselves killed yet.

415
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:33,155
Perhaps it's about time
I re‐opened the portal, yes?

416
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,089
Shambala Point B, release.

417
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:39,089
That oughta do it.

418
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:42,022
[WOMAN]
Hmm... What are you
doing over there?

419
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:43,955
Huh? Excuse me, bitch?

420
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:47,255
You know, despite
your language,

421
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:50,555
you seem oddly...
refined.

422
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,855
Ha, well, no shit.

423
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:54,522
I mean, Minister Honest
is my father, so...

424
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:56,722
Huh, that man is your father?

425
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,189
Grrr...

426
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:00,455
Guh...

427
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:03,055
What the hell does a whore
have to say about it, huh?!

428
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:05,355
[Woman crying]
I happen to have great
respect for him...

429
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,955
but I can do far
better than he has.

430
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:10,222
I consider surpassing
your parents

431
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:13,555
to be a good show of
filial piety, don't you?!

432
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:15,355
[TATSUMI]
So uh...

433
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:17,155
about that second way
back you found...

434
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:19,789
[ESDEATH]
Oh yes, I'm sure
I can tell you now.

435
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:21,189
We just need to secure a ride.

436
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,189
There are quite a few
species of Danger Beasts

437
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,655
that will let you
ride on their backs.

438
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:29,689
Although.. sometimes it's a
little difficult to train them
not to throw you off.

439
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:31,222
You'd better let me do it.

440
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:33,222
[TATSUMI]
Wait, isn't that one up there?

441
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:35,555
[ESDEATH]
Huh? I guess it is.

442
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:37,255
That's too bad.
Be right back.

443
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:39,655
Wait, what? How are you
planning on catching it?

444
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:41,122
It's way too far up in the sky!

445
00:20:41,222 --> 00:20:43,422
[ESDEATH]
I'll train it after I
shoot it down!

446
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:45,255
Just watch!

447
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:46,389
[Sigh]

448
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,555
Ah!

449
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:49,855
Whoa, it opened!

450
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:52,655
This is my perfect chance
to get outta here!

451
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,322
Hmm...

452
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:57,489
<i>But, she did look after me</i>
<i>this whole time.</i>

453
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,722
<i>I should return the favor.</i>

454
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:01,022
Look, Miss Esdeath!

455
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:02,855
The portal's opening up again!

456
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:04,322
I'm going through, okay?!

457
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:07,022
Ah! Tatsumi, wait!

458
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:09,322
Don't go in there!

459
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:16,722
[ESDEATH]
This is the same mountain
we were on yesterday.

460
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,622
Tatsumi, are you here?

461
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:22,122
Did he really get that far ahead
of me in those few seconds?

462
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:24,655
Impossible, he didn't
have that much time.

463
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,889
[TATSUMI]
<i>Even though I'm invisible,</i>

464
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:29,055
<i>she'll feel my aura if I move.</i>

465
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,189
<i>All I can do now,</i>
<i>is wait 'til she leaves.</i>

466
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:34,122
[ESDEATH]
He's not here.

467
00:21:34,222 --> 00:21:37,555
Could it be... he was
sent to another location?

468
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,722
I lost him again.

469
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:41,489
But one thing is certain...

470
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:44,022
now that we've found
each other a second time,

471
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:46,155
I'm sure it won't be the last.

472
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:49,522
Fate will bring you back
to me... I can feel it.

473
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:52,689
[TATSUMI]
<i>I can feel it too.</i>

474
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:57,489
<i>But now, I know for sure I'll</i>
<i>never persuade you to join us.</i>

475
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,989
<i>So the next time</i>
<i>the two of us meet...</i>

476
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:04,422
<i>it will be as enemies.</i>

477
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:40,189
[Music playing]
