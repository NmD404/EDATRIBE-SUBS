00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:12,166
Tatsumi died
because he was weak.

2
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,600
It's as simple as that.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,666
So then... why...
does it hurt?

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,800
[REVOLUTIONARIES]
It's Esdeath!

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,833
She's the last of them!

6
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,833
Get her!

7
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,266
The Empire is weak as well...

8
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,933
No, don't!

9
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:32,366
It must be terminated!

Uh?

13
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,066
Akame.

14
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,966
Looks like you
lose, Esdeath.

15
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:54,133
No, the Empire lost.

16
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:57,433
Regardless, my expedition
is far from finished.

17
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,433
Expedition?

18
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:00,733
But the war is
already over!

19
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,800
There will always
be another war.

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,566
If I have to,
I'll start one myself.

21
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,000
This world is poised
on the brink of peace.

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,000
And that's exactly
the reason...

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,866
I cannot let you
stay alive!

24
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,100
Oh spare me the drama.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,466
If you want to oppose me...

26
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:20,600
then show me
how much you want it!

Akame! Annihilate her!

29
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,066
You're dead.

30
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,000
We'll see about that!

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,700

Hyaa!

Oh!

38
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,700
Now freeze!

00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,133
Uh?

00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,733
Uh?

41
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Heh...

42
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:01,466
Now I see where you
get your reputation.

43
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,966
Very good!

44
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,366
Esdeath.

45
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:08,366
What is it you'll gain from
executing more people?

46
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:10,166
In the end,
what will be left?

47
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,866
The victors,
of course.

48
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:15,300
You mean murderers
standing on top of a
mountain of dead bodies.

49
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,233
Am I supposed to feel
remorseful or excited?

50
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,266
If you're not
ready to die,

51
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:23,400
then surrender and accept
your subordination now.

52
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,300
Never.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,500
Those who can't
win must perish.

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,366
That's the way the world
operates, isn't it?

55
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:30,100
No!

56
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,500
Everyone wants to live.

57
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,333
The ones who died
wanted to live too!

00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,733
Aah!

Ha!

60
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,066
No one should ever
have the right

61
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,833
to take the life of
another human being!

62
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:49,233
A rather silly thing to say
coming from an assassin,
don't you think!

63
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,633
Ah!

64
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,533

Have you had enough?
Aaah!

If you're weak,
then don't challenge me.

And if you don't believe
you can win, don't try.

76
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,700
Swine should grovel in
the dirt like the filthy
livestock they are.

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,933
Livestock? Is that all
people are to you?

78
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,466
I cannot concern myself
with the weak.

serious yet?

Oh! This must be
your trump card.

I've murdered
a lot of people
in my life.

their sorrow...

Everyone I've
ever killed...

Murasame remembers them all.

91
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:15,233
I'll take the full weight of
that guilt upon myself!

I'm quite impressed!

93

You've cast off
your human skin!

94

What a fitting perk
for a demon sword.

see through Mahapadma?!

used to beat Susanoo.

it was all just

know that?!

00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:42,763
Surprised by the power
of my Imperial Arms?

187
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:47,129
It's important to keep your
trump card a secret, isn't it?

188
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:51,463
Muhaha...
The penalty for making me
cower like a fool...

189
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:52,729
is death!

190
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:53,429
Uh!

191
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:54,829
[Gunshots]

192
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,329
Ugh!

193
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:59,263
I swear, if it's not the
Emperor, it's someone else.

194
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:03,063
Dealing with stupidity drains
the life right out of me!

195
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:04,496
[LEONE]
Errr! Hya!

196
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:05,796
Huh?!

197
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:08,496
Gah! Ahh!

198
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:11,163
Haa!

199
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:14,063
Ow ow oh ow ow oh!

200
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:18,063
Why... why...
why are you doing this?!

201
00:14:18,163 --> 00:14:19,296
You'd be a killer too

202
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:21,429
if you'd grown up in
the dump like I did!

203
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,763
But you wouldn't know
about that, would you?!

204
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,596
Haha!

205
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:25,463
[Gunshots]

206
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:26,063
Ugh!

207

[Gunshots]

208
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:29,263
[Clicking]

209
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:30,363
[Snarl]

210
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:32,029
[Panicking]

211
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:36,196
[Labored breathing]

212
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:39,763
Even if you did manage
to break my Imperial Arms...

213
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:41,129
[Whimpering]

214
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:44,496
The strength of my spirit
is more than enough...

215
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:45,796
Aghh!

216
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:49,496
...to send a bastard
like you to Hell!

217
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,729
Hur‐ahhh!

218
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:54,329
Hmph!

219
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:06,229
[LEONE]
Phew, glad that's
outta my system.

220
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:10,529
So I guess this means
Night Raid is pretty
much finished, huh?

221
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:12,029
Hm.

222
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:16,929
Goodbye... my friend.

223
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,629
Huh?

224
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:21,829
Leone... don't tell me‐

225
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,963
Aw, don't gimme
that look.

226
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:26,563
Think! I'll get to
see everyone again.

227
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,129
Uh...

228
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:29,829
Hmm...

229
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,296
There! There's
that little smile.

230
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:33,396
Goodbye!

231
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:36,163
[Footsteps fading]

232
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:42,529
Bye... Leone.

233
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:51,963
[People celebrating]

234
00:15:58,063 --> 00:16:01,263
[Girls joyfully laughing]

235
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,629
[Men]
Cheers to the revolution!

236
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:08,863
Finally get to
kiss our lives of
poverty goodbye!

237
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:12,163
Yeah! You'll never
get rich if you don't
quit bein' a lazy bum!

238
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,129
[DRUNK]
Hahaha! Got that right!
Come on!

239
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:17,296
[Man]
Hey, Leone!

240
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:19,363
Wanna knock back
a cold one with us?

241
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:22,229
Over here, Gramps,
Leone needs a mug!

242
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,763
Leone, it's been
too long since ya‐

243
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:25,729
Huh?

244
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:28,229
Where'd she go?

245
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:03,229
[Crowd mutters]

246
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:13,963
[EMPEROR]
A beheading.
That should settle it, right?

247
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:15,563
[NAJENDA]
Right.

248
00:17:15,663 --> 00:17:17,429
[EMPEROR]
Just when you think
a fallen Emperor

249
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:21,729
has nothing left to do, there's
one final task to be done.

250
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,863
Yes.

251
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:24,863
If one gives‐in to hysterics...

252
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:27,063
then we make fools of ourselves.

253
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:30,596
The final duty...
is die with pride.

254
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:37,029
[Climbing footsteps]

255
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:48,063
[EMPEROR]
Please, create a peaceful land
with no more bloodshed.

256
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:50,396
[NAJENDA]
<i>You have my word.</i>

257
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:53,529
<i>This is the last drop</i>
<i>of blood to be spilled.</i>

258
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:04,729
Kurome, I'll do my best to help
everyone in the new world.

259
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:07,029
I'll help them to be
safe and happy...

260
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,329
I'll do it for both of us.

261
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:10,229
And I'll do my
absolute best

262
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:12,329
as the new Minister
of Home Affairs.

263
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:15,463
This nation will
finally be at peace.

264
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,229
[WAVE]
And, Commander?

265
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:21,196
Feel free to share some of
that courage with me.

266
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:23,929
[RUN]
Do you think she's caught up
with Tatsumi by now?

267
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:27,829
[WAVE]
Ha! I betcha he's still doing
whatever he can to get away!

268
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:29,363
Hehe...

269
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,263
Well, we should be going.

270
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:34,329
There's plenty of work waiting
for us when we get back.

271
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:46,463
[MAYOR]
Why, this is more than we
ever had before!

272
00:18:46,563 --> 00:18:49,829
I can't believe how much
Tatsumi and the others
have been able to send us,

273
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,929
it's changed everything
around here.

274
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,763
And now that things
have settled back down,

275
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:57,429
maybe Tatsumi, Sayo, and
Ieyasu would be able to
come on back home again.

276
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:58,696
Um‐hmm.

277
00:18:58,796 --> 00:19:00,663
They shall return as heroes.

278
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:05,096
We'll welcome them home
with a glorious celebration.

279
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:35,096
[NAJENDA]
It's amazing what people
can live through.
Uh?

280
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:37,696
They're already
rebuilding the city.

281
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:40,629
Boss...
you're okay, right?

282
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:41,929
Yeah.

283
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,663
But I can't deny
I've shortened my lifespan.

284
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:50,329
So there's no telling how much
longer my body will hold out.

285
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:54,796
I'll dedicate my final
days to setting up
the new nation.

286
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:56,829
It's the least I can
do for these people

287
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,096
as one of
the survivors.

288
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:02,296
[AKAME]
If anyone can
do it, it's you.

289
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:10,096
[NAJENDA]
You're planning on
leaving, aren't you?

290
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:11,629
Yeah.

291
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:13,163
If you want to
blame me

292
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:16,096
for all the Revolutionary
Army's despair, I don't mind.

293
00:20:16,196 --> 00:20:19,263
Sorry you got stuck
with such an ugly
role in this.

294
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:23,229
I'm sure your
new mission will be
just as challenging.

295
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,629
We've lost many things
along the way...

296
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:28,196
but I'm still glad I
fought with Night Raid.

297
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:30,996
Thank you for
inviting me...

298
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,729
Najenda.

299
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:34,963
Yeah.

300
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:37,296
It has been an honor.

301
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:43,329
Farewell.

302
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:48,629

[NARRATOR]
Night Raid.

304
00:20:56,596 --> 00:20:58,229
At the fall of the Empire,

305
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,963
they were remembered as
a violent gang of criminals

306
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:03,263
who terrorized the Capital.

307
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,729
However, as the
new society grew,

308
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:10,196
not a single mention of their
existence could be found.

309
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:12,663
As long as there
is human nature,

310
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:15,129
so too must there be malice.

311
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:17,096
As long as there is malice,

312
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:19,463
so too must there be evil.

313
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,163
Evil beyond salvation.

314
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:24,429
For those who don't
wield a sword,

315
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:28,196
these vile demons are
silenced in the darkness.

316
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:32,529
By a group of elite assassins.

00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:15,496
[AKAME]

<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

319
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:22,129

<i>I believe I can find</i>
<i>my way to a new future.</i>

323

<i>I'm certain of it.</i>

324
