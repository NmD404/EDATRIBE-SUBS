1
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:11,778
Yes...

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,180
Perfect! It's all better!

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,717
<i>It was nice taking it easy</i>
<i>waiting for my arm to heal,</i>

4
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,720
<i>but I'm ready to fight again!</i>

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,790
<i>With Sheele and Bulat gone,</i>
<i>I'll have to work extra hard!</i>

6
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,691
Okay! Which one of you
is gonna train with me?!

7
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,760
(uggghhh)

8
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,995
Hey, Mine! What's up?

9
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,064
I'm glad your arm's
feeling better.

10
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,699
[MINE] What are you guys doing?

11
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,101
These pansies weren't getting
anywhere with their training,

12
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,403
so we decided to help out.

13
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,906
[TATSUMI] (straining)
I never realized...

14
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:25,712
until I actually put on
Incursio, how fast that thing
can take a toll on my stamina.

15
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,381
If I wanna wear it for
long battles like Bro did,

16
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,083
I'm gonna have to bulk up.

17
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,484
With the way I am right now,

18
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,387
I can only go invisible
for about a second.

19
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,259
It's a bit unusual to see YOU
getting all sweaty, Lubb.

20
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,162
Well since the team is down
to only two guys now,

21
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,032
figure it's about time
I started getting a
little bit more serious.

22
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,968
It's cute when you talk all big,

23
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:51,437
since you haven't done half as
many pushups as Tatsumi here.
[LUBBOCK] (grrr...)

24
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,039
But it's not his fault.

25
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,777
There's a considerable weight
difference between me and Leone.

26
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,911
(HUH?!)

27
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,680
(BANG!)
[AKAME] (awwwhhh)

28
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,916
[NAJENDA] Good, you're all here.
[ALL] (hm?) [LEONE] Boss!

29
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,151
[NAJENDA] I'm off to the
Revolutionaries' main base.

30
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,689
I'm thinking they'll need
the weapons we got from
the Three Beasts.

31
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,990
By yourself?

32
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,358
And you're taking that battle
axe? Isn't it kinda heavy?

33
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,195
[NAJENDA]
Nah, I can handle it. See?

34
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,163
Now there's no way I
could actually use it,

35
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,165
but I can at least
lug it around.

36
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,401
I had no idea
she was such a badass.

37
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,938
Of course she's a badass.
She used to be a general, man.

38
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,273
Akame,
I'm leaving you in charge.

39
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,776
I want everyone to buckle down
and train hard.

40
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,945
(ah!) Okay, whatever.

41
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,780
Hey! Could you be serious?!

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,048
Ah, don't worry too much,

43
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:40,220
Akame always gets the
job done either way.

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,556
(exhales)
I'm also going to the base

45
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,225
to try and recruit a couple
new members for the team.

46
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,193
Although, I highly doubt
they can afford to give us

47
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,496
anybody who's ready for
combat at the moment.

48
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,935
I'm sorry, guys. I'm trying
to get better, I promise.

49
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,672
(exhales) The Three Beasts you
defeated on the cruise ship...

50
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,107
They were at the center of the
Empire's offensive forces

51
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,577
and members of Esdeath's army.

52
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,046
But you and Bulat managed
to defeat them.

53
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:10,116
Esdeath may be a powerful foe,
but she's suffered a
devastating loss.

54
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:14,320
When the revolution begins,
we will have considerably less
to worry about.

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,456
You didn't just save passengers.

56
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,859
You ultimately saved thousands
of revolutionaries

57
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,328
who will be needed in our
struggle against the empire.
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

58
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,966
You are strong, Tatsumi.
And you're doing a great job.

59
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,370
(choked up) Yes, ma'am.

60
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,174
I didn't tell you before,
because I didn't want it
to go to your head.

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,209
But Bulat told me something.

62
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,178
Tatsumi's still got
a lot to figure out,

63
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,714
but I can see he has
amazing potential.

64
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,183
If we do a good job training
him, maybe he could even

65
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,686
improve enough to surpass me
one of these days.

66
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,855
I can't wait to see
what he does.

67
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,293
Thanks, man!

68
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,530
[NAJENDA] Take pride in
yourself, and survive.

69
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,231
That's all you can do.

70
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,135
Try your best to become
the kind of person Bulat
wanted you to be.

71
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,770
(trying not to cry)

72
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,075
[NAJENDA] <i>Our need for more</i>
<i>members is critical.</i>

73
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,812

00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,160
Liver, Nyau, Daidara...

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,596
All three of you were killed.

78
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,965
I suppose that means
you were just too weak.

79
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,936
You've fallen victim to the
laws of natural selection.

80
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,038
Such incompetence.

81
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,709
I cannot change the past,

82
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,378

avenge your death.

00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,169
(small chuckle) Oh well!

101
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,172
If I can handle fighting pirates
and aquatic Danger Beasts,

102
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,574
then this is nothing!

103
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,910
There's no reason to
stir things up!

104
00:06:56,316 --> 00:07:00,554

(aaahhh...) I'm so sorry!

110
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,243
Oh God, that was probably the
interrogation room!

111
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,846
Man, I'm such an idiot.

dramatic introduction.

136
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,837

S‐Sorry.

153
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,946
I would have said hello before,
but I'm a little bit... shy.

154
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,950
Y'know, bashful.
Sorry, I... I'm sorry.
[WAVE] (huh?)

together, don't I?

get to be close friends.

<i>but he is NOT my type.</i>
<i>(uh‐umm)</i>

165
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,149
(door opens)
[ALL] (hmm?)

166
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,253
[WAVE] And who might you be?

167
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,656
[ESDEATH] What in the hell
are you all doing in here?!

168
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:23,924
What's your problem?

169
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,259
We were all invited to come and‐
(ooofff)

170
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,229
(unghhh)

171
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,397
[ESDEATH] You never know
who's an assassin.

172
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,100
Don't ever let your guard down.

173
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,170
[ESDEATH] <i>This one has</i>
<i>good reaction speed.</i>

174
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,172
(crazy chuckle)

175
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,206
(gasps)

176
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,742
(ughhh)

177
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,810
[ESDEATH] You can't attack from
behind when your bloodlust

178
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,747
is so easily sensed.

179
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:51,317
(swish ‐ swoosh)
[KUROME] Not going to hold back,
even if this is just a game.

180
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,389
[ESDEATH] Must be the
Imperial Arms Yat‐su‐fu‐sa.

181
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,158
Just as sharp as expected.

182
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,628
(gasps) General Esdeath!

183
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,764
(ugh) God...

184
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:08,068
(gasps) <i>So... even the</i>
<i>superior officer's a nutcase!</i>

185
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,135
(heh!)

186
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,237
[ESDEATH]
I hope you found that enjoyable.

187
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,775
I didn't want to bore anyone
with a formal meet n' greet.

188
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,910
Nah, I'm used to a
little rough‐housing.

189
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,312
Your advice was very helpful!
Thanks a lot!

190
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,648
[ESDEATH] Good.
After we visit the Emperor,

191
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:22,849
we'll have a little party.

192
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,718
Wha?!
We're gonna meet the Emperor?!

193
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:25,986
With all due respect,

194
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,521
aren't we taking things
a bit too quickly?

195
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,456
I prefer to get the more tedious
things over with first.

196
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,058
Oh, by the way, General...

197
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,461
Have you decided on a
super‐fierce name
for the squad yet?

198
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,730
Yes.

199
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,532
We are an independently
mobile team

200
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:43,103
charged with hunting down
an elusive gang of
vicious murderers.

201
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,370
Therefore...

202
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,540
I'd like us to be called...

203
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,942
the Jaegers.

204
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,277
[WAVE] <i>I love the idea of all</i>
<i>of us eating together,</i>

205
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,181
<i>especially since the meal</i>
<i>is the seafood I brought</i>
<i>for everyone.</i>

206
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,451
<i>But why are we the only ones</i>
<i>who know how to cook?</i>

207
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,920
[BOLS] Wave!
[WAVE] (hmmm?)

208
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,287
The spinach goes in last.

209
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,790
It'll wither if you
put it in too soon.

210
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,792
Uh, you're right. I'm sorry.

211
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,360
Anyway, I wanted to tell you...

212
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,664
It's a huge relief to find out
you're such a nice guy, Bols.

213
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,434
[BOLS] N‐No, I'm afraid I'm
not all that nice.

214
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,603
Wooof.... Woof!
[SERYU] Commander?
[ESDEATH] Yes?

215
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,471
[SERYU] When you're not working,
what sort of things
[KORO] Woof! Woof!

216
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,206
do you like to do
in your free time?

217
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,910
Torturing prisoners... Learning
new methods of torture...

218
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,513
But as of just recently...

219
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,683
I've found...
an interest in love.

220
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:30,751
[BOTH] Love?

221
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,385
(soft chuckle)

222
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:36,322
Anyway, I've heard reports that
we have an extra Imperial Arms.

223
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,924
Oh! Uh, yes!

224
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,094
It's a scissor‐type weapon that
I have reclaimed from evil!

225
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,097
But we have yet to find
anyone who can use it.

226
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:47,768
The minister will confiscate it
if we don't find a wielder.

227
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,035
Which would be a waste.

228
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,303
To make things interesting,

229
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,039
we'll turn our search
into a little game.

230
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,312
[LUBBOCK] Yo!

231
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,381
[TATSUMI] Hey!

232
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,116
Come on in!

233
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,551
After you.

234
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,253
[TATSUMI] Whoa...

235
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,792
This really is
like a secret base.

236
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,527
[LUBBOCK] Yup!
It's my pride and joy.

237
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,829
Come on, it's not like you
built the place yourself.

238
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:19,666
Hel‐looooo! Welcome to our
Imperial Secret Base!
[LUBBOCK] (chuckling)

239
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,201
You're not being very secretive!

240
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,570
[LUBBOCK] Well, the Imperial
Guard's put up wanted posters

241
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,639
of some of us all over the city.

242
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,809
But there are still a few of us
who can still be seen out there.

243
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,844
Yeah, and if that isn't
enough for ya,

244
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,378
the whole capital's
been going crazy.

245
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,148
Some kind of special police
force called the "Jaegers".

246
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,350
That's because Esdeath
is in charge of it.

247
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,653
She's a pretty big deal
in this town.

248
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,988
You don't wanna mess with her.

249
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:45,559
Is this Esdeath chick
really all that dangerous?

250
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,093
You have no idea.

251
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,429
Okay, maybe I should
tell you the story.

252
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,932
So, several years ago...

253
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,234
A southwestern tribe raised
the standard of revolt

254
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,269
against the cruelty
of the empire.

255
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,540
So the empire sent the
army to quiet them down.

256
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,945
The tribe only had 10,000 men
as opposed to the
Imperial Army's 120,000,

257
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,247
so it seemed like the
outcome would be clear.

258
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,783
But it turned out to be way more
complicated than that.

259
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,319
Since the Imperial soldiers
were so used to their
cush city life,

260
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,690
they weren't able to survive
in the harsh wilderness.

261
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,759
Plus, the tribesmen
would attack at night,

262
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,994
so that made it even more
difficult for them.

263
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:25,599
The Empire started to panic, so
they dispatched General Najenda
and General Esdeath,

264
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,702
who were already extremely
talented despite being so young.

265
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:31,638
[NAJENDA] You seem to be in
a bad mood, General Esdeath.

266
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,439
[ESDEATH] (scoff)
Can you blame me?

267
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,177
The minister ordered me to
use Imperial Arms to
exterminate the rebels.

268
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:41,615
I'd hoped to take my time
punishing the forces who wiped
out the Suppression Unit,

269
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,483
but he doesn't share
my interests.

270
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:46,419
It takes all the fun out of
the whole thing.

271
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,188
But what can you do?

272
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,729
[ESDEATH] No matter if it's
Danger Beasts, killer insects,

273
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,031
plagues or viruses...

274
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:03,203
Anything that gets in my way...
will freeze!

275
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,305
(uggghhh)

276
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,741
(gasps)

277
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:11,111
[NAJENDA]
<i>Her power... it's incredible.</i>

278
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,914
We'll take over the enemy base,
okay?

279
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,718
Man, I feel like a cannonball
when I charge like this!

280
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,553
Artillery... FIRE!

281
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:24,525
(volley of gunshots)
[TRIBESMEN] (screaming)

282
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:28,995
As soon as you slaughter them,
you can enjoy your reward!

283
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,998
Have your way with
this wretched city!

284
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,667
(gasps) (disgusted)

285
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,001
[ESDEATH]
It's beautiful, isn't it?

286
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,203
Your precious home
burning to the ground.

287
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,039
You bitch! Just finish me off!

288
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,442
I feel like being merciful.
I think I'll take pity on you.

289
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:44,678
I'll allow you and
your friends to go free.

290
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,112
Like hell you will!

291
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,781
If you don't just kill me,
I swear you're gonna wish

292
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,583
you'd never come to this‐
(ungghhh)

293
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,984
[ESDEATH] Listen well.

294
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,754
Such is the fate that
befalls those who are weak.

295
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:56,322
Don't like it?
Make yourself strong.

296
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,225
[NAJENDA] <i>What do I do? There's</i>
<i>no way I could obey an order</i>

297
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,927
<i>to slaughter those people,</i>

298
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,164
<i>nor can I stand with those</i>
<i>so ready to do so!</i>

299
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,667
Well, that's the story.

300
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,869
It's pretty sick how she drilled
hate into those people

301
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,470
before letting them go.

302
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:12,606
Hang on though, from the
empire's side,

303
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,075
seems like she was
instigating the rebellion.

304
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,011
Yep, that's exactly what
Esdeath was trying to do.

305
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,880
She wanted to stir up
another uprising.

306
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,216
That way she could get her kicks
on the battlefield forever.

307
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,918
She sounds like a lunatic!

308
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,987
(big sigh) That was a close one.

309
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:31,257
I made the right choice
when I didn't pick a fight
with her by myself.

310
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,326
I mean, you would have to murder
like millions of people

311
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,195
to get a reputation like hers.

312
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,830
The way you guys are talking
about her,

313
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,965
she must be a monster!

314
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,234
You can check her out for
yourself if you want.

315
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,970
She's sponsoring a
martial arts tournament.

316
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,772
There's a cash prize
for the winner.

317
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,875
So you could earn some money for
your village while you're at it.

318
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,310
(uh...)

319
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,348
[EMPEROR] Uh, Minister...

320
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,918
Why do you think General Esdeath
is so interested

321
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,419
in falling in love
all of a sudden?

322
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,387
Everyone begins
to have these feelings

323
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,725
once they reach a certain age.
(chomp)

324
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,293
General Esdeath was
born to fight.

325
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,030
She has cared for
nothing but war.

326
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,900
Now, she's awakening to
her carnal desires.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,268
Interesting.

328
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,838
It would be wonderful to
locate a match for her.

329
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,806
She's an incredibly
prideful woman.

330
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:24,044
She won't waste any time on a
suitor who doesn't meet her
criteria.

331
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,780
[EMPEROR] But how will we
ever find a man like this?

332
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,517
[ESDEATH] Number One: Above all
else, he must have potential.

333
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,419
I'd like to personally train
him to become a general.

334
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,022
Number Two:
He must have composure

335
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,424
and be able to hunt
Danger Beasts.

336
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,261
Number Three: Like me, he must
have been raised

337
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,496
in the frontier rather
than the capital.

338
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:47,400
"Number Four: I want someone
younger so I can dominate him."

339
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,004
"Number Five: He must be someone
with a pure and innocent smile."

340
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,806
(heavy sigh)

341
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:56,743
The majority of people
won't even get past
condition number one!

342
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:01,181
[MINISTER] Yes, there aren't
many men with the potential
to become generals.

343
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,416
(large crowd cheering)

344
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:04,651
(ungh!)

345
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:06,820
(yah!)

346
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,421
(wah!)

347
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,423
(yawns)

348
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,492
What do you think of the
contenders, General?

349
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,960
They're nothing
but pathetic rabble

350
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,962
floundering through
a street fight.

351
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,363
I seriously doubt
we'll find anyone

352
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,000
who can wield an Imperial Arms.
(crowd roars)

353
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,968
Oh, it looks like
these two are finished.

354
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,170
And the victory
goes to Nobunaga!

355
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,506
That's how it goes!

356
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:29,676
This next bout is going
to be the final match.

357
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:30,677
[WAVE] To my left:

358
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,145
Kalbi the Butcher!

359
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,179
To my right:

360
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,848
Tatsumi the Blacksmith!

361
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,416
He picked an interesting
fake job.

362
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,118
Think he knows anything
about blacksmithing?

363
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,620
Well, he's not as good as me,

364
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,588
but I guess he's
decent with his hands.

365
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:45,659
I see one of them
is pretty young.

366
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,062
[KALBI] (chuckles)
Well, look at you, little fella!

367
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,365
Looks like that prize money
is as good as mine!

368
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,568
I trained at
Imperial Fist Temple.

369
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,470
I was second degree
when they kicked me out!

370
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:01,407
<i>The big fella's not all talk.</i>
<i>He looks pretty strong.</i>

371
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,377
<i>He might've intimidated me a</i>
<i>few months ago,</i>

372
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,680
<i>but I'm a lot different now.</i>

373
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,082
<i>Compared to those Three Beasts</i>
<i>I fought before,</i>

374
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,884
<i>this guy is nothing!</i>

375
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,787
[WAVE] You may begin!

376
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:17,591
[KALBI]
You will feel the full force
of my Explosive Iron Fists!

377
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:20,093
<i>I can beat this guy</i>
<i>without Incursio!</i>

378
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,562
[KALBI] Yah!

379
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,796
(huh?)

380
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,333
[TATSUMI] Hyah!
[KALBI] (ungh)

381
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,902
(grrr...) Yaaahhh!

382
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:35,208
(continued fighting)

383
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,810
[KALBI] (UNGH!)

384
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,612
[KALBI] (ARRGGH!)

385
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:43,950
(GRRR!)

386
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,319
(WAAAHHH!)

387
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,621
[TATSUMI] KYAH!

388
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,990
(huh?)

389
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,593
(stunned murmurs)

390
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,829
He might be small,
but he's rather talented.

391
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:56,930
Yes...

392
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,699
[WAVE] And there you have it!

393
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,966
Tatsumi wins!

394
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,802
(crowd goes wild)

395
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:04,104
(huh?)

396
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,741
<i>Are all these people</i>
<i>cheering for ME?</i>

397
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:10,110
This is awesome!

398
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,245
(aaahhh...)

399
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:14,715
[ESDEATH] He's the one.

400
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,650
[RUN] He's our
Imperial Arms candidate?

401
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,053
[ESDEATH] Oh, yes, that.
But that's not all.

402
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,655
Commander?

403
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:27,260
<i>(urk!) She's coming into</i>
<i>the ring herself?!</i>

404
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:34,968
Tatsumi? Is that right?
That's a lovely name.

405
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,369
Um, thank you.

406
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,071
[TATSUMI] <i>So this is Esdeath.</i>

407
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:42,442
<i>The one everyone's</i>
<i>talking about.</i>

408
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:45,345
<i>If it weren't for her,</i>
<i>we wouldn't have lost Bro.</i>

409
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,413
[ESDEATH]
You put on an impressive show.

410
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,449
Now, for your reward...
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

411
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,652
Oh, uh, thank you
very much, ma'am.

412
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,621
<i>No matter how you get it,</i>
<i>money is still money.</i>

413
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,757
<i>And I have no problem</i>
<i>taking it.</i>

414
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:57,991
[LEONE] (hmm?)

415
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,160
[TATSUMI] Huh?

416
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,796
Starting today,
you'll be mine and mine alone.

417
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:03,730
Uh, wait a sec‐ (urk)

418
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,666
Let's go somewhere
we can be alone.

419
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,300
Too many eyes around here.
[TATSUMI] Hey! Hold on, you
can't just‐

420
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,970
Be a good boy. Okay?
[TATSUMI] STOP IT!

421
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,272
<i>What'd... she do to me?</i>

422
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:15,809
We'll talk further in my room,

423
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,310
just the two of us.

424
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,145
[BOTH] (HUH?!)

425
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:22,182
[LUBBOCK]
WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!

426
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,384
So Esdeath took Tatsumi
away with her?!

427
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,820
Has she figured out he's a
member of Night Raid yet?

428
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,857
I can't really say for sure.
It's probably a 50/50 chance.

429
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,260
The last thing we saw was
her trying to drag him
into the palace.

430
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,396
What should we do now, Akame?

431
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,398
Tatsumi...

432
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,300
I won't ever make you sad again,
Akame.

433
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,868
[AKAME] (unhhh...)

434
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,738
Please don't say something
stupid like we need
to save him.

435
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,172
That won't work.

436
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,342
The first thing we should do is
move our base further from town.

437
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,112
[LEONE] Good thinking.
We're too easy to spot here.

438
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:54,380
[LUBBOCK]
Okay, but what about Tatsumi?

439
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,116
I'm not trying to say you WOULD,
but...

440
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:57,551
No, I understand.

441
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,786
I won't go charging in
without a plan.

442
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,455
But Tatsumi is still a
member of our team!

443
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:04,591
Do whatever it takes!
