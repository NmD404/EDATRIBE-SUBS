00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:04,033
[KUROME]
How fun...

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,800
a battle between Imperial Arms.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,266
How many will die?

4
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:13,333
[Roar]

5
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:17,966
[AKAME]
The more puppets she has,
the slower her reaction time.

6
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,166
That works to my advantage.

7
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,500
Ha!

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,366
Haaa!

9
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:36,433
Huh?

10
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:37,666
Natara?

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,533
Please put him to rest, Kurome!

12
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,300
You grew up together!

13
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,233
How could you say that, Akame?

14
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:50,933
I want him to stay close
to me forever and ever,

15
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,233
he's my special friend.

16
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,733
And I would love to add
you to my collection.

17
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:01,633
'Cause that way... we could be
together like the old days.

18
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,466
Not on your life!

19
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:06,466
[KUROME]
Too bad.

20
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,766
[BOLS]
Magma Drive!

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,666
[AKAME]
<i>His Imperial Arms</i>

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,566
[TATSUMI]
Don't take them on alone!

23
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,500
This isn't like you, Akame!

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,333
Oh!

25
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:25,600
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:32,033
[TATSUMI]
These guys don't seem like
they're gonna go down
without a fight, do they?

27
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,200
[KUROME]
Big Sister...

28
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,866
it's a shame you betrayed the
Empire and sided with them.

29
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:15,933
Desta Ghoul!

30
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,533
Crush them!

31
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:35,000
[MINE]
S‐Class Danger Beasts are
worse than I thought!

32
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,566
That's incredible!

33
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,866
[KUROME]
Hehehe...

34
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,600
Well, that changed
the landscape at least.

35
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,133
However...

36
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,100
Night Raid doesn't get their
reputation for nothing.

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,333
They did manage
to dodge the blast.

38
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:54,533
Looks like the fight's
already started.

39
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,166
<i>Najenda... Rest assured.</i>

40
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:59,200
<i>I will do the best</i>

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,833
<i>And when this mission is over,</i>

42
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,733
<i>I'll tell you how</i>
<i>I really feel.</i>

43
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,000
<i>If I wait any longer...</i>

44
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,166
<i>Su's gonna nab you first!</i>

45
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,166
[SUSANOO]
Its power is true to its class.

46
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,133
[NAJENDA]
Got it!

47
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,600
Everyone, work together!

48
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,733
[SUSANOO]
You didn't issue
the proper command.

49
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,266
Huh?

50
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:22,400
This Desta Ghoul may indeed
be a formidable foe.

51
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,433
But I can handle it on my own.

52
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,600
Assign the rest of
the team elsewhere.

53
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,633
Ah...

54
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,533
That's my Imperial Arms for ya!

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,233
[MINE]
Aim for the puppeteer...

56
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,566
I'll get her this time!

57
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:39,233
Ah!

58
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,233
Huh?

59
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,866
A gunslinger?

60
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:48,700
This should be fun!

00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,066
I've had enough.

72
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,000
[BOLS]
It's not wise to
charge from the front.

73
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,233
Uh...

74
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,300
Aah!

Akame!

78
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,666
Huh?

79
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,166
Whoa!

80
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,666
Congratulations.

81
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:01,500
You've made me mad.

82
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:07,733
I can see right through you
and your cheap little tricks.

83
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,333
Hey!

84
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:12,266

<i>Dammit!</i>

87
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:19,733
[KUROME]
Well, look at this,
a battle royale!

88
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,933
How exciting!

89
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:22,300
Kurome!

90
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,933
See? Don't I have just the
coolest friends ever?

91
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,433
Doya, the gunslinger,

92
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,500
used to be an assassin who
worked for the northern tribe.

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,200
You can still see that tiny
spark of confidence on her face.

94
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,033
Wall was a very
famous bodyguard,

95
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:39,833
but he was protecting my target,
so I killed him.

96
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,933
Apeman is one of
my favorites,

97
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,633
he's easy to use and
hits extremely hard.

98
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:48,266
Henter was one of the last
survivors of a savage tribe.

99
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,666
His clever moves made him
difficult to beat

100
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:52,400
so he's my prized possession.

101
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
Rokugo was an
Imperial general...

102
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,833
but he betrayed us and
tried to join the revolution,

103
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,366
so I had to kill him too.

104
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh, and I found this Desta Ghoul
while it was hibernating.

105
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,533
Talk about lucky!

106
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,766
And...

107
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:08,833
Natara's been with me ever since
I was a little girl!

108
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:10,966
He does a great job
of protecting me

109
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:13,166
whenever Yatsufusa
is activated.

110
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,300
I actually have one more puppet,

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,366
but you'll have to
wait to see that one.

112
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:19,533
<i>No way...</i>

113
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,100
<i>she hasn't even</i>
<i>brought out the full set?!</i>

114
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,700
[Fluttering]
<i>Huh?</i>

115
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,766
<i>Dammit!</i>

116
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:28,800
Wait, what?!

117
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,766
[KUROME]
That won't work.

118
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,233
They're already dead.

119
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,233
You can stab them all you want
and they'll keep moving.

120
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,166
You'll have to defeat me first.

121
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,233
Ugh!

122
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,133
Okay, buddy, I'll admit it,
you're pretty tough.

123
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,733
But!

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,433
I've got your pattern down!

125
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:51,966
I'm not gonna let you
keep hitting me

126
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:53,533
with the same attacks
over and over!

127
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,600
[NAJENDA]
Don't let go of that
whip, Leone!

128
00:07:58,533 --> 00:07:59,766
General Rokugo.

129
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:02,033
Since you're a former colleague,

130
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,900
I'll do my best to free you
from this curse

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,666
as quickly as possible.

132
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:10,700
Whoa! I can't remember the last
time I saw the Boss in action!

133
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,500
Alright then! Let's do this‐

134
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,500
Uh...

135
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,166
[Gasp]

136
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,433
[KUROME]
Hehehe...

137
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,633
Oh dear...

138
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,966
that's why you should never
take your eyes off me.

139
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:27,233
Whenever I see an opening,
I'm going to take it.

140
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:32,166
I'll make you pay for this...
little tramp!

141
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:35,600
You should know better
than to make assumptions.

142
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,033
You're not the only
opportunist in this battle.

143
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,633
Argh!

144
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,100
Oh wow that's impressive,

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,500
you can stop the bleeding
all by yourself!

146
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,700
You made a mistake messing
with me, little girl!

147
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,366
I'm gonna eat you alive!

148
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,033
Hehe...

149
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,733
Don't engage her, Leone!

150
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,666
Remember, she has a bodyguard.

151
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:04,200
You'd better support Akame
at least for the moment.

152
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,966
When you're finished,
we'll face Kurome together.

153
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,433
Let the two ex‐generals
duke it out.

154
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,566
Rokugo doesn't have
an Imperial Arms,

155
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,033
so I should be fine.

156
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,133
[LEONE]
Yes ma'am.

157
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't go anywhere...

158
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,666
I'm coming back for you.

159
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,033
I'm starting to think

160
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:25,133
you'd be the perfect
addition to my collection.

161
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,033
I'm surprised we haven't
caught up to them by now.

162
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,466
I don't like it.

163
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:39,900
It does seem like something's
not right, doesn't it?

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,333
[ESDEATH]
Perhaps this is a decoy

165
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:43,700
and Kurome's group is
the real Night Raid.

166
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,566
[Horse neighing]

167
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,266
[Thugs laughing]

168
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:52,100
And now we're running into
a gang of mindless meatheads.

169
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,466
Hard to believe this
is a coincidence.

170
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,300
[Thug]
Guess we heard right, boys!

171
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,933
[Hooligan]
She did show up here!

172
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,166
[Punk]
In the flesh!

173
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,933
So that must mean
these evil thugs

174
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,233
are working with Night Raid.

175
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,500
[ESDEATH]
‐Seryu.
‐Huh...

176
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
‐Run.
‐Hmm...

177
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,266
Destroy most of them.

178

351
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:50,254
Okay, I'm about ready
to kill a bitch.

352
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:51,288
[TATSUMI]
Mine?

353
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,554
What are you doing in there?

354
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:54,721
[MINE]
Oh, just got through
a living hell;

355
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:56,321
you could've
helped me, you know!

356
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:58,388
And don't look at me
like that, pervert!

357
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,854
How can you even tell
where I'm looking?!

358
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:02,488
[NAJENDA]
That's enough arguing
for now, you two!

359
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:04,921
We've got a battle
to win, remember?

360
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,221
[MINE]
Boss!

361
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:07,488
[TATSUMI]
Huh, what happened?

362
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,088
Why does Su look so cool?!

363
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,154
You wondered
how many will die.

364
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:12,488
Right Kurome?

365
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,021
I think I have
the answer for you.

366
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:18,688
Oh you think so, huh?

367
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:20,521
I get it.

368
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:23,021
I'll just have to kill
every last one of you...

369
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:27,554
that way you can be my
precious puppets forever.

370
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:34,054
Let's take him out!

371
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:35,354
Right!

372
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:39,488
[BOLS]
Uh? Why would they jump?

373
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,854
They can't dodge up there!

374
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:45,354
Now!

375
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,588
Uh...

376
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:49,888
[AKAME]
<i>If the bodyguard is eventually</i>
<i>going to be in our way...</i>

377
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:53,954
<i>then we can surprise everyone</i>
<i>by going after him first!</i>

378
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:58,288
No!

379
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:01,588
[LEONE]
<i>He's locked in on Akame,</i>

380
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:04,688
<i>and his bodyguard isn't</i>
<i>there to help him anymore!</i>

381
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:06,021
<i>He's mine!</i>

382
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:07,888
Ugh!

383
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,754
<i>Sneaky bastard!</i>

384
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,021
<i>Ah, crap!</i>

385
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:20,321
AAAH!

386
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:22,288
[Metallic snap]

387
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:23,954
Uh?

388
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,421
Hehe... [spit]

389
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:28,988
Tastes like you're
about to lose.

390
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:33,454
Did you actually just bite off
a piece of my weapon?!

391
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:36,888
[BOLS]
Ah...

392
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:39,221
[LEONE]
What're you gonna do
with your Imperial Arms,

393
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:40,721
it's nothing but a
hunk of garbage now.

394
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:43,954
[BOLS]
<i>She's right,</i>
<i>I can't use it anymore.</i>

395
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,454
Alright then.

396
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:46,588
Eh?

397
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:47,588
Huh?

398
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,588
I'll dispose of it.

399
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:55,721
Wait! No don't!

400
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:57,788
[Click]

401
00:23:35,254 --> 00:23:40,588
