1
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:16,533
[TATSUMI]
So this is the Capital's
red‐light district.
I'm a little nervous.

2
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:21,600
[LEONE]
Aww. Tatsumi, you're so cute
when you act all bashful!

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,866
Anyway. That money ain't gonna
make itself, so I say
we get cooking!

4
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:28,466
Lionel, transform!

5
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,266
Ha! When I get into beast mode

6
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:40,500
I feel like I can just
take on the whole world!

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,466
[Tatsumi clapping]

8
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:45,566
[LEONE]
C'mon, let's get in there
and make a mess of things.

9
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,100
Wha?

10
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:52,300
[TATSUMI]
Wait, hold on! Ahhh!

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,000
Not so fast!

12
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,366
Whew. It looks like we made it!

13
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:53,566
[TATSUMI]
But I thought we were
gonna "sneak in"...

14
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,366
[Chatter and giggling]

15
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,333
Look at this.

16
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,566
Huh?

17
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,566
[Giggling]

18
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,400
Uh...

19
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
[Door opens]

20
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
[BOSS]
Ooh, they sure are
goin' to town!

21
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,633
If you want me to
bring you more,

22
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,666
better keep bein' good
little girls, you understand?

23
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,600
Okay!

24
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,233
Huh?
[Girl giggles]

25
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,133
[LACKEY]
Hey Boss, what about
that one over there?

26
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,200
[BOSS]
Eh, I'm done with her.

27
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,466
Her mind's gone and
she stinks of fish.

28
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,766
Just get rid of her.
These bitches are
pretty easy to replace.

29
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,133
[GIRL]
Please... I need more!

30
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,400
[LACKEY]
Hm? Here.

31
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,433
[Punching]
[GIRL] Ow!
[LEONE][grunts]

32
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:42,794
[LACKEY]
I guess we need to go and pick
up a few more from the slums.

33
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:45,094
[BOSS]
Yeah, these bitches
are a dime a dozen.

34
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:47,693
Show 'em a little money, and
they'll do whatever you want.

35
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:50,826
This is even more sick than
the client said it was.

36
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,593
Those bastards!

37
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,259
That girl he was just hitting...

38
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,438
she was a friend of mine
from back home.

39
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,904
Now I'm pissed!

40
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,538
Let's just slaughter these pukes
and be done with it!

41
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:02,871
Roger that!

42
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:05,071
[LACKEY]
It looks like we're in
prime position

43
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,638
to move and expand the drug
route a little bit, huh?

44
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:09,371
[BOSS]
Yeah, probably so.

45
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,204
I'll have a talk
with Mr. Chiburu

46
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:13,104
and see how he feels about it.

47
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:14,671
[BAD GUYS]
Huh?

48
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:17,671
[BOTH]
We're here to send every
single one of you...

49
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,771
straight to Hell!

50
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:21,471
Get those punks!

51
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,071
Bring back their heads!

52
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,638
[Guys charging]

53
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:27,304
[Grunt]

54
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:32,038
Every person in this
trafficking ring is our target.

55
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,371
Which means all of you
are about to die.

56
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,371
Get ready for some pain, fellas!

57
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:38,604
Uh... Kill her!

58
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:41,871
[Grunting]

59
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:44,804
Ahh!

60
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:48,804
Ah!

61
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:51,304
Ugh...

62
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:53,904
[Trembling]
I'm‐I'm not gonna die...

63
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:56,804
I'm not gonna let you kill me!

64
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:57,971
[Gasp]

65
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:01,004
Then you'll have to move
faster than that, right?

66
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,671
[Gasps]

67
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,738
[Choking]

68
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,271
Please, take whatever you want.

69
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,704
You want money?
You want drugs?

70
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,104
I'll give you anything.

71
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:16,204
I'll give you everything.
Just let me go, please!

72
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:18,138
Anything I want, huh?

73
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:20,604
Thanks, but the only thing
I want from you is your life.

74
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:23,904
Who the hell are
you people anyway?!

75
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,404
[Choking]

76
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:26,371
Hehe...

77
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,338
Oh, we're just "bitches"!

78
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:30,671
[Groan]

79
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:35,938
I mean, honestly...

80
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:38,238
who better than a couple of
"bitches" to take you out?

81
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,204
[TATSUMI]
Uh, could you come up with
something else to
call us, please?

82
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:49,371
[TATSUMI]
So, what's gonna happen
to all those girls?

83
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:51,038
They're really messed up now.

84
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:54,771
[LEONE]
Unfortunately, that's not
really our call.

85
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,771
I know, but still.

86
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:00,271
[LEONE]
There's a retired doctor
who still lives around here.

87
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,138
I'll let him know what happened.

88
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,704
He'd probably be more than
happy to lend a hand.

89
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:08,038
The doc always was fond of
pretty girls, so everybody wins.

90
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:09,538
Know what I'm sayin?

91
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:11,604
That's great.

92
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,338
Heh. See, I knew you had
a little soft side.

93
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:17,638
I used to be friends with one of
those women, that's all it is.

94
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:19,738
That's the only reason
I wanted to help.

95
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,938
[TATSUMI]
Well, I don't care why.

96
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:22,904
Uh?

97
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,338
All that matters is
that those girls

98
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:26,571
get another chance
to start over.

99
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:29,938
[LEONE]
‐Tatsumi.
‐Hm?

100
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:31,738
[LEONE]
I've been meaning to
tell you something...

101
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,538
When you let yourself smile...

102
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:35,304
you're really sweet.

103
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:36,471
Ah!

104
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:37,971
Wh‐wh‐wha?!

105
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,204
[Leone laughs]

106
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:40,504
You can't run away now;

107
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,071
I've already marked
my territory!

108
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:45,371
Once you finally grow up,
you're gonna be all mine, baby.

109
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,138
Well anyway,

110
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:50,271
I wonder how the other group's
doing right about now?

111
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:55,338
That Chiburu guy was so
obnoxiously careful

112
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,038
I thought we'd never
track him down!

113
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:58,171
Yeah that's true,

114
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:00,704
but at least we completed
the mission on time!

115
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:07,038
[Leaves rustling]
Uh?

116
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:09,371
[Gasp]

117
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,771

118
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:12,004
Tehe...

119
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:15,904
Who is that?

120
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:17,404
Is it an enemy?

121
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,771
I couldn't sense her at all!

122
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:21,604
The other guards can't
conceal their auras,

123
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:24,738
so she must be on a
completely different level!

124
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:27,971
[SERYU]
I know you...

125
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:30,238
you're the one from
the wanted posters.

126
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,971
Sheele of Night Raid, I presume?

127
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:34,638
And judging by your
friend's weapon

128
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:37,604
I'd guess that she's from
Night Raid too.

129
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,771
I'm so glad I spent
the night on watch

130
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:42,471
or I never would have
found the two of you.

131
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:44,204
Finally...

132
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:47,671
Oh, how badly I've been
wanting to meet you, Night Raid!

133
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:51,071
I'm Imperial Guard member
Seryu Ubiquitous!

134
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,104
And in the name of
absolute justice...

135
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:56,671
I'll banish your evil
right here and now!

136
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:02,038
[Clock ticking]

137
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,571
Well now that you've
blown my cover,

138
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,171
you can either die
where you're standing

139
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:13,704
or you can come with us.

140
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:15,804
[SERYU]
They say you're wanted
dead or alive.

141
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:18,438
So that means
I can execute you!

142
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:22,204
Bandits like you are the
reason my Father was killed
in the line of duty!

143
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:26,571
And you were the ones
who murdered my mentor,
Captain Ogre!

144
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:28,871
I'll never forgive you,
Night Raid!

145
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,538
So you're that eager to
fight us, huh?

146
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:33,971
Fine. I'll make it quick!

147
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:34,971

149
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,904
Did I get her yet?

150

[Huge growl]

151
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:55,171
Y'see that....
is that what I think it is?

152
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:56,538
I'm afraid so.

153
00:08:56,638 --> 00:09:00,104
This girl has an organic
type of Imperial Arms.

154
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:01,704
Tonfa guns!

00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:08,538
[SERYU]
<i>Looks like shooting won't be</i>
<i>effective from this distance.</i>

156
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:10,071
Koro! Suppertime!

I'm sorry.

159
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:27,804
Heh...

[Roars in pain]

Don't you even remember what
the book said, Sheele?!

166
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:53,171
Organic type Imperial Arms
always have a hidden core
you have to destroy;

167
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,404
otherwise they just
keep regenerating!

168
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:59,038
And it doesn't have a heart
so Akame's sword won't
do any good either.

169
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:02,371
This is a surprisingly
nasty opponent!

170
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:04,571
Koro. Bulk up.

00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,504
Bleh. That's not cute.

173
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:15,104
Crush her!
