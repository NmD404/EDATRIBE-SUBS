1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:04,204
[WAVE] I don't get it. I feel
like we've looked everywhere.

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,072
Where could their hideout be?!

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,274
[SUZUKA] Well, Kyoroku is
an extremely large city.

4
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:11,344
And since this religious
organization is a fairly
peaceful one,

5
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,814
we can't do anything drastic
to lure them out.

6
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:17,518
It's going to take more than
simply attacking someone.

7
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:18,318
[children laughing]

8
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,621
Here!
[KORO] Woof! Woof!

9
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,188
Kids are so cute!

10
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,757
They're still so young and pure,

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,059
they haven't been
tainted with evil!

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:30,063
[SUZUKA]
Wow, I never realized she could
actually smile like that.

13
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,633
Yeah, she'd been stressed
for quite a while.

14
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,169
So Esdeath told her she should
try a little change of pace.

15
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,305
By the way, you've been
hanging around a lot lately.

16
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:41,742
Have you decided
to join us or what?

17
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,611
Hmm... I guess we're "partners."

18
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,348
Whatever it takes to get General
Esdeath to put me in my place.

19
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,852
(slightly crazed giggle)
[WAVE] I'm not sure why,

20
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,689
but something about this girl
reminds me of Dr. Stylish.

21
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,792
See ya! Remember to have fun
playing and never cheat.

22
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,960
Okay, boys and girls?

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,962
Wooofff!
[CHILDREN] Okay!

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,965
[SERYU] It's so nice to
guide them down the path
of righteousness

25
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,467
while they're young and
impressionable!

26
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,872
Yes, this is what is right.
This is my country!

27
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,307
I'll protect it at all costs.

28
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,737
[AKAME] That's all the info
the spies gathered.

29
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,474
We will launch the plan
the day of the
Path of Peace celebration.

30
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,877
Wow, going out with a bang, huh!

31
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,378
During the festival,

32
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,081
we'll slip through the crowds
and sneak into the palace.

33
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,416
Then we'll go in for the kill!
[thwack]

34
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,686
[TATSUMI] Serves him right.

35
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:09,189
This job will send the
Revolutionary Army into action!

36
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,392
Failure is not an option!
[ALL] (uh‐huh)

37
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,260
[SUSANOO] Dinnertime, everyone.

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,197
I pulled out
all the stops today.

39
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,600
Is everyone ready to have
their minds blown?!

40
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,602
[ALL] Yeah!

41
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,170
[SUSANOO] Najenda gets ramen.
The noodles are extra firm

42
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,641
and the balance of chicken
and salt is just right!
[NAJENDA] Ooh!

43
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,510
[SUSANOO]
Mine gets strawberry parfait.

44
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,312
I even added a little
something extra.
[MINE] Yummy!

45
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,949
[SUSANOO] And for Lubbuck, I've
prepared a fresh Bohai shrimp.
[LUBBOCK] Ohoho!

46
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,453
[SUSANOO] Leone gets oden and
assorted local brands of sake!
[LEONE] Yeah!

47
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,623
[SUSANOO] For Akame,
I have a collection of meats

48
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,826
from every beast I could
find in the forest.
[AKAME] Ahh!

49
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,995
[SUSANOO] And Tatsumi said he's
not picky so he gets,

50
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,797
well... this.
[TATSUMI] Huh?

51
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,700
But this looks like it's
for little kids!
[MINE] (snickers)

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,370
As a special treat,
I had Susanoo cook up
everyone's favorite food.

53
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,074
So go ahead and chow down;
you're going to need energy.
[ALL] (slurping & gobbling)

54
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,143
Oh, no need to tell you twice.

55
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,045
I'm glad everyone's hungry.

56
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,748
Mmm! So sweet! I love it!

57
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,516
Tatsumi, you gotta
try a bite of this.

58
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,785
Tatsumi, you do know what
you're s'posed to do

59
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,687
when my cup starts getting
empty, don't 'cha?

60
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,856
Yeah, yeah, okay,
I'll pour you some more.

61
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,692
Hee hee, that's right;
you're such a good boy!
[TATSUMI] (choking gurgles)

62
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,327
[AKAME]
(gulping) (contented sigh)

63
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,630
Good God! You ate all that?!

64
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,199
[AKAME] Another amazing meal.
Thank you, Su!

65
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,402
[TATSUMI]
Yeah! Seriously, I don't know
what we'd do without you.

66
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,704
You're awesome!

67
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,507
I'm deeply honored to know
I've pleased you.

68
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,676
But, Tatsumi...
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

69
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,144
[SUSANOO] You didn't eat
the last grain of rice.

70
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,680
I don't know if I can stand it.

71
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,715
Sure is a shame.
This guy would be perfect

72
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,050
if he wasn't such
a ninny all the time.

73
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,833
[SUZUKA] If Night Raid plans to
strike, it'll be today.

74
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,736
But that goes without saying,
doesn't it, Seryu?

75
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,773
Suzuka, do not let those demons
into the cathedral, okay?

76
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,543
Yeah, I know. (oh?)

77
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,979
[SUZUKA] That girl's got
combat experience.

78
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,282
I can tell by those eyes
and the way she walks.

79
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,118
[running steps]

80
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:21,321
[TATSUMI] Damn! Didn't take 'em
very long to spot us.

81
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,993
[MINE] They won't chase us
all the way out here.

82
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,830
[TATSUMI] Yeah, well,
we had to get out of the city.

83
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,832
I hope we created a good
enough distraction.

84
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,800
[MINE] All we can do now
is cross our fingers

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,337
and pray the boss and
everyone else pulls through.

86
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,476
It feels like I still have
makeup all over me. Ugh...

87
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,779
Did I get all of it off?

88
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,349
(uh!)
Y‐yeah... yeah, I think so!

89
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,752
Why are you getting all red?

90
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,689
(urk) You're not taking all that
"string‐of‐fate" crap seriously,
are you?!

91
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,358
Oh, you wish! But it sounds like
YOU'VE been thinking about it

92
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,527
since you're bringing it up!
[MINE] Ugh, shut up!

93
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,229
Don't be ridiculous!
If you're my "soulmate",

94
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,931
then explain why you
didn't try to save me

95
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,333
when I almost got eaten
by that giant frog thing!

96
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,838
Where were ya on that one?!
[TATSUMI] Hey now, I kinda had
my hands full, remember?!

97
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,741
There's that Night Raid girl
I fought before.

98
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:19,145
So why in God's name is Tatsumi
with her? What in the hell?

99
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,783
(grrr)
He's been corrupted by evil.

100
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,552
Koro, Phase 9!
[KORO] (deep roar)

101
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,889
Justice City Detector!

102
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,893
There aren't any civilians
in the area.

103
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:39,165
(crazed giggle)
At last, destiny has reunited us
once again, Night Raid!

104
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,267
Koro and I will erase your kind,

105
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,037
with the swinging
Hammer of Justice!

106
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,873
Koro!
[KORO] (deep growl)

107
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,911
I'll give them a taste of my
explosive weapon

108
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,648
that combines Judgement of the
Ten Kings 2, 7, and 8!

109
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,783
The great commander
showered you with affection

110
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,652
and you repay her
with betrayal.

111
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,321
And now, you return with the
girl whose partner

112
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,824
hacked off my arms
and tried to kill me!

113
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,493
You shall be punished by fire
for your sins!

114
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,865
(ah!) I smell gunpowder!

115
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,334
Justice...

116
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,671
VOLLEY!!
[explosions]

117
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,646
(huh?) They survived that?
[explosions]

118
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,614
Stubborn little devils!

119
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,017
[TATSUMI] They certainly
seem to be after us.

120
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,386
Right? If you ask me,
they're trying to keep us

121
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,355
as far away from the town
as possible.

122
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,723
Must've struck a nerve.

123
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,059
Here comes another round!
Get ready!

124
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,494
[explosions]

125
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,670
[TATSUMI]
The attacks have slowed down,

126
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,538
so I guess we're out of range.

127
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,739
I got a look at the shooter.

128
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,141
It's definitely
Seryu Ubiquitous.

129
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,743
(huh?)

130
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,813
Seryu Ubiquitous, huh?

131
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,483
Which way is that bitch
shooting from?

132
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,554
It's the fourth Rakshasa Demon!

133
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:12,258
Suzuka.
But I don't suppose it makes
much difference what you call me

134
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,627
since you're about to be dead.

135
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,129
[TATSUMI] Oh, really now!
(hungh!)

136
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,330
Get outta here, Mine!

137
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,499
I don't think so!
After what she said,

138
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,968
there's no way I could just‐
Ah! Tatsumi!

139
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,104
[TATSUMI]
There's been a change of plans.

140
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,139
You get to fight me instead!

141
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,641
Oh, aren't you brave?

142
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,943
All right, I'll let you be
the first to die.

143
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,846
How does that sound?
[TATSUMI] (hyahh!)

144
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,716
Tatsumi!

145
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,852
Stupid.

146
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,522
Okay, you take care of her...

147
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,292
And I'll deal with Seryu.

148
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:50,864
After I finish my business with
her, I'll come back to help you.

149
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:59,272
[SERYU] Koro, Phase 6!
[KORO] Woorf! (deep growl)

150
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,112
What's that?!
Does she EVER run out of stuff?!

151
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,915
[SERYU] The rebellion will
never find peace!

152
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,853
Those with no value for justice
will meet their end!

153
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,422
[MINE] (short laugh)
Thanks for the big target.
[gunshot]

154
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,924
[big explosion]

155
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,393
[SERYU] What?! She took down
my most powerful attack

156
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,796
with a single shot! Fine!

157
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,569
Koro, Phase 1!
[KORO] Woof! (deep roar)

158
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,904
[gunshot]
[KORO] Woof! (deep growl)

159
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,580
(pained whimper)

160
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,750
[SERYU]
I came here to personally ensure
the condemnation of Night Raid.

161
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,119
[MINE]
So, we finally meet again.

162
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,821
[SERYU]
Koro's gonna eat your corpse,

163
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,423
just like he did
your two friends.

164
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,225
TWO friends?
[SERYU] (crazed laugh)

165
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,095
We put a woman's head on display
in the middle of Romaly,

166
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,730
a redhead I do believe.

167
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,065
And Koro ate the rest of her!

168
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,367
The same with that purple
freak in the glasses.

169
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:05,171
They both ended up in
a little pile on the back lawn.

170
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,641
And now it's your turn!

171
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,816
[MINE] You know,
you like to consider yourself
a fighter for justice,

172
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,384
but you blindly followed
Ogre and Stylish.

173
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,888
You never even stopped to think
about how messed up they were,
did you?

174
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,291
[SERYU] (grrr)
[MINE]
But then again, so are you.

175
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,295
You laugh exactly how those two
sick freaks used to laugh.

176
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,032
You're just like them.

177
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,468
That's why I have absolutely no
problem taking your life.

178
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,237
I'm gonna put
a hole through you!

179
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,806
Do you feel better getting
all that off your chest?

180
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,042
Koro, Phase 5.
[KORO] (deep growl)

181
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,944
Don't forget the arms.
[KORO] (deep roar)

182
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:47,080
All you managed to do was give
Koro enough time to regenerate.

183
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,616
The evil of this world
are so stupid.

184
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,752
Let's go, Koro!

185
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,687
[rapid gunshots]
[KORO] (roars in pain)

186
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,055
How is it so powerful?!

187
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,123
Maybe because
I've been holding back.

188
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,761
This fight'll be more
entertaining if it's
a true two‐on‐one!

189
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,463
The best thing about Pumpkin is
it fires with more power

190
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,832
if I find myself
in a tight spot!

191
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,267
[SERYU] Don't give up, Koro!

192
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,236
She can't possibly keep up
a surge like that forever!

193
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,906
Maybe not!
But thanks to our last battle,

194
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,075
I've almost figured out
where the core is!

195
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,811
I don't need much more time!
And then it's over.

196
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,982
[SERYU] Damn you!
Koro, use your trump card!

197
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,217
(huh?!)

198
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,422
(loud roar)

199
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,891
[MINE] I'm prepared for this.

200
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,060
I've seen everything this
Imperial Arms can do!

201
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,632
[SERYU]
Devil King's Justice Lance!

202
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,233
(gasps)

203
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,506
(short scream)

204
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:47,107
[repeated gunshots]

205
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,177
[MINE] She's more dangerous now.

206
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,313
Her personal weapon's not
an Imperial Arms,

207
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,081
but it's really strong!

208
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,852
[rapid gunshots]
[SERYU] (ungh)

209
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,521
[SERYU] (furious scream)

210
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:02,122
[gunshots]

211
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:08,261
I'LL BEAT YOU TO DEATH!
(arrrgghhh!!!)

212
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,966
(ungh!)

213
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,971
(panting)
I took on too much damage.

214
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,941
Shit, I should've just
finished her off.

215
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,310
[MINE] (un...ghhh...)

216
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,414
(giggles)

217
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,518
[TATSUMI] This girl is
really freakin' fast.

218
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,286
She's all over the place.

219
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:40,360
(giggles)
Aw, you made me break a nail.

220
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,695
[TATSUMI] Son of a...

221
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,864
[SUZUKA]
Killing Mez, that was one thing,

222
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,800
but I was surprised
one of you took out Ibara.

223
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,702
Though it clearly
couldn't have been you.

224
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:52,272
It's painfully obvious
how little combat experience
you have.

225
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:56,042
[TATSUMI] Once again,
I'm not strong enough.

226
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,745
I've dealt with this regret
too many times.

227
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,915
Over and over and over!

228
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:05,385
No matter how tough she is,
I cannot let it happen again.

229
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,287
(ungh...)

230
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,025
(labored breathing)

231
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,328
[KORO] (deep roar)

232
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,399
Are you back at
a hundred percent now, Koro?

233
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:25,271
Good. It's time to destroy
this demon once and for all.

234
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,944
[general commotion]

235
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,114
(hyahh!)

236
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,416
Natara! Doya!

237
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,586
[LEONE] Oh, hey Su!
How are things going?

238
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,187
So far, so good.

239
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,558
We just need to stick to the
plan and lure the enemy here.

240
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,861
You must understand,
I don't have time

241
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,763
to play around with you!

242
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,231
Now where's my big sister?

243
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,200
Oh, you wanna know?
Okay, but before I tell you,

244
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,137
you're gonna pay for
cutting off my arm! (hyah!)

245
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,739
(ungh)

246
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,841
I'm still not healed
from the last fight.

247
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,276
Say your prayers, kid!

248
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,550
[WAVE] Stop picking on HER...

249
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:12,218
...and fight me.

250
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,857
Sorry I'm late, Kurome.

251
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:20,426
What? Do you want Su to send
your ass flying again?

252
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,863
Come and get me, Night Raid.

253
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:26,132
I'm not gonna let you hurt
my teammates anymore!

254
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,135
Grand Chariot!

255
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,012
General Esdeath, I need the
Jaegers; where are they?!

256
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,882
Shut up. You're getting just
what you deserve, Bolic.

257
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,518
If you'd listened,
you wouldn't be in this mess.

258
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:45,852
[BOLIC] You must protect me!

259
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,889
The minister himself commanded
you to‐ (urk)

260
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,057
[ESDEATH] You're right,
orders are orders.

261
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,493
I will continue to
keep you safe.

262
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:56,429
However, I must forbid you
to leave this room.

263
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,298
Yes! Of course!

264
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,467
[SUZUKA]
If your plan was to lose me
in the ruins, it won't work.

265
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,038
You'll just tire yourself out
and make your death too easy.

266
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,607
[TATSUMI] Yeah? Well sorry,

267
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:09,042
but you're going down
one way or another!
[SUZUKA] (wha?)

268
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,411
[TATSUMI] Get ready to join
your little friends!

269
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,148
What the hell?
This guy's gonna kill us both.

270
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,983
[TATSUMI]
You're not getting away!

271
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,452
This is your end!

272
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,491
(waaahhhh!)

273
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:41,041
This...
This brings back some memories.

274
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,844
How they called me a half‐breed

275
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,212
while they trampled me
in the street...

276
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,449
I just kept gazing into the sky.

277
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,686
No one ever stopped.
No one ever helped.

278
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,956
Then, I realized...

279
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,324
the only one
who could save me...

280
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,963
was me.

281
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:08,201
I made a promise to myself
that I would never live
such dark days ever again.

282
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,038
And I would never let anyone
else suffer such discrimination.

283
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,275
Which is why...

284
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,517
I will not die here
in the middle of nowhere!

285
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,653
(angry panting)

286
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,223
(hyah!)
[KORO] (deep growl)

287
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,157
Now!

288
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,727
I'll have my revenge!

289
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,328
[gunshot]

290
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,731
[SERYU] Koro!

291
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,365
The Ten Kings are
out of ammunition,

292
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,336
but I still have these!
[KORO] (deep roar)

293
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,673
Justice must prevail!

294
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,109
This is it!

295
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:53,213
(hyaaahhh!)

296
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,421
No! How could I let this happen?

297
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:13,767
My weapon creates power out
of emotional energy.

298
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,604
The more intense my feelings,
the more fuel for Pumpkin.

299
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,040
(unnggghhh)

300
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,744
[MINE] So the moment
you pissed me off...

301
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:25,546
that was when you lost.

302
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,315
[SERYU]
(increasing crazed laughter)

303
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,420
Justice will always prevail.

304
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,858
No matter what the cost,
all evil must be cast out.

305
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,325
[click]

306
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,528
[SERYU] Judgement of Ten Kings.

307
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:45,632
Final Phase:
Godotenrin's Furnace.

308
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,135
You've got one minute.

309
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,738
What the hell?! You bitch!

310
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,374
[SERYU] The doctor was kind
enough to give it to me,

311
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,743
the ultimate weapon against sin!

312
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:01,915
As long as it lives inside my
head, I can never truly lose!

313
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,717
Damn you!

314
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,652
Oh no, it's overheated!

315
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,421
(crazy giggle) (laughter)

316
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,724
You're too weak to get away!

317
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,826
You're not gonna make it!

318
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,128
You'll burn like
the demon you are!

319
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,798
(crazed laughter)
[KORO] (whining)

320
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,037
Koro...

321
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,439
You can't heal yourself anymore.

322
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,812
It's not fair; there's still so
much evil left in the world.
(crying)

323
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,816
I can't die until it's gone.

324
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,185
Not yet...
[KORO] (whimper)

325
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,090
(running)

326
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,760
Shit, my... my legs!

327
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,394
I cannot accept this.

328
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:52,465
If I die, how will I ever
fulfill my promise I
made to myself!

329
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:56,402
And I have to keep living for
the sake of Sheele and Chelsea!

330
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,306
Why would I suddenly
think of everyone?

331
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:05,145
I can't leave them alone;
they wouldn't have a clue
how to do anything without me.

332
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,147
(gasps)

333
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,551
[huge explosion]

334
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,520
Here it comes!

335
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,636
(ugh...)

336
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,245
[TATSUMI]
I was too weak when we lost Bro.

337
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,883
And I was too slow
when we lost Chelsea.

338
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,486
But that's it.

339
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,889
I will not lose anyone else.

340
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:51,324
(ah...) Tatsumi...

341
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,661
(chuckles)
Looks like you'll be okay.

342
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,763
(begins to cry)

343
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:03,369
[TATSUMI] Oh yeah, I did
exactly what you told me to do.

344
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,805
You said I should be there
to help out

345
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:07,340
whenever you're in trouble,
right?
[MINE] (huh?)

346
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,776
[TATSUMI] So that's what I did.
How about that?

347
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,779
Your bullcrap actually made
an impression on me.
[MINE] (huh?!)

348
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,917
Y'know, Tatsumi? You can be a
real patronizing asshole.

349
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:19,520
But...

350
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,355
I really do appreciate it.

351
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,558
Thanks a lot.

352
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,694
Uh... yeah, sure.

353
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,465
[ESDEATH] Bolic!

354
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,035
Where is that pig?

355
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,203
[NAJENDA] He already ran away.

356
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,539
Najenda...

357
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,841
[NAJENDA] It seems he
didn't take your advice.

358
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:44,044
I'm sure my subordinates are
silencing him as we speak.

359
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:46,680
[shnick]
(ugh) Nice try.

360
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,381
Horimaca!

361
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,517
But it barely even scratched me!

362
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,986
[swishing sounds]
[BOLIC] (chokes)

363
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:59,259
[ESDEATH] You always did come up
with clever little schemes.

364
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,794
Oh, yes. I like to think

365
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:04,064
I have a better understanding
of your talent than anyone.

366
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:07,834
So I wouldn't be so foolish as
to try to take you head‐on.

367
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,671
(tsch)

368
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,039
[MINE] I guess the fight's
over for now, huh?

369
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,641
[TATSUMI] Yeah.

370
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,210
[MINE] Hey, Tatsumi.

371
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,379
[TATSUMI] Hmm? What's up?

372
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,149
As soon as this is
all behind us,

373
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,985
I need to tell you something.

374
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,988
Can't you just tell me now?

375
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,455
No, I can't.

376
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:30,791
[TATSUMI] Wha... Why not?

377
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:34,194
I'm feeling so confused,
so conflicted.

378
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:37,998
I never imagined I'd want to
live for someone besides myself.

379
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,835
Promise me something.

380
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,738
Promise me you'll survive.

381
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:47,407
[TATSUMI]
Yeah, of course I will.

382
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,481
If these feelings
are driving me,

383
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:57,483
then I should be able to
tap into some powers

384
00:21:57,584 --> 00:22:00,353
far beyond any
I ever have before.

385
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:04,625
From now on, my battles
will be even more intense.
