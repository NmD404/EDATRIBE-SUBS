[LEONE] Oh God...

00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,477
We may have celebrated
a little too hard last night

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,647
for Tatsumi's return.

00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,683
[TATSUMI] (snoring)

Guess we all crashed out here.

[TRAUMA] (evil giggle)

9
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:38,071
I've done it, Master Stylish!

10
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,374
Your trusty assistant Trauma
has done iiiit!

11
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,110
Good work, now let's
continue the mission.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,846
He got the first one,
Doctor Stylish.

13
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:49,282
[STYLISH] Marvelous! That's my
little knight in shining armor,

14
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,985
flying straight into
enemy headquarters.

15
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,219
All right...

16
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,188
Go, Beautiful Team Stylish!
[TEAM] Hyah!

17
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,525
The Dapper Offensive is
officially underway!

18
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,522
[EYES]
The soldiers have made their way
into Night Raid's base.

19
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:39,993
[STYLISH]
Ah, let the show begin!
I'm tingling with anticipation!

[LUBBOCK]
(heavy breathing) Holy crap!

21
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,264
Where'd they come from
all of a sudden?!

22
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,200
They're already on top of us!
(gasps)

23
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,302
How the hell did they
even get in?

24
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,539
[STYLISH GUY] The enemy...
must be killed.

25
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,207

32
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,558
It sounds like they got one.

33
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,428
Well, my enhanced fighters ARE
more resilient than humans.

34
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,132
It takes SERIOUS finesse
to put even a scratch on them.

35
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,233
(gasps)

36
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,702
Is there some kind of problem?

37
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:25,539
Not really. But they seem
pretty resilient themselves.

38
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,941
[LUBBOCK] You'd be amazed how
many awesome tricks I can do

39
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,409
with this little bit of string.

40
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,377
CHECK THIS OUT! Hyah!

41
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,848
KYAH!!!!

42
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,416
(swishing sounds)

43
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,185
[LUBBOCK] All I have to do is
bind them all together, and...

44
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,220
VOILA!

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,555
(UNGH!)

46
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,025
[STYLISH GUY] So creative...

47
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,359
Saw that in a manga one time.

48
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,194
You wouldn't believe it,
but those crazy things

49
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,364
are full of ideas of how
to manipulate string.

50
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,801
(gasps) Crap, another one.

51
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,402
[STYLISH GUYS] (grrr...)

52
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,471
Nope. More than one.

53
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,074
Ah, sorry I'm not
so good with groups.

54
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,510
I think I'm just gonna pass on
you guys, if that's cool.

Ah, dammit,
they're pretty fast!

58
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,420
Stay behind me Lubbock.

59
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,789

Wait!
[LUBBOCK] You want some too?!

65
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,272

00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,765
[TATSUMI] (gasps)
Those scissors!

(chuckles) Oh, these?
The Shears of Creation Extase.

88
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,939
Just picked these up.

89
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,507

Pretty good reflexes boy.

96
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,259

your whole arm off!

[TATSUMI] (ungh)
[KAKU] (laughs)

98
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,996
No matter how thick
that armor is,

99
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,598
I can cut right through it.

100
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,835
So, how's it feel to know your
armor is useless against me?

101
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,105
Your little outfit
won't do you any good!

102
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,341
Sounds like we have the upper
hand over Murasame AND Incursio.

103
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,943
Exactly how I planned it.

104
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,781
It's easy to defeat somebody you
have a strong aversion to.

105
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,084
But still, we've already lost
quite a few soldiers.

106
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:28,154
There's too much noise
in the area for me to
determine the exact number,

107
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,657
but the death count
is extremely high.

108
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,459
Oh dear, what a tragedy.

109
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,096

<i>Little do they know,</i>

00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,311
<i>they're nothing but fancy</i>
<i>fodder waiting to die!</i>

[TATSUMI]
Those belong to Sheele!

117
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,448

120
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,057
You must really feel
like dying today.

121
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,694
How about I start cuttin'
some stuff off?
[TATSUMI] (unhhh...)

122
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,597
[MINE] Real brave,
picking on a pipsqueak.

123
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,665
Huh?

124
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,134
You're even more pathetic
than I thought.

125
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,472
[TATSUMI] Mine!

126
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,207
[MINE] (gasps)

127
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,511
So those pieces of crap
couldn't handle you by yourself,

128
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,647
and now it's my job?!

129
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,915
[MINE]
I'm ready to get this over with.

130
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,586
Seeing Extase in your big,
ugly hands is starting to
piss me off.

131
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,621
So you wanna get this over with?

132
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,222
Be careful what you ask for,

133
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,958
cause you're gonna get it,
sweetie!

134
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,827
In case you haven't noticed,
we took over your base!

135
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,296
You've been made,
and it's all but done!

136
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,566
That's why I'll make it quick.

137
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,703
(YAH!) Do you know who
you're talking to?!

138
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,539

The more intense my fight,

the more intense my weapon.

149
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,903
You should not have
underestimated me.

150
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,121

(ungh)

153
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,069
Kaku has been defeated.

154
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,271
And they've almost finished off
the whole infantry.

155
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,575
(sarcastically)
Oh my goodness gracious,
what a tragic turn of events.

156
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,410
I'm afraid that does it.
Time for Plan B.

00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,049
Doctor, there's something
flying over us.

159

Huh?

That must be
Danger Beast Air Manta!

163
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,592
And someone's riding
on its back.

164
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,661
Wait a second...

165
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,996
It's ex‐General Najenda!

166
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,566
Looks like she's got two other
people with her, too.

167
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,034
[STYLISH]
Oooh, delightfully dramatic!

168
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,572
Valiantly riding on a
Danger Beast she tamed herself?!

169
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,907
[NOSE] Now don't get yourself
all worked up!

170
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,910
[NAJENDA] Headquarters was proud
of their fortune‐telling Arms.

171
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,112
It predicted trouble
near the hideout,

172
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,847
and it came to pass.

173
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,283
Glad I flew back
as soon as I found out.

174
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,918
This is your shot, recruits.

175
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,020
Time to show me
what you're made of!

176
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,823
(heh)
Well, isn't THIS a fun surprise?

177
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,825
It actually works out
great for me.

178
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,493
Every one of you
is going to become

179
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,029
a test subject for
my experiments!

180
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,299
It's time to unveil
my trump card!

181
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,638
[clang!]

182
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,676
(grrr!)

183
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,645
If I can't finish you
in a single hit,

184
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,547
then I'll have to
chop you into pieces.

185
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,583
And it's gonna hurt.
You better get ready.

186
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,185
(hmph!)
That's where you're mistaken.

187
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,756
Given my condition,
I can't feel pain anymore!

188
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,992
Hyah!

189
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,328
Yah!

190
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,632
(gunshot)

191
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,099
(shwack)

192
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,868
[TOBY] (ungh)

193
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,104
(grrr!)

194
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,740
(gunshot)

195
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,914
(gunshot)
[TOBY] (UNGH!)

196
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,082
(grrr...)

197
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,586
Damn you!
This wasn't even your fight!

198
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,688
My home and all of my friends
are in danger.

199
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:58,925
Do you honestly expect me
to just sit back and watch?

200
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,494
[TOBY] Well... As it was going,

201
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,997
I would have lost
that battle anyway,

202
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,967
even if he hadn't interfered.

203
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,336
Akame... please tell me...

204
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,907
Why was it impossible for me
to win against you?

205
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,643
Your fighting style was
extremely aggressive,

206
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,580
but you left me
too many openings.

207
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,281
Obviously.
[TOBY] (chuckles)

208
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:25,218
I should've focused
more on defense. Right?

209
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,454
A sense of pain is quite the
useful luxury after all.

210
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,056
(SHWACK!)

211
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,404
[TATSUMI] What is that?

212
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:45,471
More enemies?

213
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,240
[MINE] Hang on, I'll check.

214
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,748
Whaddya know?! It's the boss!

215
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:58,752
[TATSUMI] Sweet, perfect timing!
Wait, that's not fair!

216
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,220
[MINE] What's not fair?

217
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,089
[TATSUMI] How come they get
to ride on a giant fish?!

218
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,992
I wanna ride a fish!
[MINE] Umm... I'm not sure

219
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,630
I know exactly how to
respond to that.

220
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:17,003
<i>(giggling)</i>
<i>Oh, you adorable little lady!</i>

221
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,674
<i>YOU SEEM TO HAVE LEFT YOURSELF</i>
<i>WIDE OPEN! (chuckles)</i>

222
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,910
[TRAUMA] (GNUGH!)
[LEONE] You really caught me
off‐guard didn't you?

223
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,879
[TRAUMA] (gaaahhh)

224
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,050
I was passed out and hung over
and you throw a knife at me?

225
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,853
That is grounds for a serious
ass‐kicking my friend!

226
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,387
[BOTH] (uhhh...)

227
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,858
[TRAUMA] (choking) Put me down!
I can't breathe!

228
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,992
Word of advice.

229
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,794
I'm a huge fan
of surprise attacks,

230
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,462
but if there's one thing
I hate about them,

231
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:43,697
it's when they happen to me!

232
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,465
Your body looks like
it's been enhanced,

233
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:48,068
but I wouldn't expect that to
make your death come any easier!

234
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,036
(choking)

235
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:50,837
(shwing)

236
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,839
[TRAMA] A‐ha!

237
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:57,177
(gasps) Well, she's just full
of surprises isn't she?

238
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,212
[TRAMA] (ungh)

239
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:03,784
Ow... He did manage to get in a
good one, and man does it hurt!

240
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,586
Oops! Oh crap!

241
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:06,887
I think I killed him.

242
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,055
[TATSUMI] Um... Sis?
[LEONE] (hmm?)

243
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,724
[TATSUMI]
You're okay now, right?

244
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,126
Yeah, he just surprised me
at first, that's all.

245
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,696
But I can regenerate pretty fast
when I'm in my beast form,

246
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,898
so I'll be just fine!

247
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,800
Everybody okay?
[TATSUMI] Yeah!

248
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,835
[MINE]
Good, I think we're all here.

249
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,004
(swoosh)
[AKAME] (huh?)

250
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,875
[TATSUMI] Looks like we've
still got some work to do.

251
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:33,113
This doesn't make sense.
How did they get in without
setting off my traps?!

252
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,716
I'm not picking up anyone else's
smell either.

253
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,050
[TATSUMI]
Whatever, we're all together

254
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,152
so let's just knock these
losers out, okay?

255
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,787
Right!

256
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,789
[AKAME] (gasps)

257
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,024
[TATSUMI] (huh?) Akame!

258
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,026
Wha...
what's wrong with you guys?!

259
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:50,263
[MINE]
I can't... move my body... argh!

260
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:54,300
[TATSUMI]
This sensation... it's just
like what happened on that boat!

261
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,069
Hypnosis, maybe?

262
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,772
[AKAME] No... I think...

263
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:02,075
it's... it's....

264
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,110
Seems to be working perfectly
on all targets

265
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,612
except the one
wearing Incursio.

266
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,481
[STYLISH] (laughs) That's the
effect of my trump card.

267
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:12,085
A fast‐acting paralysis agent I
made all by my stylish self.

268
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,921
Aaah! But won't our allies
be poisoned too?!

269
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,657
Obviously, the good
doctor remembered

270
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:18,458
to treat them with
the antidote, moron.

271
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,328
Oooh, Master Stylish,
you're like a super genius!

272
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,298
[STYLISH]
It's not like I intended to
try out my latest concoction

273
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,968
on such promising subjects,
you know?

274
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,804
See? It's a very
valuable creation

275
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,939
and I went to great
lengths to make it!

276
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,575
But I had no other option!

277
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:37,778
They were wiping out my lovely
cohorts so quickly! (sobbing)

278
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,279
We understand, Master!

279
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,614
You're so kind!

280
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:48,622
Yes, and the poison has no
smell, so it's easy on my nose!

281
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,657
[AKAME] (ngggh)

282
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,193
[LEONE] (ungh)

283
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,496
[TATSUMI] I'm holding up better
than anyone else right now.

284
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,364
So it's all up to me!

285
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,833
(explosion)

286
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,135
[ALL] (unhhh)

287
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,677
[TATSUMI] (uhhh...)

288
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,422
Is he... with us?

289
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:27,794
[NAJENDA] Now! Exterminate every
foe you see, Susanoo!

290
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,462
Understood.

291
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:38,605
(swoosh ‐ snick ‐ whir)

292
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,373
[ALL] (ungh!)

293
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,275
Yahhhh! (oofff)

294
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,414
(gyah)

295
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,620
[TATSUMI] What... the...

296
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,421
Sir! One of them has jumped down

297
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,958
and is now pulverizing
the entire infantry!

298
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,993
But that's impossible,
the poison should affect

299
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,328
every living being in the area!

300
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,866
Maybe not. He might have an
unlisted Imperial Arms.

301
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,901
In which case,
I guess I don't really need

302
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,336
to include him in my research.

303
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,738
Oops!

304
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,841
(explosion)

305
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,310
[ALL] (ungh)

306
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,947
[STYLISH] (laughing) Do you like
my deluxe human explosive?!

307
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,683
Ha! One down!

308
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,519
[ALL] (heavy breathing)

309
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,525
[TATSUMI] (gasps)

310
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,998
Oh my god... don't tell me...

311
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,701
I've only heard of these.

312
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,636
He's an organic.

313
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,205
He's a human Imperial Arms!

314
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,142
(hmm?!)

315
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,184
Um... what are you...

316
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,759
Fixed.
[MINE] Wait, what?

317
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,028
[ALL] (huh?)

318
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,495
<i>Whoever did this found a spot</i>

319
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,932
<i>where he could easily spy</i>
<i>on everyone.</i>

320
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,800
<i>He's probably hiding</i>
<i>somewhere upwind</i>

321
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,702
<i>so the poison</i>
<i>can't get to him.</i>

322
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:19,339
<i>If there's somebody calling</i>
<i>the shots from above...</i>

323
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,308
<i>then he must be</i>
<i>somewhere over...</i>

324
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:26,713
There!

325
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,282
Susanoo! They're on the cliff
to the southeast!

326
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,718
Don't let them get away!
[SUSANOO] Understood.

327
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,820
[ALL] (gasps)
[EARS]
We've been discovered sir!

328
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,455
Nothing to be done, is there?

329
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,124
All we can do now is RUN!
[ALL] (wha?)

330
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,026
<i>Poison doesn't affect</i>
<i>organic types!</i>

331
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,797
<i>You must either destroy the</i>
<i>core or immobilize the wielder!</i>

332
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,331
[ALL] (waaahhh!)

333
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,669
My, my, she's even more
tenacious than I thought!

334
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,443
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Master Stylish!

335
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,813
[NOSE] We are your guardians
until the bitter end!

336
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,447
I promise you're in good hands!

337
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,717
[STYLISH] <i>Oh, please,</i>
<i>you don't stand a chance.</i>

338
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,453
<i>I designed you three for recon,</i>
<i>not hand‐to‐hand combat.</i>

339
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,656
<i>Now that it's come to this...</i>

340
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,657
(grrr...)

341
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,058
I'll have to protect myself!

342
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,427
And play my second trump card,
Danger Beast Shot!

343
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,863
Sorry, but you
leave me no choice!

344
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:24,938
[EYES] You okay, Master Stylish?
What's wrong?
[STYLISH] (unngghhh...)

345
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,239
[NOSE] Sir?

346
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,341
Oh, what an impeccable
sensation!

347
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,277
This is the ultimate
in nouveau riche!

348
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,080
I've successfully merged my body
with a Danger Beast,

349
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,650
so I may personally
kick your ass!

350
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,184
[NOSE] He is GORGEOUS!

351
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,454
[EYES] Very impressive, Master!
[BOTH] (huh?!)

352
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:45,592
But first I'm going to need a
little sustenance, yes?
(yum...)

353
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,895
Time for us to become ONE!
[EYES & EARS] (screaming)

354
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:52,198
[EARS] (panicked breathing)

355
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,502
(screams)

356
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,272
Just as I expected, scarfing
down all this nutritious meat

357
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,808
is helping me level up!

358
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,610
[TATSUMI] What is that thing?!

359
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,478
He's a mutation.

360
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,350
(BOOM!)

361
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,854
[MINE]
And he's totally gross!

362
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:15,088
[STYLISH] Well this isn't bad,

363
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,423
but I'd still like to be
a scoche bigger.

364
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:21,294
That Imperial Arms guy got me
pressed even when I'm a giant!

365
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,830
I suppose if I truly desire
to win this battle,

366
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,099
I'll have to grow even larger!

367
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:30,604
Prepare yourself,
to be devoured alive!

368
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,274
[SUSANOO] (nnggghh)

369
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,777
Interesting.

370
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,581
[TATSUMI]
Oh crap, I'd better go help him!

371
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,415
[AKAME] Wait! Tatsumi...
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

372
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,819
I can't walk, but I need you to
take me with you, okay?

373
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,588
[TATSUMI] Akame?

374
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:53,193
Sure!

375
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,861
You might wanna hold on tight.

376
00:19:54,961 --> 00:20:00,500
Now, let's do this!

377
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:04,505
(laughing) Where are you going,
Mr. Fancy Pants?

378
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:07,207
Are you too afraid to attack me?

379
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,743
(BOOM ‐ BOOM)

380
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:11,812
(huh?)
[SUSANOO] (hmph)

381
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,185
And you two!
Playing some piggyback?

382
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:22,923
I'm sorry.
But that's just tacky!!

383
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,959
(BOOM)

384
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:29,863
(unhhh)

385
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,332
[STYLISH] You're wasting
your time, darling!

386
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,168
The One‐Hit Killer Murasame
won't do much good

387
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,638
if it can't pierce my skin!

388
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:41,407
Now, perhaps it's time
to give up! (ungh)

389
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,083
[STYLISH] Damn you!

390
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,718
(gunshot)

391
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,590
[TATSUMI] You've lost all
your little pawns.

392
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,793
You do know its almost over,
don't you?!

393
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,336
(panicked breathing)
I'm not done yet!

394
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,238
[TATSUMI] I bet you can reach
his flesh from here!

395
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,007
Go for it, Akame!

396
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:19,079
(shwack!)

397
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,381
[AKAME] You're done.

398
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,384
<i>No... there were still</i>
<i>so many people</i>

399
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,053
<i>on which I wanted to</i>
<i>experiment...</i>

400
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:32,025
I...I never thought it would
end for me this way.

401
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,860
I pictured more panache.

402
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,530
(ba‐dmp!)

403
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,964
(THUD!)

404
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:44,437
[BOTH] (slight chuckles)

405
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:59,786
You were lucky to die with
all your parts intact.

406
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,623
Don't take something like that
for granted.
