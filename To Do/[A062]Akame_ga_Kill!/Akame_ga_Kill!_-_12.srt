00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:06,833
Whooo, alright!!

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,100
This feels awesome!

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,066
[CHELSEA]
Hahaha...
You're so innocent

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,366
I can't believe you're
a killer, Tatsumi.

5
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:13,500
It's funny.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,900
I'd never expect that!

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,733
[LEONE]
Wow! This is even
more of a blast
than I thought!

8
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,466
[AKAME]
Yeah. The view is really
something. This is nice.

9
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:22,666
[Trembling]

10
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:25,300
[MINE]
THIS ISN'T NICE AT ALL!

11
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,266
[Roar]

12
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,066
[NAJENDA]
The Marg Highlands are
crawling with Danger Beasts,

13
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,766
which makes it impossible
for humans to live here.

14
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:14,833
And that's why it's a perfect
place to build our new hideout.

15
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:18,300
The Revolutionary Army's recon
unit is currently searching

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,833
for a more permanent place
for us near the capital,

17
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,266
but they haven't found anything.

18
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,766
So until we hear from them
we'll just stay right here

19
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:26,700
and level ourselves up.

20
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,900
[MINE]
Hey, look!

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,500
It's leaving; should we
try to catch it?

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,833
[CHELSEA]
It's going back to
its nest at HQ, silly!

23
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,466
Well, Mine, I'm surprised
you weren't smart enough
to figure that out.

24
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,266
Hahaha...

25
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:42,400
Oh great.
I hate you already!

26
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,966
Oh yes, I haven't given our new
members a proper introduction.

27
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,400
I'd like you to meet‐ Huh?

28
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:54,066
I already knew you were cute,
but you're adorable from
up close, Akame!

29
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,429
Why are you touching me?

30
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,229
Oh, yes, my name's Chelsea.

31
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,963
Since we're going to be
killing people together,
I hope we all get along.

32
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:03,029
Here! This is for you.

33
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:03,963
Oh!

34
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,829
[AKAME]
Welcome to the team.

35
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:08,063
Did she just win Akame's
heart with a lollipop?!

36
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:10,696
That long flight must have
made her REALLY hungry!

37
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:14,129
You know, Chelsea seems
even less likely to be
a cold‐blooded assassin

38
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:15,763
than Mine and
the others girls do.

39
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,663
Don't judge a book
by its cover.

40
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,129
She's an expert killer

41
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:21,796
who's completed just
as many jobs as Akame.

42
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:22,863
[TATSUMI]
Eh?

43
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:24,196
As for this fellow,

44
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:26,263
headquarters has entrusted
him with me as well.

45
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:29,329
Everyone meet the
Lightning Fast Susanoo,

46
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:31,163
he's my new Imperial Arms.

47
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:34,863
Organic types are mostly
autonomous, so he shouldn't
be all that draining.

48
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:37,129
Even with all my injuries
I can still use him.

49
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:40,129
Uh... Hi, I think
we met earlier.

50
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,063
Ah!

51
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,829
Uh, hey now‐

52
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:47,996
Fixed!

53
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,396
[NAJENDA]
I should warn you,

54
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,863
he's a bit of a neat freak.

55
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:52,596
[MINE]
Yeah, no kidding...

56
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:56,196
Well now I get why he
fixed my hair before.

57
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:59,596
Okay. So, what exactly
is his primary ability?

58
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,629
Does he only do
hand‐to‐hand combat?

59
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,763
Hehe...

60
00:04:04,763 --> 00:04:06,729
Allow me to demonstrate
that for you.

61
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,896
Try to contain your excitement.

62
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:10,963
Susanoo, proceed!

63
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:12,363
Understood.

64
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:30,763
[LUBBOCK]
Okay I admit, that DOES
look impressive, but...

65
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:32,429
what is he doing?

66
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:35,496
[TATSUMI]
From where I'm standing
it looks like... chores.

67
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:36,796
Wonderful, isn't he?!

68
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,296
Susanoo's original purpose

69
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,396
was to protect royalty
and others of status.

70
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:43,029
Not only can he fight,

71
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,563
he's equipped with a full range
of cleaning and cooking skills

72
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:47,763
so he never has to leave
his owner's side!

73
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:49,496
He can do it all!

74
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:52,963
And the best part is,
his menu includes a
thousand different dishes!

75
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:55,196
How is any of that gonna
help us in a fight?!

76
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,696
Now, now, I'm sure you'll
come to appreciate it.

77
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,229
Last but not least...

78
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:01,663
he also possesses a
trump card for combat.

79
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:02,896
Don't you?

80
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:04,063
Yeah.

82
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:12,063

‐Oh my goodness, you're flat
as a board, aren't you?
‐SHUT UP!

Y'know, you may be all
big and handsome and
strong and everything,

a glorified man‐maid!

[RUN]
We've finished searching
the doctor's residence.

89
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:38,029
However, we were unable to find

90
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,296
any evidence as to what caused
his sudden disappearance.

91
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:44,329
[BOLS]
We did notice none of his
valuable research materials

92
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:47,163
or equipment went missing
from the laboratory, though.

93
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,863
[ESDEATH]
If he hasn't deserted us,

94
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:52,696
that means he must
have been killed.

95
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:54,696
[BOLS]
And none of his
enhanced soldiers

96
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:56,629
were anywhere to
be found either.

97
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,663
I can only assume they
were all killed as well.

98
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:01,763
[ESDEATH]
I understand.

99
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:07,096
Poor Seryu's lost another

Are you going to
be able to handle

102
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,729
your maintenance without
the doctor's help?

103
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,329
I think I'll be alright!

104
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:16,963
He did leave all the materials
I need in the laboratory.

105
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:19,729
I can't make any improvements
to my equipment,

106
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:21,729
but I can keep them
in working order!

107
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,263
That's good.

So, Seryu, tell me how
Judgement‐of‐the‐Ten‐Kings

110
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:32,796
and your other new weapons
have been working for you.

111
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:35,329
Great! I'm really
enjoying them, Doctor!

112
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,829
I'm quite impressed with
how well your body
handled the experiment.

113

Now use all that newfound power
to make your dreams come true.

you if you get a boo boo.

I promise I will
fulfill that wish.

173
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,396
That's really cool.

174
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:32,829
Oh, it's easy to see why.

175
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:35,496
My feminine charm, of course.

176
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:39,529
Actually the General is
like a spitting image
of my previous master.

177
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:40,629
That makes sense.

178
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:41,929
If she was like me,

179
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,863
then she must have been
a wonderful person.

180
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:44,963
Yeah.

181
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:47,563
Not only a great leader,
but also a good man!

182
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:48,629
A man?!

183
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:49,796
Gah...

184
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,263
Hahaha...

185
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:52,929
See, Boss, you totally
look like a dude!

186
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,963
That's probably why
you're such a stud!

187
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:57,663
Cut it out, if you make her
mad she's gonna freak out
and kill us...

188
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,796
Oh! Uh...
Yeah sorry.

189
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:01,896
[TATSUMI]
Uh‐oh...

190
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:04,496
[NAJENDA]
Grrr...

191
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:06,729
[LEONE and TATSUMI]
Oww...

192
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:10,029
Jeez, I don't get why
everybody's so quick to
cozy up to that guy.

193
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,696
I thought I was the
Mr. Suave Awesome
around here.

194
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:16,963
Don't worry, Lubb, I'm pretty
sure no one considered you
"suave" in the first place.

195
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:19,163

196
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,529
[Mine]
Oh, wow.

197
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,329
Is that a baby panther cub?

198
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:25,063
[Meow]

199
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:27,863
They're surprisingly
comfortable around
humans, aren't they?

200
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:29,396
[Meow]

201
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,463
Hey now, I'm not gonna share
my food with you or anything so‐

202
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:33,096
[Cute meow]

203
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:33,929
Uhh...

204
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,496
Okay... maybe just one bite.

205
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:37,463
[Hiss]

206
00:10:37,563 --> 00:10:39,029
Whoa!

207
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:42,863
Hehehe....

208
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:45,229
What a PURRfect little snack!

209
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:47,363
Whaa‐?! It's you?!

210
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:48,529
Hehehe...

211
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,496
Oh, Mine, you always
make it so easy

212
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:52,363
I just can't help
myself! Mmm...

213
00:10:52,463 --> 00:10:53,863
I hate you!

214
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:56,263
‐Grrr...
[LUBBOCK]
‐So that was your Imperial Arms?

215
00:10:56,363 --> 00:11:00,496
It sure was! I can instantly
transform into anything I want!

216
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:01,963
Pretty cool, right?

217
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:04,863
Gaia Foundation, it's perfect
for stealth operations.

218
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:07,029
Which I must say Mine,
if you're not more careful,

219
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,129
you'll be the next
team member to
get killed on
the battlefield.

220
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:11,863
Excuse me?!
If the enemy finds out
about your weapon,

221
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,229
then you're screwed!

222
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,096
Admittedly. It is a
cosmetic‐type Imperial Arms,

223
00:11:16,196 --> 00:11:17,996
so I can't do any
real damage with it.

224
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:20,963
‐Grrr...
‐But that's what makes the
art of deception so exciting!

225
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,629
‐Ahh!
‐Like that look of surprise
on your face a minute ago...

226
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:25,229
Makes it all worth it.

227
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:29,796
[Chelsea laughs]
[MINE]
AHHH! God I hate you!

228

[Roars]

230
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:46,763
Tatsumi, you take care
of the little one!

231
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:49,029
[TATSUMI]
You got it!

232
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:50,896
<i>All their attacks do</i>
<i>a lot of damage.</i>

233
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:52,729
<i>I need to study</i>
<i>their movements...</i>

234
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:54,996
<i>avoid taking any</i>
<i>direct hits...</i>

235
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,963
<i>and take 'em down!</i>

236
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:02,829
Uh!

237
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:07,429
[LEONE]
<i>There it is.</i>

238
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:11,996
<i>Incursio's hidden polearm,</i>
<i>Neuntote!</i>

239
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,029
<i>I don't know where</i>
<i>it started...</i>

240
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,329
<i>But Tatsumi's really started</i>

241
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:20,796
<i>Heh!</i>

242
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:23,929
He'll be right up there with
Bulat one of these days.

243
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:25,196
Guh!

244
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,296
[Roar]

245
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,763
There's no end to these
ugly little shits!

246
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:35,163
It's like they keep calling
for backup or something.

247
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:38,129
The leader's gotta be
around here somewhere.

248
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,263
Hot damn!

249
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:59,096
Hyaaaa!

250
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:00,963
[Roars]

251
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,129
Nice try!

252
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:08,396
I guess that must be
your trump card!

253
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,729
Huh?

254
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:12,996
Waaah!

255
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:20,096
Ha! Didn't even break a sweat!

256
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:22,996
[NAJENDA]
Well done! You've proven
you can easily kill

257
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:24,896
the Danger Beasts
in this area.

258
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:26,263
I've noticed some of
the different types

259
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:27,996
like to attack us
out of nowhere,

260
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:29,696
so we constantly
have to be on our toes!

261
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:31,929
I like it! That makes it
so much more interesting!

262
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:34,063
[NAJENDA]
The air's pretty thin up here.

263
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,763
You've been training in
such a harsh environment...

264
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,629
I'm sure all of you have
leveled up quite a bit!

265
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:41,863
You're right!
I can already feel
a huge difference!

266
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:43,963
‐Chelsea.
‐Hm?

267
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,929
Tell me. What do you
think of Night Raid

268
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,796
now that you've been
with us for a month?

269
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:49,596
Hm. You're all strong.

270
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,629
In fact I would say you're
even stronger than anyone
from my old team.

271
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:53,796
Ha!

272
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:55,729
Aw yeah!
<i>You got that right!</i>

273
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,196
That said...

274
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,329
Just because you're strong
doesn't mean you'll survive.

275
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,029
I took the liberty of looking
through all your old reports.

276
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:06,929
Sheele and Bulat were both
killed in a recent battle.

277
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,663
The issue at hand
isn't whether or not
they were good people.

278
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:12,396
It's that those two were
obviously incompetent.

279
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:13,196
Hmm!

280
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:14,129
What?

281
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,463
[CHELSEA]
All I'm trying to say is

282
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,696
if you don't get it together,

283
00:14:16,796 --> 00:14:18,863
then you're not going to
last long enough

284
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:21,563
to see this fight
through to the end.

285
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:22,663
[MINE]
I swear...

286
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:24,429
That girl pisses me off so much!

287
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:28,263
Well, that's Chelsea for you;
she's as honest as they come.

288
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:30,963
We should eat something.

289
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:34,363
Let's go ahead and get a
head‐start on cooking
everything you hunted.

290
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,329
Can't work on
an empty stomach.

291
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:39,663
There is something really
wrong with you guys.

292
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:48,863
[TATSUMI]
So, what did you want to
talk about, Mine?

293
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:51,029
You know it had to
make you mad.

294
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:55,363
I can't believe what she said
about Sheele and Bulat!

295
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:56,829
[TATSUMI]
Yeah, I understand.

296
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,029
I don't like it when
people disrespect Bro.

297
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:01,429
We need to do something to her
that'll really screw her up.

298
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:04,996
Something that'll scare the
crap out of her or at least
make her look stupid.

299
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:07,963
Here it is. You get her off
her guard, really shake her up,

300
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:09,729
then I'll come in and
deal the final blow!

301
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:12,863
It's total genius!

302
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:15,896
Why do I feel like nothing
good can possibly come
from teaming up with you?

303
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:19,963
What do you mean?!
Don't you dare tell me
that you're gonna take
her side on this one?

304
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,496
You know she deserves it!

305
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:23,663
Okay, okay, fine,
whatever you want.

306
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:26,863
But wait, you never explained
how you wanted me to
surprise Chelsea.

307
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:29,663
Well, you and Lubb will have to
figure something out, won't you?

308
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,396
I've got my own brilliant
revenge to prepare.

309
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:35,896
So get busy, this mission
should be completed tonight!

310
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:38,763
And I'd better hear
her scream too!

311
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:41,863
[LUBBOCK]
I don't think I like her tone.

312
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:45,496
[TATSUMI]
Hmm... Something that'll
make Chelsea scream...

313
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,029
I got nothin' over here.

314
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:50,763
If only we could use our
Imperial Arms to startle people‐

315
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:53,196
OH! I think I just
had an idea!

316
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:54,429
And it was a GOOD idea!

317
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:56,363
Whoaaa!

318
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:11,429
[TATSUMI]
<i>Never thought I'd use</i>
<i>Incursio for this.</i>

319
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:14,496
Listen up! It's almost time
for Chelsea to take a bath,

320
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:16,329
so make sure you're ready!

321
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:19,129
You just need to go invisible
and sneak into the hot spring
from the back.

322
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,096
As soon as you can
get close enough...

323
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,929
all you have to do is
grab the wash bucket and
dump it over her head!

324
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,129
She's totally gonna freak out,
it'll be great! I promise.

325
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,296
[TATSUMI]
Hmm...

326
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:31,096
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

327
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:33,696
Come on! Mine's practically
forcing us to do it,

328
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:35,529
so we have the
perfect excuse!

329
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,429
It's a once‐in‐a‐lifetime
chance!

330
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,729
Well, okay...

331
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:42,096
But I can't let you
come with me.

332
00:16:42,196 --> 00:16:45,129
You understand,
right, Lubb?

333
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:46,929
Hm... That's cool!

334
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:48,529
I'll let you have
the fun part!

335
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:49,629
You're the best!

336
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,296
[LUBBOCK]
<i>This is perfect!</i>

337
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:53,863
<i>Now I can gauge how mad Chelsea</i>
<i>will get at a peeping tom</i>

338
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:55,929
<i>without having to get</i>

339
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:57,529

340
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:00,129

<i>with it too!</i>

341
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,196
[TATSUMI]
<i>I should just get this</i>
<i>over with.</i>

342
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:10,163
<i>Otherwise I could spend</i>
<i>the whole night just</i>
<i>staring at her.</i>

343
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:13,729
<i>Okay. Maybe for a second.</i>

344
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:21,263
[Deep breath]

345
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:23,129
<i>Alright, let's do this.</i>

346
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,096
Uh...

347
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:41,729
<i>Ahhh! That's DEFINITELY a guy!</i>

348
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:45,196
[SUSANOO]
You can come out now.
I know you're there.

349
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:49,296
[TATSUMI]
Uh!

350
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:51,196
Su?! How'd you know?!

351
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:54,963
[SUSANOO]
Incursio can make you invisible,
but that's all it does.

352
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:57,663
You'll have to learn to hide
your aura on your own.

353
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:58,929
[TATSUMI]
Huh!

354
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,863
Always bear that in mind
when you fight.

355
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:03,263
If you forget, it's over.

356
00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:08,396
[TATSUMI]
Uh‐huh.

357
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:09,629
Huh.

358
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:12,263
[CHELSEA]
You left yourself open!

359
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:14,796
Huh?! Wha... What?!

360
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:16,829
Haha...

361
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,296
Surprise ya?
It was me the whole time!

362
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:20,896
Ahh...

363
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:24,663
Uh, you seriously need
to work on

364
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:26,563
quelling that aura
of yours, Tatsumi.

365
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:28,963
The moment I sensed it, I knew
I could turn the tables on you.

366
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:32,563
Oh yeah, I guess that's
why you were sitting here
waiting for me then, huh?

367
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:34,196
You win this round!

368
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:37,496
[CHELSEA]
Hehe... Deception is my
specialty, you know.

369
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:40,396
To detect something like that
you'd need much more training.

370
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:44,196
I'm sorry, does it get on your
nerves when people tell you
things like that?

371
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:45,529
Not really.

372
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:46,796
Hm?

373
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:49,229
I understand what
you're saying, Chelsea.

374
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,629
There's still so many things
I need to improve.

375
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:54,896
I promise I'll take
your advice to heart.

376
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:01,396
[CHELSEA]
So, you're pretty
mature, aren't you?

377
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:03,029
The truth is...

378
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,496
Not too long ago
I came back from a mission

379
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:07,563
only to discover that
everyone on my team

380
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,896
had been murdered
while I was gone.

381
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:13,129
I would be devastated
if something like that

382
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:15,129
were to happen to
the people here.

383
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:18,763
All I'm trying to say is
if you don't get it together

384
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,796
then you're not going to
last long enough to see

385
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:22,296
this fight through to the end.

386
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,929
[TATSUMI]
<i>The only reason she</i>
<i>said all that stuff</i>

387
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:28,096
<i>was because she was</i>
<i>concerned about us.</i>

388
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:30,429
Hmm...

389
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:32,896
<i>How about that?</i>

390
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:35,729
You're a lot sweeter than
I thought you were
when we first met.

391
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:37,296
[CHELSEA]
Uhmm...

392
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:39,896
How dare you say that to me!

393
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,663
Just looking out for my mental
well‐being like anybody would!

394
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:47,696
And the next time you try to
sneak a little peek at me
when I'm naked...

395
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:51,396
I won't hesitate to
cut it off, is that clear?

396
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,496
Uh... did you say "cut it off"?!

397
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:56,729
Cut WHAT off?!

398
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,429
[Street chatter]

399
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:05,196
[ESDEATH]
Uh...

400
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:08,029
Hmm, Commander?

401
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:08,896
Yeah?

402
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,729
Is there anything troubling you?

403
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:16,263
Whenever there's a large crowd,
I find myself searching
for Tatsumi.

404
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:17,763
[RUN]
Actually...

405
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:20,529
If I may... I've compiled
a list of eligible bachelors

406
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:23,096
who all bear some
resemblance to that boy.

407
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:26,363
If it pleases you, I could
set up some meetings.

408
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:29,196
[ESDEATH]
There's no need to
trouble yourself, Run.

409
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,563
There can only be one
Tatsumi, after all.

410
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,663
No one else will ever
come close.

411
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:38,596
[RUN]
My humblest apologies.

412
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,596
<i>Hmm, this complicates things.</i>

413
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:44,496
<i>I knew she was sadistic</i>
<i>and that she's tasked with</i>
<i>the Minister's dirty work.</i>

414
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:47,896
<i>But she's even more powerful</i>
<i>and depraved than I imagined.</i>

415
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:54,063
<i>It should prove rather</i>
<i>entertaining to observe her</i>
<i>up close for a little while.</i>

416
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:58,296
[ESDEATH]
<i>Why do I feel so anxious?</i>

417
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:02,096
<i>Am I sensing that I'm about</i>
<i>to see Tatsumi again?</i>

418
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,629
<i>Or is it because...</i>

419
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:09,729
<i>because the final battle</i>
<i>against Night Raid is</i>
<i>drawing near.</i>

420
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:18,863
<i>Or perhaps, it's something</i>
<i>else altogether!</i>

421
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:30,163
[Grunting]

422
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:31,563
Uh...

423
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:34,263
[Roar]

424
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:37,096
[MINER]
Ahh! It's some new kind
of Danger Beast!

425
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,363
[OTHER MINER]
RUN!

426
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:41,763
Ahh!

427
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,729
Ahh!

428
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:53,996
[SYURA]
Hehehe...

429
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:57,796
<i>Looks like I got my hands</i>
<i>on a fun little new toy!</i>

430
00:21:57,896 --> 00:22:01,363
<i>Y'know, I haven't been to</i>
<i>the Capital in ages...</i>

431
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:04,096
<i>Should be a wonderful time.</i>

432
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:39,963
