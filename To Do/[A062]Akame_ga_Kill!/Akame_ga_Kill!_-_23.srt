1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,508
Kurome...

2
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:10,677
Unlike you,
I chose to be a soldier.

3
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,013
It was my dream.

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,281
There was an officer
who helped me,

5
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:18,018
and I wanted to be
just like him.

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,053
Soldiers fight for what's right.

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:24,024
They're supposed to work hard
to protect their country
and their people.

8
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,029
But now that I am a soldier...

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,631
I don't...

10
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:34,134
I don't have any idea what
I'm protecting anymore.

11
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,248
Looks like it's down
to the four of us.

12
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,985
This place feels really big now.

13
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,386
Yeah, it does.

14
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,388
So, what're we doing after this?
[TATSUMI] (yelps)

15
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,357
After the revolution's over,
there won't be much work

16
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,192
for guys like us, y'know.

17
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,161
If I recall correctly,
when I got here

18
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,997
you practically forced me to
join the team. Remember that?

19
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,868
And when I did, before I
knew it, everything had
gotten all crazy.

20
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,970
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,408
Oh well, then I guess you'll
just have to punish me
with a spanking! (laughs)

22
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,812
No, thank you! Besides,
assassins being out of work

23
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,514
means the world
is a better place!

24
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:21,982
I guess so.

25
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,985
Well, maybe we could start
a traveling circus group
or something.

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,420
Sounds good.
[TATSUMI] No, it doesn't!

27
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,756
I appreciate all you've done
for the cause, team.

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,393
Whoa! That sounded way too much
like a final goodbye, Boss!

29
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,862
I don't know whether
we'll meet again.

30
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,197
That's completely up to you.

31
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,965
What're you talking about?

32
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,468
You're gonna have a hell
of a time getting rid
of these three misfits!

33
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,070
Am I right?!

34
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,373
Of course!
You know I'm in!

35
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:50,977
Good! Then this will be
Night Raid's last assignment:

36
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,179
Cut down the source of
this corruption,

37
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,816
assassinate Minister Honest!

38
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,287
You have to survive.

39
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,357
I will.
You have my word on it.

40
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,257
[loud crash]

41
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,392
[NAJENDA]
Tatsumi, your time limit depends

42
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,162
on how long our main
forces can hold out.

43
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,732
Kill the minister as fast as
you can!

44
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:55,235
Today we turn our dreams of
revolution into reality,

45
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,038
and pave the way
for a new world!

46
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,540
By the strength of our hearts,

47
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,742
we will abolish this
debauched government,

48
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,979
and its people will
finally live in peace!
[soldiers cheering]

49
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,884
I'm counting on you.

50
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,987
[LEONE] (yaaahhh!)
[explosion]

51
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,624
Bingo! Hardly any guards here,
just like we thought.

52
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,192
[TATSUMI]
Lubb's map was exactly right.

53
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,795
[LEONE] Thanks, little man!

54
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,730
[SOLDIERS] (urk) (ungh)

55
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,603
[SOLDIER] Night Raid!

56
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,606
I don't want to kill
any more than I have to.

57
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,440
Get out or get ready to die.

58
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,909
[SOLDIER] We will not retreat!

59
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,011
Shoulda known they would
keep the toughest ones

60
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,880
reserved to the palace.

61
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,549
[TATSUMI] I guess killing them's
the only way through.

62
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,486
[RUN] None of you can cut it
against Night Raid.

63
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,655
Please fall back now.

64
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,392
[AKAME] One of the Jaegers.

65
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,627
[TATSUMI] It's Run.

66
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,328
It's been a while, hasn't it?

67
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,564
I'm surprised you remember me,
Tatsumi.

68
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,701
By any chance, you think
you could let us pass?

69
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,268
Pretty please?

70
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,638
Oh, sorry. I've always been
the type of person

71
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,140
who prefers to finish
everything I start.

72
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,042
[TATSUMI]
Yeah? Even if it's a mistake?

73
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,045
[RUN]
History will ultimately decide
who made the right decision

74
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,515
in a situation like this.

75
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,683
There's no reason to
throw your lives away.

76
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,852
You may leave.
[SOLDIER] Huh?

77
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,220
You can't help me.

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,557
As a matter of fact...
you'd be in the way.

79
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,829
Watch out!

80
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,099
Those must be his Imperial Arms!

81
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,501
[RUN] You were right, y'know.

82
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,703
Just as you thought,
the empire as we know it

83
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,905
has become rotten to its core.

84
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,642
The current regime is on
the verge of collapse.

85
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,910
[TATSUMI]
If you know that, why are
you getting in our way?

86
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,147
Because your methods of revolt
cause too much bloodshed.

87
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,715
Are you saying you're no
different?

88
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,685
Well, you see,
I was once a teacher.

89
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,588
How did a teacher
wind up in the Jaegers?!

90
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,391
[RUN]
Not long ago, a group of bandits
abducted my students

91
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,326
and murdered them.
[TATSUMI] (gasps)

92
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:04,430
[RUN]
But the government didn't treat
it like a crime in any way.

93
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,967
Now, the village I came
from was quite poor,

94
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,504
so the bureaucrats saw
no reason to get involved.

95
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,105
[TATSUMI]
Really? That happened to you?

96
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:16,910
It did. And it's precisely the
reason I despise this empire.

97
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,915
In that case, why are you
not on OUR side?!

98
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,150
That's where you belong!

99
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,852
My plan was to
infiltrate the Jaegers.

100
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,889
I thought I'd be able to
accomplish more from
the inside!

101
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:33,594
But Night Raid decided to
resort to violence in the
name of REVOLUTION!

102
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,961
Man, you piss me off!

103
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,098
I'm gonna knock some sense
into your thick skull!

104
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,702
[rumbling]

105
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,838
[LEONE]
Keep moving, you two. I'll
handle this guy on my own!

106
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,206
[TATSUMI] Sis!

107
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,042
It's not a good idea for us all
to be together in one place!

108
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,977
I'm fine, just GO!

109
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,946
Don't you go dying on me.

110
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,653
Not until I get at least
one good hit on the minister,
all right?!

111
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,223
And AS for YOU, this is
gonna be over real quick!

112
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:07,360
It's nothing personal, but your
ass was doomed when you chose
to fight for the empire!

113
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,897
You chose the wrong side!
(kyaaahhh!)

114
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,503
[LEONE] What the hell?!

115
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,072
Divine Wings, my trump card.

116
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:23,043
You didn't actually expect
me to fight you in
hand‐to‐hand combat?

117
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,779
[LEONE] Oh, crap...

118
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,814
[EMPEROR]
What's the status, Minister?

119
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,216
[MINISTER]
Doesn't look promising.

120
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,485
I hate to be the
bearer of bad news,

121
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,688
but our forces seem to be
completely overwhelmed

122
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,223
by the onslaught from the
Revolutionary Army.

123
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,559
So we're losing...

124
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,460
I fear Our reign's been
nothing but failure!

125
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:44,631
Nonsense! Even in the wake of
the unfortunate passing of
your DEAR parents,

126
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,501
Your Majesty has always
been steadfast.

127
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,536
And with me guiding your hand,

128
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,472
at what point could you possibly
have made any mistakes?

129
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,675
Oh yes, you're absolutely right.

130
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,043
You have been a wonderful
example, Minister.

131
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,579
(soft sinister chuckle)

132
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,948
The citizens are losing their
minds over a foolish dream!

133
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,519
The revolution they imagine
will never come to pass!

134
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,855
It's your duty to teach
the defectors a lesson!

135
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,224
I'm sure there will
be casualties,

136
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,228
BUT there are times when a
leader must make sacrifices!

137
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,633
A display of authority
is the remedy for this
absurd rebellion!

138
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,504
Make it so, O Wise One!

139
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,808
[loud crash & screaming]

140
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,613
[TATSUMI] Well, well,
what do we have here?

141
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,615
It's the rebels!

142
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,417
That man's from Night Raid!

143
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,452
How did you get past
the Royal Guards?!

144
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,221
[breaking glass]

145
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,359
Looks like your precious guards
decided to give up.

146
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,628
(waaahhh)

147
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:50,864
Minister, you're my target.

148
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,633
You're done!

149
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,969
(yaaahhh!)

150
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,905
(cackling laughter)

151
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,040
You're too late!

152
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,976
The ultimate Imperial Arms
has been activated!

153
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,679
You lose! (belch)

154
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,247
[MINISTER] Excuse me...

155
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,449
This empire is
coming to an end,

156
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,851
because of what YOU started!

157
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,153
[TATSUMI]
No! Please, listen to me!

158
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,255
Things were messed up
far longer than that!

159
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,992
The weak and the poor have been
suffering under this tyranny
for ages.

160
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,895
And no matter how hard those
people prayed for things
to change,

161
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:25,198
you never did anything
to help 'em!

162
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,734
Sayo, Ieyasu, and my friends...

163
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,536
they're all dead now!

164
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,939
This callous nation cannot
stand any longer!

165
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,578
[MINISTER] Your Majesty,
you mustn't allow him to
deceive you! Please!

166
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,546
[TATSUMI]
You hold your tongue, Minister!

167
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,948
Your days of manipulating
the emperor are over!

168
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:47,788
What? You should stop making
such vile accusations in
royal company.

169
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,591
I give advice out of
love and respect!

170
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,125
[TATSUMI]
That's bullshit and you know it!

171
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,360
Can't you hear what's
happening outside?

172
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,196
The capital IS finished!

173
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,497
Careful, boy...

174
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,499
I'd advise you to
shut your mouth.

175
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,867
Please, Your Highness!

176
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,837
Crush these traitors in
the name of the empire!

177
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,941
[EMPEROR] Submit before
your all‐powerful Emperor!

178
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,810
[low rumbling]

179
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,278
[TATSUMI] What's happening?!

180
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,247
[loud crashes]

181
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,651
The empire's secret weapon,
Primus Imperator!

182
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:24,190
A machine that's as colossal
and undefeatable as the
gods themselves!

183
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:29,796
[MINISTER] Now the infidels
who dared defy the empire

184
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,232
will face its wrath!

185
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,401
[MAN] Oh God, what is that?!
[WOMAN] Oh, no!

186
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,170
[MAN] What's going on?!

187
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,483
That thing's enormous!

188
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,253
He's using the legendary
Imperial Arms!

189
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,521
[LEONE] Hey, wait!

190
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:58,158
Primus Imperator?
So it actually existed?!

191
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,492
Damn that minister!

192
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,194
No wonder he didn't
admit defeat.

193
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,631
He had this up his sleeve
the whole time!

194
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,900
[EMPEROR]
For generations, Our empire

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,003
has been a flawless image
of divine order.

196
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:15,408
And anyone who should rebel
against it must atone
for their SINS!

197
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,549
[tchzang]

198
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,985
[explosions]

199
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,098
STOP IT!

200
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,443
[MINISTER] Oh, how magnificent
you've become, Your Majesty!

201
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,748
Had your mother and father
not been taken by an
inexplicable accident,

202
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,851
they would be so proud!
[EMPEROR] Yes...

203
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:02,856
[MINISTER] Only those of royal
blood are capable of using
Primus Imperator.

204
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:09,129
There can be no denying the fact
that you are indeed the
chosen emperor!

205
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,064
This is true.

206
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,034
We are rightful heirs
to this nation.

207
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:17,070
Yes, Your Grace! Yes! Yes! Yes!

208
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,172
(screams)

209
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,776
[tchzang]

210
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,846
[large explosion]

211
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,182
So this is the weapon
Stylish described

212
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:33,119
as the first and strongest
of all Imperial Arms.

213
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,223
(panting)

214
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,426
This... is for the best.

215
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,763
[MINISTER] THERE'S a good lad!
(wild laughter)

216
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,131
With this power at your
disposal,

217
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,369
everything around you is yours
to do with as you please!

218
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:54,074
What's a little destruction in
the quest for absolute power?

219
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:58,211
The losses can always be purged
from the peasants again!

220
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:02,482
It's just me and
the emperor now!

221
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,085
(evil laughter)

222
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:10,991
These guys are tough!

223
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,459
But I guess they are
the emperor's guards.

224
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,165
Tatsumi?!

225
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,002
[TATSUMI] Stop! Look what you're
doing to your own people!

226
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,504
Night Raid has done this.

227
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:27,240
This is merely the result
of what you've created!

228
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,645
[TATSUMI]
Don't you have any compassion?!

229
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,380
What kind of emperor would be
able to unleash such suffering?!

230
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,884
Silence! This empire is
a thousand years old.

231
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,887
We will never allow it to
collapse during Our reign!

232
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,022
[MINISTER] Hear, hear!

233
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:45,158
Well said, Your Majesty!

234
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,729
[TATSUMI] The last thousand
years have led to this day!
(hyah!)

235
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,564
[EMPEROR]
As the ruler of this country,

236
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,434
we were born into a life of
crushing responsibilty!
[TATSUMI] (waaahhh)

237
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:57,904
You could never understand
how that feels!

238
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,439
[TATSUMI] It's bigger than you.

239
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,241
It's bigger than all of us.
[MOM & DAUGHTER] (aahhh...)

240
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,578
It's the anguish and agony
of everyone around you!

241
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,614
[tchzang]

242
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,650
[large explosion]

243
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,251
[TATSUMI]
Look! Can't you see it?!

244
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,587
Can't you see what's happening
down there!

245
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,188
(ah!)

246
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,166
(gasps)

247
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,135
He lies!
Don't listen to such deceit!

248
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,371
If you bow and show leniency,

249
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,840
everything will have
been for naught!

250
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,676
It's time to be strong!

251
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:38,111
Oh... guess that could
be what we need.

252
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,214
[TATSUMI] What're you doing? I
never said you could look away!

253
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,983
[tchzang]

254
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,256
[huge impact]

255
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,527
[SOLDIER] Your Majesty!
[screaming]

256
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,563
(panting)

257
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,665
[TATSUMI] If you have
the power to do all this,

258
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,569
why not use it to fight the
real problems out there?!
[EMPEROR] Shut up.

259
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,839
[TATSUMI]
Are you just gonna be his little
puppet forever, is that it?

260
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,474
[EMPEROR] SHUT UUUUUP!

261
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,144
[huge thump]

262
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,281
[TATSUMI] (gasps) Wave?!

263
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,584
[WAVE] I'm an Imperial Soldier.

264
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,620
It's my job to protect people!

265
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,221
Man, am I happy to hear that!

266
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,858
(chuckles) And besides, I
already owed you a favor anyway.

267
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,627
Or don't you remember?

268
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,030
[TATSUMI] Huh? A favor?

269
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,698
[WAVE] Don't worry about it.

270
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,367
Your Majesty, calm yourself!
Please!

271
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,469
[EMPEROR]
This crusade is Our cause!

272
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,439
We must see it through
to the end!
[tchzang]

273
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,507
[large explosion]

274
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,442
[WAVE] He has to be
stopped at all costs.

275
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:45,245
And you and I are the
only ones who can do it!

276
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,447
[TATSUMI]
Yeah, you don't have to tell me!

277
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:51,918
Infidels! Why do you fight
against your country
AND your Emperor?!

278
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,954
[WAVE]
Don't try to twist what this is!

279
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,189
It's not like I'm siding
with the rebels.

280
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,725
But a soldier is supposed
to protect the innocent.

281
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,427
And that's what I'm gonna do!

282
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,363
[general commotion]

283
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,099
[LEONE]
He sounds like a handful.

284
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,101
Yes, he is.
[LEONE] Hmm?

285
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:12,539
But we could use
more people like him.

286
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,474
[tchzang] [explosion]

287
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,278
[screams]

288
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,848
We can postpone our little
scrap, right, Fly Boy?

289
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,717
That won't be necessary.

290
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,586
(chuckles)

291
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:27,821
[TATSUMI] Hyah! Nothing!

292
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,223
[WAVE] Kyah!

293
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,993
Grand Chariot can't
even hurt it!

294
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,796
[tchzang] [tchzang]

295
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,664
We have to keep fighting!

296
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,433
The second we give in,
we lose!

297
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,536
[huge explosion]

298
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,943
(unngghh!)

299
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,477
What was that?!

300
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,246
[WAVE] Look out!

301
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,551
That felt different somehow.

302
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:00,020
No matter how resilient
your opponent may seem,

303
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,689
there's always
a weak spot somewhere.

304
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,025
Try to remember that
next time you're in battle

305
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,627
so you can disarm your enemy.

306
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,228
Su...

307
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:12,165
Wave! Make me an opening!
[WAVE] Got it!

308
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,802
This traitor must be executed!
[EMPEROR] (panting)

309
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:20,206
For betraying the emperor,
you are sentenced to DEATH!

310
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,342
[large explosion]

311
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,448
[TATSUMI] Hyaaahhh!

312
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:35,589
[EMPEROR] (screams)

313
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,191
[TATSUMI] This is the only place
that seems worn down!

314
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,660
It's just like you said!

315
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,563
There's gotta be a weak spot
somewhere, right, Su?

316
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:43,964
Nothing's invincible!

317
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,266
DAMN YOU!

318
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,434
[tchzang]
[TATSUMI] (screams)

319
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,605
[WAVE] Tatsumi! (ungh!)

320
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,249
Just give up!

321
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,553
Why do you have to be
so persistent?

322
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,123
We're begging you, please...
please surrender!

323
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,292
[TATSUMI]
Don't underestimate me!

324
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,928
I've been through more pain
than you can imagine!

325
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:18,599
I carry the hopes of all my
friends who've gone before me,

326
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:22,335
and I won't allow their
deaths to be in vain!

327
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:30,711
[BULAT] There will always be
hardships and misery, Tatsumi.

328
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:33,279
In fact, that's all we get.

329
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,650
But this is the path
we chose for ourselves.

330
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,018
[TATSUMI] Bro?

331
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,054
[BULAT] We should feel fortunate
to do what no one else will.

332
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,189
It's how the world is changed.

333
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,926
And then, we simply disappear.

334
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:46,927
[TATSUMI] Bro!

335
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:49,029
Come on and scream!

336
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,132
With all the fire in your soul!

337
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:55,569
[TATSUMI] Yaaahhh...

338
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,272
INCURSIO!

339
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,810
(determined roar)

340
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:12,586
The ancient soul inside the
armor is causing it to evolve!

341
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:14,621
[tchzang]

342
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,557
[huge explosion]

343

[WAVE]
Are you trying to get killed?!

351
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,454
Of course I'm not!

352
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,891
I made a promise, didn't I?!

353
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,767
I swore I'd make it back alive!

354
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,669
TATSUMI!

I'm sorry.

363
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,873
I guess I broke my promise.

00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,959
Tatsumi... Tatsumi...

367
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,272
Is it over?

368
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:49,843
Has the empire... fallen?

369
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,878
Have we failed Our reign?

370
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,720
Tatsumi...

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,321
is dead.
