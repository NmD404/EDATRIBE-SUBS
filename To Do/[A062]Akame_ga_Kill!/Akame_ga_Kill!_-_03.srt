1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,671
[JENDA ]
How many intruders and where?

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,308
[LUBBOCK]
Judging by the reaction of my
barrier I'd say about eight.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,911
They're getting a little
close to the hideout
if you ask me!

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,580
If they were clever enough
to sniff us out,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,982
we should assume
they're tribal assassins.

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,083
Move quickly!

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,385
Don't let them leave here alive.

8
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,059
You're still a little new
to go up against a
big group like this.

9
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,628
So try to be careful!
The first thing

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,564
is to let your body get a good
feel for the battlefield!

11
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:31,765
Right!

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,033
And the second thing is...

13
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,801
Please call me either
"Handsome" or "Bro".

14
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,136
You got it, Bro!

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,904
Yeah! Now we're talkin!

16
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,640
Hey, check this out.

17
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,041
(deep breath)

18
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,644
Incursio!

19
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,646
Whoa!

20
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,081
(swhooshing sounds)

21
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,187
[BULAT] Yah!

22
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,623
(laughs) So cool!

23
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,526
[BULAT] This is the
Imperial Arms Incursio.

24
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,061
[TATSUMI] I don't know
what Imperial Arms are,

25
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,495
but, man, that was awesome!

26
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,332
[BULAT] Ah, good, I see
you recognize its greatness!

27
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,609
It's them.

28
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,311
[BULAT]
Now's your chance to see what
Imperial Arms are all about.

29
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,546
Yeah!

30
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,951
[ASSASSIN] That's the girl
from the wanted poster.

31
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,121
That means Night Raid must
be around here somewhere.

32
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,990
She's a pretty little thing,
huh?

33
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,658
Let's not bang her up too bad.

34
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,494
I wanna have some fun
with her first.

35
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,063
Huh?

36
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:17,931
Wha?

37
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,132
Be careful.

38
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,101
You've entered enemy
territory, y'know.

39
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,235
Oh, shit!

40
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,837
(gaahh...)

41
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,272
You bitch!

42
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,908
I'm gonna make you pay for that!

43
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,510
(choking)

44
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,678
What's going on?

45
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,279
It's poison?!

46
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,352
It only takes one strike.

47
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,054
[ASSASSIN]
<i>Crap, they spotted us.</i>

48
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,489
<i>But now I know Night Raid's</i>
<i>hideout is somewhere near here.</i>

49
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,526
<i>That kind of intel</i>
<i>is worth a fortune.</i>

50
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,828
<i>I've got to get</i>
<i>back to the base.</i>

51
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,534
[MINE]
Well, he's made it pretty far.

52
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,903
Bummer, I really don't
like revealing my location.

53
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,073
(smirk)

54
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,608
[ASSASSIN] You're mine!

55
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,843
(ack!)

56
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,779
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,614
Thank you, Sheele.

58
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,451
Nice timing! That was just
enough danger to power up!

59
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,153
(increasing power whine)

60
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,755
(gunshot)

61
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,356
Huh?

62
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,659
(screams in pain)

63
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,001
Sweet! Bullseye!

64
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,335
The bigger the trouble I'm in,

65
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,005
the more powerful my
beautiful Pumpkin becomes!

66
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,439
[LEONE] Hmm?

67
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,542
That sounded like
Pumpkin just now.

68
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,344
I'm surprised she puts up
with that finicky thing.

69
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,813
When I go into beast mode

70
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,649
I can just beat the living
daylights outta my enemies!

71
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,450
Much more fun!

72
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:48,522
[LUBBOCK]
Oooh, it was a lady tugging my
strings this whole time.
(stretching sound)

73
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,223
Please just spare my life!

74
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,758
I'll do anything you want!

75
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,627
Noooo way.
[ASSASSIN] (painful whimpering)

76
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:57,030
I've seen way too many guys wind
up dead after a girl says that.

77
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,366
(snick)

78
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,005
(thump)

79
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,616
Maaan, what a waste.

80
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:19,019
Why does this job have to be so
disappointing sometimes?

81
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,487
Yaaahh!

82
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,562
(heavy breathing)

83
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,070
Look out!

84
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,705
[ASSASSINS] Hyah!

85
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,074
[BALUT] Yah!

86
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,546
He's... so strong!

87
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,113
So this...
(patter of falling blood)

88
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,749
this is the power...

89
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,983
of Night Raid.

90
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,119
[BULAT]
You still alive, Tatsumi?

91
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,855
Huh?

92
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,156
Uh, yeah!

93
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,591
Then everything's fine!

94
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,426
I can already tell
you've got some talent!

95
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,830
Yep!

96
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,032
(owl hooting)

97
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,514
<i>Night Raid...</i>

98
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,415
<i>They're killers...</i>

99
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,785
<i>But they're bringing about</i>
<i>a revolution.</i>

100
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,689
Man, I really have found a
crazy group of friends, huh?

101
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:31,925
Heh!

102
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,695
(waaah! panting)

103
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,733
(shivers)

104
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,468
<i>Why'd I dream of him</i>
<i>of all people?!</i>

105
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,743
[SAYO] The Imperial Capital!

106
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,712
There's a giant wall
surrounding the whole city,

107
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,880
and the canals are
full of trading ships!

108
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,949
There's so much to see!
[IEYASU] (snickers)

109
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,019
And don't forget all those sexy,
sophisticated city women!
[SAYO] (grrr...)

110
00:06:59,119 --> 00:06:59,986
Oooh!

111
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,354
Gross!
[IEYASU] (ungghh)

112
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,455
Hey, what was that for?!

113
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,424
(laughing)

114
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,729
<i>Sayo... Ieyasu...</i>

115
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,131
<i>I'll do my best for you guys.</i>

116
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,766
<i>I promise.</i>

117
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,106
Hmm?

118
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,474
Is something the matter?

119
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,409
Huh? Oh hey, Sheele.

120
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,711
I'm fine...

121
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,346
I'm supposed to be training
with Mine today,

122
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,114
but she hasn't come out
of her room yet.

123
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,550
Spoiled little brat.

124
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,751
[SHEELE] Yeah, well...

125
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,753
Mine does have a habit
of sleeping in.

126
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,388
Seriously?! This is her job!

127
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,490
I'm so sorry for
the inconvenience.

128
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,892
I'll go wake her up now.

129
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,427
[JENDA] Wait. Let Tatsumi do it.
[SHEELE] Huh?

130
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,663
[TATSUMI] What? Why me?

131
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,931
Because you're her
subordinate for today.

132
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,234
Waking up your supervisor is
part of an assassin's job.

133
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,605
(grrr... tch!) Okay, fine.

134
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,275
I wasn't aware that
we had that rule.

135
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,409
(chuckles)

136
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,178
Consider it another test.

137
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,980
Huh?

138
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,014
[TATSUMI] Hey, Mine!

139
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,784
You just gonna sleep
all day or... (urk)

140
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,156
[MINE] (shrieks)
(explosion)

141
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,194
Hmm?

142
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,496
(aaahhhh...)

143
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,399
You coulda killed me!

144
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,567
Well, I missed!

145
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,002
You filthy pervert!

146
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,605
How dare you dodge when you know
you deserve to die?!

147
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,940
Oh, whatever!
If you hadn't slept in so late,

148
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,810
then I wouldn't have been
ordered to come get youuu...
(powering up whine)

149
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,344
Maybe so, but haven't YOU

150
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,113
ever heard of a thing called
KNOCKING?!

151
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,616
(repeated explosions)

152
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,484
Hey, is there some kind of
festival going on?!

153
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,253
She's really going all out.

154
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,789
Tatsumi's in for a long day.

155
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,599
<i>I used to think</i>
<i>the capital was great,</i>

156
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:56,102
<i>but now I can see how</i>
<i>miserable the people are.</i>

157
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,104
Hey! Pervert, hurry up!

158
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,706
What's the hold‐up, country boy?
[TATSUMI] Uh!

159
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,208
Let's move it! Chop chop!
[TATSUMI] (grrr...)

160
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,211
Aren't you supposed to be my
faithful servant for the day?

161
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,212
Servant?!

162
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,280
That's what the boss said.

163
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,582
No, I'm just training under you.

164
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:09,950
There IS a difference, you know!

165
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,318
Yeah, and the operative word
there is "under".

166
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,420
C'mon, we don't have
a lot of time!

167
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,257
Wha‐ Hey, wait!

168
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,692
Hmph!

169
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,027
[TATSUMI] Hey, Mine?
[MINE] What?

170
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,730
[TATSUMI] Don't these people
look unhappy to you?

171
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,265
[MINE] They live in fear
of the government

172
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,933
AND the economy sucks.

173
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,436
Most everyone's either at rock
bottom or on their way down.

174
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,573
You wouldn't be
that chipper either.

175
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:33,874
(men laughing & a child crying)

176
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,876
[PUNK] Go ahead and cry.
Nobody's listenin'!

177
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,711
(continued laughing & crying)

178
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,212
[TATSUMI] Hey, what do
you two think your do‐

179
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,380
[MINE] Shouldn't you two jerks

180
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,382
be picking on someone
your own size?

181
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,084
You gonna do something about it?

182
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,187
It's fine. This little
girl's a refugee from
outside the country.

183
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,756
I mean, she could turn out
to be a traitor any second.

184
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,892
So could I.
[PUNKS] Huh?

185
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:52,559
Tatsumi?

186
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,660
Got it.

187
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,261
(snick, snick)

188
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,000
(yaahhh!) (gasp)

189
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,670
(waahhh!)

190
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,006
Hmph.
[GIRL] Thank you for saving me.

191
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,408
[MINE] Don't thank me.
[GIRL] (gasp)

192
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:12,012
[MINE] Just grow up strong so
you can protect yourself, okay?

193
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,149
Ah...

194
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,288
I hate to ask,
but is it safe for you

195
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,290
to wander around in broad
daylight like this?

196
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,592
Y'know?
[MINE] Huh? Why not?

197
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,261
They've only identified
four of us so far.

198
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,864
Guess that makes sense.

199
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,965
Huh?

200
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,834
Wait, who's that guy
in the middle?

201
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,168
[MINE] That's Bulat.

202
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,370
Ohhh, Bulat.

203
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,873
(gah!) Tha... that's BRO?!

204
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,942
That picture's from back
in his army days.

205
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,011
He changed his look whenever
he signed with Night Raid.

206
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,282
[TATSUMI]
That looks nothing like him!

207
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,551
[BULAT] Ah, hah.

208
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,952
Oh man, that's all I need
is another image

209
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,687
to haunt me in my dreams.

210
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,689
Anyway the Boss gave this
mission to you and me

211
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,691
BECAUSE we can
walk around freely.

212
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,760
Understand?
[TATSUMI] Oh, okay!

213
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,862
I was wondering why we were
patrolling this part of town.

214
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,965
Good! Now it's time for our
retail investigation!

215
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,068
[TATSUMI] I don't know what
that means, but WOOHOO!

216
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,788
[MINE] Ahhhh... What a day!

217
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,757
Nothing makes me happier
than a brand new pink dress!

218
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,158
Yeah, whatever...

219
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,661
Isn't it wonderful to have
a whole day to goof off?

220
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,496
Yeah, whatever...

221
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:38,264
Well, the mission's complete!

222
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,067
What the hell?!
We did nothing but shop all day!

223
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,036
Welp, Get over it!
[TATSUMI](owwww!)

224
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,640
[MINE]
Have you already forgotten
that I'm above you?

225
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,242
Good servants don't
question their masters.
[TATSUMI] (ouch!)

226
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,011
You should be grateful
that I deemed you
[TATSUMI] (ah! uh!)

227
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,546
worthy enough to carry my bags!
[TATSUMI] (ow! ah! ow!)

228
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:55,048
Yeah well you're not gonna be
my boss forever, you know!

229
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,117
Plus, nothing we did
counts as training!

230
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,853
What? You think you can
just waltz in here

231
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,454
and be on my level?

232
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,225
You do seem pretty confident in
your skills as a swordsman...

233
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,429
but you haven't seen nearly
as much combat as me.

234
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,497
[TATSUMI] I get it.

235
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,699
Huh?

236
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,134
I'm new...

237
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,669
So there are going to be some
things about this job

238
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,671
that I don't get yet.

239
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,874
But still!
I am gonna keep on fighting!

240
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,143
For Sayo and Ieyasu!

241
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,079
Ah... (sighs)

242
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,849
Akame and Bulat have
high hopes for you,

243
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,917
but I have my doubts.

244
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,486
(crowd murmuring)

245
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,388
So what's that all about?

246
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,390
[MINE] It's an execution.

247
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,159
They're pretty common here.

248
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,295
(crowd murmuring)

249
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,498
(gasps)

250
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,035
(prisoners groaning)

251
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,040
How can they do this to people?

252
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,744
[MINE] It's the minister who
supports this sort of cruelty.
[PRISONER] (groaning)

253
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:02,048
Ultimately, he put the child
emperor on the throne so he
could be in control.

254
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,984
As for me...
[PRISONER] (cries out in pain)

255
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,286
I'll never end up like this.

256
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:11,825
I am going to survive this hell
no matter what happens!

257
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,862
<i>The Minister, huh?</i>

258
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,565
<i>What kind of monster</i>
<i>is this guy?</i>

259
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:30,043
Administrator Shoi...

260
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,613
For speaking out publicly
against Our policies

261
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:34,380
and interfering with
matters of state,

262
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,283
We decree you shall be
drawn‐and‐quartered!

263
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,284
(gasps)

264
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,820
(shocked reactions)

265
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,023
Did We make the right decision,
Minister?
(footsteps approaching)

266
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,525
(chortles)

267
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,026
Oh yes, Your Highness.

268
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:49,896
You're the wisest ruler the
Empire could ever dream of.

269
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,765
Is that meat AGAIN?

270
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,266
You eat that a lot.
[MINISTER] (laughs)

271
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,970
I want to enjoy it now,
while I'm young and healthy.

272
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,506
Buono, buono!
(discontented grumblings)

273
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,676
[SHOI] Your Majesty, the
minister is deceiving you!

274
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,310
Please! I implore you!

275
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,013
Open your ears and hear
the voice of the people!

276
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,816
Well, Minister, did you hear
what he just said?

277
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,686
Seems the poor fellow's
lost his mind.

278
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,155
Right! You've never
lead me astray before,

279
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,023
so this man MUST be insane!

280
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,625
(quaking in fear)

281
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,027
My old friend...
[SHOI] (argghhh!)

282
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,829
Why must it end this way?

283
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,065
No, please! Your Grace if you
don't stop him,

284
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,934
he'll lead the empire into ruin!

285
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,604
Please... Your Grace.

286
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,238
No need to worry.

287
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,708
You can count on me
to look after

288
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,911
that beautiful wife
you're leaving behind.

289
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,447
I'll be sure to satisfy
all her needs.

290
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:46,219
And I do mean ALL of them.
(evil chuckle)

291
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,187
(struggles)

292
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,056
Nooo! You can't let this happen!

293
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,491
He can't do this!

294
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:53,026
He must be stopped!

295
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,761
Someone... anyone...

296
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,463
I'm begging you...
That man is a demon!

297
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,099
Can't any of you see that?!

298
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,069
Please! Pleeeaaase!!!!

299
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,507
[JENDA]
Night Raid has a new mission.

300
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:11,477
This time our target
is a distant relative
of Minister Honest: Iokal.

301
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,313
He's been using the
minister's name so that

302
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,282
he can kidnap innocent women
and then beat them to death.

303
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,085
Iokal also has
five mercenary guards.

304
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,487
They're equally guilty.

305
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,489
I'm counting on you guys.

306
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,158
Now, go take him out!

307
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:29,162
[TATSUMI]
So that's Iokal's mansion.

308
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,331
It's enormous.

309
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,399
Hey, Mine.
[MINE] What?

310
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,936
Is that one of those
Imperial Arms things too?

311
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,371
Yep! Its name is Pumpkin.

312
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:42,308
It gets more deadly the more
danger I find myself in.

313
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,646
BUT a girl like me is hardly
ever in any real danger.

314
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:48,949
How on earth did you figure out
how to make something like that?

315
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,217
Nobody makes Imperial Arms,
stupid.

316
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,720
Jeez, they're ancient,
legendary weapons.

317
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,690
I'm amazed by the things
you don't know.
[TATSUMI] (grrr...)

318
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,962
I don't need a risk factor
this far away.

319
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,998
I'll shoot him as soon as
he sets foot outside.

320
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,600
Right, and as soon as you
splatter him,

321
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,002
it's my job to make sure you
don't get hurt on the way back!

322
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,136
Leave it to me!

323
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,640
Heh!
I'll keep my expectations low.

324
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,043
(long, slow breath)

325
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,615
(ah!)

326
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,986
<i>She's so determined...</i>

327
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,789
<i>I can almost feel</i>
<i>how focused she is!</i>

328
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:29,656
[MINE] Here he comes.

329
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,758
(uh‐uh) Where?

330
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,460
[TATSUMI] Ah! Okay, I see him,

331
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,429
but those other guys
aren't on the hit list!

332
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,731
That's fine.

333
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,932
How is that fine?

334
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,634
You'll never make
the shot from here.

335
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,068
They are irrelevant.

336
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,804
Irrelevant?

337
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:44,971
No, don't!

338
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,006
We can't shoot innocent pe‐

339
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:46,940
(gunshot)

340
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,542
(uh!)

341
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:50,711
(urk)

342
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:53,914
(aaahh... aaahhh...)

343
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,115
[MINE]
Oh, I should let you know,

344
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,618
I'm kind of a badass,
sniper genius.

345
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:00,453
[MERCENARY]
We must find Lord Iokal's
killer at all costs!

346
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,923
[MERCENARY 2] If we don't, the
minister will have our heads!

347
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,325
[MERCENARY 3]
Right! He can't be too far!

348
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,829
[MERCENARIES] (huh?)
[LEONE] What do we have here?

349
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,599
Nice of you guys to save us
the trouble of chasin' you down.

350
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:19,072
Ah, man!
The escape route is not ideal.

351
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,074
Think they've finished off
the guards yet?

352
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,645
Those guards trained at the
Imperial Fist Temple.
[MONKS] (yah! yah! yah!)

353
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,513
It may take a little while.

354
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,049
[TATSUMI]
That's the best martial arts
temple in the Empire.

355
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:32,452
Guess you get what's coming
to you if you mess with
the minister's family.

356
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:36,156
Yeah. He was using his family's
influence to get ahead.

357
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,526
[TATSUMI] (ugh!)
[MINE]
I hate that more than anything!

358
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,562
(climbing)

359
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,463
<i>Sounds like there's</i>
<i>a story there.</i>

360
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:46,099
[MINE] (hmph) I feel like being
nice to you right now,

361
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,268
so I'll tell you the
story behind that.

362
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,436
[TATSUMI]
<i>Didn't even have to ask!</i>

363
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:56,109
I was born into one of the
tribes on the western border.

364
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,344
That means half of
my blood is foreign.

365
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,314
The villagers treated me
terribly because of it,

366
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,317
and no one showed me
an ounce of respect.

367
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,522
My childhood
was a nightmare.

368
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:13,393
But the Revolutionary Army
formed an alliance with
the western tribe.

369
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,629
So if we do end up
having a new nation,

370
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:18,331
people will stop caring
about our differences!

371
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,503
And no more kids will have to go
through what I did growing up.

372
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:27,007
I will not allow anybody else to
ever suffer such intolerance!

373
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,875
Wow, Mine...

374
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,878
Not to mention after everything
I've accomplished in the
name of revolution,

375
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,315
I'll get loads of reward
money and grow old in
the lap of luxury!

376
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,284
(rich girl laugh)
[TATSUMI] (grrr...)

377
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,521
(meowrrr!)

378
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,123
Oh man, that felt so incredible!

379
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,358
That was a rather pleasant
challenge, wasn't it?

380
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,160
[AKAME] Something's not right.

381
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,596
I thought the Boss said we were
supposed to kill five.

382
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,965
Aw man, I didn't
get to kill anybody!

383
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,099
So I guess there's one left.

384
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,167
Too bad, Lubb.

385
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,301
I'm dockin' your pay.

386
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,070
WHA?! You can't do that!

387
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,506
[LEONE] (hee hee) Wanna bet?

388
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,842
(gasps)

389
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,410
[AKAME] Tatsumi...

390
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,382
[MINE]
This is the rendezvous point.

391
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,317
Guess we're all done.

392
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,419
Not until we report back in,
remember?

393
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,889
[MINE] Ha! You sound like Akame.

394
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:18,892
(ah!) Look out!

395
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,627
[MINE] (ah!)
[TATSUMI] (ugh)

396
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,730
Tatsumi! (unh)
Who are you?

397
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,633
[INSTRUCTOR] I must say
I've outdone myself.

398
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,602
[MINE] You're a fighter
from the temple.

399
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:32,038
[INSTRUCTOR] I am. Assistant
instructor, to be exact.

400
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,674
Course, that was
ten years ago now.

401
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:36,309
And look at you now,
protecting a nobody!

402
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,912
Oh my, how far the
mighty have fallen!

403
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,582
Let's just say I
stirred up some trouble!
[rapid gunshots]

404
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,283
(unh, unh)

405
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,220
Better say your prayers,
little girl.

406
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,488
You're going straight
to the minister!

407
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:51,191
(grrr!) That's not gonna happen!

408
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:52,593
(huh?)

409
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:53,727
[TATSUMI] (hungh)

410
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,428
(smirks)

411
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,198
(grrr...)

412
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,500
Hurry, Mine! Shoot him!

413
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,636
Tatsumi...
(struggling in background)

414
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,071
I can't believe you'd
sacrifice yourself!

415
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,472
I'm still alive, you know!

416
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,942
You said you're a genius sniper,
didn't you?

417
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,443
You can do it!

418
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,580
(continued struggling)

419
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,016
[INSTRUCTOR]
Damn it, put me down right now!
[TATSUMI] Hurry!

420
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:19,352
[MINE] Since when do you think
you can give me orders?

421
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,588
Might as well give it
my best shot though!

422
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,024
(wah!) Ah crap!
(powering up whine)

423
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:26,159
(rapid, heavy breathing)

424
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,594
(ungh)

425
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,897
(chuckles)
(gunshot)

426
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,713
You... You bastards are
gonna pay dearly for...

427
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:51,885
for assassinating... a member
of the minister's own family...
(blurk)

428
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,591
(gasping for breath)

429
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:02,896
[MINE] Hey, you. Looks like
you've got some guts after all.

430
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:06,432
I suppose I ought to commend
you on your braver‐ (ow, ow, ow)

431
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,602
[TATSUMI] You didn't need
to cut it that close.

432
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:11,905
Look at what that Pumpkin thing
did to my freakin' hair!

433
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,774
Ah! What's with you?!

434
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,809
A genius was about to give
you a compliment, dumbass!

435
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,310
[TATSUMI] Oh, shut it!
You're not a genius,

436
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,779
you're just too smart
for you own good!

437
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,346
I guess there was no need to
(argument continues)

438
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,348
rush all the way over here, was
there?

439
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,719
(hmm)

440
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,926
[ZANKU] Some fellow
Imperial Arms users...

441
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,561
and they're killers!

442
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:38,331
Mmm, how utterly delightful!

443
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,601
I must get my hands on them.

444
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,569
[GUARD] Hey, you over there!

445
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,137
What're you doing back here?

446
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:45,572
Don't move!

447
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:54,480
[ZANKU] I think the Imperial
Capital's going to be

448
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,183
the perfect place
to call my new home.

449
00:21:57,283 --> 00:22:01,321
It's so crowded there's a new
victim around every corner!

450
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,056
(evil chuckle)

451
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,825
How delightful!
