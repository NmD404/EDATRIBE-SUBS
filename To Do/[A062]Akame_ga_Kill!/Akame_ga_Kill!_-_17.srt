1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:03,003
Wait! No don't!

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,805
[AKAME] (gasps)

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,640
[click]

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,075
[large explosion]

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,518
[TATSUMI] What the hell?!
Where'd that come from?
[MINE] (ungh)

6
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,034
[TATSUMI] (gasp)

7
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,337
Kurome's gone.

8
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,272
That was quite
a blast wasn't it.

9
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,976
I guess Rubicante
must have exploded.

10
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,112
Without Bols backing me up,
I would've had a much
harder time

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,549
trying to hold my own
back there.

12
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:53,386
Big Sister...
did you make it out alive?

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,658
(ungh!)
The meds are wearing off!

14
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,163
[LEONE] (coughing)

15
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,631
That was bad.

16
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,932
Are you okay?

17
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,668
Yeah, I'll be all right.

18
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,035
I just wanted to make sure

19
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,605
that you would still be in
commission for later.

20
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:12,973
But, Leone...

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,575
Oh, you know how I am.

22
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:18,679
I like to show off my amazing
ability to... heal...

23
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,446
(ah!)

24
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:22,849
Come on now...

25
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,985
You're...
You're okay, right?

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,420
(gasps) LEONE!

27
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,351
[BOLS] (labored breathing)

28
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,855
I think I'm clear now.

29
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:14,294
But I didn't do right
by my guard, did I?

30
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,498
I sure hope Kurome's safe.

31
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,569
[ESDEATH] I'm curious, Bols.

32
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,404
Why do you prepare such a feast

33
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,574
only to excuse yourself
when it's time for dinner?

34
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:29,910
[BOLS] I...

35
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,048
If I joined you, I'm sure it
would just ruin the meal.

36
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,851
Oh? So you don't want
to show your face?

37
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,753
That makes me even
more curious, you know.
[BOLS] Ah! Commander!

38
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,522
[BOLS] No, please stop!

39
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,494
Is that it? You had me
thinking it was a lot worse.

40
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,998
I must admit I'm
a little disappointed.
[BOLS] Huh?

41
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,536
Nobody's going to bat an eyelash
over something like that.

42
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,340
Now,
let's all have a meal together.

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,875
[WAVE]
What took you so long, Bols?

44
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,711
[SERYU] Jeez, Koro, calm down!
I'll feed you in a minute!

45
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,580
[STYLISH]
The wine is quite stylish!

46
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,350
[SERYU]
Bad dog, bad! Koro, please!

47
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,388
[BOLS] I wish...

48
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,124
we COULD all eat together
one more time.

49
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,561
[child‐like sobbing]

50
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,064
[BOLS] Oh no, what is this?!

51
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,632
What are you doing here,
sweetie?

52
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,134
This isn't a safe place to play!

53
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,203
(screams) A MONSTER!!

54
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,072
[BOLS] Oh no, I'm not a monster!

55
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,875
It's okay, please don't cry!

56
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,610
Oh goodness, you're hurt!

57
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,780
Just sit still for me okay?
[GIRL] (screams)

58
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,650
[BOLS] Now, now, be a big girl!
[GIRL] Please don't eat me!

59
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,486
[BOLS]
Now, that's not very nice.

60
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,354
There you go!

61
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,591
It'll be all better
before you know it.

62
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,459
Just leave it alone and
let it heal, okay?

63
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,496
Thank you! I feel much better!

64
00:04:56,597 --> 00:05:01,067
[BOLS] Such a big brave girl.
[GIRL] (happy laughter)

65
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,836
[BOLS] (happy chuckle)

66
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,038
[GIRL] Y'know what?

67
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,541
All those places
you burned down...

68
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,343
[BOLS] (ungh)

69
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,312
[CHELSEA] They're gone forever.

70
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,216
The girl you saw...

71
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,185
she lived in one of
the villages you destroyed

72
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:22,488
under SUSPICION of aiding
the Revolution.

73
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,258
Of course,
you've slaughtered so many,

74
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,428
I doubt you even
remember faces anymore.

75
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,705
[BOLS] This is it.

76
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,443
The retribution for
what I've done.

77
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,880
The retribution
I've always deserved.

78
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,482
But I...

79
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,985
I can't...

80
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,354
I must go home!

81
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,824
My girls...
are waiting... for me!

82
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,094
My girls... (sobbing)

83
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,868
My girls...

84
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:22,315
Honestly, that's the most
disturbing thing about
this line of work:

85
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,718
when you feel
your target's pain.

86
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,387
[LUBBOCK] You got a clean kill
before he could run away.

87
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,523
I'm impressed, Chelsea!
[CHELSEA] Hey, Lubb.

88
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:33,393
Let's go ahead and meet up
with everybody else all right.

89
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,761
Nah, you go on without me.

90
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,563
I'm going to track down Kurome
and finish her off

91
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,965
before she can get
back to Esdeath.

92
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,934
Kurome's already gone
outside my barrier,

93
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,670
but I think I know which
direction she was headed.

94
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,739
You could probably catch her.

95
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,440
But it's way too dangerous!

96
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,943
It's not like you to bite off
more than you can chew!

97
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,211
I don't have a choice.

98
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,913
If we let Kurome
get away this time,

99
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,616
she'll just come right back
with eight more puppets for us.

100
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,450
I cannot let that happen.

101
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,219
Do me a favor and
let the rest of the team

102
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,486
know what I'm up to, okay?

103
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,255
And if you could,
see if you can convince

104
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,858
a couple of the others
to come back me up.

105
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:07,928
All right, fine.

106
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,030
But don't do anything stupid,
Chelsea.

107
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,832
Of course not. Don't worry.

108
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,134
If Kurome and Esdeath have
already found each other,

109
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,803
I'll come right back.
I promise.

110
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,272
I'll send someone
as soon as I can.

111
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,675
That would be great!

112
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,878
But it's way too dangerous!

113
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,347
It's not like you to bite off
more than you can chew!

114
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,251
[CHELSEA] He's right. I really
have been out of sorts lately.

115
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,853
It's crazy.

116
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,491
C'mon, Chelsea, focus.

117
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,861
It's time to
take care of business!

118
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,167
[CHELSEA] Kurome, you're next.

119
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,970
I swear I'm gonna take you out.

120
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,175
[KUROME] (heavy sigh)
The medication's all worn off.

121
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,988
We agreed to purchase a
hundred young children
from across the country

122
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,658
and train them to be members of
a new assassination squadron,

123
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,795
but this is obviously
much more than that.

124
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,797
[GOZUKI] What's the big deal?

125
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,600
You need to start
with a few extras.

126
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,604
We'll lose dozens of 'em once we
begin the weeding‐out process
anyway.

127
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,105
[BILL] Hmm, yes.

128
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,974
Naturally, the weakest ones
will drop out on their own.

129
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,710
[GOZUKI] Exactly.

130
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,447
I will take the seven most elite
survivors under my wing.
[CHILDREN] (panting)

131
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,216
[CHILD] (screams)

132
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,654
[CHILDREN] (screams)

133
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,825
[GOZUKI] It's always interesting
to see what type of child

134
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,628
is the first to make it out
of the forest alive.

135
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:52,666
[KUROME] (panting)
Akame, I can't run any farther.

136
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,636
Almost there, Kurome.
Try to keep moving!

137
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,837
[KUROME] (gasps)

138
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,540
No, they're gonna eat us!

139
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,942
Then we'll go this way!
Hold on to me!

140
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,811
Don't be scared!
I won't let anything hurt you.

141
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,379
(uh‐huh)

142
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,815
[BOTH] (running)

143
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,485

[KUROME] (screams)

144
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,454

145
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,158

(gasps)
[CREATURE] (roars)

147
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:26,299
(gyahh!) Don't touch my sister!
(screams)

148
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,502
[AKAME] I must protect Kurome!

149
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,237
[KUROME]
I have to help my big sister!

150
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,888
You both passed the test.

151
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,324
Did you hear that?

152
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,660
It looks like we made it,
Kurome.

153
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,998
Thank you.
Thank you for helping me, Akame.

154
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,767
[BILL] Are you including
those sisters in the seven?

155
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:04,538
Oh no, I think it's a bad idea
to keep siblings together.

156
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:09,009
They'll be nothing but trouble
if they start relying on
each other.

157
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,646
[GOZUKI]
Seeing as you're sisters,

158
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,782
we've decided to split you
two up from now on.

159
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,618
Akame, you're with me.

160
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,586
Kurome, you're going
to the capital.

161
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,155
[AKAME] You can't!
Kurome needs to stay with me!

162
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,625
Please don't make me go!

163
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,827
Kurome!
[KUROME] Akame!

164
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,700
[AKAME] NO! KUROME!
[KUROME] (sobbing)

165
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,340
We will now begin
the experimentation.

166
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,512
You may not have all the innate
skills of the Elite Seven,

167
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,649
but these drugs will
make up the difference.

168
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,617
It's only a matter of time

169
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:54,888
until I create the perfect
assassination squad.

170
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,929
[YOUNG KUROME] (weakly)
When can I see you, Big Sister?

171
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,170
I'm so tired.

172
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,777
Aww, hurry up, I wanna
change my dress already!

173
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,012
Not 'til I'm finished
patching you up.

174
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,815
Um, Leone, are you sure
you'll be all right?

175
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,350
Uh‐huh! Can't you see
how much better I look?

176
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,588
When Lubb gets back, he can use
Cross Tail to sew my arm back on

177
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,889
and I'll be good as new!

178
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,924
[TATSUMI] Uh, did you say
"sew it back on"?!

179
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,860
It's a special combo skill
only Lubb and I can use.

180
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,396
Pretty handy, don't you think?
[TATSUMI] Uhh...

181
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,199
Healing super quickly is
Lionel's trump card!
[roar]

182
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,301
It's called Regenerator!

183
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,036
Well, that's nice I guess.

184
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,072
Although, my precious Susanoo
can regenerate automatically.

185
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,675
Yeah, whatever.
He's still a maid.

186
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,243
Well anyway, it's
a relief to find out

187
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,546
that she's not gonna
lose her arm forever.

188
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:53,647
Uh, isn't it?

189
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,683
(uh‐hum)
[TATSUMI] (uhhh...)

190
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,552
[MINE] Still, I gotta say,
it's kinda lame

191
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,721
that your trump card
doesn't do any damage.

192
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,022
That's cute, you're just mad

193
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,489
'cause you don't
HAVE a trump card.

194
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,259
[MINE] Pumpkin doesn't NEED
a trump card, thank you.

195
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,428
The greater the threat,
the stronger its power!

196
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,697
Which means it can get me
out of almost anything.

197
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,566
[SUSANOO]
I'm putting on the ointment.

198
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,734
It might sting a little.

199
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,101
[MINE] OW OW OW OW OW OW OW!

200
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,670
It's pretty embarrassing
when you try to act cool

201
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,772
and end up failing, huh, Mine?

202
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,140
I feel your pain.

203
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,942
Don't you dare take pity on me!

204
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,409
Least I can keep my pants on!

205
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,513
You're the loser here, not me!
[door opening] [panting]

206
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,981
Oh, hey there, Lubb!

207
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,683
Listen,
I need to ask you a favor...

208
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,885
It's Chelsea!
[ALL] (huh?)

209
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,125
[KUROME] (sighs)

210
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:43,530
Natara and Doya are the only
two friends I have left.

211
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,933
I don't think I'll ever be able
to get that many again.

212
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,605
At least my snacks
are really tasty.

213
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:52,773
[rustling leaves]

214
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,241
[BOLS] Ah, Kurome, it's you!

215
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,579
Thank goodness
you're not injured!

216
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,647
I can't believe
you're still alive.

217
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,248
That was a huge explosion.

218
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,785
[BOLS] The Incendiary Squad
put me through a ritual

219
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,620
that made me resistant to fire.

220
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,421
Well, that's good.

221
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,823
Glad to hear it.

222
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,925
[BOLS]
But I lost my Imperial Arms.

223
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,794
Are you disappointed in me?

224
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,328
(comforting) No.

225
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,664
[CHELSEA] Tatsumi gave me a
rundown of the personalities

226
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,366
and speech patterns
of all the Jaegers.

227
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,003
Looks like he nailed it.

228
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,640
[CHELSEA] She's not even
going for her weapon.

229
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,775
But I should wait
for the right moment.

230
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,444
Akame said she's
using enhancements.

231
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:35,982
If I attack now, she could flip
out and make things difficult.

232
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:39,853
I'll play it safe and
wait for a clear opening.

233
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,789
[NAJENDA] I see.
So Chelsea killed Bols.

234
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,526
And then she ran off to
face Kurome by herself?

235
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:49,630
You guys, I saw the way she
moved whenever I engaged her.

236
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,932
It seems to me like there's a
lot more going on with her

237
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,366
than just a few drugs.

238
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,935
Those people may have
done some stuff to her

239
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,770
that Akame doesn't
even know about.

240
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,371
(gasps)

241
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,741
[MINE] Chelsea might not be
able to do anything to her.

242
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,976
We need to hurry up
with those reinforcements.

243
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,779
[NAJENDA] Akame, Tatsumi,
that's your cue.

244
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,881
I know you haven't had
much time to rest up,

245
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,316
but I need you to find Chelsea
and help her win!

246
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,417
Right, you got it!

247
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,520
You can count on us!

248
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,222
[BOLS] I think we're almost
to a village now.

249
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,192
[KUROME] But there could be
an ambush waiting for us.

250
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,795
[CHELSEA] Hmm, what is this?

251
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,196
I don't know why,

252
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,766
but something about this girl
feels a little off.

253
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,334
And I haven't found any
golden opportunities.

254
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,971
Maybe I should make a break
for it while I still can.

255
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,007
The commander should be coming
back this way eventually.

256
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:37,277
Let's just play it safe
until she‐ (unngghh)

257
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,681
[BOLS] Oh no!
Are you in pain, Kurome?!

258
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,083
I guess I should've
had more snacks.

259
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,788
[BOLS] Um, what can I do
to make you feel better?

260
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:51,324
I'm fine.
I just need to eat something.

261
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:55,328
[BOLS] Poor thing,
you're suffering, aren't you?

262
00:14:55,428 --> 00:15:00,033
I know, I have a trick
that'll stop the pain.

263
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,743
[CHELSEA] See?

264
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:12,178
Nothing can hurt you ever again.

265
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,981
It's all over.

266
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,418
[KUROME] (aahhh...)

267
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,287
Big... Sister...

268
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,560
[CHELSEA]
Both targets... eliminated.

269
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,563
So the last words to come
out of your mouth

270
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,197
are "Big Sister."

271
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,200
I really do feel bad for you,

272
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,005
but consider it karma for
everyone you murdered.

273
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,307
[VICEROY] Your grades are
exceptional, Chelsea!

274
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,476
I expect great things from you.

275
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,880
[CHELSEA]
Thank you, Your Excellency!
I'll keep doing my best.

276
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,650
Hmm, I'm sure you will.

277
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:51,818
(sneaky laugh)

278
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,820
I'll use my brains
to get a decent job

279
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,156
and then marry
into lots of money!

280
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,192
[VICEROY]
Well, that is interesting.

281
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,962
[MERCHANT] Please accept this
small gift, Your Excellency.

282
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,964
Perfect,
just leave it there and go.

283
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,999
A bribe? How could you?

284
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,668
[VICEROY] I saw nothing.

285
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:09,302
[slaves running]

286
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:13,874
[SLAVE] Keep running!
[VICEROY] That's it, run!

287
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,409
(cackling laughter)

288
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,747
[running & screams]
[VICEROY] (crazed laughter)

289
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,649
[CHELSEA] He's hunting people.

290
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:26,953
(grrrr) He's... insane!

291
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:30,524
[CHELSEA] Is there...
anything I can do about it?

292
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,594
[door creaking]

293
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:38,832
[CHELSEA] What is that?

294
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,234
[GIRL]
Oh, the box in the basement?

295
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,303
That's an Imperial Arms.

296
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,471
It's called Gaia Foundation.

297
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:50,010
Supposedly, it's been set aside
because no one can use it.

298
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,046
Really? No one could?

299
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:57,250
[CHELSEA] I feel like...
it's calling to me.

300
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:04,925
It...
It wants me to use it!

301
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,426
(squish!)

302
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:10,230
[MAN] The viceroy, he's dead!
[general commotion]

303
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,767
[CHELSEA]
Everyone's happier now.

304
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,136
They're even cheering!

305
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,805
I've made the world
a better place.

306
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,943
If I put my ability to good use,

307
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,746
maybe I can change this
messed‐up world.

308
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,517
I am bringing peace
to this corrupted land.

309
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,687
It's too bad you won't be
around to see it.

310
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,758
[KUROME] HEY!!!

311
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,726
(gasps)

312
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,194
How'd you get my sword?!

313
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,697
It's too bad your trick
didn't work!

314
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:47,367
I'm in so much pain right now
I'm not sure I can take it!

315
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,936
But my needle insertion
is normally fatal!

316
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,638
[KUROME]
Right after my sister ran away,

317
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,676
the scientists developed an even
more specialized medicine.

318
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:59,079
It makes my entire body
incredibly strong,

319
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,548
though it does take
a bit of a toll.

320
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:05,886
Even I didn't know I'd
survive THAT though.

321
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:08,288
If you want to
kill me for real,

322
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,423
then it looks like
your only two options

323
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,694
are to cut off my head or
pierce me through the heart.

324
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:16,329
(gasps)
[explosion]

325
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,335
She's not even human anymore!

326
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,671
I need to transform
and get out of here!

327
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,439
[gunshot]

328
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:32,613
Ah... no...

329
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,282
(painful panting)

330
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,851
It's hard to move.

331
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,786
I'm running out of energy.

332
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:40,954
Fine.

333
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,589
But if it's the LAST thing I do,

334
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:46,226
I WILL make sure that girl dies
right here and now!

335
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:50,263
Earlier she said BOTH targets
had been eliminated.

336
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,433
That means she's the one
who murdered Bols!

337
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,970
Natara! Doya! Get her!

338
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,272
Chop her into little pieces!

339
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,411
[CHELSEA] (running)

340
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,150
(gasps)

341
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,485
[schawk]
[CHELSEA] (unngghh)

342
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,657
[gunshot]
[CHELSEA] (uuuggghhh)

343
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,254
[CHELSEA] So, it was me.

344
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,391
I was the one
who needed to be punished.

345
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,764
I wanted to show you
what I can do.

346
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,267
I wanted you to be proud of me.

347
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,236
Tatsumi...

348
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,706
I wanted to see you smile again.

349
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,747
And I...

350
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,650
I...

351
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,523
(quiet sob)

352
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,329
[heavy rain]

353
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,040
Oh wow, it's really pouring.

354
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,077
Hey, I'm gonna go invisible
and take a good look around
town real quick.

355
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,646
Stay out of trouble.

356
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,549
You just need to check
the status of things.

357
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:49,950
Yeah.

358
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:55,856
[TATSUMI] That trail of blood
on the highroad leads all
the way into town.

359
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:59,359
If they caught Chelsea,
we've gotta go save her!

360
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,195
Then again,
she knows what she's doing.

361
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:05,532
Maybe we missed each other
and she's already back
at the base.

362
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,438
[TATSUMI] Yeah, I bet that's it.

363
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,474
She wouldn't have done
anything crazy.

364
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:16,476
Must've been enemy blood.

365
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:19,546
[low murmuring]

366
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,783
[TATSUMI] What's going on here?

367
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,023
(aahhh...)

368
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,062
(unh...)

369
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,387
(small gasps)
