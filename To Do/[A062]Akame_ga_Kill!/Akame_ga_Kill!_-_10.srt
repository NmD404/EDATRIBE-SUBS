Our first mission as Jaegers

00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:09,800
is to tear this

How shall we go about it?

00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,500

bring me here?

You're part of the

‐Uh!
‐Mmm.

00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:09,166
If I didn't, then I wouldn't
be in this bed with you.

105
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,133
Um... in that case,

106
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,800
could you just hear me out
real quick?

107
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,833
Hm? Of course,
what's on your mind?

108
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:18,000
To be intimate we must
know each other.

109
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:21,900
It's just, the Empire's
kind of a mess right now.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,066
I imagine a lot of citizens
would agree with you about that.

111
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,400
What's your point?

112
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,166
If I'm gonna be doing
this kind of work,

113
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,800
I think maybe I should be
part of the Revolutionary Army.

114
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,266
And I'd really like it if you
and I could join them together.

we could save that way!

You do realize that you're
speaking to a General

00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:47,000
in the Imperial Army.

121
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,800
I know this may sound
completely ridiculous to you,

122
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,166
but unless things change,

123
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,533
we could end up having
to fight each other!

124
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:55,133
Uh!

125
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,966
There's no need for you
to worry about that.

126
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:01,366
I'll be keeping you
by my side forever.

127
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:04,100
I know you're unsatisfied
with the life you once knew.

128
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,100
But with me you'll never
need to want for anything.

129
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,600
And I promise
I shall be faithful.

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,033
I won't even look
at another man.

131
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,500
You'll never feel
alone again.

132

Oh...

133
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,766
It's not that I don't
appreciate the sentiment,

134
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,533
but I can't.

135
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:24,166
It's not right if I'm the
only one who finds happiness.

136
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,833
So you have a family then?

137
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:28,066
I can offer them
full protection too.

138
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,800
‐That's not it.
‐Uh!

139
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,066
Listen, I want to live
in a nation where

140
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,166
everyone can enjoy
their ordinary lives.

141
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:38,666
So, that's why this messed‐up
Empire needs to be torn down.

Don't you understand?

00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:42,266
Of course not!

145
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:44,866

for the fragile.

That's the law of the land!

00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:52,666
Those who die, are not
strong enough to survive.

149
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:56,333
No. There's no way I could
fall in love with anyone
who thinks that way!

150
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,733
If you care about me even a
little bit, then please!

151
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,566
You have to learn
to love life!

152
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,466
[ESDEATH]
<i>That face... I love it...</i>

153
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,766
Tatsumi, that'll never happen.

154
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,300
Understand something.

155
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
You're never going
to change who I am.

156
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,233
You will be the one
changing for me!

157
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,633
That's all there is to it!

158
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,733
You can't expect me
to change what I believe

159
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,100
just because you tell me to!

160
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,733
Even if you torture me!

161
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,900
Hm, you're so headstrong.

be tired after today.

We'll discuss it more tomorrow.

167
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:42,200
For now we should
get some sleep.

168
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,200
Ehh...

169
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,400
Okay, I'll be over here
on the sofa.

170
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,933
You can sleep in
the bed tonight;

171
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,400
I won't do anything to you!

172
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,433
Oh yeah!

173
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,966
Then I should probably
take a shower!

174
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,100
[ESDEATH]
Just so you know.

175
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,266
If you wander around the palace

176
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,666
or make any attempt to leave,

177
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:58,265
you will be executed.

178
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:01,232
Please do not try
anything foolish.

179
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,698
Don't worry about me...

180
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:05,232
<i>That's true,</i>

181
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:07,832

<i>how dangerous the palace is.</i>

182
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:13,565
Ah. I should've had us
shower together.

183
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:18,332
<i>Well, no reason to rush things.</i>

[ESDEATH]
Therefore, not only is he
a part of our reserves;

185
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:23,765
Tatsumi here is also
going to be my lover.

186
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:26,632
Now, if any of you are married
or in a relationship,

187
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,165
please raise your hand.

188
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:32,198
‐Whaaa?!
‐Don't tell me YOU
have a girlfriend!

189
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:35,265
[BOLS]
A lovely wife of six years,
actually!

190
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:38,432
She's such a wonderful woman;
I really don't deserve her!

191
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:40,232
Then maybe you can help me.

192
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:44,232
What can I do to encourage
Tatsumi to return my affections?

193
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:46,198
Ooh, the trick is to
never giving up!

194
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:47,932
I'll tell you a secret.

195
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:49,965
My dear wife turned me
down twice

196
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:51,398
before I found the
perfect moment

197
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:53,132
and swept her off her feet!

198
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:56,665
So bear in mind that
it may take some time.

199
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,765
But it will be worth it.

200
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,165
That's very helpful.

201
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:03,732

<i>be determined.</i>

202
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:08,165

sleep last ni‐

206
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:19,832
Oh wow, you didn't sleep at all.

207
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:22,932
No, I was so nervous I stayed
awake until the sun came up.

208
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:25,198
She said she wouldn't
do anything,

209
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:26,998
but when I woke up
she was spooning me!

210
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:30,232
You sure do start snacking
early in the day, Kurome.

211
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:31,598
Mind your own business.

212
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,165
You should try to
eat more seafood,

213
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,398
it's really good for you.

214
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:35,532
I wouldn't want to smell

215
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,032

like you do.

216
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:39,065
What? Really?
Do I smell like fish?

217
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:42,198
Oh, uh, no not really,
yeah you kinda do.

00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:43,732
Hm?

‐Keep your eyes
off of my cookies!
‐Ah...

<i>Yep, she must be</i>

226

Gotta problem?

227
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:02,398
Oh, uh... Please don't
be offended,

228
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:05,098
but you really look like
that Akame girl from
the wanted posters.

229
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,565
Right! I noticed
that earlier too!

230
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:10,432
Well yeah. I'm related to
that goody‐two‐shoes.

231
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:13,598
[KUROME]
But now she's a traitor
to the Empire.

232
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:16,732
I do hope I run into
her again soon.

233
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:18,065
You know why?

234
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:21,032
So I can be reunited
with my dear sister...

235
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:23,465
And kill her with my bare hands.

236
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:24,798
Uh.

237
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:29,132
Tatsumi! We're off
to Fake Mount.

238
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:31,365
We'll spend the next
few days hunting.

239
00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:33,032
Where's Fake‐Mount?

240
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,498
You've never been there?

241
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:36,432
It's in the range beyond the
outskirts of the Capital.

You two will be joining us.

[BOTH]
Roger that.

247
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:47,332
Kurome and I will take
the east throughout the day.

248
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:49,465
Wave and Tatsumi, you're
in charge of the west.

249
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,365
We'll exchange
partners at night.

be with me.

rough, don't you?

Let me know if you
ever need to vent.

Huh? Uh... I'm not sure
how to explain it.

I'll have to keep track of him.

Ow!

I'll always be there

Thanks for your help
back there, Lubb.

405
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:14,365
Yeah, no sweat.
It was kinda my fault

406
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:16,032
for bringing up that
stupid tournament.

407
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:19,298
If anything happened
to you, then I'd be
the only guy left!

00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,665
Well, maybe that'd be okay,
I'd have my own harem!

he was worried sick
about you the whole time.

Except I'm very sorry for
what happened, okay?!

418
00:18:46,732 --> 00:18:49,832
General Esdeath, I humbly beg
your forgiveness!

419
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:53,065
Tatsumi got away because
you weren't paying attention.

420
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,632
What I cannot overlook,

421
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:57,665
is that a member of Night Raid
slipped through your fingers.

422
00:18:57,765 --> 00:18:58,998
Kurome, more weight!

423
00:18:59,098 --> 00:18:59,965
M‐hm.

424
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:00,965
Ahhh!

00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:03,032
Oh my dear Wave.

00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:04,698
Your technique is impeccable

427
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,098
but it's worthless if you
don't use your head.

428
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:08,598
Please try to correct this.

429
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:09,632

Oh and next time
you disappoint me...

I will be delivering
your punishment myself.

00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:17,565

heard from him.

found nothing.

Commander.

442
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:35,832
May I ask a
question concerning

443

the young man
you're interested in?

444
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:40,365
If he did turn out
to be an enemy,

445
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:43,532
then how would you
like us to proceed?

Honestly, I still care
for Tatsumi very much.

The harder something is to get,
the more desirable it becomes.

448
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:55,356
However, the lives of my
subordinates are more valuable.

449
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:59,289
I'd prefer if you took him
alive, but I'm giving you
permission to kill him.

450

As you wish, Commander.

451
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:02,602
Tatsumi's been
infected with evil,

452
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,535

vanquish him right away!

<i>No, I'll make sure of it.</i>

I still can't believe
Kurome's one of them.

But when you left the Empire,
why didn't you bring
your sister too?

470

[AKAME]
I asked her to come with me.

But she decided to stay behind.

472
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:57,402
So from Kurome's perspective,

473
00:20:57,502 --> 00:20:59,668
I'm just another traitor
who ran from the Empire.

If we're talking
one‐on‐one,

00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,502
I don't think any of the
Jaegers are tougher
than we are.

480
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:14,568
It's just...

Esdeath.

00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:17,435
I've never seen
anything like her.

483
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:20,968
As of now, I really don't think
I stand a chance against her.

484
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:22,968
Esdeath may have amazing power.

485
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:25,202
But she still has a weakness.

486
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:26,835
[LEONE]
And what's that?

487
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:28,302

She's alive.

00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:31,435
Her heart is beating

00:21:31,535 --> 00:21:34,402
Therefore,
I can still kill her.

490
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:38,368

it won't do any good.

Hehe... I knew there was
something trÃ©s funky
about that boy.
