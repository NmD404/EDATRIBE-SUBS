1
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,272
[MINE] I'm going.

2
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:08,108
And I won't let you stop me.

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,342
[AKAME] It's a trap.

4
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,945
[MINE] I don't need you
to tell me that.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,914
But still...
I won't just sit here

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,683
and watch them execute Tatsumi!

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,451
You've really changed, Mine.

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,287
Remember when you were
trying to stop me?

9
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:23,890
Please don't say something
stupid like we need to save him.

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,225
That won't work.

11
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,660
That was a long time ago.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,262
Tatsumi means something
different to me now.

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,197
[AKAME] I'm going too.
[MINE] (huh?)

14
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,735
There's no reason to put
yourself in danger.
That's stupid!

15
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,637
What you're planning is stupid!

16
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:40,707
If we do this together,
we have a greater chance
of making it back.

17
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:48,148
Y'know, you're starting to sound
just like him with all that
pathetic optimism.

18
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,584
You're just as bad as me,
if not worse.

19
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,553
[MINE] (urk!) (hmpf!)

20
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,255
Fine, you can tag along
if it means that much to you!

21
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,423
[LEONE] Sounds like a plan!

22
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,592
[MINE] Leone!

23
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,561
[LEONE] I'm the one who
saw Tatsumi's potential

24
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,263
and pushed for him to join us
in the first place.

25
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,066
If he were to get himself
executed at this point
in the game,

26
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,467
it would make me
look like a jerk.

27
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,936
So...
Does that mean you're on board?

28
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,304
[LEONE]
We've made up our minds, Boss.

29
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,939
Hope you're okay with it.

30
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,076
[NAJENDA] Why would I have
a problem with that?
[MINE] The boss?

31
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,744
[NAJENDA] If they're holding a
public execution

32
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:21,281
with the intention of weakening
the Revolutionary Army's morale,

33
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,150
then it's our responsibility
to put a stop to it.

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,322
Besides, I have no doubt we're
going to need Tatsumi and
Incursio in the final battle.

35
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,993
Awww!
It's okay, we know you miss him.
[NAJENDA] (hmm?)

36
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,328
(short chuckle)
Oh, you know I'm right.

37
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,964
Then consider this
an emergency mission.

38
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,133
Let's go get Tatsumi.

39
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,512
[ESDEATH] Tatsumi...

40
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,644
[ESDEATH]
It's been a while, Tatsumi.

41
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:35,181
I can't believe YOU
were part of Night Raid.

42
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,684
I came in here
ready to destroy you,

43
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,921
but all my anger was gone
once I saw your face.

44
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,823
You must be so unhappy.

45
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,825
It's not too late to join me.

46
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:49,429
If you do, I promise I'll
forgive all your transgressions.

47
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,865
Never!
I will not fight for the Empire.

48
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,634
[schlang]

49
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:59,139
If you won't accept my offer,
then you know what
must happen.

50
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,307
I will die for what I believe.

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,281
[ESDEATH] I won't ask
where your friends are.

52
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,685
All I want is for you
to stand beside me.

53
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,755
[TATSUMI]
Why are you so fixated on me?

54
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,490
[ESDEATH]
My heart was drawn to you.

55
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,426
I want us to be together,
Tatsumi.

56
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,195
[TATSUMI] No!
[ESDEATH] (gasps)

57
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,998
I could never be with someone
who's only desires in this world

58
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,400
are creating war
and destruction!

59
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,236
Is that right?

60
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,372
Then have it your way.

61
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,578
I will perform your execution
with my own hands.

62
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:42,549
That way I can see for myself
the strength of your resolve.

63
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,118
[WAVE] The commander said she
was in love with Tatsumi, right?

64
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,820
So why is she doing this?

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,090
[RUN]
Well, I suppose you could think
of it as an act of passion.

66
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,124
(huh?)

67
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,059
Our orders were very clear.

68
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,494
Tomorrow during the execution,

69
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,097
palace defenses will be
thinner than usual.

70
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,432
We'll be expected
to provide backup.

71
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:05,038
[WAVE] But what is she thinking,
killing the one she loves?

72
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,475
It just doesn't
make sense to me.

73
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,878
[KUROME]
I understand how she feels.

74
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,247
Instead of letting
somebody else kill him,

75
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,683
she wants to be
the one to do it.

76
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,420
Just like how I want
to kill my sister.

77
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,056
It's because I love her.

78
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,330
But now... it's...

79
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,766
It's too late.

80
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,606
I'm out of time.
I can't...

81
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,207
[NAJENDA]
My sources have informed me that

82
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,110
the Great General Budo will be
attending the public execution

83
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,311
along with Esdeath.

84
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,580
Who's Budo?

85
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,649
He's the only great general
in the empire

86
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,317
and he has the loyalty
of all the guards.

87
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,187
And his weapon, Adramelech,
is quite terrifying.

88
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,756
Wow!
[NAJENDA] Susanoo?

89
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,758
Are you ready to use
your trump card?

90
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,260
Yes,
once you've given me the word,

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,495
I can activate it as needed.

92
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,533
[NAJENDA]
We must complete this mission

93
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,369
and prove our comrades
didn't die in vain.

94
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,805
Thank you for
your loyal service.

95
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,507
Thank you, Lubbock.

96
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,711
[crowd cheering]

97
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,387
People of this great nation!

98
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,222
We are most distraught
by the rebels

99
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,659
spreading unfounded rumors
about the fall of Our empire.

100
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,895
Disregard these allegations.

101
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:39,533
We would like to assure you that
the empire is alive and well!

102
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,536
Today, one of their members
shall be put to death,

103
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,772
in atonement for this
traitorous behavior!

104
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,642
The Revolutionary Army has
caused great unrest,

105
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,545
with these murderous criminals
as their spearhead!

106
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,114
And by brandishing
the blade of greed,

107
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,949
they've deceived honest people.

108
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,152
They're nothing but
a violent gang of assassins!

109
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,588
[crowd cheering]

110
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,757
No matter what your numbers,

111
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,693
and no matter what
falsehoods you perpetuate,

112
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,563
We will not allow you
to poison Our city!

113
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,899
Mark my words: Our great
empire will never fall!

114
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,135
[crowd cheering]

115
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,276
We've done well,
haven't We, Minister?

116
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,379
Impeccable as always,
Your Majesty.

117
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,885
General Esdeath, you may lop off
his head whenever you're ready.

118
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,521
Hold on.
Where do you think you're going?

119
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,223
Excuse us, it's time for lunch.

120
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,092
Come along, Your Grace.

121
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,628
[EMPEROR] (hmm?) Lunch already?

122
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,264
Then, could you oversee the
execution, Budo? Please?

123
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,399
[BUDO] Of course.
[MINSTER]
Oh, I'm quite famished!

124
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,869
[BUDO] So the minister's
making his escape.

125
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,037
[crowd cheering increases]
[BUDO] (hmm?)

126
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,032
[ESDEATH]
I know precisely where to cut

127
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,735
whether I want to maim
or I want to kill.

128
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,970
[shwack]

129
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,308
You told me you were prepared
to die, did you not?

130
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,143
If you're the man
I think you are,

131
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,346
then you'll show me
how strong your spirit is!

132
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,948
(huh?!)

133
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,120
Way to go, dummy!

134
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,822
You weren't supposed
to get caught, y'know!

135
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,790
Oh, no. What're you doing?!

136
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,492
[MINE] You are not allowed to
worry me like that ever again!

137
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,628
[gunshots]

138
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:48,895
[TATSUMI] (screams)

139
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,164
Hey, watch where you're
aiming that thing!

140
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,700
Well, look who's here.

141
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,572
[panic & commotion]

142
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,408
So you finally came out to play.

143
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,711
Well, you didn't leave me
much of an option.

144
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:08,048
(laughs)
Spoken like a true coward.

145
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,415
It's been a long time.

146
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,118
Whaddya say we do
some catching up?

147
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,687
In my torture chamber.

148
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,557
Thanks, but I'm not really
into that stuff.

149
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,625
I think I'll pass.

150
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,227
[explosions]

151
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,731
I'm glad you set up those
charges before you left,
Lubbock.

152
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,300
We didn't plan this, but
they're being put to good use!

153
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,671
[explosions]

154
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:35,876
I'd never suspect you'd enter
the fray without a strategy.
It's so much fun.

155
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:41,014
You must be here to rescue your
little partner, eh, Night Raid?!

156
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,717
[NAJENDA] Let's go!
[LEONE] Right!
[SUSANOO] Understood.

157
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,821
You handle General Budo
for me, okay?

158
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,958
What? But how am I supposed to
fight a guy with hair like that?

159
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,628
[BUDO]
Revolutionary filth like you
should never be permitted

160
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,864
to set foot inside
the sacred coliseum!

161
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:02,769
Prepare to be destroyed by
my Imperial Arms!
(hyah!)

162
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,639
[AKAME]
Since you won't surrender...
[SOLDIERS] (yaaahhh!)

163
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,240
You must die.

164
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,444
[ESDEATH]
Is that your Imperial Arms?

165
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,146
[NAJENDA] It is.

166
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,681
I am Susanoo.

167
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,550
[ESDEATH]
I don't care what it's called.

168
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,053
It won't need a name...
after this!

169
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,692
Back off!

170
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,129
(hyaaahhh!)

171
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,934
(laughing)
Very nice! Keep it up!

172
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,403
(screams)

173
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,306
Man, you'd be easier to save
if you weren't so damn tiny!

174
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,776
Do you really think this is the
time to start picking on me?

175
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,745
Look out!
[explosion]

176
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,780
Ow, that hurt!

177
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,217
You must be their
close‐range fighter!

178
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,453
Take the shot, hurry!

179
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,856
If she does,
it'll surely kill you too!

180
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,625
Oh no, my healing ability
is pretty badass.

181
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,393
Guess I have to trust you!
[power‐up whine]

182
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,995
[gunshot]

183
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,298
[explosion]

184
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,770
(gasps)
[LEONE] (ungh)

185
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,606
I didn't expect it to
paralyze my whole body!

186
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,008
[BUDO] An impressive
team you have here.

187
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,344
First that young man on the
crucifix, and now you two.

188
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,815
It's regrettable that
you've chosen the path of
wickedness and treason.

189
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,383
Who cares what you think?!

190
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,819
Whether it's the right one or
not, the path will be my own,

191
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,821
thank you very much!

192
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,992
Mine!
[MINE] (screams)

193
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,695
Oh really now?
You finished already?

194
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,230
Clearly, you don't realize
what my weapon can do.

195
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,600
This is my
Adventurous Bunker Pumpkin.

196
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,370
And its firepower gets deadlier
the more dangerous the
situation!

197
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,407
It's to my advantage to have my
back up against the wall!

198
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:51,712
The greater the threat,
the stronger I get!
[gunshot]

199
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,787
It's not charged enough yet!

200
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,291
[SOLDIER]
You're not getting through!

201
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,264
[sounds of battle & screams]

202
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,334
Found it!

203
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,402
Hang in there, Tatsumi.

204
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,407
[SUSANOO] (gasps)
[ESDEATH] Now freeze.

205
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,913
(chuckles)

206
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,882
Susanoo!
[ESDEATH] What a shame.

207
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:32,653
[ESDEATH] And to think I used
to have so much respect
for you as a general.

208
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,287
I hope you have more to offer.

209
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,956
[NAJENDA]
Why was I saving my energy?

210
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,191
This is Esdeath
I'm dealing with!

211
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,861
Magatama Manifest!

212
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,333
What are you up to?

213
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,703
Night Raid must be more
resilient than you think

214
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,572
if we've survived this long.

215
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:53,206
Even if he IS frozen solid,

216
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,076
I wouldn't let my guard
down just yet.

217
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,378
Are you ready now, Susanoo?

218
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,014
It's time to defeat Esdeath!

219
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,251
Must be your trump card.
This should be good.

220
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,020
(hyaahh!)

221
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,725
But it won't be enough
to overpower me.

222
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,628
You must realize that
you're outmatched!

223
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,930
Eight‐Handed Mirror Shield!

224
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,669
She always has something.

225
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,938
[explosions]

226
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,507
Man, this guy's annoying!

227
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,274
Look out, he's gaining on you!

228
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,475
Don't worry, Tatsumi!

229
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,444
I know it looks pretty serious
from where you are,

230
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,247
but I'm getting ready to
turn the tables on this loser
and save you!

231
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:39,385
[BUDO] Well then, it appears
you possess everything it takes
to master that Imperial Arms.

232
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,557
It seems to be fluently
resonating with your
every emotion!

233
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,892
Eat this!
[gunshot]

234
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,029
[BUDO] Either way,
you're not going to win!

235
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,165
You're about to eat those words,
you pile of crap!

236
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,738
[MINE] (screams)

237
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,840
Mine, no!

238
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,543
[MINE] I'm okay, Tatsumi.

239
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:05,478
Don't you remember?
I made a promise to myself,

240
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,849
I was gonna make something of
my life, didn't I?

241
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,385
My strength...
is Pumpkin's strength!

242
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,890
(ngngh) (coughs)

243
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,025
I'm not finished yet!

244
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:25,031
[BUDO]
Out of mercy, I'll go ahead and
put you out of your misery.

245
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,234
I don't need mercy from you.

246
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:34,174
All of my people are going to
walk out of this place alive.

247
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:37,243
I'm not losing any more friends!
I'm not!

248
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:42,348
Allow me to demonstrate
the ultimate power of
Adramelech's trump card!

249
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,052
Solid Shooter!

250
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,258
This is bad!

251
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,261
Mine, don't!
[powering‐up whine]

252
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:59,866
Please, Pumpkin... Please.

253
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,201
Channel my feelings!

254
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,904
[BUDO] Say goodbye, little girl!

255
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,976
Tatsumi!

256
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:16,016
[MINE] (grunts in exertion)

257
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:20,587
YOU CAN'T KILL ME!

258
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,057
[gunshot]

259
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:29,062
What? No! (screams)

260
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,940
(loud thud)

261
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,189
I... won...

262
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:58,925
Hold on!

263
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,594
[shwick]

264
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,195
Tatsumi!

265
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,565
Mine!

266
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,105
[TATSUMI] (ungh!)

267
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,677
[TATSUMI] Please... not this!

268
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,945
Oh no...

269
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,246
(grrr!)

270
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,948
The mission's complete!

271
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,350
Get back to base, NOW!

272
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,555
Tatsumi, I won't let you leave!

273
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,226
Sacred Sword of the Heavens!

274
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,567
I gotcha!
[click]

275
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,003
[explosions]

276
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:48,008
Everything in sight
will be encased in ice.

277
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,776
Mahapadma!

278
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,316
That ability puts such
enormous strain on me,

279
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,520
I'm not capable of using it
as often as I'd like.

280
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,724
Too much would be
overkill, anyway.

281
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,161
What... what happened?

282
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,996
Esdeath, what did you do?!

283
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,398
Oh, I just froze time and space.

284
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,601
It's my special trump card
that I developed for

285
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,302
just such an occassion.

286
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,139
I wanted something that would
not only keep Tatsumi
from escaping,

287
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,642
but effectively slay my enemies.

288
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:26,012
SUSANOO, GET OUT OF THERE!

289
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,816
I suppose I should congratulate
you for inspiring me to use it.

290
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:32,719
Susanoo's core!

291
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,191
(shocked gasp)

292
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,697
[ESDEATH] You lose.

293
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:47,534
Now if you'll accompany me
to the torture chambers...

294
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,106
What?! Impossible!

295
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,376
It's regenerating itself!

296
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,546
This makes three times.
It's our last shot.

297
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,815
It'll take everything
I have left.

298
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,684
If I exhaust my life force,

299
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:06,787
I'm sure I can make him
even more powerful.

300
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,221
[coughs]

301
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:12,325
If General Budo is dead,
then my life was well spent.

302
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,261
I can die peacefully
knowing that.

303
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,898
The rest is up to you, Susanoo.

304
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,801
[ESDEATH] Burn in Hell, Najenda!

305
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:23,537
Celestial Treasure Magatama!

306
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,673
Well, he just boosted his power.

307
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,109
(kyaaahhh!)

308
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,778
[TATSUMI] Su, let me help you!

309
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,747
[NAJENDA] Run away, Tatsumi.

310
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:36,349
[TATSUMI]
But he's powered up now!

311
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,619
[NAJENDA] It's just the way
his attacks overlapped.

312
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,856
It's making it appear as though
Susanoo's strength increased
by double.

313
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,257
But the level he is right now,

314
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,260
he'll never even come close
to defeating Esdeath.

315
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:49,563
[TATSUMI] Su!

316
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,364
It looks like you've
gotten tougher,

317
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,567
but you're still
not strong enough.

318
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:57,370
Despite your best efforts,
you're still losing this fight.

319
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,439
[TATSUMI] Don't do it!
[SUSANOO]
Please try not to forget

320
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,676
the reason we came here
in the first place.

321
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,310
Run, Tatsumi.

322
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,579
[TATSUMI] But, Su...

323
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,814
In my thousand years as
an Imperial Arms,

324
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:11,752
my time with this group has been
the most fun I've ever had.

325
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:13,920
I have no regrets.

326
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,355
Susanoo...

327
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,490
I bid you farewell.

328
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,831
[ESDEATH] Stop right there!

329
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,567
[SUSANOO] I don't think so!

330
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,572
That mirror again.

331
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,007
I will never let you
catch up to them!

332
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,609
So you're using yourself
as a shield

333
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,579
in order to buy time
for your companions to escape.

334
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,082
Where does Najenda find all
these mushy little softies?

335
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,284
I am nothing more than a weapon.

336
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,419
And now I have no trump card.

337
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,388
Given my situation,
wouldn't you agree

338
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,390
that this is my best
possible option?

339
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,393
[ESDEATH] You said your name
was Susanoo, yes?

340
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,563
[SUSANOO] So you WERE listening.

341
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:59,933
I will forever remember it as
the name of a legendary warrior,

342
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,402
and NOT an Imperial Arms.

343
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,137
Now, as you face your demise,

344
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:07,941
I will enjoy watching your
sad attempts to avoid
your inevitable end.

345
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,876
[SUSANOO] (yaaahhh!)

346
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,916
[TATSUMI]
We're going back to the base.

347
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,083
Just hang in there!

348
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,585
You'll be all healed up
in no time.

349
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:19,786
Put me down.

350
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:20,887
[TATSUMI] Don't be an idiot.

351
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,723
Your injuries are serious.

352
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:25,258
[MINE] Just do it, okay?

353
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,805
[MINE] Tatsumi?

354
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,173
[TATSUMI] I'm right here.

355
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,844
Ever since you saved me
back in Kyoroku,

356
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,379
I've been trying to find
a way to repay you.

357
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,581
That's why I‐
[TATSUMI] No...

358
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,482
You didn't have to do that!

359
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,452
We can... call it even now.

360
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,087
Yeah, sure! We're even.

361
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:55,956
Just don't give up on me,
all right?!

362
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,423
[MINE] You're so stupid.

363
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:00,326
I can't just heal myself
like Leone does.

364
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,762
[TATSUMI] (sobs)

365
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:03,329
I wanted to be...

366
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,599
I wanted to be by
your side 'til the end.

367
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,200
[TATSUMI] Don't talk like that!

368
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,903
'Cause we're supposed to be...
together...

369
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,337
Together forever!

370
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,508
You're such a bad liar,
Tatsumi.

371
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:18,211
And you're...
the biggest crybaby I ever met.

372
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,980
[TATSUMI] I can't believe you...

373
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,615
Why did you have to save me?

374
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,483
If it meant you were gonna...

375
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,252
You can't just... (sobs)

376
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:30,724
A man... should never let
anyone see him cry.

377
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,158
Hey...

378
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,060
Tatsumi?
[TATSUMI] Yeah?

379
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,428
I'm glad I...

380
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,831
I'm glad I fell
in love with you.

381
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:38,832
Mine...

382
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:39,866
You can't die...

383
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,434
PLEASE don't die!

384
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:44,337
You have to survive and make
something of your life, right?!

385
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,306
What are you talking about?
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

386
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:49,576
I already... I already did.

387
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,416
I love... you.

388
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:57,984
[MINE] (sighs)
[TATSUMI] (gasps)

389
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,252
[TATSUMI] Mine...

390
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,021
Mine, no!

391
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:03,624
Mine! (sobs)
