1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,170
[HUSBAND] I heard a rumor that
people have been seeing

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,508
a new type of Danger‐Beast
around here lately.

3
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:10,877
Be careful. I don't want you
going out by yourself.

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,479
I know, dear,
don't you worry about me.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,314
[loud banging on door]

6
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,415
(gasps)

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,650
[snarls]

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,351
[rapid gun shots]

9
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,391
[munching sounds]
[WOMAN] (quiet panic)

10
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:27,994
[growls]

11
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:31,532
No... no please...
don't hurt me!

12
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,300
(screams)

13
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,897
[EMPEROR] Thanks to the Jaegers,
the number of bandits

14
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,367
near the imperial capital
has drastically decreased.

15
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,804
And Night Raid has kept
a low profile as of late.

16
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,973
They must be quite
afraid of you.

17
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,542
We are pleased with your work!

18
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,878
Yes. Once I discover the
location of their new base,

19
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,079
they will be punished.

20
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,582
(mmm) We have the
utmost faith in you.

21
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,751
But sadly,
We haven't found a suitor

22
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,452
who meets your criteria yet.

23
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,320
Though I should mention
the minister here

24
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,589
does have an unmarried son!

25
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,758
I hear HE has potential.
[MINISTER](grunts)

26
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,326
[ESDEATH] Your Highness,
as I stated in my report,

27
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,128
the position has been filled.

28
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,064
You needn't concern
yourself further.

29
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,467
But didn't you tell Us that he
had vanished without a trace?

30
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,770
How can you have a
relationship like that?

31
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,006
[ESDEATH] The pursuit has made
me want him even more.

32
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,609
It seems this love is
unfamiliar to me.

33
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,843
[EMPEROR] (woah...)

34
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,111
Most intriguing!

35
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,682
Not as much as you think,
Your Grace.

36
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,818
You seem to have
rubbed off on the Emperor.

37
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:09,055
He's been very interested
in romance of late.

38
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,724
I think he's well on his way

39
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:15,228
to a life of corruption
and debauchery. (laughs)

40
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,131
My plan is to make sure
the Emperor

41
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,334
enjoys the sweetest life
possible.

42
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,137
Just don't allow him to fall
into any bad habits.

43
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,974
Right. Anyway, I have
a favor to ask of you.

44
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,910
[ESDEATH] I'm listening.

45
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,247
A new species of Danger Beast
has appeared around the capital.

46
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,683
I would like you
to get rid of them.

47
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,951
Yes, I know.

48
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,955
I've already started
investigating that for myself.

49
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,524
Until recently,
creatures like these

50
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,892
only lived in forests
and in the mines.

51
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,730
But just days ago, a few forced
their way into a couple's home

52
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,097
and devoured them alive.

53
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,599
I heard that.

54
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,302
They're also said to bear
a resemblance to human beings.

55
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,507
We could have a lot of fun
with these new toys, yes?

56
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,310
Great General Budo has ordered
that they all be destroyed,

57
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,548
but I would love to
examine them.

58
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,082
As you wish.

59
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,551
After hearing how
deadly they are,

60
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,786
I don't think I can
resist hunting them.

61
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,622
I suppose I could catch two
or three for you.

62
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,791
Please forward the reward
money to the soldiers

63
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,425
I have stationed up north.

64
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:24,464
You truly are a benevolent
leader, aren't you, General?

65
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,968
A soldier is more likely
to fight to the death

66
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,136
for a commander he respects.

67
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,005
And when you consider
that idea,

68
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,507
it's easy to see why my forces

69
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,042
are considered the strongest
in the nation.

70
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,645
[MINISTER] That's comforting.

71
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,516
Please pick out a few
feisty ones for me.

72
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,483
[rattling wagon wheels]

73
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:44,718
[TRAVELER] Hurry up!

74
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,620
We need to reach
the capital before dark.

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,121
I know, I know, I'm trying to.

76
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,824
We gotta get outta this area
as soon as we possibly can!

77
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,659
(horse whinies in terror)

78
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,694
(gasps)

79
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,195
[TRAVELERS] What's that?!
‐ Oh, my God!

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,998
[snarls and growls]
[TRAVELERS] (screams)

81
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,569
[BOLS] Just in time.

82
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,038
[snarling]

83
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,741
[BOLS]
Now then, I'd better clean up.

84
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,444
[pained snarls]

85
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,254
[BOLS] Gentlemen,
is everybody all right?

86
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,856
(gasps and panic)

87
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,626
[BOLS] Um, I went ahead and took
out the Danger Beasts for ya.

88
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,828
So there's no need
to be afraid.

89
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:32,533
[echoing] ...be afraid...
be afraid... BE AFRAID.
[TRAVELERS] (panicking)

90
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,535
Worry not citizens, you're safe.

91
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,137
They've been incinerated by
the flames of justice!

92
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,639
Oh, thank you!

93
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,441
You must be imperial officers
from the capital, right?

94
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,109
We owe you one!

95
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,179
So uh, that was
kinda awkward, huh?

96
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,348
You did a good thing, okay?

97
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,084
[BOLS] Those... people...

98
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,786
They can feel safe now!

99
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,555
Which is wonderful!

100
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,122
Right?

101
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:58,925
[panting]

102
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,861
[sudden wind howling]

103
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,169
[ESDEATH] There we go.

104
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:13,840
Freezing these creatures was
the most effective way of
capturing them.

105
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,512
It's true. I've never seen this
kind of Danger Beast before.

106
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,584
(hungry sounds)

107
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,919
It's not a snack.
[KUROME] (urk)

108
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,225
[BOLS]
Wave, Kurome, the tea is ready.

109
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,426
Oh thanks, Bols.

110
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,495
Uh, thank you for always
waiting on us.

111
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,397
[BOLS] No, no, don't mention it!

112
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,533
I like being helpful.

113
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,836
[BOLS] What's the matter, Wave?

114
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,705
It still just
kind of bothers me.

115
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,273
I mean, you're a
really nice person.

116
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,577
But even when you killed
the Danger Beasts and saved
those guys' lives,

117
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,779
they still judged you
based on how you look!

118
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,481
[KUROME] Yeah, but you
did the same thing.
[WAVE] (huh?)

119
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,052
(gyaaahhh) Crap, I did!

120
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,354
[BOLS] Wave, I told you before.

121
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,190
I'm not a... nice person.

122
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,494
I've been to inflicted
and diseased villages,

123
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,931
and I've burned them
to the ground.

124
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,065
I was an executioner.

125
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,202
I've burned innocent men
and women to ashes.

126
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,105
I've done so many
horrible things.

127
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,308
I've lost count of the names
of those who want me dead.

128
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,445
But all you did was follow
the orders you were
given, right?!

129
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,614
[BOLS]
What I do may just be a job,

130
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,916
but karma is still karma.

131
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,053
I figure I'm only
getting what I deserve:

132
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,121
reminders, retribution.

133
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,924
But Bols, you shouldn't torture
yourself like that!

134
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,793
Listen, if you ever need
a shoulder to cry on,

135
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,995
I'm right here okay!
[KIJE] Honey!

136
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,830
[ROGUE] (giggles) Daddy!

137
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,532
[WAVE] Huh?
[BOLS] My girls!

138
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,634
[BOLS] What are you lovely
ladies doing here?

139
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,703
You big 'ol goofball,
you left your lunch

140
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,138
sitting on the kitchen counter
this morning.

141
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,607
[BOLS] Oh, my GOODNESS!

142
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,109
Mommy, Daddy made a boo‐boo!

143
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,612
[All] (laughing)

144
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,614
You have such a demanding job,
sweetie.

145
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,116
If you don't eat lunch,
you might get too light‐headed.

146
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,317
[BOLS] Yes, dear.

147
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,486
I'll be more careful next time.

148
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,421
Daddy! Hold me!

149
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,591
[BOLS]
All right, c'mere, big girl!

150
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,425
[ROGUE] (laughing)

151
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,762
[BOLS] Look, I appreciate
your concern, Wave.

152
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,365
But my wife and my daughter know
all about the things I do,

153
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,302
and well, they still
love me, no matter what.

154
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,105
It's because of them that,
y'know...
[ROUGE] (giggles)

155
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,207
That nothing out there is too
much for me.
[WAVE] (ungghhh)

156
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,109
[WAVE] God,
I can't even stand it!
[BOLS] (chuckling)

157
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,777
Turn down the love!

158
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,679
Oh man, I think this is
twice in a row

159
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,949
I've failed at
comforting someone?

160
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,051
[ALL] (happy laughs)

161
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,055
[KIJE] Aww, daddy's little girl!

162
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,290
[water rushing]

163
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,667
[TATSUMI] (hyaaahhh)

164
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,472
Do not rely
on simple brute force

165
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,608
when you try to hit something.

166
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,814
[TATSUMI] (huh?!)

167
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,651
[SUSANOO] (umph)

168
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,755
No matter how resilient
your opponent may seem,

169
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,290
there's always a weak spot
somewhere.

170
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,726
[TATSUMI] Whoa...

171
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,862
Try to remember that the next
time you're in battle

172
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,664
so you can disarm your enemy.

173
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,231
[TATSUMI] Yeah, I will.

174
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,634
But wait, do you think
I'll be able to pull off

175
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,803
something like that
in the middle of a fight?

176
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,839
[SUSANOO] It always seems to
present itself eventually.

177
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,141
You must be pretty observant
then, huh, Su?

178
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,112
Something like that.
I was originally created
to look after my master.

179
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,683
I have been trained to observe
every little detail around me.

180
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:43,984
Makes sense to me!

181
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,319
Well, it's great
to have you around!

182
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,721
Y'know since you came along,

183
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,623
I've been a lot more confident
that all eight of us

184
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,392
are gonna live to see
the end of this whole thing.

185
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,060
I am an Imperial Arms.

186
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,763
There's no need for you
to include me in such things.

187
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,398
[TATSUMI] Don't say that!

188
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,767
You're a weapon AND a companion!

189
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,870
Companion? Why?

190
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,940
I'm not really sure
I understand.

191
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,776
That word refers to people who
fight alongside one another.

192
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,980
Wha‐? Yeah, well that too,
but it's a lot more than that.

193
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,549
Umm...

194
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,384
Companions...
just help each other out.

195
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,520
Hey, I got it!

196
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,655
You're a relatively
handsome guy.

197
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:22,989
When all this fighting's over,
I want you

198
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,658
to help me and Lubb
pick up chicks.

199
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:25,726
How's that sound?

200
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,829
(hmph) Not sure if I know how.

201
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,864
But if that really is what
you want from me,

202
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,466
I'll do everything in my power
to help you achieve it.

203
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,835
Aw, yeah!

204
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,503
[AKAME] Hey, Su! Tatsumi!

205
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,138
[TATSUMI] (huh)

206
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,373
The boss just called an
emergency meeting.

207
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,975
We need to get back to base.

208
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,077
Emergency? What's going on?

209
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,846
Apparently, some new
Danger Beasts

210
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,749
are causing a lot of trouble
in the imperial capital.

211
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,483
But before we can
take care of them,

212
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,686
we're relocating
to our new hideout.

213
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,588
[TATSUMI] (huh)

214
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,189
The Capital, huh?

215
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,101
This is it?

216
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,104
It doesn't look any different
from the old hideout.

217
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,841
Well, when you build a facility
that's hard to find and
easy to flee,

218
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,877
it pretty much looks like this.

219
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,980
And the best part is the new one
has a hot spring, too!

220
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,116
After this job, we should have
a soak and get trashed!

221
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,685
Sounds like fun!

222
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,152
[LUBBOCK] Najenda, guess what!

223
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,821
I set up a barrier
all the way around

224
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,489
the perimeter of the hideout!

225
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,891
Okay.

226
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,359
And I dug out a few traps
in case of an emergency.

227
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,396
Oh, that was really fast,
Susanoo. Nice work!

228
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,731
[LUBBOCK] (urk!)

229
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,032
(angry growl)

230
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,901
You'd better
watch yourself, pal!

231
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:44,237
Hm? What are you talking about?

232
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,972
[TATSUMI] (sigh)

233
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,108
[NAJENDA] I hate to send
you all out again so soon,

234
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,411
but your next job is to take out
the Danger Beasts I mentioned.

235
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:53,947
We don't know very much
about them at the moment,

236
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,749
except that they're
somewhat intelligent

237
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,251
and they usually like
to travel in packs.

238
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,287
But individually,
they're still extremely strong.

239
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,858
They've overpowered everyone
who's tried to fight them.

240
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,060
They've been attacking both
humans and livestock

241
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,429
south of the capital
in various environments,

242
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,765
from mines to forests.

243
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,366
The Jaegers and
the Imperial Army

244
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,637
are working day in and day out
to exterminate them,

245
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,806
but their numbers
haven't decreased much.

246
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,608
If they're giving
the Empire a hard time,

247
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,844
then I seriously doubt
this is a trap.

248
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,046
(exhales) Undoubtedly,

249
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,750
we're actually HELPING the
Empire by taking this job.

250
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,384
Can you live with that?

251
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,686
Absolutely, Boss!

252
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,655
After all,
this is a special case.

253
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,156
I agree with Tatsumi.

254
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,159
It sounds like we should
defeat them as soon as possible.

255
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,629
I just hope we don't run into
any Imperial Soldiers

256
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,097
while we're near the capital.

257
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,499
(hmm?) Shouldn't be an issue.

258
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,336
We're Night Raid. We do our work
while the soldiers are off duty.

259
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,138
Oh yeah, guess so.

260
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,473
[CHELSEA] (sigh)

261
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,842
So you bleeding hearts will
just put yourselves in danger

262
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,911
just to help slay the monsters?

263
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,413
Leave it to the Jaegers
to get themselves killed.

264
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,784
You guys really have to stop
being so soft all the time.

265
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,451
(troubled sigh)

266
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,988
[TATSUMI] I understand
where you're coming from.
[CHELSEA] (huh?)

267
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:12,225
[TATSUMI] But what if those
things are killing more
innocent people as we speak?

268
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,460
Even if we are
a bunch of assassins,

269
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,730
we're still allies
of the people!

270
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,998
And if we really want to help,

271
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,001
we have to kill those things
right now!

272
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,870
[CHELSEA] I figured you'd say
something like that.

273
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,606
(sighs) Fine, you win.

274
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,140
(mmm)

275
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,809
(aggghh)

276
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,110
[SUSANOO] Tatsumi...

277
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,614
There's something
I really need to tell you.

278
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,215
[TATSUMI] What's that?

279
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,217
Could you please
zip up your pants?

280
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,185
It's been bothering me
for a while now.

281
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,554
(aaaggghhh)

282
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:44,090
[LEONE & LUBBOCK] (laughing)

283
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,927
So much for trying to
look all cool, Romeo!
[LUBBOCK]
Yeah, Tatsumi, you're the man!

284
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,695
We totally take you seriously!
[LEONE] (laughing)

285
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,163
You're awesome. So smooth.
[LEONE] (laughing)

286
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,431
It serves you right, loser.
[LUBBOCK] Mr. Cool.

287
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:52,899
Come on, guys!

288
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,500
[AKAME] Sorry, Tatsumi.

289
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,072
I noticed it a while ago, but I
thought it might be intentional.

290
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,441
Are you crazy?! What the hell
kind of exhibitionist

291
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,609
do you think I am?!

292
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,944
[AKAME] (ummm)
[TATSUMI] (urk)

293
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,211
From now on, I'll watch closely

294
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,047
to ensure it stays up.
[TATSUMI] (waaaahh!)

295
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,215
No thanks,
I'm sure I'll be fine!

296
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,018
It's an ingenious technique. A
great way to distract the enemy.

297
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,254
You need to
shut your stupid face!

298
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,757
Oh, there's nothing to
be embarrassed about.
[TATSUMI] I swear I am going
to kill you, Lubbock.

299
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,191
You had your fly down
for the people, right?
[TATSUMI]
I am going to kill you dead.

300
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,226
Huh?! Seriously?
[LUBBOCK] Ha, ha!

301
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,928
This is actually pretty
normal for our crowd.
[commotion in background]

302
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,798
Make sure you're prepared
for plenty of headaches.

303
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,600
Yeah, I'm prepared for that,

304
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,934
but I'm a little scared.

305
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,402
I mean I can't help
but be worried

306
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:31,838
after reading about
Sheele and Bulat.

307
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,140
Tatsumi's too nice,
like they were.

308
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,776
I'm afraid it's
gonna get him killed.

309
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,344
[commotion continues]
[LUBBOCK]
Awww, don't be such a baby!

310
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:46,219
[ESDEATH]
Run, I have something very
important to discuss with you.

311
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,621
Based on the
minister's research,

312
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,856
those Danger Beasts were
once people.

313
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,658
I knew it.

314
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,128
Their physiques did seem
unusually human as I recall.

315
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,531
Someone was turning them
into monsters.

316
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:01,001
Only an Imperial Arms user could
manage something like that.

317
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,804
There's a distinct possibility
that these new Danger Beasts

318
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,139
could have been the
doctor's experiments.

319
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,875
It's probably not a coincidence
they started wreaking havoc

320
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,912
right about the same time
the doctor disappeared.

321
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,246
Is there more evidence?

322
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,215
When I went to investigate
the laboratory,

323
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,519
I remember noticing that the
place seemed surprisingly empty.

324
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:21,755
Especially knowing he was almost
always conducting experiments,

325
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,456
I thought it rather odd.

326
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:27,628
So that means he must have
had another secret lab
somewhere, right?

327
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,263
Yes, and whatever he was
keeping locked up in there

328
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,066
somehow found a way to escape
after he was gone.

329
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,001
It could also be
an unknown third party

330
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,504
stole his Imperial Arms
to make the monsters,

331
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,240
but then again the attacks
seem so random.

332
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,076
I guess it's possible the doctor
stumbled upon the enemy

333
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,345
while he was out
looking for Tatsumi.

334
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,413
He found their hideout
and tried to capture them

335
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,415
and turn them into
his test subjects,

336
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:54,120
only to have the tables turned
and be killed by them instead.

337
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,757
I'm beginning to think that he
may have been more insane

338
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,892
than I ever thought he was.

339
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:02,228
If the doctor really was the one
who created those Danger Beasts,

340
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,565
then there should only be
a limited number.

341
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:07,834
Eventually, the problem
should resolve itself.

342
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,704
[ESDEATH]
There's more to this than how
many we're dealing with.
[RUN] (huh?)

343
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:15,241
[ESDEATH] For starters, were
those monsters truly capable
of escaping on their own?

344
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,512
Or should we assume that
somebody WANTED to
set them free?

345
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,146
(ah!)

346
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,684
[RUN]
Understood. I will continue
to evaluate the situation

347
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,218
as thoroughly as possible.

348
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,553
[ESDEATH] I'm counting on you.

349
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,123
We don't know exactly how
serious this is yet.

350
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,758
All that aside...

351
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:35,261
It's unusual to see you stopping
to admire the flowers like this.

352
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,764
[ESDEATH] Hm? Oh, these?

353
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:41,467
Well, when you rub these
particular flowers into
an open wound,

354
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,070
they cause excruciating pain.
[screams of agony]

355
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,372
I use them in light torture.

356
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:52,546
[RUN]
I'll be sure to remember that.

357
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:55,415
How dare you terrorize the good
people of this land?!
[snarls & growls]

358
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,017
Koro, Phase One!

359
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,451
Woof! (growl)

360
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,557
Purifying Ball of Justice!

361
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:07,928
Koro! They should be all nice
and tender and ready to eat!
[KORO] (growl)

362
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,063
[wet munching sounds]

363
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:15,702
[SYURA]
That's one of those Jaegers
everybody's talking about.

364
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,739
Living up to their reputation.
[SERYU] Aww, who's a good boy?
You're good boy!

365
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,541
[SYURA] (evil chuckle)

366
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:24,711
I think I'll play with my toys
just a bit longer.

367
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,483
Man, how did I get paired up
with a dude again?

368
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,587
It's not like we're out here
to get some kissy time,
ya ding dong.

369
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,088
[LUBBOCK]
We should be on the lookout.

370
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,957
There might be
Imperial Soldiers.

371
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,660
Why are you acting so jumpy?

372
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,194
Now, listen here.

373
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,229
It's crucial for an assassin to
be a little bit paranoid.

374
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,665
It helps you stay alert.
[TATSUMI] Uh, ah, hey...

375
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:47,167
Najenda said that herself,
thank you very much.

376
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,302
You might wanna try it, too!

377
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:54,207
Now wait a minute, I've noticed
you doing that before.

378
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,209
Hm? You noticed what?

379
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,411
Everybody else just
calls her "Boss,"

380
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,180
but you always
call her Najenda.

381
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,948
Don't you, Lubb?

382
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:06,520
[LUBBOCK]
Uh... Uh, yeah, I guess I do.

383
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,722
She and I go way back,

384
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:11,825
all the way back to when she was
fighting in the Imperial Army.

385
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:18,632
[LUBBOCK] I was the fourth son
of a rich merchant who lived
in the countryside.

386
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:22,135
I mean I had all I ever wanted
when I was a kid.

387
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,403
I was the best at
everything I did,

388
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:26,272
so the world seemed
really boring.

389
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,341
Wow, Lubb, sounds to me like
you really had it rough.

390
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,912
[LUBBOCK] It's gonna be a
tearjerker, okay, so shut up!

391
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,980
[LUBBOCK] So one day, Najenda
ends up getting assigned

392
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,682
to the town where I live.

393
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,117
(wow...)

394
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,186
It was love at first sight.

395
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,625
So, of course,
I decided to join the army.

396
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:48,629
I did whatever it took to climb
the ranks and get closer to her.

397
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,332
So if you used to be
in the army,

398
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,300
then what are you doing
in Night Raid?

399
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,970
Everything I've done
is to be with her...

400
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,739
With Najenda.

401
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,942
When she left the Empire,
I forged my records
to say I was dead

402
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,144
so I could go with her.

403
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,679
Pretty awesome of me.

404
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,180
Don't you think so?

405
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,850
Well anyway,
she doesn't feel the same.

406
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,451
It's unrequited love.

407
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:14,487
Told you it was gonna
be a tearjerker.

408
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,156
Lubb, awww.

409
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,691
But if you wanna win her love,

410
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,526
you have to stop looking at
other girls in the hot spring!

411
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,095
WHAAAT?! Checking out hot chicks
and being in love

412
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,429
are two totally
different things!

413
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,898
What's the hell's
wrong with you?!

414
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,466
[TATSUMI] See, that's why
she doesn't love you back!

415
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,101
[LUBBOCK] You don't know!

416
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,771
Just you wait, she's gonna
come around one day.

417
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,273
If that ever happens, I'll treat
you to anything you want.

418
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,608
[LUBBOCK]
I look forward to it.

419
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,076
[TATSUMI]
Anyway, I still haven't seen

420
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,778
any Danger Beasts around here.

421
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:40,146
Do you think maybe there
aren't any left up here
on the mountain?

422
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,615
[LUBBOCK] I set some tripwires,

423
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,217
but it doesn't look like
anything's tripped 'em so far.

424
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,418
[TATSUMI] All right...

425
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,153
Well, if we're sure
this area's okay,

426
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,389
then I guess I should
probably take a look
at the peak real quick.

427
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,457
Remember if you see anything,
just run.

428
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:52,993
We can fight it together.

429
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,629
[TATSUMI] Sure thing!
[swoosh!]

430
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,408
[TATSUMI]
Nothing really stands out.

431
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,544
I don't even see any animals.

432
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,553
Even Danger Beasts have to go to
sleep sometime, huh?

433
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,460
[ESDEATH]
I know that technically
I'm out here on night patrol,

434
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,531
but I can't help notice how
beautiful it is tonight.

435
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:34,200
This kind of frivolous nonsense
normally doesn't suit me.

436
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,171
Oh, Tatsumi,
I'm just not myself lately.

437
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,441
And I have you to blame,
my love.

438
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,979
Is that a Danger Beast
down there?

439
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,313
[happy chuckle]

440
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,850
If so, it has terrible luck.

441
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,487
And here I was, starting to
feel sorry for myself.

442
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,189
[ka‐boom!]
[TATSUMI] (ungh)

443
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,791
What the‐

444
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,695
Tonight isn't your night.

445
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,998
I've got a new form of torture
I've been‐ (gasps)

446
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:09,002
[ESDEATH] Tatsumi?!

447
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,573
[TATSUMI] What's Esdeath doing
here?! This is crazy.

448
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,942
How am I supposed to know
if she's gonna fall
right out of the sky?!

449
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,812
What do I do, what do I do,
what do I do, what do I do?!

450
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,517
[sinister snarls]

451
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,419
Great, this is NOT
what I need right now!

452
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,454
No wait, they look pretty tough.

453
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,557
Maybe I can run away
and leave this to her!

454
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:31,958
[schnick!]

455
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,030
Then again, maybe not.

456
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,299
There goes that idea.

457
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,735
[snarling]

458
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:47,708
[ESDEATH] You are in my way.

459
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,243
[TATSUMI] (urk!)

460
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,012
Is this some sort of dream?

461
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:55,916
I've been waiting so long
for the moment we could
meet again, Tatsumi!

462
00:21:55,974 --> 00:22:00,278
[TATSUMI] Nope, unfortunately
this is not a dream.

463
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:04,448
So uh, is she gonna finish
that thing off or what?
