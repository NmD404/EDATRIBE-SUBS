00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:06,466
[GEBAZE]
Livestock... livestock...
livestock...

2
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:10,000
All those stupid, miserable
faces, are priceless!

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,333
A herd of sheep
to fill my coffers!

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,700
I do believe their taxes make
my wine taste even more sweet!

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,900
[CHELSEA] Hello, Master.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,166
Good afternoon.

7
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:25,400
[GEBAZE]
Ooh! Hope you're ready, my dear.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,600
I'll need a nice,
long full‐body rub today.
(urk)

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,600
Mission successful.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,133
So what kind of massage
did you have in mind?

11
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:38,533
[running footsteps]

12
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:39,600
We're the Jaegers, sir!

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,700
We're here to protect you.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,633
We need to search the mansion.

15
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:45,466
[KUROME] Look at this.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,966
We were too late.

17
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,400
[CHELSEA]
I don't what happened,

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,866
but we must've had a leak
somewhere down the line.

19
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,766
The Jaegers walked in on me.

20
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,666
I'm amazed you
made it out safely.

21
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,566
Those guys are a real threat.

22
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,233
[CHELSEA] He had a few cats,

23
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:03,200
so turned into one and just
acted casual 'til they left.
(phmeow)

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,166
So I guess your Imperial Arms
DOES have its uses then.

25
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,733
I'm not sure how I would've
gotten out of a pinch like that.

26
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,500
It's harder for you now, since
they know what you look like.

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,066
Feel free to leave missions
like that to me
from now on, okay?

28
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,333
(huh?) Wow, thanks, Chelsea.

29
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:18,933
Well, while I'm out
saving the day,

30
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,533
you be sure to
guard the house...

31
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:21,833
like a puppy.

32
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,366
(waaahhh!)

33
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,366
Just when you're being nice,
you turn into a piece of crap!

34
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:27,766
Oh my god, I hate you!
[CHELSEA] (laughing)

35
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:31,200
[TATSUMI] Yeah, I remember
when Mine used to say
the same kinda shit to me.

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Well, based on what happened,

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,733
it would seem the Jaegers might
be starting to hone in on us.

38
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,533
Well, now that they've run out
of Danger Beasts to hunt,

39
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:42,000
maybe Night Raid is the last
group of enemies they have
left to fight.

40
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,000
But since Tatsumi decided to
take an island vacation
with their leader,

41
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,766
maybe they'll decide
to go easy on us!

42
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:49,333
(sphhhttt!)

43
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,200
Leave me alone! I was sent there
against my will, remember?!

44
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,533
Sure, you were just alone in
paradise with a beautiful woman.

45
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,933
It's not like I'm totally
jealous of you or anything.

46
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,400
You coulda just left her there.

47
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,466
I mean she is the most dangerous
killer in the Empire.

48
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:05,133
Boy, am I glad that wasn't me.
Whoo, I sure am lucky.

49
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:06,200
LUCKY, LUCKY ME!

50
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,700
Don't hurt yourself there, Lubb.

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,100
C'mere, Tatsumi, just forget
all about that nasty lady!

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,500
[TATSUMI] Squishy squishy...

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,433
[NAJENDA] Esdeath was always
a resilient one.

54
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,000
Even if you'd left her,
she would've found a way back.

55
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,266
So forget about
owing her any favors,

56
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,233
because when you go up
against her in combat,

57
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,766
I expect you to do so
with all you've got.

58
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:27,466
Did you say "always"?

59
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,533
Hold on, Boss,
how old ARE you anyway?

60
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,900
In my mid‐twenties,
if you must know.
[LUBBOCK] (uh... uh...)

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,833
Esdeath is actually
a bit younger.

62
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,966
No way! You're only in
your mid‐twenties?!

63
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,200
I thought you were way older!

64
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,766
(grrr...)
[slaps & thumps in background]

65
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:44,400
Tatsumi, you should know better
than to ask a woman how
old she is.

66
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,700
It's rude.

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,433
[squeaky] Yeah, but when you
talked about Sis being fat,

68
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,966
how come you didn't get
your face smashed in?

69
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:52,166
Hm? What are you talking about?

70
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,866
Food's ready, everyone.

71
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,666
[AKAME] (ah!)
[TATSUMI] Ow!

72
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:58,566
[ALL] (pleased, happy sounds)

73
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,333
[NAJENDA] I know it's sudden,
but let's have a strategy
meeting after we eat.

74
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,266
It's time to move out.
The Revolution is finally here.

75
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:09,633
We're ready to take the first
step towards overthrowing this
corrupt government,

76
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,566
once and for all!

77
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,266
Look, we are not with
Night Raid, I swear!

78
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,966
I promise, we only stole
what we needed to eat!

79
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,500
We would never kill anyone!

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,533
[SERYU] So you admit
that you were stealing.

81
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm afraid once you've been
tainted, you must be
slaughtered.

82
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,666
[KORO] (deep throated growl)

83
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:05,166
Koro, snack time.

84
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,600
(roar)
[THIEVES] (screams)

85
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,933
Wait, please listen to me!

86
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,366
I never wanted to take anything,

87
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,533
but they threatened to kill me
if I didn't help them!

88
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:13,733
You gotta believe me!

89
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,800
Please just give me a fair
trial, I'm begging you!

90
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,400
[SERYU]
And yet you helped them anyway.
A crime is still a crime.

91
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,566
Well, there's no reason for my
commander to concern
herself with you.

92
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,133
I will punish you myself
for your poor judgement!
[KORO] (growl)

93
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,200
[SERYU] Justice be served!

94
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,033
[WAVE] Seryu! There you are!

95
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:40,933
So, what happened to the
thieves you found?

96
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,800
Don't worry, Wave.
I took care of it.

97
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,400
[WAVE] (huh?)

98
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,300
[WAVE] Stop. You just...

99
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,366
executed them, didn't you?

100
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,800
Listen, just because the Jaegers
have special jurisdiction,

101
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,400
it doesn't mean we can
go around murdering people
whenever we wa‐

102
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,000
They weren't Night Raid,
but they were admitted
criminals,

103
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,866
so I removed them from the
population.

104
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:02,366
Justice was served.

105
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:05,300
Let's keep working. There's
still so much evil to purge.

106
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,133
(ah!)

107
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,966
[SERYU] C'mon, Koro.

108
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,766
[WAVE] Seryu...

109
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:14,266
I won't pretend
this is a pretty job,

110
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:18,066
but I never knew the imperial
capital was this twisted.

111
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,733
This is seriously messed up.

112
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,233
But I must repay
my debt of honor!

113
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,366
All I can do is fulfill
my duty as a soldier.

114
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:32,033
[NAJENDA] The Revolutionary Army
is rising up!

115
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,300
As such, I would like to take
this opportunity

116
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,233
to explain our first
order of business.

117
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,766
I assume you're all familiar
with the popular religion

118
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,766
among citizens known as
Path of Peace?

119
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:44,066
They're the one's who believe
a person's good deeds

120
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,433
determine their happiness
and longevity of life.

121
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, yeah! They used to practice
that religion in my village!

122
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,066
In fact, the day I left
for the capital,

123
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,533
the mayor even gave me
a statue of their god.

124
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,266
In the past ten years,

125
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:57,966
more and more people
have been joining.

126
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:01,133
Its influence is quite high
in the eastern part
of the capital.

127
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,900
We have reason to believe that
they're taking up arms.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,500
They're looking to launch
a religious rebellion!
[ALL] (huh?)

129
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,733
The plan is for us to use that
to our fullest advantage.

130
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,633
Hey now, wait just a second!

131
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,733
Don't you understand
how many people could die

132
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,466
if there's a religious
rebellion?!

133
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,833
Shouldn't we try to stifle it
or something?!

134
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:22,733
The capital's let its backwards
government push the people
over the edge.

135
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,333
(exhales) Even if we managed
to stop the rebellion,

136
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:29,700
then the angry masses would
simply explode somewhere else.

137
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,433
This forsaken empire's already
living out its last days.

138
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:37,633
Finally.
[TATSUMI]
Do you really think so? (grrr)

139
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,933
You should've at least
let her finish before
you threw a tantrum.

140
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,633
Just think back to
that story we told you

141
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,500
about the rebel tribe and
the hero from the north.

142
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
[TATSUMI] (huh?)

143
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,833
[TATSUMI] Didn't Esdeath put
a stop to both of those though?

144
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:53,733
[LUBBOCK] They failed because
they tried to confront the
empire by themselves.

145
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,866
The powers that be
are pretty capable.

146
00:07:56,966 --> 00:08:00,500
Give 'em a little time,
and they'll snuff out the
Path of Peace rebellion too.

147
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,033
And when they do it,
it won't be pretty.

148
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,900
And that's where the
Revolutionary Army comes in.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,833
We're allied with
a tribe in the west

150
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,233
that's set to begin
their invasion

151
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,400
the moment the religious
uprising starts to move.

152
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,833
When they do, the empire will
be forced to defend itself

153
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,533
on both sides of the border.

154
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,866
But that won't be enough
to bring it down.

155
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,500
So for the finishing blow,

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,033
the Revolutionary Army will
stage a riot in the south.

157
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,066
As soon as we march
into the capital,

158
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,500
we'll bring the empire
to its knees.

159
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,466
Now I get it.

160
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,300
We're planning a
three‐way offensive.

161
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,366
The empire has a long history
of underestimating us.

162
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,166
And now, they're grateful
to the Revolution

163
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:41,966
for gathering all the people
who oppose them into one place.

164
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:45,766
The Revolutionary Army's
stronghold is located
at the empire's border.

165
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:48,300
They'll have to break through a
lot of checkpoints along the way

166
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,266
to get to the Imperial Castle.

167
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,766
Lucky for us,
we're already in secret talks

168
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,833
with several of the
castle viceroys.

169
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:59,966
Many of them used to work
diligently at Central only to
wind up getting relegated.

170
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,233
So they were happy to cooperate.

171
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,900
It should be quite a sight!

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,300
Our forces will storm
the capital and claim
castle after castle

173
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,466
without spilling
an ounce of blood.

174
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,633
Of course, the empire will
probably respond

175
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:16,000
by sending their trump cards:
Great General Budo and
the Royal Guards.

176
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,166
But that'll drain
the palace defenses,

177
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,633
which works in our favor.

178
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:20,966
Making it the perfect time

179
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:24,333
to assassinate the
source of all this.

180
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,666
We'll charge into the
Imperial Palace head‐on,

181
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,966
and we'll kill the minister!

182
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,800
Rip the empire apart
from the inside!

183
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,933
The minister's pretty slick,
so I'm sure he'll try
to sneak away

184
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:34,966
at the very last second.

185
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:36,433
[LEONE] Not if I can help it!

186
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,666
This is his mess.

187
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:40,766
And I'll make sure he pays
for it with his face.

188
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,266
We do have debts to pay.

189
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:44,466
We promised the western tribe
we would return their land

190
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:46,766
in exchange for
their assistance.

191
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:48,166
"Return"?

192
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,233
[MINE] Some parts of the
empire's western territory

193
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,566
were originally owned
by foreign tribes.

194
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,033
I know how desperately
they must want that land back.

195
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:58,400
[TATSUMI] Oh yeah, I forgot.

196
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,833
Half of Mine's blood comes
from a western tribe.

197
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,000
[NAJENDA] After the empire falls
and its laws are abolished,

198
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
the people's anger will subside.

199
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,800
And the quicker we can overthrow
the imperial capital,

200
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,900
the less blood
will have to be spilt.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
Is that all right with you,
Tatsumi?

202
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,800
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry I interrupted you.

203
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,433
Now then...

204
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,866
You should know there's just one
problem with the Path of Peace,

205
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,666
and it's a pretty big one.

206
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:26,400
[quiet chanting]

207
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,566
[NAJENDA] A man named Bolic
serves as the assistant

208
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,233
to the charismatic figure
they call their lord.

209
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,666
However, he's actually a spy
sent by the minister.

210
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:38,366
Bolic seeks to take control from
the religion's founder

211
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:41,833
and prevent the church from
rebelling against the empire.

212
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,666
So here's what I'd
like you to do.

213
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:47,633
Sneak into the Path of Peace
headquarters and kill Bolic.

214
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:52,300
He's also been secretly drugging
his followers through their
food, a little at a time,

215
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,533
getting them addicted and
making them into his slaves.

216
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,266
DON'T go easy on him.

217
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,933
So that bastard gets to hop
around from one hot girl
to the next!

218
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,366
And slipping things into
someone's meal

219
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:04,333
is an unspeakable insult
to the food!

220
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,166
[BOTH] This guy is going down!

221
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:10,033
Nice enthusiasm, but I think it
might be a little misplaced.

222
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,366
If we don't do something soon,

223
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:14,166
he's gonna keep drugging
more and more people.

224
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,933
We need to finish this fast.

225
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:18,300
We can't forget about
the Jaegers either.

226
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,466
As long as they have
Esdeath calling the shots,

227
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:23,266
they might as well be the
minister's own private army.

228
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,300
We should eliminate them first.

229
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,266
That way we can be sure the
mission runs smoothly.
[All] (uh‐huh)

230
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:32,366
Right now, the Jaegers are doing
everything in their power
to get their hands on us.

231
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:34,766
So we need to draw them
out of the capital...

232
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,433
and strike them all down!

233
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:40,233
[MINE]
Sounds fun! Let's hit those
jerk‐wads with all we've got!

234
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,466
[NAJENDA] If the opportunity
presents itself,

235
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:46,133
HQ specifically wants us
to kill Bols and Kurome.

236
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,566
You should be able to fight
people you're familiar with,

237
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,300
right, Tatsumi?

238
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,433
Wave was a good guy, and he's
not one of our targets,

239
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,733
so it's not like I have
a reason to hurt him.

240
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,300
But if I know Wave,
he'll do anything

241
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,300
to protect the rest of his team.

242
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,233
So I'll probably have
to face him anyway.

243
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,600
Above all else, I'm an assassin.

244
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,300
I chose this for myself,

245
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,533
and I knew exactly what I was
getting into when I
decided to join.

246
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,066
I'll do what must be done.

247
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,466
I will complete this mission,

248
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,666
even if I have to kill someone
who's not a target!

249
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,433
I won't hold back!

250
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:22,333
Good!

251
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:25,500
[CHELSEA] I can feel the resolve
in those eyes of his.

252
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,866
Hopefully, he won't get all
sympathetic for the enemy

253
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:30,000
and get himself killed.

254
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,333
Wait, what?

255
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:36,633
Why am I always troubling
myself with Tatsumi?

256
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,800
It's like,
[LUBBOCK]
You think you're so cool!

257
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,333
I can't help but
worry about him.
[LUBBOCK] Did you remember
to zip your pants?

258
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,166
[TATSUMI]
Yeah, take a look and tell me.

259
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,066
[RUN] Commander.

260
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,866
Two unidentified women have been
spotted on the Highroad.

261
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:59,000
We have reason to suspect
they're Akame and Mine
from Night Raid.

262
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:07,033
[ESDEATH]
Gather the Jaegers immediately.

263
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,800
[NARRATOR] All people
must one day turn to ash,

264
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,633
so too must nations
fall to ruin.

265
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,666
There are those who seek
to create a new world,

266
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:19,100
and those who wish to protect
the world they know.

267
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,066
With opposing ideals
and philosophies,

268
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,466
the two forces are drawn by fate

269
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:27,833
to their inevitable
confrontation.

270
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,266
With deadly armaments
in their hands

271
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:32,966
and determination
in their hearts,

272
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:36,600
they march toward
their final battle.

273
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,266
[chains rattling]

274
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,200
[SPY 1] It's the Jaegers.

275
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,666
All six of them, headed east.

276
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:59,166
[SPY 2] Everything's exactly
as Najenda planned.

277
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:00,833
[SPY 1]
All right, marg falcon,

278
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,500
get this information
to Night Raid.

279
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,233
[SPY 2] Go.
[screech]

280
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,566
[SPY 2] So the plan is to
murder a leader of the church

281
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,266
and challenge the Jaegers.

282
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:12,333
They're gonna need all
the luck they can get.

283
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,900
[SPY 1]
I hope you survive, Night Raid!

284
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,233
We need you.

285
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,233
We need you to help set this
world right again.

286
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,300
[NAJENDA] Six of them, huh?

287
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,566
That means they've sent out
the whole team.

288
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,400
Considering how fast
Esdeath tends to move,

289
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,566
even if she has to ask around
a little to find out
where we are,

290
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,333
I bet she'll be here
by tomorrow afternoon.

291
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,000
[screech]

292
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,433
[NAJENDA] All set.

293
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:42,600
I've just received word from
the revolutionary spies.

294
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,000
As I said before,

295
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,466
try to casually draw attention
to yourselves today.

296
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,066
[BOTH] Roger that.

297
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:53,466
Aww, yeah! I can't believe
we get to watch the girls
[giggling & splashing]

298
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:55,800
bounce around in bikinis!
(pervy laugh)

299
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,233
Can you control yourself?

300
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,200
Try to focus, dude.
This is all part of the mission.

301
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,833
What?! Are you crazy?!
Or impotent?!

302
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:02,933
Neither jackass!

303
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,133
[LEONE] Tatsumi!

304
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,166
We'd like your opinion
about something.

305
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,366
Do you like my suimsuit or
Chelsea's better?

306
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,933
Ooh, careful
how you answer that!

307
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:11,800
[TATSUMI] (uuuhhh...)

308
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,966
So? Which is it?

309
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,300
Uh, let's see, I, uh...

310
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,066
Would ya look at that,
Su's here!

311
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,400
How ya doin' there, buddy?!

312
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,600
[LEONE]
Aww, he dodged the question.

313
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,733
Why didn't you ask me? I would
have given you an honest,

314
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,533
non‐biased critique and said
BOTH are amazing and beautiful,

315
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,800
and I wanna just touch 'em
and squeeze 'em forever!

316
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,233
Why didn't you ask me?! (urk)

317
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,400
'Cause we already knew what you
would say, dumbass!

318
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,100
She's right. It means nothing
coming from you! Sorry.

319
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,300
[LUBBOCK]
What's that supposed to mean?!

320
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,333
Why does Tatsumi
get all the action?

321
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,300
WHY?!
[LEONE] Why do you think?!

322
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,966
Great, the rest of the team is
having the time of their lives

323
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,700
down there on the beach.

324
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,333
Ah, man, this is bullcrap.

325
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:50,033
How come they get
to have all the fun?

326
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,833
Are you doing okay, Akame?

327
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:55,066
Oh, I'm fine.

328
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:01,300
Guess you're probably thinking
about your sister, aren't you?

329
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,566
[AKAME] Yeah.

330
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,200
I know she'll be coming after me
sooner or later,

331
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,200
so my thoughts are all over
the place right now.

332
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:19,066
I...

333
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,900
Uh, Mine?

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,600
Once your sister is gone,

335
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,200
you'll need to find a way to
remember that you're not alone.

336
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,800
Okay?

337
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,333
You still have us, you know.

338
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,666
You should be grateful for that.

339
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
[AKAME] Thanks.

340
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,233
[ESDEATH]
Najenda is still heading east,

341
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,133
and Akame went to the south.

342
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,366
We have witnesses who testify
that the two of them came
to town together

343
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:46,400
but left separately.
[SERYU] Hey, this is my snack!
You can have a little treat
later.

344
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,400
[BOLS] If they're going east,
they'll reach

345
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,033
the Path of Peace
headquarters in Kyoroku.

346
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,800
If they go south,
they'll be in a city

347
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,933
that supports the
Revolutionary Army.

348
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,866
Either way,
it's very suspicious.

349
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,266
We can cut them off
if we move quickly.

350
00:16:59,366 --> 00:16:59,933
Let's go!

351
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,333
Not so fast, Wave.

352
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:03,866
Night Raid is well‐known
around the capital.

353
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,733
And they're fully aware
of the wanted posters
around the city.

354
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,100
Our guards have been able
to track them ever since
they showed up.

355
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,933
So, why exactly would they
allow themselves to be seen?

356
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,400
It feels too easy.

357
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,800
Right. That's why I think
it's probably a trap.

358
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,533
They must have
wanted us to see them.

359
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,500
[SERYU] They were trying to get
us out of the castle

360
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,266
so they could defeat us.

361
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:26,966
[ESDEATH]
That's the way Najenda fights,

362
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:29,366
with a cool head
and a burning heart.

363
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,666
Are you saying it's too
dangerous to follow her?

364
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:33,900
Oh, no, she's not getting away.

365
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,300
After playing it safe and
hiding for so long,

366
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,233
Night Raid has finally decided
to come out into the open.

367
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,233
I don't care if it IS a trap.

368
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,966
We'll destroy the trap too!

369
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:45,500
Seryu, Run,
you help me locate Najenda.

370
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,500
Kurome, Wave, and Bols,
go find Akame.

371
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,066
(excited chuckle)

372
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,166
[ESDEATH] Always be aware
of your surroundings.

373
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:54,800
If you feel there are too
many of them lying in wait,

374
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,566
you are free to retreat.

375
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,466
Fight hard, but don't resort
to suicide attacks.

376
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:03,000
These are the last threats
to the capital.

377
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,600
Trap them in a corner
and finish them off!

378
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,233
[ALL] Roger that!

379
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,366
[hoofbeats]

380
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:13,500
[BOLS] We're about to face
the toughest criminals
in the capital.

381
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,700
Do you think I'll
match up against them?

382
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,300
Yeah, you'll be okay!

383
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,100
I already fought against
a member of Night Raid
once before.

384
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,233
For some reason,
he wouldn't fight back.

385
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,933
But I still got the impression
we were pretty much evenly
matched.

386
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:28,433
I'm sure we can win
if we work together!

387
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:31,700
Luckily your weapon is good
for fighting multiple people
at once.

388
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
You're gonna be a big help.

389
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,200
[BOLS] I sure hope so.

390
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,233
You're really sweet and
all for saying that, Wave,

391
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,933
but you're probably the most
worthless member of the group.

392
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,833
[WAVE]
What?! Are you trying to tell me

393
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,266
you don't think I have
what it takes?!

394
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:46,100
Seems pretty obvious.
You won't last five minutes.

395
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,800
Well, you've obviously never
seen me use my Imperial Arms!

396
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,266
Why don't you
show it to me, then!

397
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:51,900
Oooh, NOW you're asking for it!

398
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,766
[KUROME] So let's see it!
[BOLS]
Please don't argue, you guys.

399
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,766
[WAVE] Hey, look.
What the heck is that?

400
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:00,466
[KUROME] Some sorta scarecrow?

401
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:01,600
[BOLS] I think so.

402
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,900
Once again, very suspicious.

403
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,766
Something isn't right here.
[horses whinnying]

404
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:08,100
[WAVE] Okay, guys,
keep your eyes open.

405
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,500
[MINE] Targets in sight.
I only see three.

406
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,133
Esdeath must have split
the team in half.

407
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:21,133
I guess she couldn't resist
going after the boss.

408
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,266
The plan seems to be working.

409
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,933
(ah!)

410
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,133
She looks so much like Akame.

411
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,900
You can tell they're related.

412
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Which is exactly why Akame
shouldn't be the one
to kill her.

413
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,166
All I need...

414
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:39,966
is one clean shot.

415
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,733
[gunshot]

416
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,600
[explosion]

417
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,333
She dodged that?!

418
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:52,566
That kind of speed
isn't even possible!

419
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,333
[KUROME] (grrr)

420
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,400
Look out!

421
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,600
(waaahhh!)
[SUSANOO] (kyah!)

422
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,866
[BOLS] Wave?!

423
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:05,266
[NAJENDA] Well, the sniper
may have missed,

424
00:20:05,366 --> 00:20:07,466
but at least we got rid
of one of you.

425
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:11,866
Oddly enough, that poor
unfortunate fellow wasn't
even on our hit list.

426
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,066
[BOLS] Night Raid?

427
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,366
And the entire team
is together?!

428
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:17,600
So the other group was a decoy.

429
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,133
[NAJENDA] Kurome and Bols...

430
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:22,433
You have been selected as prime
targets among the Jaegers.

431
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,933
Get ready to die!

432
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:25,466
[BOLS] Targets?

433
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:28,466
I've burned countless
people alive,
[screams of anguish]

434
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:32,133
so I always knew a reckoning
would come for me one day.

435
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,066
However...

436
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,033
I cannot allow myself to die.

437
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,366
Big Sister!

438
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:44,433
Hello, Kurome.

439
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:47,766
I've been dying to see
you again! How nice!

440
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,533
If I kill you myself,

441
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:54,333
then I can add you to
Yatsufusa's collection.

442
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,333
Now wouldn't that be
just wonderful?

443
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,366
[electrical crackling]

444
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,733
[rumbling]

445
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:15,533
[TATSUMI] Is this an earthquake?

446
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:16,533
[rocks falling]

447
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:19,366
I've improved a lot
since last we met.

448
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:22,633
Now I can command
any corpse I choose.

449
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,833
[thmp!]

450
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,133
Pretty neat, right?

451
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,100
[low growl]

452
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,766
[ALL] (gasps)

453
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:36,200
I mean, look at this.

454
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,533
I can even control S‐Class
Danger Beast Desta Ghoul.

455
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:43,100
[NAJENDA] I took a gamble
on whether Esdeath would
split up her party.

456
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,233
Now I see why she did.
If she's using Yatsufusa,

457
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,400
it'll take more than a little
trap to throw her off.

458
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,400
How fun...

459
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,533
a battle between Imperial Arms.

460
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:53,633
(grunt)

461
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,366
(grrr)

462
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:57,433
(ump)

463
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:02,266
[KUROME] How many do you
think will die? (giggles)
