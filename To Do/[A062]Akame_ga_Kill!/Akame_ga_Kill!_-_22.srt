1
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:12,866
But why? Why would you allow
them to die just to save me?

2
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,900
[NAJENDA]
Get over yourself.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,166
Huh?

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,200
If we hadn't stopped
that execution

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,533
it would've seriously damaged
the Revolutionary Army's morale.

6
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,866
Besides, everyone participated
of their own free will.

7
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:26,666
Yeah, well that's
not the point.

8
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:28,000
[Blow]

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,600
Furthermore...
we managed to eliminate

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,166
a long‐standing obstacle when
we killed Great General Budo.

11
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,033
We've gained a lot
from this mission.

12
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,933
Uh! Is that all that
matters to you?!

13
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:40,833
Tatsumi, you do realize this
whole thing's been hard
on the Boss too, right?

14
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,666
She lost Susanoo.

15
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,166
[Blow]
These things happen.

16
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:47,166
It was doing its job as
a weapon, that's all.

17
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:49,933
Poor Su.

18
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:52,433
As the living it is
our responsibility

19
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:55,366
to carry out the wishes
of the ones who are gone.

20
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:57,166
[TATSUMI]
I don't know if I can.

21
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,066
It may be heavy,
but it's a burden

22
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,866
that none of us have
the right to abandon.

23
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:03,200
Akame...

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,500
In other words,
if we quit now...

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,633
then all the dead will
have died for nothing!

26
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:12,066
Yeah, you're right!

27
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:16,233
I guess somebody has to put
an end to all this sadness.

28
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:29,766
[NAJENDA]
<i>In order to use his trump card,</i>
<i>Susanoo needed to take my life.</i>

29
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,600
<i>But I'm still here...</i>

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,933
<i>Susanoo, did you burn through</i>
<i>your own life energy</i>

31
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:38,266

Lemme go!

43
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,966
Keep up this rebellious crap

44
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,633
and I'll put you under arrest!

45
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,766
This place is a joke;
can't you see it's
falling apart around us!

46
00:03:58,866 --> 00:03:59,766
[Guard]
What was that?!

47
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,400
No! Don't!

48
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,466
Hm...

49
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,666
[WAVE]
Hmph!

50
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,200
How much longer do we
have to put up with this?!

51
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,866
It'll be over soon.

52
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:10,600
The Empire's
on its way down.

53
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,800
Most of the people we were
supposed to protect

54
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
are now siding
with the Revolution.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,833
Is there still a place
for us here anymore?

56
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,633
Try to stay calm.

57
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:23,600
The chaos probably won't stop
even after the revolution.

58
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,000
And when the time comes,

59
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,700
the people are going
to need our help.

60
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,766
It kinda sounds like you
knew this would happen.

61
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,833
Well, it came a little
earlier than I thought
it would.

62
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:34,000
Huh?

63
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,266
I was desperately
hoping for reform.

64
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,833
That's why I joined
the Jaegers,

65
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,700
to try to make a difference in
this nation from the inside.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,233
To make a difference?

67
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,666
This Empire has
become corrupt.

68
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:48,066
That said, I think this kind of
rebellion is unacceptable.

69
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,200
So you chose to work
under General Esdeath.

70
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,200
Yes.

71
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,300
I actually find her
quite fascinating.

72
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
You are a strange guy
y'know that.

73
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,133
Hm... I get that a lot.

74
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,533
Y'know my initial
intention for joining

75
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,500
was to rise up in the ranks,
but I got sidetracked.

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,333
Because I've enjoyed my time
with everyone here so much.

77
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:13,333
Speaking of which, Kurome,
what are you planning on doing?

78
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:16,133
Since you've got
one foot in the grave.

79
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,833
Huh? Wait a minute,

80
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,500
how did you find out
about Kurome?!

81
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:23,217
You shouldn't be
all that surprised, Wave.

82
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:25,883
It's obvious by the way
you've been acting.

83
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:28,617
Ah!

84
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:31,383
At this point,
you could probably be
free from the Jaegers

85
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:33,917
without becoming a
target, yourself.

86
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:35,617
Be free?

87
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:37,050
Yes.

88
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,217
I don't have any need for
a brief taste of freedom.

89
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:43,950
There's only one thing
I care about in this world.

90
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:46,917
Aah!

91
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:48,383
Ugh!
Aah!

92
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:51,050
Now this is the kind of battle
I enjoy the most!

93
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,783
If any of you neophytes are
unsatisfied with your destiny,

94
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:56,983
I invite you to put me
in my place!

95
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,583
You can go to Hell!

96
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:01,917
As soon as you're dead this
corrupt nation is finished!

[ESDEATH]
Oh, an Imperial Arms?

98
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:05,983
How cute.

99
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,683
Aah!

100
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,550
Is there not a single one
of you who can challenge me?

[MESSENGER]
The Imperial Capital is almost
completely surrounded now!

109

What the hell is
going on out there?!

110
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,917
Not even General Esdeath
is capable of leading an army

at the same time!

[Footsteps]
Your Highness!

113
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:53,050
The Empire is crumbling
under our reign...

114
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,850
have we not been good rulers?

There's nothing wrong with
your rule, Your Majesty.

Oh, Minister Honest!

117
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:02,583
You idiots should be
more supportive.

118
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:05,683
They've let their fear
get the best of them.

119
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:11,617
I hate to say it, but I
am painfully aware of your
feelings on this matter.

120
00:07:11,717 --> 00:07:13,350
These men are fools!

you've taken

to keep our land peaceful.

against us.

Please tell me
what we should do!

125
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,417
There comes a time
when a nation's ruler

is called to show his leadership
with an iron fist.

known to your people!

If it was a trap they
wouldn't have waited
this long to come for me.

145
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,317
It's a personal grudge.

146

A grudge?
Then who is it?

147
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,483

settle things between us.

Is this fight really all that
important to you two?

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,483
Mm‐hm.

152
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,383
Akame I'm sure you know
that the lives of

153
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:41,417
thousands of people are
resting on our shoulders!

How can you put this
personal vendetta

over everything else?

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,083
That's exactly why
I have to do this.

No matter what, I can't
ignore Kurome's feelings.

Hm.

your mission is.

Okay fine, but promise me
you'll come back alive.

telling me to do.

thing from you.

00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:01,117
Akame.

176
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,317
Hello Kurome.

177
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:08,183
You wanna snack?

178
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,550
Hm.

179
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,650
You remember this place,
don't you?

180
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,417
This isn't the first time
we've met here.

181
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,017
It's also the place...

182
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:30,317
where you turned
your back on us.

183
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:33,483
Seems like the perfect place
for me to kill you.

184
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,050
It sure takes me back.

185
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,583
No matter what
happened to us,

186
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:40,783
you were always right there
looking out for me.

187
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:43,417
We didn't have anyone
but each other,

188
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,517
and this was the only
place we felt needed.

189
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:50,383
They trained us to be
assassins for the Empire.

190
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,283
We learned to stop uprisings
before they started.

191
00:10:55,383 --> 00:10:59,083
That was the way we were
taught to protect the peace.

192
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:01,883
Under orders,
we learned to kill

193
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:05,083
anyone who might be
a threat to the Empire.

194
00:11:06,617 --> 00:11:11,050
As far as we knew,
we were doing the right thing.

195
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,050
Big Sister! Haha!

196
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:17,083
Kurome.

197
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,383
I missed you.

198
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:24,283
[AKAME]
After being raised in
two different squads,

199
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,750
we finally got the chance
to be together again.

200
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,950
You came as a replacement for
someone who'd been killed.

201
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,283
[KUROME]
After that, the two of us
were inseparable...

202
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:39,283
like we were trying to
make up for all the time
we'd been apart.

203
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,317
We were the ultimate team.

204
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:44,983
Some of our missions
were difficult,

205
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,183
but I made it through
because I had you.

206
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:51,283
If you were with me,
I was happy.

207
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:54,483
But... then...

208
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,683
[Panting]

209
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,983
But then you betrayed the Empire
and joined Night Raid.

210
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:08,617
Why?! I tried so hard
to stop you!

211
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:18,250
Being abandoned
by my own sister
absolutely crushed me.

212
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,083
Every day
since you left,

213
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:22,917
I've been imagining more
and more ways to kill you.

214
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:25,083
Is killing me gonna
solve your problems?

215
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:26,950
There is no solution.

216
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,683
However, if I kill you...

217
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:32,950
then you can be beside me
for all eternity.

218
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,417
[Kurome coughs]

219
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:39,117
[AKAME]
Using an Imperial Arms
is very strenuous.

220
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,917
It must be unbearable
when you're so weak.

221
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:43,417
I can end your suffering.

222
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:49,083
Haha! Sister, it's time for us
to fight... to the death.

223
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,017
[WAVE]
Kurome.

224
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:55,617
[RUN]
I guess she's gone.

225
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:59,550
She needed to take
care of some
unfinished business.

226
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,583
But why would she
leave without saying
anything about it?

227
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:05,950
If she'd said something,
you would have tried
to stop her.

228
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,483
Do you have any idea
where she could've gone?

229
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,650
Maybe a place that's
important to the two of them?

230
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,150
Uh... Ah...

231
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:27,683
Uh...

232
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,783
Why did you have to leave
and betray the squad?

233
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:40,083
Everything would have
been fine between us
if you hadn't run away!

234
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:42,517
I learned a lot
about life from
going on my own.

235
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:46,317
And I realized that we were
never fighting for the
good of the nation!

236
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:49,117
We were only doing
the Empire's dirty work!

237
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:51,617
Murdering people
without question!

238
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:53,017
The way things stand,

239
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:55,717
no good is ever going to
come from this government.

240
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:58,117
It's why I wanted you
to leave with me.

241
00:13:58,217 --> 00:13:59,750
How could you expect
me to do that

242
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,750
when so many others
were forced to die

243
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,283
for the sake of
their missions?!

244
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,483
All that sadness was caused by
the leaders of the Empire!

245
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,817
If we can bring happiness
to people by overthrowing
the leadership,

246
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,517
I know our comrades
would understand!

247
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,383
That's a selfish excuse!

248
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:15,083
[Growls]

249
00:14:16,183 --> 00:14:17,317
Huh?

250
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,950
[Growls]

251
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:28,517
[Roars]

252
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,717
Danger Beast.

253
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:31,317
It must've come
out of hiding

254
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,683
when it sensed
our desire to fight!

255
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:35,017
[Roar]

256
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,783
Kurome!

257
00:14:37,883 --> 00:14:39,150
Ah!

258
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:41,817
Uhh...

259
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:43,450
Natara!

260
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:43,917
[Grunts]

261
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,783
[Growls]

262
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:48,883
You will pay for
hurting my friends!

263
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:50,317
Doya!

264
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:54,483
[Roar]

265
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,817
Uh!

266
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:57,983
No!

267
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,850
[Grunt]
Alright that's it!

268
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,250
I don't have any more
time to waste on you!

269
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,583
[Growl]

270
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:06,217
Aah!

271
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:07,517
Uh!

272
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:08,150
[Growl]

273
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,217
[Gasp]

274
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:15,683
That was really close.
Are you okay?

275
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,283
Akame.

276
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:21,150
Let's go get him.

277
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,250
Hm.

278
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,383
Hyaaa!

279
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:32,417
Hyaaa!

280
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:34,183
[Groan]

281
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,383
[Gas venting]

282
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:37,483
[Groans]

283
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,317
[Roar]

284
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,617
You're done!

285
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,450
[Groans]

286
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,517
[KUROME]
Haha...

287
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:57,250
Looks like you and I
still have what it takes.

288
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,017
The two of us always were
pretty good at this weren't we?

289
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:03,583
You remember don't you,
Big Sister?!

290
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:07,383
[KUROME]
Haha...

291
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:08,583
Ah!

292
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:09,983
Ha!

293
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,283
[Grunt]
Get her!

294
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,650
Uh! I should've known
my pawns couldn't handle it.

295
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,617
This battle... IS OVER!

296
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:37,383
[Explosive impact]

297
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:43,217
[WAVE]
I won't let you hurt Kurome!

298
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:44,217
Wave?!

299
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:46,950
C'mon, Night Raid,
I'm your target now!

300
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:48,550
Ugh!

301
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,683
What the?!

302
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,783
[WAVE]
Move, Tatsumi!

303
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,183
[KUROME]
You move, Wave!

304
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:56,083
Huh?

305
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,417
But you're my teammate;

306
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,783
I can't just walk
away from you!

307
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:01,583
But I want you to.

308
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:03,283
Kurome...

309
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:05,483
What are you doing
here, Tatsumi?!

310
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,383
I came to make sure no one
interferes with your fight.

311
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:09,550
Huh?

312
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,983
Hm.

313
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,850
[WAVE]
Tatsumi, we don't
have time for this!

314
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,350
[TATSUMI]
I wish I could stop them too!

315
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,883
But if I did that,
then they'd never

316
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:18,583
be able to finally sort
this thing out!

317
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:22,150
[WAVE]
Is this how Night Raid assassins
settle their differences?!

318
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,817
I cannot allow it to happen!

319
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,883
[TATSUMI]
This a matter of the heart!

320
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:29,050
Sometimes there are
problems that can only
be solved by yourself...

321
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,983
without any help!

322
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:37,950
[KUROME]
A matter of the heart?

323
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:45,450
[WAVE]
I...

324
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:48,717
[KUROME]
Wave.

325
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,917
Uh...

326
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:55,817
Thank you for coming to help me.

327
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,517
Maybe if things had
gone differently...

328
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:00,117
The two of us could've
been friends or something.

329
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,350
But Kurome...

330
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,350
It's time for us
to finally deal

331
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,450
with all the regret
and pain we've had
for so long.

332
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,017
It's time
to end this.

333
00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:15,150
Are you ready?
Let's go.

334
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:27,683
Kurome...
my little sister.

335
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,117
Mmhmm.

336
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:33,583
You know I've always
loved you, Big Sister.

337
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,217
Ugh!

338
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:48,683
Hyaaa!

339
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:50,650
Hyaaa!

340
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,183
This couldn't be
the only way

341
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,983
for them to resolve
their differences.

342
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:33,550
[Wave crying]

343
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,250
I wasn't able to help her...

344
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,850
I couldn't do
anything to stop it!

345
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,917
You came to look after
my little sister.

346
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:43,950
That's enough.

347
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,017
Uhh...

348
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,917
[WAVE]
No... no...

349
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:55,417
Damn it!

350
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,017
I don't understand.

351
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,317
I don't know why...

352
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,250
why we're even fighting
each other anymore.

353
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,350
If you can't find
a reason to fight

354
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,483
then you shouldn't
be fighting.

355
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,850
Only those who fully
comprehend the
implications of war

356
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,383
can be capable of
bearing arms.

357
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:16,583
Implications?

358
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,617
You'll bear this weight
for the rest of your life.

359
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,950
Aaah...

360
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,717
Uh, Akame!

361
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:40,183
Didn't I tell you
to stay back?

362
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:42,117
Yeah, maybe
during the fight.

363
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:44,617
But you never said anything
about coming to take care of

364
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:46,383
an injured companion,
now did you?

365
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:47,650
Huh?

366
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,450
I've said goodbye to so many
of my friends along the way.

367
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,850
But that's nothing...

368
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,517
compared to all the loss you've
been through your whole life.

369
00:20:58,617 --> 00:21:00,883
I couldn't even begin to
comprehend your pain.

370
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:02,483
Huh!

371
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,417
Akame...

372
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:06,650
you're not gonna lose
any more loved ones.

373
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,250
Ever again.

374
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:21,117
[Akame crying]

375
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:37,950
[MINISTER]
I'm so pleased you
came to this decision!

376
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,050
What a wise ruler you are!

377
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:46,417
Now, open your Imperial Arms
passed down through
generations of royalty!

378
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:49,017
Those insufferable
revolutionaries...

379
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:51,117
as well as the
brainless masses...

380
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:54,450
soon they'll know
your supremacy!

381
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:57,150
This is our Empire.

382
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,050
We must use our powers
to defend this land.

383
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:40,217
