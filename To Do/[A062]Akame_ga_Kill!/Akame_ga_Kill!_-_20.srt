1
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:03,733
[OLDER OFFICER]
Another castle
surrendered without a fight!

2
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:06,900
Cowards. Don't these people
have any loyalty anymore?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
The viceroys of these castles
were relocated to
the countryside

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,533
because their behavior showed
signs of insubordination
against His Majesty.

5
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,466
It comes as no surprise.

6
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:21,100
But Minister, if this continues,
the rebel army will reach
the Imperial‐

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,933
[BUDO]
There's no need to panic.

8
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,600
[OLDER OFFICER]
Great General Budo!

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,100
A general should refrain from
getting involved in politics.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,566
I've lived by those words
for quite some time now.

11
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,233
However I'm finding it a
challenge to keep my mouth shut

12
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,200
when it comes to something
like this, Minister.

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,766
Hohoho...
I'm not sure what to say!

14
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:40,300
I will protect this Empire.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,166
It is a responsibility handed
down through my family line

16
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,066
for the past thousand years.

17
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,366
As such, I will personally
annihilate anyone who dares

18
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,866
to disrupt the peace of
this great nation...

19
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,766
regardless of who
may interfere.

20
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:56,333
[MINISTER]
Admirable! But there's
no reason for concern.

21
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:59,033
Even if the citizens
rise in rebellion,

22
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,366
we have plans in place
to overpower them.

23
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,233
Gentlemen...

24
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,000
Allow me to introduce
an elite force

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,766
I've assembled to
protect the Capital.

26
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:12,633
[Door opens]
[SYURA]
Hello Hellooo.

27
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,966
[Gasps]

28
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,833
This is my son, Syura.

29
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:21,766
I've decided to appoint
him to serve as the
company's commander.

30
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:26,266
Hm? You must be the
"Great" General I've
heard so much about.

31
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:30,100
You're like tied with
Esdeath for scariest
in the Empire.

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,900
Anyway, you shouldn't waste time
worrying about some commoners
and their revolution bullshit.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,800
Why not let me handle it?

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,233
Oh? Going out?

35
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,100
If there's one thing I've
learned from battle,

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,266
it's that you can always
find a few rats around

37
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:46,366
before the entire swarm
makes an appearance.

38
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,533
Seriously.

39
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:50,966
Can't he just sit in the
castle and look pretty.

40
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,200
[MINISTER]
Listen, Son.

41
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,500
This is your chance
to prove yourself.

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
Whether or not I choose you
to be my successor

43
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,900
will depend on your performance.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,766
Very well.
Hope you enjoy the show.

45
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:07,633
<i>But first, I have a few rats of</i>
<i>my own to hunt down. Hehe...</i>

46
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:52,366
[WAVE]
It's so empty in here lately.

47
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:57,000
Kurome, do you feel better now?
Honestly?

48
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,100
[KUROME]
I'm... okay.

49
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:00,966
Hmm...

50
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,533
[RUN]
I did the best I could,

51
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:06,766
but I doubt it'll taste as good
as what Bols used to make.

52
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:09,566
Wave, have you heard about
the new security force?

53
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,233
Apparently they report
directly to the Minister.
[WAVE] Yeah?

54
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,833
[RUN]
Well, I suppose we probably
should've seen it coming.

55
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,366
The Commander's on
an expedition,

56
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,133
and half our team members
have been assassinated.

57
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:24,833
[WAVE]
But isn't that even more of a
reason to move the rest of the
Jaegers to the frontline?

58
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,933
Why would they
put us on standby?

59
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,966
[RUN]
It tells me that there must be
some disagreement in the
Capital's central command.

60
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:33,200
[WAVE]
What the hell are
they thinking?!

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,366
It's times like these
we have to pull together.

62
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:38,500
It's the only way to bring down
the Revolutionary Army.

63
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,833
More please!
Are you serious?

64
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:45,600
Jeez. How can you even
eat at a time like this?
Hehe...

65
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,233
Help yourself.

66
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:50,633
[Plate breaks]
Uh...

67
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:51,500
Uh...

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,466
[WAVE]
She fainted!

69
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:53,300
Oh God!

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,000
Kurome!
What's wrong?!

71
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,633
Can you hear me?
Kurome!

72
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,333
Wake up!
Open your eyes!

73
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,333
Kurome!

74
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,300
[TATSUMI]
They're sending out
more soldiers.

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,166
[LUBBOCK]
Yeah. This place is starting
to look like a battlefield.

76
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,700
[TATSUMI]
So the plan is to wait out here

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,200
for the perfect moment
and sneak into the palace.

78
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,166
And then we can
kill the Minister.

79
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:13,733
Are you sure you're ready
to do this, Tatsumi?

80
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,166
It's what we have to do.

81
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:17,533
Remember, it's important
that we minimize

82
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,600
the number of innocent
people involved.

83
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,633
The best way to do that
is get rid of the Minister
as quickly as possible.

84
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:26,533
Well put.

85
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:29,033
[LUBBOCK]
Oh, it's almost time for our
meeting with the resistance.

86
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,733
Let's go.

87
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:35,633
[MINE]
It's hard to believe how complex
these waterways are.

88
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,900
[LEONE]
I think they got bigger as the
Imperial Capital got bigger...

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
pretty wild.

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,000
But their maintenance is crap,

91
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,866
and it's impossible to
find a good map.

92
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:48,733
Well on the bright side,
I bet there's a way we can
use it to our advantage.

93
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,200
[LEONE]
So... Mine.

94
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,466
Hmm? Uh‐oh, why the
sudden change in tone?

95
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:54,600
Hehehe!

96
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,866
So like what is the story
on you and Tatsumi?

97
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,433
Ah! Whaaat?!

98
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,566
[LEONE]
Oh come on, you don't think
I wasn't gonna notice.

99
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,000
I mean seriously, you two've
been all cute and awkward

100
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,333
since we left Kyoroku.

101
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,100
Hey now you wait
just a minute!

102
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,366
There's NOTHING going on
between me and that idiot,

103
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,233
are you looking for a punch
in the face or something?!

104
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,066
Aww, it's okay, you don't have
to get all flustered about it!

105
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,533
What?! Whatever, I'm not
getting all flustered!

106
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,766
Well, if that's how you're
gonna be about it...

107
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:19,633
Then I guess he's
up for grabs then!

108
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:20,666
Uh?

109
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:22,033
Oh hell no!

110
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,500
[LEONE]
Hahaha...

111
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,233
Uh, oh...

112
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,133
You are really pathetic.

113
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:30,466
That's adorable, but I'm still
taking Tatsumi for myself!

114
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,433
Errr...

115
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:33,533
Hmph!

116
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,533
Quit screwing around and
get back to work!

117
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:37,200
Let's go!

118
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,433
Not flustered at all.

119
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,033
[NAJENDA]
Got it.

120
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,766
Continue the mission as planned.

121
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,933
Right!
You can count on us.

122
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:48,766
Apparently we're no longer in
contact with the western tribe.

123
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,400
[AKAME]
Hm? Really?

124
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,966
It's fine.
I was expecting this.

125
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:55,300
Let's not deviate
from the plan.

126
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,366
When we storm the palace...

127
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,600
I would like the two of you
to take the lead.

128
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't fail me!

129
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,933
Understood.

130
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:04,833
<i>Tatsumi, Lubbock.</i>

131
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:07,966
<i>Please get through this.</i>

132
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,600
[LUBBOCK] Hey, Tatsumi.
[TATSUMI] Hm?

133
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,100
[LUBBOCK]
What are you gonna do when
the revolution's over?

134
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,333
[TATSUMI]
Uh... hmm... I dunno...

135
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,300
I guess I never really
thought about it.

136
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
What about you?
You got plans?

137
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,066
Well, I've been running
that bookstore on the side.

138
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,100
I'll probably just
stick with that.

139
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,700
Maybe I could make it
a national chain
or something.

140
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,700
Wow.

141
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,166
And then!

142
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,266
When the timing's right
I'll ask Najenda to marry me!

143
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,933
Oh, is that so?
That sounds nice.

144
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:36,233
While we're on the subject,
what's going on with
you and Mine?

145
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,666
Huh?! What does she
have to do with this?!

146
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,233
Aw, don't be shy!

147
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,833
Everybody can tell there's
been a little spark

148
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:43,300
between the two of
you love birds

149
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,966
ever since we got
back from Kyoroku.

150
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,200
So spill it!

151
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,966
Tell me how far have
you gotten with her.

152
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,866
Ooh, you've at least
landed a smooch, right?
Hey man! Cut it out!

153
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,433
[MAID]
Uh, pardon me...

154
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,166
Huh?

155
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,333
[MAID]
You're uh...

156
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,000
members of Night Raid, right?

157
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,433
Uh...

158
00:07:58,533 --> 00:07:59,666
Ah!

159
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,933
Lemme guess you must be
with the resistance.

160
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,366
I am.

161
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,366
Once we go inside,
we'll have to be very quiet.

162
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:15,733
Okay.

163
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,700
[LUBBOCK]
I gotta say I'm surprised
a high‐class lady like you

164
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,300
would be part of the resistance.

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,866
[MAID]
My father was one of the
Emperor's instructors,

166
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:26,566
but the Minister accused him
of having ulterior motives
against the Empire.

167
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:30,626
He threw my father and
my mother in prison.

168
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:31,926
[LUBBOCK]
Well now I get it.

169
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:33,493
[TATSUMI]
So that means...

170
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:36,293
even more people in the palace
must support the revolution.

171
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:37,660
[MAID]
Yes.

172
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,260
They've united under a group
of anti‐Minister bureaucrats,

173
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,160
who stay in close contact
with the Revolutionary Army.

174
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,526
[LUBBOCK]
And it's up to us
to help those guys

175
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,226
get the revolutionaries gathered
together from the inside,

176
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:51,826
once the siege on the
palace actually goes down.

177
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:53,560
[TATSUMI]
Alright. Perfect.

178
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,093
Good to know we're not alone.

179
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:56,993
[LUBBOCK]
We were chosen over
everyone else for this job

180
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:59,760
because of my stealth
and your invisibility.

181
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,626
We can't screw up!

182
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:04,993
Hm.
Hm.

183
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,093
This is it.

184
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
[Knocking]

185
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:18,493
Huh?

186
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:19,226
You alright?

187
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,926
Something's wrong.

188
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:22,526
Whenever I knock twice,

189
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,526
someone's supposed to respond
back with a password knock.

190
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:26,493
Uh!

191
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:27,993
[LUBBOCK]
Stand back.

192
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,660
Hm?

193
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,693
Huh?

194
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,993
[Maid shocked]

195
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,293
Whoa..
what happened here?!

196
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:40,526
This isn't good guys;
they already found the hideout.

197
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:41,493
Huh?!

198
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,226
[LUBBOCK]
Get out, NOW!

199
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,426
Uuh...

200
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,393
Huh?

201
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,693
Hm!

202
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,093
[SYURA]
Hehe...

203
00:09:57,193 --> 00:10:00,893
Took you long enough;
I've been waiting forever.

204
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:02,526
Hate to be the one
to break it to you,

205
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:05,893
but I had to eliminate all those
idiots with the "resistance".

206
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:10,093
You may call me
the Great Syura!

207
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,793
You two are with
the Night Raid, yes?

208
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:16,026
You had better be worth
all the trouble.

209
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:17,660
Huh?

210
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,260
Oh! You must be the little shit
with Genreal Esdeath

211
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,093
when I sent her to that
deserted island or whatever?

212
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:29,093
[TATSUMI]
So I guess you must've
been responsible for
the Danger Beasts!

213
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,560
Why'd you do it?

214
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,126
Why do anything?

215
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:34,660
'Cause it's amusing,
young man!

216
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,493
There's nothing in this world
that bothers me more
than being bored.

217
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:42,326
And those creatures kept me
pretty well entertained.

218
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:45,026
That's enough... eat this!

219
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:46,326
[LUBBOCK]
Tatsumi!

220
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,160
Wh... what the?!

221
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,393
[BUDO]
Just as I thought, a few rats
have found their way in.

222
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:04,360
Uh...

223
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,160
Oh! I'm always up for a
visit from my Uncle Budo.

224
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,060
I'll let you take care of
the pipsqueak.

225
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,026
Exactly what
I had in mind.

226
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,626
I am known as Budo.

227
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:19,326
His Majesty the Emperor granted
me the title of Great General.

228
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:21,860
[TATSUMI]
<i>I've heard rumors</i>
<i>about this monster.</i>

229
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,826
You are villainous trash
threatening the Empire...
you are finished.

230
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:28,493
Now face your judgment.

231
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:32,393
And feel the Wrath of the
Lightning God Adramelech!

232
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:35,460
Ah!

233
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:37,160
Urgh!

234
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,360
Tatsumi!

235
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,660
Ahh!

236
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,126
Uh... How did he
manage to do that?

237
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:45,660
He never even touched me!

238
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,893
Impressive.

239
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:49,160
Not many men can
dodge my attack.

240
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,460
I see determination
in your eyes.

241
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,426
Errr..

242
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:55,660
Incursio!

243
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,526
Be careful with that guy!

244
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:04,060
Hehehe...

245
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:05,360
Huh?

246
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,360
Uuh!

247
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,660
Ugh!

248
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,060
Heh!

249
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,026
What?!
How'd you do that?!

250
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:13,493
I think you're gonna be
a fun one to mess with.

251
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:15,760
Leave him
to me, guys!

252
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,160
This precious little
victim is all mine.

253
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,393
Err...

254
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,560
[ESDEATH]
I quite enjoyed that.

255
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,326
As one might expect, the
atmosphere of the battlefield

256
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:31,493
suits me far better
than bodyguard duty.

257
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,960
It's time to return
to the Capital.

258
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:46,493
<i>It won't be long,</i>
<i>Night Raid.</i>

259
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:48,426
Hyaa!

260
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:50,560
[SYURA]
Aw...

261
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:53,360
What?!

262
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,360
Don't forget to look
behind you, Night Raid!

263
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,693
[Punch]
Ugh!

264
00:12:58,493 --> 00:12:59,260
Well now!

265
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,126
What do we have here?

266
00:13:01,226 --> 00:13:03,326
A seamstress?
[Grunt]

267
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:05,993
Ooh, don't get
such a pouty face;

268
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:08,160
I'm about to share
with you a secret.

269
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,626
I call this little
toy "Shambhala."

270
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:15,426
It gives me the ability to
teleport either myself
or my adversaries...

271
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:16,593
Huh?!

272
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:18,560
...to anywhere I've left
my pretty little mark!

273
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,826
Huh?!

274
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:21,460
<i>He can manipulate space!</i>

275
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,726
But the damn thing
does wear me out.

276
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:27,526
I couldn't use it
in quick succession
until just recently.

277
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,660
[Spray]
Uhhh...

278
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,326
Then I found this juicy‐stuff
when I got to the Capital.

279
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:38,093
It really lets me "cut loose",
if you will!

280
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,760
As you can see...

281
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,160
I got a little carried away

282
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,193
and put markers
all over the place!

283
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:45,193
Huh...

284
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:46,293
Ah!

285
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,426
What's wrong?

286
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:49,993
Not gonna run?

287
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,426
[Panting]

288
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:55,726
Aww, man!

289
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:57,526
You giving up already?
Hehe...

290
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:59,626
[LUBBOCK]
<i>Getting away from him</i>
<i>won't do any good!</i>

291
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:03,060
<i>No matter where I run,</i>
<i>he can warp right up to me!</i>

292
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,560
<i>But...</i>

293
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,893
<i>He can't follow me</i>
<i>somewhere he hasn't marked!</i>

294
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,326
Ha!

295
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:11,293
Huh?

296
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:13,426
Ugh!

297
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,793
Aaah... Urg!

298
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,660
Did that get you all pissy?

299
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,693
[SYURA] Awww.
So I guess you can put up
markers in midair can't ya.

300
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,060
[SYURA]
Bingo, smarty pants.

301
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,860
Think I'd leave you
a safe place to hide?

302
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,260
You've nowhere to run!

303
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,693
[Grunts]

304
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,960
[TATSUMI]
He hits hard but his
movements are exaggerated.

305
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,460
I can take him!

306
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,060
Ah!

307
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:45,693
Hyaa!

308
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:52,993
Young man, I'm curious
what is your name?

309
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:53,926
Huh...

310
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,460
Tell me who you are.

311
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,460
Or perhaps assassins like you
don't have names?

312
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,660
It's Tatsumi!

313
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,326
[BUDO]
<i>Tatsumi.</i>

314
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:05,326
<i>Seems to be a sincere boy;</i>
<i>and honest enough.</i>

315
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:08,926
<i>And not a hint of hesitation</i>
<i>in his posture.</i>

316
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,593
<i>I can only imagine</i>
<i>the amount of training</i>

317
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:13,560
<i>it took for him to achieve</i>
<i>this level of skill.</i>

318
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,626
<i>Even so...</i>

319
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:18,093
Uh!

320
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:21,393
<i>I am charged with the</i>
<i>termination of any</i>

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,360
HAA!

323
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:28,726
Guh!

00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,560
[Scream]

00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:37,826
Uh... Huh?

00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,126
Hey, what're you doing?

329
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:40,926
[MAID]
I'm sorry!
I have to do this...
Hey!

330
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:42,426
I have to, for my mother...

331
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,393
and for my father...
[LUBBOCK] Stop it, let me go!

332
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:45,493
I'm sorry...

[Gasp]

334
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,860
Didn't I tell you
to stay out of this?

335
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,826
[LUBBOCK] Huh...
Stupid toys should not be
interfering with my plans.

336
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,626
She's a... a toy?

337
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:04,460
Uh‐huh.
Everything from these morons to
the Capital itself, are my toys!

338
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,026
Pretty soon I'll leave
my old man in the dust,

339
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:09,326
and they'll be
crowning me emperor!

340
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:13,060
Hey now, don't tell me
you're quitting.

341
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,426
We're only just getting
started, sonny!

342
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:17,293
No... it's over.

343
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,960
And it looks like you lose.

344
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,593
Huh?

345
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,593
Uh?

00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,460
Oh...

Owwwww!

00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:30,126
Don't move!

349
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:32,026
Or I'll have to take off
something bigger next time.

350
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:34,426
Damn you!

351
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,926
Huh? What's this?!

352
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:38,560
[LUBBOCK]
A barrier of
World‐Severing String.

353
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,460
I'd already used a lot,
but I had just enough left
to pull this together.

354
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,493
[SYURA]
Son of a bitch! You set this up
while you were running!

355
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:47,026
[LUBBOCK]
You gave me plenty of time.

356
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:48,660
And all of your bragging
and showing off

357
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,560
gave me a pretty good indication
of where all the markers were.

358
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,093
[SYURA]
You little shit!

359
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:55,493
Listen up! All of you,
drop your weapons now!

360
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:59,626
Syura, I've got a few questions
that I need to ask you.

361
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,093
[Stabbed]
Guh!

362
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,693
Uh... You...

363
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,226
Please, Lord Syura...

364
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:11,126
I did as I was ordered...

365
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:15,093
now please, release my family...

366
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:16,193
Hehehe...

367
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,926
No can do, sweetie!

368
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:26,660
Haha... Sorry to tell you,
but Mommy and Daddy
died a long time ago!

369
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,260
Hahaha....

370
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,793
Okay, Night Raid, I've really
had a marvelous time. But...

371
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:33,826
It's time we wrapped this up.

372
00:17:33,926 --> 00:17:35,926
I'd like to express
my gratitude

373
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:39,360
by letting you
see my trump card.

374
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,326
Bon voyage!

375
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,526
You're off to the
ends of the Earth!

376
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:50,026
[Panic and screams]

377
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:55,860
[SYURA]
No one's ever made it
back from out there!

378
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,526
You're gonna die alone in the
emptiness of space, Night Raid!

379
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:02,493
Hahahaha‐

380
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:03,626
Huh?

381
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:05,126
<i>No!</i>

382
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,960
<i>That son of a bitch!</i>

383
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,593
Nothing in this world
or the next

384
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:12,293
could possibly break the
World‐Severing String!

385
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:15,226
Not even an Imperial Arms
that controls space!

386
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:17,526
[Syura struggles]

387
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,960
So, here we go again.

388
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,326
God dammit... Ah!

389
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:26,560
You cannot get away!

390
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:29,060
Guh! Ohhh!

391
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,260
It's only right that we
finish this fairly.

392
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,293
If I'm going to die, then
you're going down with me.

393
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:35,593
The hell I am!

394
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:38,326
I won't allow myself to die
with rabble like you!

395
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:41,226
I haven't had time to take this
boring bland vanilla nation

396
00:18:41,326 --> 00:18:43,026
and give it the fun it deserves!

397
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:44,526
Kind of a crazy sentiment...

398
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:47,493
but believe it or not,
I do think I understand.

399
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,926
No, I'm not supposed to die yet!

400
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,426
I have so much to do!

401
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:55,660
So you wanna change
the world? Huh?

402
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,193
Course you do.

403
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:59,593
Everybody wants to
do that, asshole.

404
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:00,760
[Cough]

405
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,260
But still...

406
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,893
none of that gives you the right

407
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:05,393
to treat your fellow
human beings

408
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:07,226
like they're your own
personal playthings

409
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:09,626
and to treat them like
they're nothing!

410
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,193
[Choke]

411
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:28,560
Uh...

412
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:31,193
Uh...

413
00:19:32,526 --> 00:19:37,226
Thanks for protecting me
so long, Cross Tail.

414
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:52,326
I'm sorry, Najenda.

415
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:55,660
This was as far
as I could go.

416
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:59,993
I'm leaving the rest
to you, Tatsumi.

417
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,660
Uh...

418
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:18,326
[Gasp]

419
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,926
Oh, Lubb...

420
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:23,193
[TATSUMI]
Aaaugh!

421
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:31,893
[Sniffling]

422
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:33,960
He's dead!

423
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:36,193
[Crying]

424
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:38,526
Noooo!

425
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:41,960
How could you leave me?!

426
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,526
Oh well!

427
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:49,260
Can't change anything
by grieving over the
fallen, can we?

428
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,926
Well he did manage to eliminate
a Night Raid assassin.

429
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:55,026
Rather fair trade if you ask me.

430
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:59,760
[BUDO]
I took the liberty of confining
the other Night Raid member
to the dungeon.

431
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,526
[MINISTER]
Excellent work.

432
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,626
Let's see... now...

433
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,293
If we wish to subdue the rebels,

434
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:12,593
I imagine we need to make
an example of that boy.

435
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:14,160
It must be bold.

436
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:20,226
So I wonder what's the best form
of torture to make a point.

437
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:23,626
Hmm... You're still as depraved
as ever, aren't you, Minister?

438
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:28,126
Listen. Punishing a rebel calls
for a higher grade of cruelty.

439
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:29,793
I have a few suggestions...

440
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:31,160
[Door opens]
Hm?

441
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,926
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation.

442
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,826
And if I may, I'd like
that job to be mine.

443
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:38,226
Ohh?

444
00:21:38,326 --> 00:21:42,960
<i>Tatsumi, I won't let anyone</i>
<i>take you from me!</i>

445
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:51,493
[Bell rings]

446
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,660
An execution? Oh no...

447
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,226
Uh! Oh God... no...

448
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:40,260
[Music playing]
