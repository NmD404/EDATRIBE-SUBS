Could you please explain
why your head

00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,041
is suddenly 33 percent
larger than before?

00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah. Well, you see,

10
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,250

moisture like a sponge.

Now, then.

14
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,666
According to Mr. Karasuma,

15
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,000
we have another

Great.

Ten to one it's gonna
be another assassin.

18
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,041
[KORO-SENSEI] I made a
bit more trouble for myself

19
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,541
than I'd bargained for
underestimating Ritsu.

20
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,583
So rest assured, I won't be
making the same mistake twice.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,458

encourage all of you to see

23
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,166
the new addition to our class
as one more potential ally.

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,125
Hey. Heard anything?
I mean, since you're both new.

Figure you transfers gotta
stick together, right?

Actually, I do know
a little bit.

27
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,958
The original plan was for he
and I to start at the same time,

28
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,708
but it didn't work out that way.

29
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,791
I would handle
long-range attacks,

back Koro-sensei into a corner.

the order for, well, reasons.

being put into the field.

I lacked the capacity

he's capable of, well...

Now there's three of them?

173
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,125
Here's the thing, if they
really are related. I mean,

174
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,666
don't you think Koro-sensei
would've known about it?

175
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,958
[FUWA]
Hmm... Not necessarily.

176
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,125
[SOLDIERS yelling]

177
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,083
[MALE RETAINER] Your Highness,
the enemy is upon us.

178
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,500
All is lost!

179
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,625
[KING]
So be it.

180
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,791
My sons.

181
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,916
You alone will survive!

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,041
[KORO-SENSEI] Hurry,
little brother! We've no time!

183
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,208
Clear the bridge and
escape is assured!

Go! I'm lost!

--[ITONA] No, brother!

188
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,166

You have to live!

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,500
[FUWA]
Once grown,

190
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,125
each was driven by cruel
fate to battle the other,

191
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,250
without knowing their
opponent's true identity.

192
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,500
[KAEDE]
Um.

193
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,291
That still doesn't explain
why Itona's human.

194
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,166
[FUWA]
Easy, he's a mutation.

195
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,916
[KAEDE] You've totally glossed
over the core issue here!

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,708
[SUMIRE] No offense,
but your characterizations

197
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,250
are kind of cliché. And
the plot's ridiculous.

198
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,666
[FUWA]
Hey! No one asked

199

[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]

204
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,291
This place looks like an arena.

205
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,041
Yeah. Fit for an
honest death match.

206
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,583
It's the first time I've seen an
assassin take this approach.

207
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,666
[SHIRO] Surely by now
you're tired of clunky,

208
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,666
overly complicated
attempts on your life,

209
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,958
so let's confine
ourselves to one rule.

210
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,916
Set foot outside
the desk boundary

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,166
and your life is forfeit.

212
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,333
Agreed?

213
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,916
Oh yeah, sure, whatever.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,375
As if the loser's gonna stick
to that without any issues.

215
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,916
They will.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,125
Koro-sensei's all about how
his students see him, remember?

217
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,958
He'll abide by the rules
out of a sense of honor.

218
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,250
Cheating would risk throwing
shade on his reputation with us.

219
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Very well, sir.

220
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,541
I agree to your rule.

221
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,208
But let's include another,
injuring any spectators

222
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,250
also counts as a forfeit.

223
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,000
[SHIRO]
Agreed.

224
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,625
Commence on my signal.
Assassination.

--[ALL gasping]
--[NAGISA] For what seemed like

229
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,291
an eternity, our eyes were all
riveted to the same thing.

230
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,625
And, oddly enough, it wasn't
our teacher's amputated limb.

231
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Impossible!

232

Itona's hair is made
of... tentacles!

235

[KARMA]
That's how he stayed dry.

236
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,916
Sneaky bastard didn't need
an umbrella after all.

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,500
He just batted
the raindrops off.

238
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
How is this possible?

239
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,458
[NAGISA gasps]

240
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,166
[KORO-SENSEI] Tell me where
those tentacles came from.

241
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,333
[KORO-SENSEI] Why does
someone like you have them?

242

[SHIRO] We're neither at
liberty or obligated to say.

243
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,458
But I hope this serves
to convince you:

244
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,125
You may have come
from different parents,

245
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,083
enjoyed different upbringings,

246
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,916
but nevertheless you
are indeed brothers.

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,916
[SHIRO chuckles]

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,458
[SHIRO]
What a face you're making.

249
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,791
Does this encounter stir up
unpleasant memories, perhaps?

250
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Clearly.

251
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,083
You and I need to
have a little talk.

252
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,541
[SHIRO]
Not possible.

253
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,958
You'll be dead.

This pressure ray

at close range.

properties of your skin cells.

You see, Koro-sensei,
there's an aspect even to that

269
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,083
which constitutes
an Achilles Heel.

[KORO-SENSEI grunting]

dearly in terms of energy.

plummets while you recover.

grown back that arm

--Itona lobbed off
--[KORO-SENSEI screaming]

275
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,625
in his initial attack! That's
even more energy you've lost.

276
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,958
By my calculations,
at the moment this makes

277
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,958
the two of you a fairly
even match for one other.

278
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,625
Using one's
tentacles effectively

279
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,250
calls for a great deal
of mental stamina, too.

280
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,333
And it appears Itona's dirty
little secret pulled the rug out

281
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:12,291
from under your state of mind,
which, of course, was the idea.

282

Not to boast, but it's obvious
who has the upper hand.

of his devoted guardian.

Look at you. Not so
tough now, huh?

00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,458
[NAGISA] He's got
Koro-sensei on the ropes!

If they actually kill him,
they'll save the world!

298
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,625
But... it's hard to get
excited about that.

They not only know
his weak points,

300
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,791
they know how to zero in on
them one after the other.

And that's cool and all,

302

but... we were hoping to
pull this off ourselves.

If anyone gets to kill
him, it should be us!

legs have regenerated.

[KORO-SENSEI] No one's ever
run me this ragged before.

307
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,291

I was signing up

more strategy afoot

An anti-me blade

332
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,375
works just as well on your
tentacles as they do mine.

And regeneration takes
just as much a toll.

My old skin kept
him perfectly safe.

Technically though, Itona,
you are outside the boundary.

In yo' face. I win.

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,333
Etcetera, etcetera.

341
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,750
No more trying to kill me with
your guardian's help, hmmm?

If, however, you'd like to stay,

344
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,250
perhaps learn a thing or two

345
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,583
along with the rest
of the class,

346
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,166
we'll welcome you
with open arms.

347
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,875
Bear in mind,
what you learn here

348
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,583
can't necessarily be quantified.

349
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:57,500
You are a gifted young man,
but I am richer in experience.

350
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,458
I became a teacher so as to
translate that experience

351
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,625
into something which
can enrich others.

352
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,208
The way to assassinate me isn't
by honing in on my weaknesses,

353
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,083
but by absorbing my lessons.

354
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,416
[ITONA]
Are you saying

355
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,708
that I'm never gonna be
strong enough to beat you?

356
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,833
You think that I'm weak?!

357
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,166
[SHIRO]
Oh, no.

358
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,541
Itona is not a fan
of being lectured to.

Black tentacles?

00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,583
I think the dude's
about to go postal!

365
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,083
[ITONA]
I am strong!

366
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,000

my victory over everyone!

Pardon us, Koro-sensei.

373
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,125
My hot-headed ward

374
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,791
isn't exactly prime classroom
material at the best of times.

375
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,541
It's not lost on me that
this is his first day,

376
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,583
but a mandatory vacation
is clearly in order.

377
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Excuse me!

378
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,250
I can't let you walk
out of here with him.

379
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,500
He's my student!

380
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,666
Until graduation, his
well-being falls on me.

381
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,375
And, frankly, I also have
a lot of questions

382
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,583
to ask you, Mr. Shiro.

383
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,958
[SHIRO]
Sorry. We're leaving.

being restrained by you.

No to worry, my
conscientious friend.

390
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,083
He'll be back
before you know it.

391
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,666
March is almost
upon us after all.

392
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,000
In the meantime,
I'll take responsibility

393
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,083
for his well-being, thank you.

394
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,750

Such a personality.

395
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,583
It will hoist him by his own
petard before doomsday.

396
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,500
And those children.

00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,958
Huh! Very promising.

398
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,083

What an unpredictable classroom.

we're having today.

He's been this way for a while.

[KORO-SENSEI]

has brought out my serious
side and I'm ashamed!

You children are supposed to
think of me as comic relief!

We are?

tentacles came from?

[KORO-SENSEI screams]

[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't repeat that!

412
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,458
Just hearing those words again

413
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,541
make me want to bury
my head in the sand!

414
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,291
I'm a free-spirited,
impish type

415

who cleverly dodges
direct questions!

That's my shtick!

[SUGINO] You dissecting
your character type

419
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,625
is what's humiliating.

421
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,583
Was anyone else caught off guard

out of that boy's head?

what're we here for?

No, you're right.

433
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,708

you children the truth.

434
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
In reality, your teacher...

435
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,250
Is a biologically
engineered life form!

436
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,000

Pardon me if I expected
a bit more of a reaction!

441
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,375
Sir, we kinda noticed
that you're an octopus

that flies through the
air at Mach Twenty.

443
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,000
But you said you're not
from another planet,

444
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,625
so that rules out alien.

445
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,083
[MEG] And how else can you and
Itona be brothers when you had

446
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,125

were biologically engineered.

happened today.

We've never seen you like that.

452
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,916
[NAGISA]
Does it have something to do

453
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,041
with why you were created
in the first place?

454
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean, why are you even here?

455
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
All very good questions.

456
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,541
Too bad they won't matter.

457
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,250
Soon, everything you want
to know will be reduced

458
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,916
to space dust swirling in the
place where Earth used to be.

[YOSHIDA, TERASAKA grunt]

460
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,791
[KORO-SENSEI] On the other
hand, if you're serious

461
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,250
about saving this planet,
you'll have amble opportunity

462
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,291
to learn the truth
between now and then.

463
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,166
They say curiosity
killed the cat,

464
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,541
but if those enquiring minds
are to be satisfied,

465
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,875
you'll have to continue
trying to kill me.

Teacher, student.
Assassin, target.

467
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,833

in this classroom.

nothing, boys and girls.

work for them.

Right. No student
was hurt in any way.

--Uh?

us more about assassination?

[KARASUMA]
Hmm.

489
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,791
You already know plenty.

490
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,916
Here's the deal, sir.
We've been slacking off

491
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,208
'cause we figured someone else

492
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,416
would take care of killing
Koro-sensei, y'know?

493
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, 'cept when we saw
Itona do his thing,

494
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,375
it dawned on us.

495
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,666
The thing is, we don't want
it to be someone else.

496
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,541
It should be us. If they can
just bring anyone they want

497
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,166
to do it, well, what's the point

498
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,125
of us being here in
the first place, right?

499
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,958
We may not have
a lot of time left,

500
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,250
but we're willing to
work harder. Please.

501

We want to
assassinate our teacher!

502
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:32,541
Like he said, we have to work
for any answers ourselves.

503
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,500
[KARASUMA] What a positive
shift in attitude.

504
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,500
Nice.

505
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,541
All right, then.

Students interested
in beefing up

507
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,500
their assassination skills
can stay after class.

508
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,833
