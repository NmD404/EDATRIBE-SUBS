1
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,958
[KAEDE] I've gathered
you all here today,

2
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,458
even though we're
still on break,

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,708
for a very important reason:

4
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,541
Our nation's current
egg surplus crisis!

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,958
Poultry farmers across the land

6
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,375
are throwing out
their excess in bulk!

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,125
[ISOGAI] Right. I heard
about that on the news.

8
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,166
It's a real waste.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,500
It is!

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,083
So I've drafted a proposal
to salvage those eggs,

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,166
and assassinate
Koro-sensei in a way

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,083
that's almost guaranteed
to be foolproof!

13
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,958
We're killing him
with surplus eggs?

14
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,958
What? You gonna
make an omelet?

15
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,666
Throw in a couple
of these babies?

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,083
Like he won't see that
comin' from a mile away.

17
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,333
[giggles] I gave it a little
bit more thought than that.

18
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,958
In fact, my plan's already in
motion, thanks to Mr. Karasuma.

19
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,500
Right. All the stuff you
need's been set up outside.

20
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,333
Egg-cellent! Everybody
to the yard!

21
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,166
[KARASUMA] They're creative,
I'll give 'em that.

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,750
How they come up with this
stuff, I'll never know.

23
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,375
[STUDENTS]
Whoa.

24
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:07,041
[OKUDA] So we have a ton of eggs
and a mold. Are we making...?

25
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,500
[KAEDE] Yep! It's
exactly what you think.

26
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,708
We are going to whip up
a ginormous pudding!

27
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,500
I give you...
Operation Pudding Popper!

28
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,458
[NAGISA]
Operation Pudding Popper, huh?

29
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,916
Well, Koro-sensei does have
a pretty serious sweet tooth.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,458
[KAEDE]
Bingo!

31
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:02,166
And the target's recent crucial
confession only confirms it!

32
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,666
[KAEDE] You'd scarf down a
mountain of these if you could.

33
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, without question!

34
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,500
What a dream come true it
would be to gorge myself

35
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,625
on a mountain of pudding!

36
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,708
Too bad I don't have the
funds to make it happen.

37
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,083
So, let's make that
crazy dream a reality!

38
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,625
Saving some for
ourselves, of course.

39
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,083
[NAGISA chuckles nervously]

40
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,875
[KAEDE] The idea is to plant
bombs and anti-Sensei BB's

41
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,666
into the giant pudding's base.

42
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,083
When he eats his way to
the bottom, we detonate.

43
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,666
[KORO-SENSEI screaming]

44
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,750
This is starting to sound
like it's worth a shot.

45
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,333
I'm with you on that.

46
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,000
Koro-sensei loses his marbles
when it comes to anything sweet.

47
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,291
[TAKEBAYASHI] And since Kayano's
usually not that proactive,

48
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,708
there's the element of surprise.

49
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,083
He won't be suspicious.

50
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,125
[ISOGAI]
All right then!

51
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,583
Let's wait till he's not around

52
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,458
and make ourselves
a giant pudding!

53
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,958
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

54
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,333
[KAEDE] This equipment comes
from an inactive line

55
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,833
at a mayonnaise factory.

56
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,500
Once the eggs are prepped,
they'll be going in here.

57
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,916
Step one: Crack 'em.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,333
Step two: With help
from the government,

59
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,125
we do the mixing manually.

60
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,583
It's a lot of work,
but eyes on the prize.

61
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,833
Step three: Add sugar and milk.

62
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,958
Lots of it. Plus some vanilla
extract to give it flavor.

63
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,291
[HINANO]
Hey, Kaede?

64
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,625
I saw them try to make a
giant pudding on TV once,

65
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,833
and it didn't work.

66
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:20,458
It weighed too much. Totally
collapsed. Just sayin'.

67
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,250
That thought occurred to me,

68
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,333
which is why we're
using gelatin and agar.

69
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,916
Not common for pudding.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,708
The agar's fibers make
it a great coagulant.

71
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,500
Plus, did you know that it has

72
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,000
a significantly higher
melting point than gelatin,

73
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,000
making it perfect for
keeping our pudding firm

74
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,250
in the September heat?

75
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,916
[SUGAYA, HINANO]
Whoa.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,583
[KAEDE] Commence pouring
in the first batch!

77
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,833
[KAEDE]
That's the way!

78
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,583
Once that's all in, swap out
with Team Second Batch!

79
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,000
We'll increase the ratio
of cream as we go up,

80
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,583
maintaining firmness while
ensuring the lower layers

81
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,125
don't bear too much weight.

82
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,750
And what're these for?

83
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,500
Fruit sauce in edible
mousse wrappers

84
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,125
to add the occasional
burst of new flavor.

85
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,291
Vanilla is scrumptious
and all, but think about it,

86
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,500
wouldn't you get sick of
the same taste bite after bite

87
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,625
in something so large?

88
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,791
Sure you would!

89
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,250
Okay, that's great.

90
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,958
Once the mold's full,
drop the lid on

91
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,541
and let the whole thing chill.

92
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,875
This isn't just any old
pudding mold, either.

93
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,458
The outer walls are
fitted with pipes

94
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,250
that have coolant
circulating through them.

95
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,791
Pretty neat, huh?

96
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,375
A pudding with this much volume
needs to be chilled through.

97
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,166
We're talkin' inside and out.

98
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,708
[STUDENTS]
Wow.

99
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,208
Who in the world
would've ever thought

100
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,333
you could be an expert
on giant pudding?

101
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,500
She's got the
engineering part down pat.

102
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,875
And she knows how to
make it taste great.

103
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,666
[KARMA]
Nice work, Kayano.

104
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,708
You really thought all this
up after reading an article

105
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,083
on the country's egg surplus?

106
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,583
[KAEDE]
Sorta.

107
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,666
Actually, I've wanted to try
and do this for a while now.

108
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,541
And since the Ministry
of Defense was willing

109
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,958
to shell out the
money this time,

110
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,958
I figured why not go for it?

111
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,333
When my mind's
fixed on something,

112
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,125
I just keep rolling, I guess.

113
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,500
[NAGISA]
Most of the time,

114
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,250
Kayano's more in the
background than center stage.

115
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,791
That's probably why
I've always pegged her

116
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,250
as the supporting role type.

117
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,458
But look at her now.

118
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,666
I never imagined she
could get so fired up.

119
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,291
Proof anyone can shine when what
they're into becomes relevant.

120
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,041
[KAEDE] We've got another
early day tomorrow.

121
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,875
[KAEDE] Once we've let
it chill overnight,

122
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,958
we check to see if
it's firmed up enough.

123
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,375
If it is, we remove the pipes.

124
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,583
[KAEDE]
After that,

125
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,291
we loosen the bolts
holding the lid in place.

126
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,458
Then we blow air between
the walls of the mold

127
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,791
and the pudding itself.

128
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:39,875
Next...

129
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,791
Release internal lock!

130
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,500
[KAEDE] When the pudding is
completely free of the mold,

131
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,958
we carefully shore up the sides
with softened gelatin and agar

132
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,083
to add just a bit more firmness.

133
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,625
Then we top it off
with a caramel sauce.

134
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,666
And lightly brulee the top!

135
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,416
[STUDENTS]
We did it!

136
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,541
Wow! That looks sure delicious!

137
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,958
You completely forget there's
a bomb planted in there!

138
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,375
[NAGISA]
And with that,

139
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,750
Kayano's gigantic killer
pudding was ready to be served.

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
And-And I'm allowed to eat

141
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,000
this entire thing?

142
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,541
[KAEDE]
Oh, uh, sure.

143
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,333
I just didn't want those
eggs going to some landfill.

144
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,208
This was all Kayano's
idea, you know.

145
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,875
[KAEDE chuckles]

146
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
You've made me so happy!

147
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,083
[NAKAMURA]
We'd better get goin'.

148
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,125
[ISOGAI] Yeah. Don't wanna
be late for English.

149
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,291
Now, you've gotta promise
to eat every last bite!

150
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Not a problem!

151
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:48,666
At last my dream's
come true! Thank you!

152
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,875
Come on. We'll watch the
detonation from inside.

153
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,875
Oh. Yeah, okay.

154
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,916
[SUGINO] Wow, he's
really gettin' after it.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,791
I have a feeling it
won't be very long

156
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,166
till he reaches the bottom.

157
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,500
[TAKEBAYASHI]
Don't worry,

158
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,208
I've installed a security
camera into the base.

159
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,125
I'm keeping my eye on it.

160
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,916
The second he reaches the bomb,

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,166
we'll detonate it
by remote control.

162
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,583
We'll know he's eaten his way to
it once light starts pouring in.

163
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,541
My pudding. It'll be...

164
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,500
It'll be tastiest if the flavor
changes halfway through.

165
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,083
Ah, that makes sense.

166
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,875
I'll use a scale model to
test its strength first.

167
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,708
Aww! Not another collapse!

168
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,541
Pudding.

169
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,875
[KAEDE]
My pudding!

170
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,166
I can't let something I've
put my heart and soul into

171
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,416
be blown to smithereens!

172
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,375
Kayano, take it easy!

173
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,791
[TERASAKA] It's a damn pudding,
not the family pet!

174
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,833
It's supposed to be
blown to smithereens!

175
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,208
[KAEDE]
We can't!

176
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,041
It should stand in
the schoolyard forever

177
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,583
as a monument!

178
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,833
[STUDENTS]
Ew, gross!

179
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Phew! My jaws need a break.

180
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,750
By the way, amid all
the deliciousness,

181
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,583
I caught a faint whiff of this.

182
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,000
[NAGISA] The bomb! And the
detonator's been detached!

183
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,375
[KORO-SENSEI] I ate a path from
caramel to pudding to dirt

184
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,291
and proceeded to tunnel
from underneath to remove it.

185
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,958
I assume the bomb was your
handy work, Takebayashi?

186
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,208
Well, your calculations
were spot on,

187
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,125
and if had I not picked
up the distinct scent

188
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,458
of plastic explosive,

189
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,916
your scheme might've
very well worked.

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,250
Next time, you'll account
for strange odors, right?

191
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,125
Right.

192
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,625
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

193
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
C'est la vie!

194
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,041
But since you worked together

195
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,625
to create this
wonderful concoction,

196
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,583
you should enjoy it together.

197
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,458
I set aside a nice, clean
portion for each of you.

198
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,791
So he gets the drop
on us yet again.

199
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,166
And it was such a
clever idea, too.

200
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Incidentally,

201
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,333
consuming eggs headed for the
landfill is, strictly speaking,

202
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,750
a violation of sound
economic principles.

203
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,916
So, we'll be exploring
the complex role

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,958
of a perishable good surplus
in our next civics lesson.

205
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,666
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir.

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,083
[NAGISA]
Kind of a shame, isn't it?

207
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,750
I bet you're relieved, though.

208
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,250
[KAEDE chuckles]

209
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,750
Honestly, no offense,

210
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,416
but I didn't think you had it
in you to be so hardcore.

211
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,000
It was cool to watch.
A nice change of pace.

212
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,291
[KARMA]
Mmm.

213
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,375
[chuckles]

214
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,041
That's what it is
to be an assassin.

215
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,916
Not even your close friends
get to see your true blade.

216
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,708
[KAEDE] Oh, yeah. There's
more where that came from.

217
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,958
I've got all kinds
of jiggly weapons.

218
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,458
Here even a pudding expert
can be a top-notch assassin.

219
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:48,750
[WOMAN A]
Huh?

220
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,166
[chuckling]

221
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,833
[gasps]

222
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,416
[WOMAN A screaming]

223
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,666
[NAGISA]
Once the break was over,

224
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,458
Mr. Karasuma got
down to business

225
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,000
and really ramped
up our training.

226
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,250
Today's P.E. class was a first.

227
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,125
Parkour crossed
with Cops n' Roppers.

228
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,291
The cops being our
toughest teachers.

229
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
How 'bout this?

230
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,958
If we manage to
round 'em all up,

231
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,916
they get double the homework.

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,166
Ugh, stop makin' this
about role play.

233
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Aw now, ain't
no reason it can't be fun.

234
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:25,000
You're just tryin' to hog all
the good times for yourself.

235
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,458
Puttin' me in charge a
holdin' down the fort.

236
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,666
What did you expect?

237
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,708
You can't be the chaser.
This is training.

238
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,125
[OKAJIMA] Mr. Karasuma will
catch up to us eventually,

239
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,291
but it's a big mountain!

240
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,708
And there's a time limit,

241
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,875
so at best he'll tag maybe
two or three of us, tops.

242
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,541
Yeah, if even that many.

243
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,708
[RYUNOSUKE]
No kidding.

244
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,000
[KARASUMA]
I heard that.

245
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,041
Ridge. Eighty meters. Boom.

246
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,291
[KARASUMA]
You're under arrest.

247
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,500

Come on.

253
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,916
This isn't some battle manga.

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,708
Seriously, how'd you not
know he was on your tail

255
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,375
till after he tagged you?

256
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,875
[OKAJIMA]
Look, just be careful.

257
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,500
He's like a ninja. For all
you know, he's right there.

I'll just pull him down by his
tagging hand and booyah.

We'll go at it right
here in the wilderness.

"Bad Cop, Good Cop" will
take on a whole new meaning.

Uh-oh. We're
droppin' like flies!

00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,833
We should rename this
place Mount Slaughter!

270
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,625
They just got
tagged out, right?

271
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,041
Huh. Wait a second.

00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,333
This is Cops n' Robbers.
Technically--

273
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,416
We can tag 'em back in!
Okuda, you're a genius!

274
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah, sure. Have fun.

275
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,708
Like anybody's
breakin' out of jail

276
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,875
with the supersonic
Octopus on duty.

277
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,041
If it was possible to
come in under his radar,

278
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,750
we'd have offed him months ago.

279
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,125
[SUGINO]
You have a point.

280
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,833

You come to bust us out?

281
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:14,958
Ah-ha!

00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yeah?

00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,458
Ooh.

00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:22,708

Just this one time.

[OKAJIMA]
Sugino! Now!

286
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,291
Five prisoners free.

[KARASUMA growls]

288
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,708
Damn it!

289
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,125
Mind explaining how prisoners
are escaping on your watch?

290
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,250
[KORO-SENSEI] They're shrewder
than we gave 'em credit for!

291
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,000
But good heavens! Those
things are really enormous!

292
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,583
[KARASUMA]
Are you taking bribes?

293
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:45,708
Look, whatever, if you let the
next group escape, so help me!

294
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,583
[TOKA]
Actually, Koro-sensei.

295
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yup?

296
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,375
My little brother's come
down with a rare illness.

297
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,833
Poor guy's been
bedridden for weeks.

298
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,000
When I told him what we're
playing, he texted back:

299
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,666
"Win one for me."

300
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,791
If he finds out I was captured,
the shock might be too much.

301
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:01,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Go.

302
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,583
[gasps]

303
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,166
[KORO-SENSEI] This cop
never saw anything, so go.

304
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,208
[TOKA] Thank you, sir!
You're the best!

305
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,375
Four more prisoners free.

306
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,541
[KORO-SENSEI] Come in,
Karasuma! Do you copy?

307
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,291
How are these inmates
breaking out of my prison?

308
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,625
[KARASUMA]
That's my line, you moron!

309
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,500
Time's up! Game over!

310
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,333
Finally.

311
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,250
--Can't breathe. Need air.
--About friggin' time.

[growls]

313
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,833
[NAGISA]
When it was over,

314
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,541
our game of Cops n'
Robbers-slash-parkour

315
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,333
ended with us getting away.

316
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,083
Koro-sensei's stint as warden
left a lot to be desired

317
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,041
as far as Mr. Karasuma
was concerned.

318
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,166
But it was good training
for us either way, really.

319
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,708
Yep. Things were
going fairly well.

320
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,500
Second term was off
to a promising start.

321
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,458
No way.

322
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,666
[KORO-SENSEI] An excellent
beginning to second term,

323
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,041
it must be said.

324
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,291
The mutual respect and trust
the students and I share

325
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,916
grows stronger by the day.

326
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,208
How wonderful it is to
see their shining faces

327
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,708
look up at me with
such... unbridled disgust?

328
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,750
[OKANO] They're totally talking
about you, aren't they?

329
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,125
[MIMURA]
How could you do that stuff?

330
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,125
We're very disappointing
in you, sir.

331
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
No, wait! I'm innocent!

332
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,875
I don't even know
anything about this!

333
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,541
So, have an alibi?

334
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
A do what now?

335
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,625
Where were you on the evenings
of the incidents in question?

336
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,458
And can anybody back you up?

337
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Let me see.

338
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,041
I was vigorously shaking
a bag of seasoned fries.

339
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,333
Alternating between an altitude
of ten thousand meters

340
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,875
and three thousand
meters, respectively.

341
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,416
[MIMURA]
No one can back that up!

342
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,833
That's enough, guys.
Come on, he's not a perv.

343
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,833
He's done some
creepy things, sure.

344
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,250
But even if you
add 'em all together,

345
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,833
what've you really got?

346
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,583
He's read some adult magazines.
Been bribed with dirty pictures

347
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,708
Stared intently at
pinups during recess.

348
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,250
Spammed lingerie companies

349
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,083
with requests to let him give
their models a tentacle bra.

350
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Daddy help.

351
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,875
[ISOGAI] Koro-sensei,
just turn yourself in.

352
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Et tu, Isogai?

353
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,958
This is an outrage!
I stand wrongfully accused!

354
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,500
Don't you believe me? Very well.
To the teacher's lounge!

355
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,125
I'll show you the kind of
upright citizen I can be!

356
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,416
Behold! My pinup stash.

357
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,875
I'll toss every last one of them

358
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,291
without so much as a
twinge of reservation--!

359
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,833
[BOTH gasp]

360
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,500
You're kidding.

361
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,416
Oh my god, guys!
Check out the roll book!

362
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,958
He put letters next to
all the girls' names.

363
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,000
Koro-sensei knows our cup sizes!

364
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,333
[KAEDE]
Huh?!

365
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,750
What the hell is "Forever
Flat" supposed to mean

366
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,291
you eight-armed, two-bit,
emoji-faced peeping tom?!

367
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,500
And what about this?

368
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,291
A breakdown of all the
girls in Kunugigaoka

369
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,541
with an F-cup or above?

370
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,625
[KORO-SENSEI] Wait, I...
That can't possibly...

371
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,208
[STUDENTS groaning]

372
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,916
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles nervously]

373
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
You know what we need?

374
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,875
A good, old-fashioned,
afterschool barbeque!

375
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,208
Doesn't that sound like fun?

376
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,708
Here!

377
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,000
Get a load of these succulent
skewers I threw together!

378
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,958
[chuckling]

379
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,833
Wow.

380
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,375
This is nauseating.

381
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,416
Gross.

382
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:15,375
[KORO-SENSEI] That... That's all
for today, b-boys and girls.

383
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,833
I, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

384
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,208
[KARMA chuckles]

385
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,875
We certainly put the Octopus
through the ringer, didn't we?

386
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,916
Some people just
can't take the heat.

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,333
Is he stealing underwear?
That'd be pretty serious.

388
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,625
I mean, we're talkin'
an actual crime.

389
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,041
Compared to blowing up the
Earth? I say it's precious.

390
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,416
Okay, but...

391
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,625
[KARMA] I don't know what
I'd do with super speed,

392
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,583
but I can tell you one thing,
if I stole underwear,

393
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,166
I sure as hell wouldn't
be sloppy enough

394
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,708
to leave evidence behind.

395
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,083
[KARMA] I found that
in the equipment shed.

396
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,958
Koro-sensei's no fool.
He understands.

397
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,166
Knows he'd be dead to us
over something like this.

398
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,041
His whole life's about
being a teacher.

399
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,708
Between losing our respect
and being assassinated,

400
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,416
everyone knows which
of those things

401
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,708
he'd go more out of
his way to avoid.

402
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,375
Yeah. Have to agree with you.

403
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,833
Then who's the sicko
doing all this stuff?

404
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,375
[FUWA]
An impostor.

405
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,791
[KAEDE]
Fuwa?

406
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,541
That color. That laugh.
We're dealing with an archetype.

407
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,958
A fake sensei! The Double!
The Doppelgänger!

408
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,208
Oldest super villain
trope in the book!

409
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,750
Which means our culprit
is intimately familiar

410
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,083
with Koro-sensei and his quirks.

411
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:36,166
Hey, let's you and me
play detective, Ristu.

412
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,083
Yes!

413
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,041
Something along those lines.

414
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,875
As for what's in this
for the real culprit,

415
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,333
your guess is as good as mine.

416
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,708
But we gotta put a stop to him.

417
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,083
If the rumor mill runs
Koro-sensei out of town,

418
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,416
there goes our bounty, and
then what's all this been for?

419
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,208
We'll lose our shot at this.

420
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,708
If, on the other hand,

421
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,625
we catch the real guy ourselves,
Teach will be in our debt.

422
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,583
[FUWA, RITSU, NAGISA]
Yeah!

423
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,208
"Forever Flat."

424
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,458
Ha. Justice will prevail now
the great, and very mature,

425
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,916
detective is on the case.

426
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,291
You say "on the case,"

427
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,083
I say "exploiting our
parkour skills to trespass."

428
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,583
Hey, remind me again.

429
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,916
Of all the places in town,
what makes us so sure

430
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,166
the creeper's gonna
strike here next?

431
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,500
First off, this place is
a camp for pro entertainers.

432
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,833
The cincher, though?

433
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,291
A phenomenally popular,
bazonga-licous girl group

434
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,750
has been staying here for
the past couple of weeks.

435
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,750
[RITSU]
Right.

436
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,833
And based on the
suspect's profile,

437
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:34,333
the probability that
he'll show is 99.78%.

438
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,125
[FUWA] Indeed, because
camp's over after tomorrow.

439
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,000
And no way is our man gonna
let these top-tier trophies

440
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,791
slip through his fingers!

441
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,166
[TERASAKA]
Uh-huh.

442
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,625
[NAGISA]
Koro-sensei!

443
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,250
Okay, please say that he's
here to nab the bad guy, too.

444
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,250
That getup ain't exactly helpin'
me presume his innocence.

445
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,583
[FUWA] Look. He's so pissed
off at the real criminal,

446
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,333
just looking at all that
underwear gets him steamed.

447
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,208
[TERASAKA] Right.
Wrongfully accused my ass.

448
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,291
[KARMA]
Heads up.

449
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,541
[KAEDE]
Someone's here!

450
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,791
[NAGISA]
A big guy with a yellow head!

451
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:11,750
[FUWA]
I knew it!

452
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,416
[KARMA]
So it is a frame-up.

453
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,666
[TERASAKA] Look at him move,
that's not normal.

454
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,000
[KAEDE]
Uh-oh! He's getting away!

455
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Gotcha!

456
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,041
How dare you impersonate me
and act out my lurid fantasies!

457
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,958
Well, so long as everyone thinks
I'm pilfering unmentionables,

458
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,916
I might as well take yours!

459
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,666
[KORO-SENSEI laughing]

460
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,208
I dunno.

461
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,083
I think this might make him
worse than an underwear thief.

462
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,875
Hey, the eyewitness reports
were right about his laugh.

463
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,041
[KORO-SENSEI] Now. Let's see
your true face, Imposter!

464
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,125
Hang on, isn't that that guy...

465
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,541
...Mr. Karasuma's underling?

466
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
You?

467
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,666
What earthy reason could
you have for--? Ah!

468
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,708
[ALL gasp]

469
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,250
[SHIRO]
The government was kind enough

470
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,458
to let me have one of
Karasuma's men on loan.

471
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,791
I required a decoy

472
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,166
to lure you into this pen
of anti-Sensei sheets.

473
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,583
[SHIRO] Not unlike the ruse your
students devised on the island,

474
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,666
yes?

475
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,291
Such nimble minds
the young have.

476
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,541
Lure, confine, and strike.

477
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
That voice.

478
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,833
[SHIRO]
Now, then, Koro-sensei.

479
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,041
Let your final death
match begin.

480
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,041
[ITONA]
So strong, but compared to me...

481
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,541
[ITONA]
...so weak.
