1
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:11,375
[MEG] Hey, Nagisa. You figure
out who all's in your group?

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,625
My what?

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,166
[MEG] It's mine and Isogai's job
to keep track

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,416
of who's with who,
so let one of us know.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,333
--[NAGISA] Hm?
--You look confused.

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,291
She's talking about
next week's trip.

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Of all the--

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,833
Who in their right mind
schedules a class trip

9
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,500
this early in the year?!
Unbelievable!

10
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,208
I cannot say that I approve.

11
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,500
Then why are you
dressed like that?!

12
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,500
Geisha? Really?

13
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,375
[OKAJIMA]
It's actually kinda hot!

14
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Guilty as charged.

15
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,500
Yes, all right, I'll admit it.

16
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,250
I'm as excited about
this excursion as you.

17
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,958
[NAGISA] First midterms,
and now a class trip.

18
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,916
We have a pretty full calendar.
I mean, for assassins at least.

19
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,500
[KARASUMA] Everyone's aware
next week is our big,

20
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,875
overnight field trip
to Kyoto, yeah?

21
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,583
Well, not to put
a damper on the fun,

22
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,958
but you're still on the clock.

23
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,083
So, are we supposed to
try to kill him there?

24
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,708
That is the idea.

25
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:35,125
Kyoto is a very large city,
a lot more cosmopolitan

26
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,625
than this area.

27
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,791
For your safety, you'll be
touring in designated groups.

28
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,666
Koro-sensei will divide
his time between you.

29
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,333
[KARASUMA] There are
a lot of good sniper nests

30
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,916
in the big city.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,583
We plan to have sharpshooters
posted just about everywhere.

32
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,458
Lead your target into
the crosshairs,

33
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,250
and the reward money
will be parsed out

34
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,375
between you and
the lucky marksman.

35
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,250
So stick to the
sniper-friendly routes

36
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,708
and keep those eyes peeled.

37
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,125
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir.

38
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,208
[school bell chimes]

39
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,791
[NAGISA] So we're splittin' up
into groups, huh?

40
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,500
Hey, Karma. Do you
wanna be with us?

41
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,583
Count me in.

42
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,208
Uh, you're gonna
behave yourself, right?

43
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,625
No funny business?

44
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,458
No gettin' into fights
and all that stuff?

45
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,291
Yeah. Sure.
Don't worry, dude.

46
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,791
When I stir up trouble out
of town, let's just say...

47
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,875
...I know how to keep
witnesses from reporting it.

48
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,250
Oh, great! And now
he's part of our group.

49
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,625
Way to go!

50
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,750
Eh. What can I say?
We've been friends for a while.

51
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,750
So... Who else?

52
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,583
There's me, you, Sugino,
Kayano, should be two more.

53
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,625
Yep. Got it covered!
Okuda's in!

54
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,875
Still one shy.

55
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,958
You think our number six
should be a girl, too?

56
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,583
Heh-heh! No sweat. I foresaw
this and took the liberty

57
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,916
of enlisting
someone very special.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,666
Ladies and gentleman,
class idol, Kanzaki!

59
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,125
Ohh! I'm totally for it!

60
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,833
[NAGISA]
Nice girl, Kanzaki.

61
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,958
Doesn't exactly
stand out in a crowd,

62
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,541
but everyone in E Class
is nuts about her.

63
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,916
Good addition to
the group, I think.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,291
Thank you for letting me join!

65
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:57,958
I'm flattered.

66
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,333
Uh, yeah.

67
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,708
[KAEDE] Cool. So where
in Kyoto do we wanna go?

68
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:02,708
[SUGINO]
Good question.

69
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,666
Oh! You're all so cute.

70
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,000
Excited to walk the city
streets, boys and girls?

71
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,666
Ah, so young and naïve.

72
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,541
Yeah, well, you can just
stay here, Professor Bitch.

73
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,375
You can water the plants
while we're gone.

74
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,291
[HINANO]
Where should we go on day two?

75
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,791
[MEG]
I vote Higashiyama.

76
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,916
[ISOGAI] Remember, we have to
think about assassination.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,958
[MEG] But there's so much
cool stuff on this route.

78
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,833
Oh, no! If you bastards think

79
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,708
you're gonna deal me out of
this trip, think again!

80
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,125
What?!

81
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,791
You know, you're kinda
giving us mixed signals here!

82
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,250
[IRINA] Oh, I'll show you
mixed signals, copper top!

83
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,041
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

84
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
One for each of you!

85
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,208
What are those, sir?

86
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
They're field trip guidebooks!

87
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,500
--[grunting]
--[MIMURA] What the hell?

88
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,916
They're more like dictionaries!

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Just a little something

90
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,458
I threw together last night!

91
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,833
Included are: illustrations of
every major tourist attraction,

92
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,250
the top 100 local souvenirs
and where to find them,

93
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,041
travel self-defense techniques
from basic to advanced,

94
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,125
oh, and best of all: the
first edition comes with

95
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,458
a model of Kinjakuji!

96
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,375
[OKAJIMA] You are WAY too
excited about this trip!

97
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,333
[NAGISA] Koro-sensei likes
E Class to be prepared.

98
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,041
If the way things have been
going lately is any indication,

99
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,791
this is going to be
an educational trip.

100
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,083
I'm actually kinda stoked!

101
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,416
[SUGAYA] Whoa. Man, look
at those lucky jerks,

102
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,708
gettin' to ride first class.

103
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,458
And as always,
we're stuck in coach.

104
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,166
Yay for us, right, guys?

105
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,416
Now, now, boys and girls.
Try not to look so sour.

106
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,166
Rules are rules,
you know how this works.

107
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,791
The student handbook
states those of us

108
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,416
with the highest grade-point
average get dibs

109
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,291
on school funds.

110
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,291
Oh-ho! Is that the putrid stench

111
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,500
of abject poverty
filling my nostrils?

112
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,250
[IRINA]
Pardon me, boys.

113
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,958
[IRINA] Everyone having a
glamorous day so far?

114
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,333
[MAEHARA]
Um, Professor Bitch?

115
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,250
Why are you dressed like the
paparazzi should care

116
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,500
who you are?

117
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,458
[IRINA laughs]
When it comes to womanly wiles,

118
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,791
a femme fatale
pulls out all the stops.

119
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,041
Besides, travel is
no excuse not to look

120
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,208
devastatingly fashionable.

121
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,125
[KARASUMA]
You stick out like a sore thumb.

122
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,208
Go change. You're a chaperone,
not a runway model.

123
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,666
Oh, come on, lighten up!

124
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,083
What's wrong with
a little style?

125
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,416
These kids are
going to the city.

126
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,125
Shut up. Get changed now.

127
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,291
[IRINA sobs]

128
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,375
[MEG] She's a more
of a child than we are.

129
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,125
[ISOGAI] Maybe killing
rich dudes for a living

130
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,875
disconnects you from reality.

131
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,916
An excellent
place to corner him.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,625
Yeah!

133
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:19,083
[STUDENTS chattering]

134
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,958
[SUGINO] Huh. Has anybody
seen Koro-sensei?

135
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,666
Was he even at
the train station?

136
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,750
Holy--!

137
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,166
Not to pry, but is
there some reason

138
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,666
you're stuck to the window?!

139
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,583
[KORO-SENSEI] Uh...
I was stocking up on munchies

140
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,541
at the terminal and
lost track of time.

141
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,916
It's all right,
I'll just stay here

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
till we reach the next stop.
Cloaking engaged!

143
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,625
Nothing to see here. Just some
random clothes and luggage

144
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,000
stuck to the side of a train.

145
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,250
[NAGISA]
Worst. Camouflage. Ever.

146
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Whew...

147
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,208
Who knew traveling incognito
would be so exhausting?

148
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,958
Goodness me.

149
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,625
Might be a little easier
if you didn't bring

150
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,916
such a big suitcase.

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,958
No offense, but you
weird people out as it is.

152
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,375
And while we're
on the subject,

153
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,583
broadcasting that you're
in disguise defeats the purpose.

154
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,791
[KORO-SENSEI gasps]

155
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,708
[TOKA] Truth? It's a
lame disguise anyway.

156
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,000
Nobody's buyin' it.

157
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,541
Hey, Koro-sensei.

158
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,625
Try these.

159
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,000
Can't have your nose going
AWOL all the time, right?

160
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Wow! A perfect fit!

161
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,375
Custom carved to complement
the contours of your face.

162
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,750
You're welcome.

163
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,625
It's whatever, just a little
hobby of mine, no big.

164
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,166
Whoa! That's cool, Sugaya!

165
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,250
[KAEDE giggles] Isn't it awesome
how when you travel together

166
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,958
you see a whole
other side to people?

167
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,125
[NAGISA] Mm-hm! I don't know
what we'll learn about

168
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,875
each other on this trip but
I'm ready to be surprised.

169
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,750
Hey, guys, I'm gonna make a run
to the main car

170
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,916
and get us some drinks.
Anybody else feeling parched?

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,666
Uh, can I come with you, please?

172
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,125
[KAEDE]
Me, too!

173
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,833
--Isn't this cool?
--I love how space age it feels.

174
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,333
[KANZAKI]
Sorry. Excuse us.

175
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,000
[GIRLS giggling]

176
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,375
[PUNK A] What school
you s'pose they're from?

177
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,875
[RYUKI]
Kunugigaoka, probably.

178
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,500
How'd you like that?
A train full of smarties

179
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,000
from one of the best schools
in the country.

180
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,083
Tell me another.
Come on, her?

181
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,458
She don't look smart.

182
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,166
[RYUKI]
Hey. I have an idea.

183
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,500
Once we're in Kyoto,

184
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,166
whaddya say we have some
fun with these dweebs?

185
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,833
Nice!

186
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,750
[KORO-SENSEI sighs]

187
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,916
[MIMURA] So, bullet trains
actually give him

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,375
motion sickness?

189
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,208
You'll probably feel better
if you lay down

190
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,333
in our room for a while.

191
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Perhaps later...

192
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,208
I need to pop back over
to Tokyo for a moment first.

193
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,166
Koro-sensei forgot
his favorite pillow.

194
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,750
How is everything you
own not in that bag?!

195
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,416
Any luck?

196
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,458
It's gotta be in there, you
worked so hard on it, too.

197
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,916
[KANZAKI]
Mm-mm...

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,416
[KORO-SENSEI] I admire your
going through the trouble

199
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,708
of putting together an
itinerary, Kanzaki,

200
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,625
but if you can't
locate it, don't fret.

201
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,125
I have just the solution.

202
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,333
These handy dandy guidebooks
contain everything

203
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,500
you could possibly need.

204
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,750
[MAEHARA, OKAJIMA]
She made the itinerary

205
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,416
so we wouldn't have to
lug those things around!

206
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,166
I distinctly remember
putting it in my handbag.

207
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,166
I wonder if I
dropped it somewhere.

208
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,333
[MALE TEACHER A] So, uh,
tomorrow is your free-study day

209
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,166
in Kyoto, everybody got that?

210
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,208
Hey! Shut your traps
and listen for a second!

211
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,083
[RYUKI] Heh! Those jerks
from Kunugigaoka

212
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,708
are really gonna try to
squeeze all this

213
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,041
sight-seeing into one day?

214
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,208
[SUGINO] Nice spot.
For assassination, I mean.

215
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,291
Don't you think, Nagisa?

216
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,708
[NAGISA]
If the snipers can see it, sure.

217
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,000
[KAEDE] What a bizarre
field trip, right?

218
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,416
[NAGISA] Maybe.
But you gotta admit it's fun.

219
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,916
[KAEDE sighs]
Whatever we do,

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,875
we have to get green tea
warabimochi dumplings!

221
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,666
--[NAGISA chuckles]
--[OKUDA] That's a great idea!

222
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,291
We could put poison in them!

223
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,458
That's twisted!

224
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,916
[OKUDA] Not for us, silly.
For Koro-sensei.

225
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,125
Not too shabby.

226
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,708
We could take advantage
of his sweet tooth.

227
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,375
[KAEDE] That'd be a waste of
a perfectly good local treat!

228
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,875
Now if only we could
find a poison

229
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,875
that didn't give him
special powers.

230
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,208
[SUGINO] Not to be that guy,
but I gotta tell ya:

231
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,375
I was sorta hoping we could put
the whole assassination thing

232
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,875
on hold while we were here.

233
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,875
We're in Kyoto, people!

234
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,458
What do any of these sites have
to do with assassination?

235
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,958
[NAGISA]
You'd be surprised.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,166
[OKUDA]
Hold on, the Ryoma Sakamoto?

237
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,875
[KARMA] This is where
Omiya used to be.

238
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:10,916
The inn where Sakamoto was cut
down by assassins in 1867.

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,291
That's right.

240
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,583
And just a little further
down is Honnoji Temple.

241
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,958
Though it's moved a few
times since they built it.

242
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,916
Oh, yeah. Oda's death
counts as an assassination.

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,500
[NAGISA] Just think,
in these few city blocks

244
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,625
a slew of high-profile
assassinations went down.

245
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,875
Sure, Kyoto's always been the
heart of Japan,

246
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,625
but it's also a Mecca
for professional killers.

247
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,833
[SUGINO]
I never thought of it that way.

248
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,500
Guess you could say we're on
an "assassination vacation."

249
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,000
[NAGISA] Throughout history,
tons of targets have been

250
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,708
neutralized here, targets
whose lives the world

251
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,875
still feels the
repercussions of.

252
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:48,000
As far as that goes, Koro-sensei
is definitely in good company.

253
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,208
[OKUDA]
Cool! Next up is Yasaka Shrine!

254
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,458
[KANZAKI]
Uh-huh.

255
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,208
[KARMA sighs]
Mind if we take a break first?

256
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,583
I could really go for some
sugar-loaded Kyoto coffee

257
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,541
right about now.

258
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,041
[KAEDE]
Yay, sugar!

259
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,541
[KAEDE] Talk about off
the beaten path.

260
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,750
Gion is a ghost town
this far in.

261
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,208
[KANZAKI] Yeah. Places like
this put a cap on the number

262
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,625
of visitors they allow,

263
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,333
so you don't catch many people
just wandering around.

264
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,458
Secluded, lots of
good hiding places.

265
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,041
That's why I made sure
to put in on the itinerary.

266
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,250
It's ideal for assassination.

267
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,958
[KAEDE] Good job, Kanzaki!
You really do your homework!

268
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,625
I vote this is
where we do the deed!

269
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,000
[PUNK A]
"Ideal" is right.

270
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,500
[gasping]

271
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,416
It's also a great spot for
kidnappers to ply their trade.

272
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,875
[KAEDE]
Huh...?

273
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,625
[PUNKS laughing]

274
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,625
[RYUKI chuckles]

275
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,041
[PUNKS chuckling]

276
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,666
[RYUKI chuckles]

277
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,750
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way,

278
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,041
but, something tells me
you gentlemen aren't tourists.

279
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,958
Don't try to be
a hero, carrot top.

280
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,708
Hand over your
lady friends and wa--

281
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,875
[PUNK A grunts]

282
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,083
Y'see that? What did I tell you?

283
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,791
To hell with 'em.
Without any witnesses,

284
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,000
it's basically a
free-for-all, so go nuts!

285
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:07,875
--Hey!
--[KARMA] Hm?

286
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,583
I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

287
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,500
[PUNK B grunts]

288
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,125
[KARMA] Strong words for
a guy kissin' the sidewalk.

289
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,500
[KAEDE]
Let go of me!

290
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,291
[KANZAKI]
No! Stop!

291
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,958
[RYUKI]
What did we tell you?!

292
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,541
--[KARMA grunts]
--[KANZAKI gasps]

293
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,458
[KARMA grunting]

294
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,416
Leave him alone!

295
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,875
[NAGISA grunts]

296
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,291
[RYUKI]
Bring the car around.

297
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:33,333
Yeah, that's right.
Don't mess with us, dweebs.

298
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,416
[NAGISA] They crawled out of
the shadows like monsters.

299
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,125
Only these thugs are something
far worse than monsters.

300
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,541
They're high schoolers.

301
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,625
[PUNK B growls]

302
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,500
[OKUDA]
Nagisa! Sugino!

303
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,750
[NAGISA grunts]

304
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,166
Oh, thank goodness!
Are you two okay?

305
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,500
You all right, Okuda?

306
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,250
Those guys didn't do anything
to you, did they?

307
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,916
It's okay, I'm fine.

308
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,916
Sorry, I didn't know
what to do, so I just hid.

309
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,625
[KARMA] Don't sweat it.
You did the right thing.

310
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,666
[OKUDA]
Huh...?

311
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,083
[KARMA]
I think it's safe to assume

312
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,458
those guys are pretty hardcore.
We could go to the cops,

313
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,083
except they're the type who know
their way around the system.

314
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,875
Which is fine.

315
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,875
'Cause I'm the type who
likes to handle these things

316
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,333
personally, if you
know what I mean.

317
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,375
[SUGINO] Okay. Dude,
how do we even find them?

318
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,333
[RYUKI] I gave our buddies
a call and they're in.

319
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,791
We're gonna have ourselves a
li'l commemorative photo shoot

320
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,041
with you gals.
Feel free to scream.

321
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,291
No one'll hear ya 'cept for us.

322
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,916
[RYUKI] You. I seen you
somewhere before, right?

323
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,625
Sure I have.
Last summer in Tokyo.

324
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,583
Saw ya in that arcade.
Don't deny it.

325
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,041
[BOTH gasp]

326
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,791
[RYUKI]
My boys spotted you first,

327
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,208
told me to be on the
lookout for a party girl.

328
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,708
We was gonna
kidnap you then, but...

329
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,500
I guess you lucked out
and gave us the slip.

330
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,083
Who'd 'a thought
you were gonna go

331
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,708
to the school for geniuses?
No judgment, though.

332
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,750
I get it.

333
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,500
The higher you are
on the ladder,

334
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,791
the more you wanna
take a swan dive.

335
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,666
[KANZAKI gasps]

336
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,291
Don't worry about a thing.

337
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,750
Professor Ruin's gonna take
all night teachin' you

338
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,333
to dive like a pro.

I'll just say it, what kind of
"guidebook" covers this stuff?

341
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,583
[NAGISA] The sort of guidebook
an insanely thorough teacher

342
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,541
writes, apparently.

343
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,250
There's even a section
on how to deal with

comforting to know

00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,750
even you went through a phase.

Yeah.

in school and
building up my resume.

361
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,750
It was so suffocating, you know?

362
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,041
I just couldn't deal.
So I'd ditch the uniform,

363
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:16,291
glam myself out, and hang
where no one knew who I was.

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,208
What do you know?
I guess it has.

507
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,000
Thanks for coming to the rescue!

508
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't mention it. [giggles]

509
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,333
Why don't we carry on with
our field trip, boys and girls?

510
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,875
[SUGINO]
Aw, dang it.

511
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,875
We never got to try out
our assassination plan.

512
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,375
[OKUDA] Well, it really isn't
the time or place for that now.

513
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,958
[KARMA] Whatever.
We'll just try it tomorrow.

514
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,833
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]
Best of luck to you.

515
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,000
[NAGISA] When your target is
also an outstanding teacher,

516
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,958
it's the definition of "between
a rock and a hard place."
