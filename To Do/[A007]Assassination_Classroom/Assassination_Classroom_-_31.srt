00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,333
[NAGISA]
November: maturity month.

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:14,375
Everyone's really started
thinking for themselves.

3
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:15,958
Which is good.

4
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:19,791
Because we only have four months
left to assassinate Koro-sensei.

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:20,625
[STUDENTS gasp]

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:21,875
[footsteps]

7
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,458
[IRINA]
Is the Octopus for real?

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,791
He's giving you kids
career counseling now?

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:26,416
[STUDENTS gasp]

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,208
Wow, look at you!

11
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,333
In a normal outfit!

12
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,333
Yeah.

13
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,916
Thought I'd go for
cheap and plain.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,708
Just tryin' to fit in to your
regular old world, that's all.

15
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,250
[BOTH gasping]

16
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,666
Oh, come on.

17
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,625
Don't tell me all of a sudden
you wanna see more skin?

18
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,125
[OKAJIMA] No, leaving
more to the imagination

19
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,458
is somehow even sexier.

20
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,333
You've really grown as a person!

21
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:46,958
[NAGISA]
Uh.

22
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,166
[NAKAMURA laughs]

23
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,291
[NAGISA] Uh! Nakamura!
Did you write this?!

24
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,416
That's my future
you're messing with!

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,375
Sorry, sweetheart, men's
work just doesn't suit you.

26
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,500
[KARMA]
Hey, Nagisa.

27
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,208
[NAKAMURA, NAGISA]
Huh?

28
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,333
Which would you prefer,

29
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,708
Thailand or Morocco
after graduation?

30
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,958
I'm kinda partial
to Thailand myself.

31
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,166
[NAGISA]
Why do I get the feeling

32
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,333
everyone's dead-set
on neutering me?

33
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,583
[NAGISA sighs]

34
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,583
[SUGINO]
Careers? Seriously?

35
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,166
Why're we talking
about this stuff

36
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,916
when the Earth's on the
verge of being destroyed?

37
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,333
[NAGISA]
Hm. What do I wanna be?

38
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
A bureaucrat, eh?

39
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,083
Interesting choice.

40
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,250
If I may say so, administrative
duties seem rather, um,

41
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,125
restrained for someone
of your temperament.

42
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,166
Well, remember the last quake?

43
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,958
How the politicians were
completely useless?

44
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,000
[KORO-SENSEI] I won't
disagree with you on that.

45
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,541
[KARMA] The country should've
been paralyzed, but it wasn't.

46
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,458
Everything kept functioning.

47
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,916
Who do we have to thank?

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,750
Behind every talking
head at a podium

49
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,750
is some bureaucrat
pulling the strings.

50
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,458
That's what real
power's all about.

51
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,833
Does that make sense?

52
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
You know, I take it back,

53
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,666
that's a good fit for you.

54
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,250
[KARMA]
Take my advice, Terasaka.

55
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,500
Don't be a politician.

56
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,833
Huh?

57
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,458
I mean, sure: people love
seeing a big-mouthed,

58
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,666
impulsive idiot on the ballot,
don't get me wrong.

59
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,083
It's just that making you
a puppet'd be way too easy.

60
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:53,833
Huh.

61
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,083
You're delusional, man.

62
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,958
Like I'd be somebody's puppet!

63
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,458
Who the hell said I
wanna be a politician?

64
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Nakamura.

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,666
You aspire to be a diplomat?

66
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,250
Oh, to aim so far above
one's modest beginnings.

67
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,416
[laughs]

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,958
You don't have to put
it like that, sir.

69
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,791
Believe it or not,
back in primary school

70
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,833
they said I was a
certifiable genius.

71
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,000
In first grade,

72
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,333
I actually tested at
a sixth-grade level.

73
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,875
I always placed in
the top of my class.

74
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,125
The thing is...
it really sucked.

75
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,041
I just wanted to be normal.

76
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,291
Not caring about grades,
goofing off with your friends:

77
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,125
that's normal.

78
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,541
So, when I made it to
Kunugigaoka, I played dumb.

79
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,375
After a while it wasn't an act.

80
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,958
Then I saw how disappointed
my parents were,

81
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,708
and the importance of what
I'd thrown away really hit me.

82
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,208
I still wanted to joke around,

83
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,791
but I knew I needed
to apply myself, too.

84
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,041
[NAKAMURA] This class is
the best of both worlds.

85
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,583
What I mean is... Thank you.

86
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Aw...

87
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,666
[HINANO]
Miss Irina! Miss Irina!

88
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,666
Can I hear more of
the story, please?

89
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,083
[NAGISA]
To look at them,

90
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,083
you wouldn't believe anyone's
thinking all that hard.

91
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,958
But they are.

92
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,583
[KAEDE gasps]
Uh-oh.

93
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,083
Miss Irina's top.

94
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,000
The tag's still on.

95
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,708
[KARMA] She's not used to
buying stuff off the rack.

96
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,291
You think maybe we
should tell her?

97
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,625
[NAGISA]
I'll take care of it.

98
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,125
Believe me, I earned that car.

99
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,166
Putting the moves on the
CEO of a tech company

100
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,833
is challenging to say the least.

101
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,916
Oh, yes.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,166
For one thing, the hours
are atrocious...

103
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,916
...if Karasuma hadn't forbidden
me to drive the damn thing here.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,125
He says I won it by
defrauding a man.

105
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,916
"I'm Karasuma and I hate fun!"

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,083
[HINANO, TOKA laugh]

107
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:34,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Okey-dokey.

108
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,000
Last but not least.

109
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,458
So, have you decided
on a prospective career,

110
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,166
Nagisa m'boy?

111
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:45,541
Sir, I... I think, well, uh.

112
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,333
I think I have a talent
for killing people.

113
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,291
I'm pretty sure I could get to
where I do what the Reaper does.

114
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,041
We all know I don't have
any other strengths.

115
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:00,291
So, I mean, what else can I
reasonably shoot for, right?

116
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,791
[NAGISA]
Koro-sensei, should I...

117
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,416
Should I become an assassin?

118
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,583
Please, sir. What path
should I follow?

119
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,583
'Cause I don't know.

120
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,500
[KORO-SENSEI] You're a
sensible young man, Nagisa.

121
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,166
And a good student.

122
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,875
I'm sure you would've
weighed the risks

123
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,458
of becoming an assassin
before coming to me with this.

124
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,458
For the record, you have
a gift for the work.

125
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,250
No one who's seen you in
action could doubt that.

126
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,458
Whether facing an
otherworldly monster,

127
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,166
an unhinged teacher, or an
evil genius, you prevail.

128
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,833
Your attacks are thought-out,
well-timed, and without fear.

129
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,291
All indispensable qualities
for a master killer.

130
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
That said, of course.

131
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,500
While you are courageous,
there's a tinge of desperation.

132
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,916
[NAGISA]
Uh!

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,750
[KORO-SENSEI] You never
give your safety, or dignity,

134
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,458
a second thought.
You strike without fear

135
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,625
because you feel you
have nothing to lose.

136
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,250
To what end should your
talents be put to use?

137
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,583
More importantly, for whom?

138
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,041
Reexamine those
questions more closely.

139
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:12,291
We'll talk again after you've
done a bit more soul searching.

140
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,500
I give you my word,

141
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,583
if you still wish
to be an assassin,

142
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,708
I'll support that decision
wholeheartedly.

143
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,208
[NAGISA sighs]

144
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,500
[BOY A] Whoa! You beat it?
Even the secret boss?

145
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,958
Not my first time.

146
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,916
I had to play it twice before
I got enough experience.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,416
Oh, I see, I'll
start over. Cool!

148
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,208
[BOY B laughs]

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,291
--[door opens]
--[NAGISA] I'm home.

150
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:39,166
[HIROMI] Welcome back, Nagisa.
Have a seat, please.

151
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,958
[NAGISA]
Sure, mom. What's up?

152
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,750
[HIROMI]
Not your grades, certainly.

153
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,250
Fifty-fourth on midterms?

154
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,833
The cutoff for being
permitted back

155
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,833
onto the regular campus
is fiftieth place.

156
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,708
I'm disappointed,
but don't lose hope.

157
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,041
Tanaka's older brother
was once sixtieth.

158
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,750
Of course, this was
three years ago now,

159
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,916
but he managed to bounce back.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,333
The school made an
exception for him

161
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:05,166
on account of his family's
rather generous donation.

162
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,458
The same gesture
should work for us.

163
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,791
Whatever gets you out
of that dreadful E-Class.

164
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,791
The sooner the better.

165
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:11,791
[gasps]

166
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,875
I'll be scheduling
an appointment

167
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,208
with Mr. Ono of D Class

168
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,000
very soon and I expect
you to come with me.

169
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,625
[NAGISA]
No, wait! You... you can't!

170
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,083
Please! You gotta let me stay
where I am for right now!

171
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,708
I know you don't like it,
but honestly,

172
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,291
I'm bringing my grades up,
and it's a lot of fun!

173
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,541
Look, I'll go to whatever
college you want, I swear!

174
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,333
But for junior high
I really, really--!

175
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,625
[gasps]

176
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,166
[NAGISA]
Uh-oh.

177
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,916
She's in one of her
moods, not good.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,125
Here it comes.

179
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,291
[HIROMI growls]

180
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,375
[HIROMI] Shut that filthy,
ungrateful mouth!

181
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,375
I did not raise my son to be
driftwood, do you understand me?

182
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,958
Do want to live the rest of your
life in the shadow of failure?

183
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,500
You have no idea what it's like!

184
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,958
I work and slave to spare you
the fate of your poor mother

185
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,833
and this is that thanks I get!

186
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,333
Do you think money
grows on trees?!

187
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,666
You think I just pulled this
donation out of thin air?!

188
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,208
Well I've got news for you!

189
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,500
I put myself through hell
to secure your future!

190
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,458
Who do you think you are?!

191
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,041
[NAGISA] There's no talking
to her when she's like this.

192
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,833
It's my fault for not
bringing this up

193
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,625
when she was in a better mood.

194
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,250
I'm sorry, mom.

195
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,083
I was being selfish.
I wasn't thinking.

196
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,333
[HIROMI grunts]

197
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,375
[NAGISA] Dad doesn't have
the stomach for confrontation.

198
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,916
This is why he walked out on us.

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,875
[HIROMI]
Now, then.

200
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,166
You listen to me.

201
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,708
You're a child.

202
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,416
You have no earthly idea how
to make your way through life.

203
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,958
But mother knows all
the twists and turns.

204
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,333
I won't let you end up
like your father and I.

205
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,541
See, I have it all planned
out, just trust me.

206
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,375
The long-term goal is to get
you into Keisetsu University.

207
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,708
[NAGISA] One of the top
schools in the country.

208
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,916
Mom didn't make the cut.

209
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,375
It's a great alma mater.

210
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,833
Big companies take notice.

211
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,708
In the real world,
it's not what you know,

212
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,750
it's who you know: school
ties are everything.

213
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,083
A Keisetsu graduate could
even have a shot at working

214
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,250
for an elite corporation
like Hishimaru!

215
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,958
[NAGISA] They're a famous
company, who didn't hire her.

216
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,000
[HIROMI sighs]
Have I ever told you

217
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,041
how badly I wanted
a little girl?

218
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,000
[NAGISA]
Only about a million times.

219
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,541
[HIROMI] Your grandparents
discouraged me

220
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,625
from being too feminine.

221
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,541
It was always studying
and hard work.

222
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,208
That's why Hishimaru
didn't want me.

223
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,958
They're all about looks.

224
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,958
I promised myself
if I had a daughter,

225
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,500
she'd get to wear are the frilly
things I was never allowed to.

226
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,958
Ah!

227
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,083
See how nice this looks with
your beautiful, long hair?

228
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,916
[NAGISA]
Yeah. Looks great.

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,750
Except I'm a boy.

230
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,083
It's chilling how
determined she is.

231
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,291
I don't think I'll ever be able
to get out from under her.

232
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,500
Koro-sensei saw right
through me.

233
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,833
I'm not, and never will be,
the hero of my own life.

234
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,875
Not even close. It's her RPG.

235
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,250
I'm just her new play through.

236
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,750
[HIROMI]
Oh, and by the way.

237
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,916
Just so you know, I'll be
dropping by the school tomorrow

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,833
to meet with your
teacher for a transfer.

239
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,125
[NAGISA]
Huh?!

240
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,500
That's a little out
of the blue, mom!

241
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,958
I think he might be busy!

242
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,041
It's for the best,
Nagisa dear.

243
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,791
Now, if I were you, I'd say
goodbye to my E-Class friends.

244
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,083
[NAGISA]
She's gone dark again.

245
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,833
Nothing I say will
make any difference.

246
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
I see.

247
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,166
Your mother seems to
be rather single-minded.

248
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,500
[NAGISA] Yeah, I know.
What do I do now?

249
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,791
She won't listen
to a word I say.

250
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,083
Mr. Karasuma's out
of town on business.

251
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,750
I can't ask one of
his subordinates

252
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,083
to meet with her on his behalf.

253
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,125
I'm just... I can't.

254
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,750
I'm not ready to
leave E-Class yet.

255
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Now, now.

256
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,041
Don't you worry about a thing.

257
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,041
I'm a super being capable
of destroying the planet,

258
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,583
after all.

259
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,333
A simple parent-teacher meeting
should be a walk in a park!

260
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,875
[NAGISA] Uh... I'm
not so sure about that.

261
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,000
[SUGINO]
Wow, seriously? Your mom?

262
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,583
She's one tough cookie.

263
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,541
Koro-sensei seems pretty sure
he can handle her, but...

264
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,875
I see no reason I couldn't
play your teacher.

265
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,041
[NAGISA]
Uh?

266
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,125
Problem is, officially
it's Mr. Karasuma.

267
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,583
His name's on file.

268
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,666
If our parents talk to each
other it won't add up.

269
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,708
Mm. Yeah. Good call.

270
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,416
[KORO-SENSEI] Ha, ha, ha.
There's a simple solution.

271
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,875
Yours truly becomes
Tadaomi Karasuma.

272
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,500
[NAGISA]
Koro-sensei?

273
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ha!

274
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:11,916
Why, no!

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,583
I'm Karasuma!

276
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,291
[OKAJIMA, SUGINO]
Worst cosplay ever!

277
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,291
[NAKAMURA] Did you draw lines
on your face with a marker?!

278
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
It's a furrowed brow

279
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,333
to accentuate his
bleak worldview.

280
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,791
Details!

281
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,625
[MIMURA] Why do your arms
look like summer sausages?!

282
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,250
[KORO-SENSEI] These are
Karasuma's bulging muscles!

283
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,583
[MIMURA]
You look ridiculous!

284
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,166
[NAGISA] All I can do
at this point is pray.

285
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,875
With any luck, mom will
fall for the charade.

286
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,375
Please just let me
stay in E-Class.

287
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,833
[MIMURA]
That's Nagisa's mom?

288
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,375
[OKAJIMA]
She's a knockout.

289
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,000
[MAEHARA]
More like she'll knock you out.

290
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,541
[HIROMI]
It's a pleasure to meet you.

291
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,250
I'm Ms.Shiota, Nagisa's mother.

292
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes, yes. Please, have a seat.

293
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,458
Good to see you.

294
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,166
Trekking up the mountain
is quite a journey,

295
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,333
you must be tired.

296
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,333
Might I offer you a
refreshing beverage?

297
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,291
[NAGISA]
I...

298
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,166
I guess it's kinda convincing?

299
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
If I may say so, madam,

300
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,000
you're quite stunning.

301
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,083
I see where Nagisa
gets his looks.

302
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,875
[HIROMI gasping]

303
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,500
[HIROMI]
Why, thank you!

304
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,833
You know, if only this one
had been born a girl,

305
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,750
I'd have groomed her
to be my ideal!

306
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,291
Not quite sure I follow you.

307
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,416
Well, you see.

308
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,875
I wasn't allowed to
wear my hair long

309
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,791
and a girl is ever so much
prettier with flowing locks.

310
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,333
Oh, Nagisa,

311
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,583
what I wouldn't give to have
had lovely, full-bodied hair.

312
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,875
I was so mad when he
started tying it back

313
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,125
for school this year.
But it looked so good,

314
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,875
I just had to let it slide as
long as he wouldn't cut it off.

315
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,000
[HIROMI]
Ah.

316
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,375
But we're here to
discuss his future.

317
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,500
We can't afford to discourage
them at this age.

318
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,333
They're far too impressionable,
in my experience.

319
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,958
You're familiar with Kei U?

320
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,541
They've accepted
several graduates

321
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,833
from Kunugigaoka High School.

322
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,166
I'd very much like
Nagisa to go one day,

323
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,208
but I'm afraid being so far
off track in Junior High

324
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,375
will hurt his chances.

325
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,791
So I've come here,
with all due respect,

326
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,208
to talk about what we can do
to get him out of E-Class.

327
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,666
And I trust you spoke
with Nagisa on the matter?

328
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,875
Oh, he's too young to
understand what's at stake,

329
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,500
believe me. And at any rate,

330
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,541
it's my job as a parent
to steer him clear

331
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,375
of the mistakes
I made at his age.

332
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,500
[NAGISA]
Mom. I, don't--

333
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,541
[HIROMI]
Hush up now, sweetheart,

334
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,833
the adults are talking.

335
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,500
Uh.

336
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,833
[KORO-SENSEI exhales]
Yes, well...

337
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,458
I believe I'm starting to get a
clearer picture of how Nagisa

338
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,916
became the person
he is today.

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,791
[NAGISA]
Huh?

340
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,083
[BOTH]
Ugh!

341
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,250
[KORO-SENSEI] Yes. Indeed.
I, Tadaomi Karasuma,

342
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,166
wear a toupee!

343
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,208
[KORO-SENSEI] High schools,
colleges, and hairstyles.

344
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,375
Ma'am, forgive me for saying so,

345
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,708
are decidedly not a
parent's prerogative!

346
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,916
Nagisa must be permitted
to live his own life.

348
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,708
You'll get nowhere foisting
your complexes onto him.

349
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,375
Ms. Shiota. Let me
be perfectly clear.

350
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,250
Unless Nagisa so desires,

351
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,833
he will not be allowed
to leave E-Class.

352
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,416
Uh.

353
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,791
[HIROMI] What's the hell
is your problem?!

354
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,916
Since when does a teacher
talks like that to a parent?!

355
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,958
How dare you?!

356
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,416
"Foisting my
complexes onto him"?!

357
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,750
If you think I'll sit by--

358
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,583
[OKAJIMA]
Whoa.

359
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,958
[MAEHARA]
Holy crap!

360
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,666
That is one seriously
pissed of lady right there!

361
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,541
Of course! That
explains your attitude

362
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,208
at home lately, this bald
idiot's been giving you ideas!

363
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,583
Well, watch this!

364
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,500
When I'm done with you,
your eyes will be wide open!

365
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Koro-sensei.

366
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hm.

367
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,583
That was a bit more
tactless than I'd planned.

368
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,208
Still, though...

369
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,125
There's a lesson
to be learned here.

370
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,583
You need to communicate
your intentions

371
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,958
more clearly from now on,

372
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,666
speak your mind.

373
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,333
It's not that easy.

374
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,500
Mom won't listen
to anything I say.

375
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,958
She only sees me as her
second play though.

376
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,541
[KORO-SENSEI] It's not as
though you're powerless.

377
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,083
If assassination is your
forte, what can't you do?

378
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,833
The first round of your
own RPG started here

379
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,708
in this classroom,
remember that.

380
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,833
[NAGISA]
My first. My first round.

381
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,500
[NAGISA]
Looks great, thanks.

382
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,291
[HIROMI]
Sorry for earlier, darling.

383
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,000
I ought not have blown up
at your teacher like that.

384
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,916
It's just that I'm so invested.

385
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,750
Yeah.

386
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, anyway.

387
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,208
I've been doing quite a
bit of thinking today.

388
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,583
And I've decided I simply will
not have someone who thinks

389
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,791
they know better than me
interfering with my life.

390
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,250
Period.

391
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,791
All obstacles must be removed.

392
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,791
It's time I gave you
a new outlook on life.

393
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,333
Nagisa.

394
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,791
[NAGISA]
Wha... What the...?

395
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,208
Mom?

396
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,583
[HIROMI] This is where it all
started going downhill.

397
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,666
When you started disobeying me.

398
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,541
This place turned
into a monster.

399
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,250
[NAGISA groans]

400
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,500
Burn it to the ground.

401
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,000
With your own hands.

402
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,083
Get your life back on track.

403
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,750
Mom, please.
What're you doing?

404
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,791
Calm down!

405
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,875
[HIROMI]
Mother knows best, honey.

406
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,458
Listen to me.

407
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,083
Burn it down and the guilt will
keep you from being able to face

408
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,666
any of these people again.

409
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,000
Plus, with the building gone,

410
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,458
the main campus
will have no choice

411
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,166
but to take you back in, yes?

412
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,333
[NAGISA]
No! I don't want to!

413
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,166
I brought you into
this world, Nagisa!

414
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,750
I scraped to send you to cram
school, then private school!

415
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,291
You have no idea
what it cost me!

416
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,250
I do everything for you!

417
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,875
Every night dinner's
on the table,

418
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,708
no matter how exhausted
I am from work!

419
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,083
Does E-Class do that for you?!

420
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,416
I made you who you
are! You owe me!

421
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,666
You will do what I tell you!

422
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,291
[NAGISA]
She's wrong.

423
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,958
But she's right.

424
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:36,333
How do I tell her,
what do I say?

425
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,791
[KORO-SENSEI] You need to
communicate your intentions

426
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,875
more clearly from now on,
speak your mind.

427
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,208
Mom, listen. I--

428
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,250
[BOTH gasp]

429
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,625
[ASSASSIN A] How 'bout you
quit shrieking, you old bag.

430
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,083
Sit back and enjoy the
show like a good girl, hm?

431
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,333
[NAGISA] That bloodlust.
He's an assassin!

432
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,125
Actually, it's you
who's in my way.

433
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,458
It's Wednesday night.

434
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,625
He comes here to watch
his favorite TV shows

435
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,583
on the Autonomous Artillery.

436
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,875
He'll shoot through here
at the speed of sound,

437
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,208
and when he does,

438
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,625
I'll split his head open
with my whip and kill him.

439
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,041
[HIROMI]
Kill? Oh, dear.

440
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,208
I have to call the police--!

441
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,375
[gasps]

442
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,500
Wouldn't do that if I were you.

443
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,708
The bounty's void
if I kill the kid,

444
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,833
but nothing in the rules
says I can't take out

445
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,083
a whiney old hag.

446
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,958
[HIROMI whimpering]

447
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,416
[NAGISA]
Okay. She's afraid.

448
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Which probably means the
assassin has his guard down.

449
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,833
Mom.

450
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,666
I've spent my whole life
learning how to read you.

451
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,000
It's given me a very
specific set of skills.

452
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,875
Maybe not the ones
you'd prefer me to have,

453
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,833
but they come in very handy.

454
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,750
Especially in E-Class.

455
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,333
[KORO-SENSEI] The first round
of your own RPG started here

456
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,583
in this classroom,
remember that.

457
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,541
[HIROMI whimpers]

458
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,541
[NAGISA]
Mom. Believe it or not,

459
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,333
I'm giving this class
everything I've got.

460
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,583
Before I graduate,
I'll get results.

461
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,083
And when I do,

462
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,750
I'm cutting my hair,

463
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,791
and paying back every scrap
you've spent on me.

464
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,375
[whimpers]

465
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,583
[NAGISA] If you can't find it
in your heart to forgive me...

466
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,375
What is this?

467
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,041
[NAGISA]
...then I'll graduate again,

468
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,750
from you.

469
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,458
[clap]

470
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,750
[ASSASSIN A gagging]

471
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,750
[gasps]

472
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,916
[NAGISA]
Mom.

473
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,291
I'm grateful that you had me.

474
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,166
Grateful that you raised me.

475
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,416
It may be asking a lot,

476
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,166
but if you can just be happy
that you have a child.

477
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,333
That, all things considered,
turned out relatively okay,

478
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,666
that's all I need to be happy.

479
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,291
Who are you, Nagisa?

480
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,833
What in the world have you done?

481
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Certain unsavory types

482
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
have made this their
after hours hangout,

483
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:59,291
I recommend you give the
area a wide berth at night.

484
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,791
Koro-sensei.

485
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
For the record,

486
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,625
you just vowed to kill
me before March.

487
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,333
No takesies-backsies!

488
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,166
[grunts]

489
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,583
You heard all that, huh?

490
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Now, then, ma'am.

491
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,416
Nagisa has quite a bit of
growing left to do, I agree.

492
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,166
What he needs more than
anything is a loving mother.

493
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,833
Don't take his stubbornness
so personally.

494
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,625
Every little birdie needs to
leave the nest at some point,

495
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,583
that's the way of things.

496
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,541
[HIROMI]
My baby is...

497
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:31,083
pulling away. He's leaving me.

498
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,416
Mom, no!

499
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
It's all right.

500
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,583
The adrenaline rush
got the best of her.

501
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,041
Why don't I take the two
of you back to her car?

502
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,291
I'll drive you home.

503
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
So tell me, Nagisa.

504
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,666
If you did manage
to assassinate me,

505
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,041
would you marshal your talent

506
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,208
toward becoming a
full-fledged professional?

507
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,583
Good question.

508
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,375
I don't know.

509
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,791
Probably not.

510
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,250
I mean, when we're
talking about talent.

511
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,375
It's not like it's only for
one thing or the other.

512
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,041
I'd be good at killing,

513
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,750
but I'd be good at
protecting people, too.

514
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,916
But definitely not by
being an assassin.

515
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,500
Way too dangerous for me.

516
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,833
I'd rather find a career that
wouldn't worry my folks.

517
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,791
[KORO-SENSEI] No rush.
You have plenty of time.

518
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,166
Ah, and keep in mind:

519
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,625
with your parents,
communication is key.

520
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,916
[NAGISA]
Right.

521
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ugh! Come on,

522
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,000
there's no cross traffic!

523
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,250
How long does it take
to get a green light?!

524
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,833
[NAGISA sighs]

525
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,875
[HIROMI]
And what's all this?

526
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,375
[NAGISA] I'm making
breakfast from now on.

527
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,250
So, uh, you can take it
easy in the mornings now.

528
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,333
I'll start taking
out the trash, too.

529
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,125
And hey, I promise to
get into a high school

530
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,708
every bit as good
as Kunugigaoka!

531
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,250
Just please, mom.

532
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,666
Let me stay in E.

533
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,916
If that's what you want, fine.

534
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,541
I really couldn't care less.

535
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,750
[NAGISA]
Ha!

536
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,166
[NAGISA]
I'm an assassin!

537
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,875
Holding my head high
till graduation!
