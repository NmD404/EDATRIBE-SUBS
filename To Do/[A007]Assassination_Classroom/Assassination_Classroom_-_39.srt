1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,250
I'm not even sure it's possible.

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,833
But instead of
killing Koro-sensei,

3
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,041
I think we should
try to save him.

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,500
[MIMURA]
Save him?

5
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,416
By like, finding a way to keep
him from self-detonating

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,250
come March, or what?

7
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,625
Where do we start?

8
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,125
Well, I don't know. Yet.

9
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,166
But...

10
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,041
Totally! I'm game!

11
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,458
Koro-sensei's way too good
of a bug-hunting buddy

12
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,250
to let explode!

13
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,625
Kurahashi...

14
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,000
Thank you for bringing it up.

15
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,375
If you hadn't said
something, I would've.

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,541
Saving him's
the least we can do.

17
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,958
So you're on board?

18
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,166
[SUMIRE]
Seems appropriate.

19
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,041
It is what this class
has been leading to.

20
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,416
Damn right. I'm in!

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,541
Far as I'm concerned,
it's a whole new challenge!

22
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,750
Like a new show, sort of.

23
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,583
I really don't wanna
live with the guilt.

24
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,250
I mean we're obligated
to at least give it a shot.

25
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,333
Guys, you...

26
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,958
[NAGISA]
Thank goodness...

27
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,750
They feel the same way I do.

28
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,250
[SUGINO]
Amen to that, Okano!

29
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,625
[STUDENTS murmur, laugh]

30
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:11,458
I really hate to be the one
who spoils the mood...

31
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,000
...but I'm against it.

32
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,416
[ALL]
Huh?

33
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,208
[NAKAMURA] We're assassins.
He's the target.

34
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,750
That's our bond.

35
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,250
Koro-sensei said so himself.

36
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,083
I don't know about you,
but I cherish that bond.

37
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,291
Think about it.

38
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,625
Not killing him would
defeat the purpose.

39
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,958
Nakamura, I...

40
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,000
You're against it?

41
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,875
We get wantin' to
save him and all.

42
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,750
but how do we know
it's even doable?

43
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,375
Well, I...

44
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,541
You act like you're the only one
who's been thinkin' about this.

45
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,250
Also, what happens if
the clock runs out on us

46
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,750
before we find a way?
Did you consider that?

47
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,875
Seriously. You want the
Octopus's last thought to be

48
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,291
"Damn, my students
are a bunch of half-asses"?

49
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,666
No! But--

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,666
We owe it to him!

51
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,250
Always the talented ones, huh?

52
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,791
Figuring whatever the odds,

53
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,208
in the end, things
will always work out.

54
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,250
Wow. Listen to you.

55
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,708
Getting a tad full of
yourself there, chief.

56
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,583
Granted, you're the most
gifted one in our class.

57
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,166
But seriously.

58
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,416
We should just up and scrap
the whole assassination plan?

59
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,041
What about the underdogs?

60
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,708
Those of us who work ourselves
sick just to squeak by

61
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,958
on what little talent we have.
How're we supposed to feel?

62
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,166
You're like a hot chick
tellin' her homely friends

63
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,166
there's no point
trying to find a man.

64
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,333
'Course you don't have a problem
with changing the rules.

65
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,750
You've already won the game.

66
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,833
That... That's not
what I'm trying to say...

67
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:12,833
Besides...

68
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,166
I'm not the gifted one.

69
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,625
Between you and me,
you're the better assassin.

70
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:20,083
Okay, hearing you talk like that
just pisses me off even more.

71
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,000
You know what your
problem is, Nagisa?

72
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,750
You've got no respect for how
hard this is for everyone

73
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,916
who isn't you.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,083
Whoa, whoa!
Where is this coming from?!

75
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,250
I'm just telling you how I feel!

76
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,958
Do you have an axe to grind
with Koro-sensei or something?!

77
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,583
He took us to the movies!
He's made learning fun!

78
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,458
That's my point! Why do you
think he bothered?! Huh?!

79
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,250
He didn't want us to
end up like a bunch of

80
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,750
whiney, half-assed jerks!
And look at you!

81
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,666
Assassinating him is what
this entire class is based on.

82
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,250
You're just trying
to find a loophole!

83
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,666
You wanna undermine
what Koro-sensei's done?

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,666
Or do you have the mind and
the body of a ten-year-old?

85
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,041
[KARMA]
Ah. What's with that look?

86
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,541
Aw, the itty-bitty mouse
wanna roar?

87
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,416
Feel like he could
take on a lion?

88
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
No, I...

89
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,958
[KARMA]
Got somethin' to say?

90
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,875
Kick my ass for once and
you can say whatever you like.

91
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,375
Oh, don't be shy.
What're you afraid of?

92
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,791
Let's settle this like men.

93
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,166
C'mon! Ha!

94
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,375
[gasps]
A flying triangle hold!

95
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:34,291
[NAGISA] I am not...
a whiney, half-assed jerk!

96
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,041
Well, all right then.
When did Nagisa learn that move?

97
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,083
Um...

98
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,083
[KIMURA] He's still no match for
Karma in hand-to-hand combat.

99
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,875
You little...!

100
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,416
[MAEHARA]
Knock it off!

101
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,875
[ISOGAI] What the hell are the
two of you trying to prove?!

102
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,250
[MAEHARA] Okay! I don't
think I can hold him back!

103
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,833
[MAEHARA] Damn it, Karma!
Will you chill out already?

104
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,416
[KORO-SENSEI] A good
old-fashioned schoolyard fight?

105
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,625
Outstanding!

106
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,291
However, you're the
Assassination Classroom!

107
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,375
This is how we settle
our differences!

108
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,791
[STUDENTS]
What kind of mediator are you?!

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,458
Oh, these are just
red and blue paintballs.

110
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,041
[KORO-SENSEI] Red for those who
feel I must be liquidated.

111
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,333
Blue for those
who beg to differ.

112
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,791
Before we begin, I want each
of you to state his or her

113
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,000
position clearly and
choose a color.

114
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,333
Then, after battling it out
on the mountainside

115
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:36,791
like civilized human beings, the
winning team's opinion prevails.

116
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,041
[gasping]

117
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Absolutely no grudges allowed!

118
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,875
Seem fair?

119
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
For the record...

120
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,666
Whatever the outcome,
I'll respect your decision,

121
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,583
provided you defend it
with everything you have.

122
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,625
You are all a family.

123
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,125
I can't abide for my students
to be at odds with each other.

124
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,750
If you truly care about me,
promise what we've built here

125
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,291
won't crumble into discord.

126
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,833
Well, guys?

127
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,458
Right. Let's do it.

128
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,125
[ISOGAI]
To kill or not to kill.

129
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:27,416
'Kay, then. So, guess
I'll choose a side.

130
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,208
Me, too.

131
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,750
[RYUNOSUKE] The insta-kill
shot's almost there.

132
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,750
We've put a lot of work into it.

133
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,958
[RYUNOSUKE] And, as for who,
or what, got us this far...

134
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,500
[HAYAMI] ...I'm sure he'd want
to see us take it all the way.

135
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,458
We keep our eyes on the target.

136
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,000
Chiba... Hayami, you...

137
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,791
[KAEDE]
My mind's made up.

138
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,083
I've already tried
to assassinate him once,

139
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,125
and I regret it.

140
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,750
I want Koro-sensei to
live as long as possible.

141
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,375
My sister felt the same way;

142
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,958
must run in the
family or something.

143
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,875
[KAEDE]
No more death.

144
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,958
He's entitled to our protection.

145
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,041
[KAEDE]
Having a thing for assassins

146
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,083
runs in the family, too...

147
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,166
[OKUDA] The power
of science is limitless!

148
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,500
If it can sow
destruction, then surely

149
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,416
it can find a way to save!

150
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,125
Right. And it's not
as though hope is slim,

151
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,708
we can do anything together.

152
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,125
I know we can.

153
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,083
[OKAJIMA]
Sorry, but us hands-on types?

154
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,833
We kinda see this assassination
as our big final project.

155
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:35,875
[OKAJIMA grunts]

156
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,458
If Koro-sensei's
gonna die anyway,

157
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,458
showing him our masterpiece
will be his going away present.

158
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,500
[KIMURA] Justice is a tricky
concept for a kid like me,

159
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,583
you're the one who
taught me to respect it.

160
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,166
My choice is clear:
Gotta live up to my name.

161
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,458
[KANZAKI]
I suppose I'm selfish.

162
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,041
I want him to keep
giving us good advice.

163
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,041
[KIRARA] Save the planet
or save our teacher?

164
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,375
Blah, blah, blah.

165
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,333
We're just goin'
around in circles.

166
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,208
I'm more of a cut-to-the-chase
kind of gal.

167
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,958
[TOKA] If you can't be true
to your own feelings,

168
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,916
what hope is there in life?
I want him to live, that's that.

169
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,375
[MAEHARA] Couldn't have
said it better myself.

170
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,833
We're simple guys at heart,
the two of us.

171
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,708
We wanna save him 'cause we
wanna save him, y'know?

172
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,875
Right?

173
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,166
Sure. As long as I can
still be sensitive

174
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,833
to everyone else's needs.

175
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:37,791
[ITONA] I'm a simple guy.
I joined this class to kill him.

176
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:42,125
I've learned a lot.
Even made a few friends.

177
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,625
Coming up with ways
to kill him has been fun.

178
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,375
So, yeah.
More of that, please.

179
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,791
[RITSU]
It may be my prime directive,

180
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,708
but after several attempts to
assassinate Koro-sensei,

181
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,416
I'm at a loss.
The protocol has changed.

182
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,333
I've thought about this, and
I've come to the conclusion

183
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:04,250
that the target's death would
be an immeasurable loss to us.

184
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,458
The right course of
action is unclear.

185
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,125
My current specs are unable
to make an informed decision

186
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,500
on the matter.

187
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,375
So in the spirit of cooperation,
I'll remain neutral.

188
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,333
[OKANO] Not gonna lie--I was
in the no-kill camp.

189
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:23,166
But hearing everyone's
thoughts... now I'm not so sure.

190
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,750
I have a question.

191
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:29,416
If we do this, does killing you
necessarily mean we hate you?

192
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Of course not, Okano.

193
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,416
Quite the opposite, in fact.

194
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,083
It's when you're killing me
that I feel the most loved.

195
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,750
Well, in that case,
Nagisa, I'm sorry.

196
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,583
Pretty sure my feelings
are more in line with

197
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,833
where these guys stand.

198
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,875
[NAGISA] Guess it was
a little arrogant of me

199
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,000
to think I spoke
for the whole class.

200
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,333
[SUGINO]
Aw, man.

201
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,833
This is gonna be one
hell of a showdown, huh?

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,791
Uh, hey, I've been kinda
wondering about something.

203
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,458
So Nagisa and Karma...

204
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,916
They've been friends
for a while, yeah?

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,541
Oh, sure, been in the same class
since they were First Years.

206
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,791
They hang out all the time.

207
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,041
Huh. But look how they act.

208
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,875
There's always this
polite distance.

209
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,750
You can hear it in the way
they talk sometimes.

210
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,625
Like they don't really feel
comfortable with each other.

211
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,875
[ISOGAI]
All right.

212
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,083
Looks like everyone's
picked a side.

213
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,041
[KARASUMA] The object is to the
steal the opposing team's flag,

214
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:56,958
or to wipe them out entirely.
It's my job to referee.

215
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,541
I'll be watching from midpoint.

216
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,500
If I see zombies or any other
illegal moves, I'll call 'em.

217
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,625
Don't worry. For all
intents and purposes,

218
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:08,125
I'm blind to your
respective positions, got it?

219
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,625
[KARASUMA] Even if the
pro-kill team wins this thing,

220
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,875
odds are an assassination
at this stage won't succeed.

221
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,208
These kids are just
too conflicted

222
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,416
to go through with it.
Who wouldn't be?

223
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,625
[KARASUMA]
Here we go. Are you ready?

224
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,666
Let the intra-class
assassination survival game--

225
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,708
Begin!

226
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,333
[BOTH]
Right out of the gate?!

227
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,541
[TAKEBAYASHI]
Ugh!

228
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,333
Shot just as we were
getting into position!

229
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,333
[MEG] It's hard to establish
a BB's trajectory

230
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,791
beyond 50 meters.

231
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,250
Chiba and Hayami's super
long-distance sniper shot

232
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,083
is incredible!

233
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,458
[IRINA]
Holy crap.

234
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,208
The killing machines you've
made out of those two!

235
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Indeed.

236
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,208
Though, as you'll see,
they're far from the only ones.

237
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,791
Nice job: Keep your sights
trained on the enemy.

238
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,833
[gunfire]

239
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,791
You're kidding me! Wow.
Did not see that one coming!

240
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,458
I should've known.

241
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,916
Kanzaki: Undisputed champion
of the online war game.

242
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,583
[KANZAKI] Started playing to
help with assassination

243
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,916
and got where I mastered it.

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
What?!

245
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,375
[KANZAKI] I'm glad I did. The
hours it took really paid off.

246
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,458
Yukiko. She's been
keepin' a low profile.

247
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hasn't she, though?

248
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,791
And her battle style
is so classical!

249
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,000
A frontal breakthrough on
this field is quite difficult.

250
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,541
Normally, the best strategy
would be to circle around

251
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,666
and attack from the outside.

252
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,958
And yet...

253
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,083
[KANZAKI gasps]

254
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,541
[KARMA]
Oh, that's right.

255
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,583
You cut your teeth on a virtual
battlefield, didn't you?

256
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,541
Trouble is, once I realize
you're making a beeline

257
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,041
for a key position,

258
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,666
all I have to do is be patient
and wait for you to jump.

259
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,375
Red Team, it's Karma.
I'll be taking the lead.

260
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,000
Mimura, there's a highpoint
to Mr. Karasuma's right.

261
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,958
You should have a visual.

262
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,166
Go for it.

263
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,291
[MIMURA]
Copy that.

264
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,875
[KARMA]
Make sure no one sees you.

265
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,750
Terasaka and the other stooges,

266
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,833
I want you on defense
at Face Rock.

267
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,125
We're screwed if they make it
past there, so play it tight.

268
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,791
Man, why are we
always pawns?

269
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,250
Shut your hole!

270
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah! Very well done out there!

271
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,333
[MEG]
I was careless.

272
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,916
We were only two minutes in
and I got killed...

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
By Karma's orders, most likely.

274
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,208
[IRINA]
Incredible.

275
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,250
The red-headed one's
so organized.

276
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,166
What else does he have
up his sleeve?

277
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,750
[MIMURA]
Karma, I'm at the highpoint.

278
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,208
[KARMA]
Perfect.

279
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,916
You should have a clear view
of the enemies' movements.

280
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,208
Anyone shows up, give me
their positions and I'll order

281
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,958
our team to mobilize.

282
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,500
[KARMA] Mimura always blends in.
Makes him ideal for covert ops.

283
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,416
Plus he's got a producer's
eye for the field,

284
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,333
which translates into a real
knack for reconnaissance.

285
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:01,166
Not that anyone else
in class has ever noticed.

286
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,416
[MIMURA]
I see Sugino and Fuwa, I think.

287
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,791
Forest, right flank.

288
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,416
Nice. Keep it up.

289
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,541
Hazama, this is
your cue to advance.

290
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,083
[chuckles]

291
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,791
[SUGINO]
Where'd she even come from?!

292
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,208
Stop being one with
the shadows, dang it!

293
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,250
[grunts]
Rat bastard used me as a decoy.

294
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,541
You'll be paying
for that, Karma.

295
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Why move Hazama into such

296
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,625
a compromising position?

297
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,916
He had to have known she'd
be hopelessly outnumbered.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,125
[TAKEBAYASHI] Well, Hazama
is a terrible fighter,

299
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,583
but she did manage
to take down two enemies.

300
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:41,416
Not least of which was Sugino,
the close-combat superstar.

301
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,125
[KARMA]
Their ranks are in shambles.

302
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,583
Now's the time
for a surprise attack.

303
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,500
Okano?

304
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,666
On it!

305
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,708
--[HINANO groans]
--Oh no!

306
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,791
I lost the Battle of the Hinas.

307
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,083
I'm sorry...

308
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,416
Ha! Well done!
You've been holding out on us!

309
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,958
[KAEDE grunts]

310
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,125
I'm gonna assume you didn't pick
these moves up in gym class!

311
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,708
I'm an actor, I take training
for a role very seriously!

312
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,375
Now that I don't have to mask
the pain of having tentacles,

313
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,291
I can actually focus!

314
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,458
[OKANO]
Aw, crap...

315
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,458
[KAEDE] Koro-sensei...
I'll keep you safe!

316
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,125
--[gunshots]
--[grunts]

317
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,666
I'm impressed.

318
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,208
But I sure wish we could've seen
this side of you before now.

319
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,875
[OKANO] You weren't the
only one working hard in secret.

320
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,208
We've all been training.
Honing our skills.

321
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,750
However this business ends up,

322
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,250
we'll face it
together as a class.

323
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,708
No masks.
No more secret agendas.

324
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,541
Sound good?

325
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,541
[gasps]

326
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,333
Okay, then.
We'll see you later!

327
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,166
Oh-ho, hey! Remind me
to get your autograph.

328
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,583
[KIMURA]
Ee-hee-yeah-ha!

329
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,125
Let's keep up the momentum
and tag someone else!

330
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,208
You sure? But Karma's orders
were to hit and run!

331
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:01,000
Yo, look! It's Hara
and she's wide open!

332
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,250
Tonight's rations
belong to me!

333
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,041
[BOTH yelp]

334
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,875
Uh-oh! Ha! Little
homemade trap of mine.

335
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,083
Mama is fierce.

336
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,958
An unarmed girl
alone in the woods

337
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,750
must seem like
a pretty easy mark.

338
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,708
I suppose looks
can be deceiving, huh?

339
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,333
Hey, no butt-cutting, pervert!

340
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,291
Stupid idiot got
ahead of himself.

341
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,458
Seriously, why the hell
can't people just do

342
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,583
what I tell them to?

343
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,958
Yeah, it's a tragedy.

344
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,708
Well, looks like it's time
for your lieutenant

345
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,083
to finish this off.

346
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,083
Isn't that why you left
the stooges over there?

347
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,250
Not bad. You get me.

348
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,458
Have fun.

349
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,875
[OKUDA]
Ah-ha! Over there!

350
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,416
Ugh, I figured our
formation was leaked.

351
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,958
Mimura can see us!

352
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,541
[KARMA] As of now,
both sides are down by half.

353
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,541
Okay, I think it's time
we start focusing

354
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,333
on flag-capturing tactics.

355
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,458
[SUMIRE grunts]

356
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,416
[KARMA]
Strategic maneuvering is key.

357
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,458
We were bound to
get here eventually.

358
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,666
It's why we took out Kataoka
and Takebayashi first.

359
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,666
To deprive the enemy
camp of options.

360
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,750
To that end, Hayami's
lookout position

361
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:07,500
was absolutely crucial. Couldn't
have done it without her.

362
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,000
[HAYAMI] I'm gonna need you
stand guard, Itona.

363
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,125
[gasps]

364
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,958
[KARMA] Chiba can shoot farther
and hit the target more often,

365
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,666
but her balance and kinetic
vision are way better.

366
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,708
Give her an active
battlefield like this,

367
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,375
and she really shines.

368
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,958
[ISOGAI grunts]
She's not gonna be an easy one.

369
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,000
Gotta go in carefully.

370
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,333
We could try attacking
from the opposite side,

371
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,000
but then we'd have to
break through Terasaka's

372
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,166
defensive line,
and he's too solid.

373
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,416
And the area around their flag
is well within Hayami's range.

374
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,083
We've no choice but
to take Hayami out first.

375
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:48,208
Hayami, Itona, they'll be coming
in droves any second now.

376
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,041
Do whatever you can
to slow 'em down.

377
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,916
If you can take 'em out,
take 'em out.

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,125
[HAYAMI, ITONA]
Roger.

379
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,875
[KARMA] Nakamura,
when the fight starts,

380
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,291
I want you to step
in and finish it.

381
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,541
[NAKAMURA]
Gotcha.

382
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,250
That means we're counting
on you, Meat Wall!

383
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,625
--[TERASAKA] Excuse me?!
--Shut up.

384
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,666
Everyone else'll be
occupied with Rinka.

385
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,875
I'm gonna rush in while you
play the part of my shield.

386
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,166
Once you three are dead, I'll
have time to capture the flag.

387
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,750
Good strategy, right?
Of course it is.

388
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,916
So we're being
sacrificed, then?

389
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,166
That is some
serious ruthlessness.

390
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,875
[NAKAMURA] Duh! We have
to do whatever it takes.

391
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,958
I wanna win this...
so we can kill Koro-sensei.

392
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,625
[sighs] I know what this is.

393
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,541
You wanted us all
to think you were stupid,

394
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,041
so you did stupid stuff.
But be honest,

395
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,208
you joined the pro-kill camp
because you feel

396
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,041
you have a sense of duty.

397
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,333
In reality, out of everyone
here you're the one who

398
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,500
takes things the most seriously.

399
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,125
[KARMA] The plan's as ready as
it's ever going to be I suppose.

400
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,083
There's just one hitch: Nagisa.

401
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,916
Not even Mimura can
figure out where he is.

402
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,125
[ISOGAI] Okay, guys.
Forget about defense.

403
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,791
Take out Hayami and
Itona no matter what!

404
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,208
Tag those two, and Karma's
the only one guarding the flag.

405
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,250
Let's settle this now!

406
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,791
[guns firing]

407
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,750
All right...

408
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,375
Let's get over there, guys!

409
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,500
[yelps]

410
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,208
[ISOGAI]
Surround them from the left!

411
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,291
[gasps]
Isogai's in the lead.

412
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,750
If I can take him down,
we'll have this game in the bag!

413
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,958
[TOKA]
I sincerely hate conflict,

414
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,666
and never once have
I managed to shoot

415
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,125
anywhere near as good as Rinka.

416
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,375
But this isn't for me.
It's for Koro-sensei!

417
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,166
Yada...?

418
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,541
I got her!

419
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,083
And I'm out, too...

420
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,625
[grunting]

421
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,541
Cool, huh?

422
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,458
I had a feeling I was more
of a knife guy, y'know?

423
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,125
I mean, there's no way
I'm worth a damn with a gun.

424
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,083
[TERASAKA]
Son of a--

425
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,416
Did they get you?!

426
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,958
It doesn't matter.
The flag's unguarded either way.

427
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:54,791
It's time.

428
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,500
Nakamura, get in there now.

429
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,416
[NAKAMURA]
Yes, sir!

430
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,458
[gasps]

431
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,958
[NAKAMURA screams]

432
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,708
[grunts]

433
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,583
[NAKAMURA] From behind
at point-blank range...?

434
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,458
Like a bolt of lightning
out of the clear blue sky!

435
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,500
Where in the world
has he been hiding?!
