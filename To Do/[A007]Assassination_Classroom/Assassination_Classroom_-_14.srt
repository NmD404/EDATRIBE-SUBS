1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Phew!

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,583
Talk about Helter Swelter,
am I right, boys and girls?

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,791
Quite a heat wave we've got!

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,125
Yeah.

5
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,583
Hey, so why are we hiking
down the mountain again?

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,833
To swim, maybe? The main
campus has a pool.

7
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,875
In the opposite direction.

8
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:24,916
Yeah.

9
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,416
[KARMA]
Hey, Nagisa.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,708
I heard you were a real
badass the other day.

11
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:34,875
Sorry I wasn't around. I'd have
loved to see the guy's face.

12
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,458
[NAGISA]
He means my "assassination"

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,375
of Coach Takaeko.
Which was cool, sure.

14
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:43,208
But it's relatively easy to take
a normal person by surprise.

15
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,166
Besides, we're down to the wire,

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,500
and it's still anybody's guess

17
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,625
how we're going to
assassinate him.

18
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,041
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

19
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,083
[KORO-SENSEI] All right, class.
Feast your eyes on this.

20
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,208
[STUDENTS gasp]

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Your very own swimming hole,

22
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,041
compliments of moi!

23
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,083
[STUDENTS]
Woohoo!

24
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,666
[NAGISA] It's weird when
he does stuff like this.

25
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,416
It makes him awesome,

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,958
and, honestly,
hard to wanna kill.

27
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,125
[sighs] Not to be ungrateful,
but this is kinda sad.

28
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,583
First of all, I can't even
swim, and second of all,

29
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,083
this bathing suit makes
me feel self-conscious.

30
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,750
[OKAJIMA] You got nothin'
to worry about, babe.

31
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,375
Take my word for it. Plenty
of people go for your body type.

32
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,791
Gee, thanks.

33
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,333
And plenty of people
wouldn't find it creepy

34
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,625
that you're using
a long-range lens.

35
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,625
[NAKAMURA]
Nagisa? Oh, snap.

36
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,500
You're really a dude!

37
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,500
You didn't know that?

38
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,916
[OKANO]
We had our doubts.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,166
[whistle blowing]

40
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Kimura!

41
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,791
Absolutely no running
around the edge of the pool!

42
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,333
That's how accidents happen!

43
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,666
[KIMURA]
Oh, sorry.

44
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,916
[whistle blows]

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,750
[KORO-SENSEI] What do
think you two are doing?!

46
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,458
Absolutely no holding
your breath underwater!

47
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,333
How am I supposed to tell the
difference between horseplay

48
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,375
and drowning?

49
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,875
Absolutely no sneaking pictures!

50
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,666
Put down that book and enjoy
the water, for heaven's sake!

51
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,125
[whistle blowing]

52
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,000
[SUGINO]
Wow. What a pain.

53
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,541
[NAKAMURA]
Huh.

54
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,583
I guess being a lifeguard really
goes to some people's heads.

55
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,750
Brings out their inner
Type-A personality.

56
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,125
[KIMURA]
No kidding.

57
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,875
Someone tell him he needs
to dial it back a notch.

58
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,375
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

59
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,916
[KORO-SENSEI] I've gone
through a great deal of trouble

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,250
making sure this
pool is in harmony

61
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,750
with its natural surroundings.

62
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,208
Proper enjoyment of it must
be disciplined and orderly.

63
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,208
[HINANO] Aw, c'mon! Don't be
such a stick in the mud!

64
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,250
You need to loosen up!

65
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Eek!

66
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,000
[HINANO]
Uhh...

67
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,583
[NAKAMURA] Um, did he just
scream like a chick?

68
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,416
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]

69
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,583
[KORO-SENSEI yelps]

70
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Karma, what are you doing?

71
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,541
Stop it! I'll fall in!
Are you listening to me?

72
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,583
I said stop! Please!

73
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,083
[MAEHARA]
Whoa.

74
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,583
[ISOGAI]
Are you okay?

75
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't read too much into it.

76
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,916
I just don't feel like taking
a dip at the moment, that's all.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,166
It's certainly not as though

78
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,666
water causes my fingers
to swell up or anything.

79
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,500
[NAGISA]
Wait a sec.

80
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,000
He can't swim!

81
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,541
Interesting. This might be his
most promising weakness yet.

82
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,875
If you were never intending
to get in the pool,

83
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,916
why even bother bringing
that kickboard along?

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,750
[KORO SENSEI]
This? This isn't a kickboard!

85
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,208
It's my afternoon snack!

86
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,541
[MIMURA]
Naturally.

87
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,500
[TERASAKA]
Hmph.

88
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,166
[TERASAKA] Excuse me? You're
happy your grades are up?

89
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,500
No, say that again! Don't
think I heard you right!

90
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,291
C'mon, these are the highest
scores I've ever got.

91
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,541
It's 'cause of the octopus

92
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,083
and the "Right Before
the Practice Exam

93
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,791
Afterschool Slithery
Study Session" thing.

94
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,125
Whoa, whoa.

95
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,791
You sayin' you actually
showed up for that crap?!

96
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,291
Yeah.

97
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,041
The three of us agreed no
slithery anything, remember?!

98
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,416
But that's the thing!

99
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,458
It wasn't all bad, in fact,
it really helped me out.

100
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,041
[TERASAKA]
Are you kidding me?!

101
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:29,416
Fine, care about your grades if
that gets you off, you traitor.

102
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,875
[TERASAKA]
Fantastic.

103
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:36,166
Now Muramatsu's fallen for
that "you can do it" B.S.

104
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,375
Am I the only one
with half a brain?

105
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,791
[YOSHIDA]
That is awesome!

106
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,208
Holy crap, you even got
the flair sides right!

107
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,000
The hell you so stoked about?

108
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,750
Oh. Hey, Terasaka.

109
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,166
So, you know how
we always thought

110
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,500
I was the only one here
into bikes and stuff?

111
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,458
Well, turns out Koro-sensei
knows as much as I do about 'em.

112
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
I may be an adult,

113
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,791
but I'll never outgrow
the need for speed.

114
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,625
I've dabbled in manly hobbies
like this for years.

115
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,916
Did you know this
particular model

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
can reach up to 300
kilometers per hour?

117
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,541
What I wouldn't
give to burn rubber

118
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,541
on the genuine article someday.

119
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,083
Are you kidding?

120
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,000
You could get this puppy to
Mach 20 without pumpin' the gas!

121
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:13,750
[STUDENTS laughing]

122
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,791
[growls]

123
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,750
[KORO-SENSEI yelps, screams]

124
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,625
Come on dude, what the
hell is wrong with you?

125
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,250
Apologize immediately!

126
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,791
Koro-sensei worked very hard on
that to showcase his manliness

127
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,125
and you've just
reduced him to tears!

128
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,291
[MEG, MIMURA, FUWA]
Yeah, what she said!

129
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,583
[TERASAKA]
You're talkin' to me

130
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,916
and all I hear is a swarm
of freakin' locusts.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,041
I think it's time for
some pest control!

132
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,875
--[KIRARA] Hey! What the--?
--[OKAJIMA] Is that a bug bomb?

133
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,041
[KORO SENSEI]
That does it!

134
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,333
I enjoy a good prank as
much as the next--

135
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,916
Get those disgusting
things the hell off.

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,875
You're a monster, you hear me?
A freak of nature!

137
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,708
Anyone who falls for your
nice-guy act is stupid!

138
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right!

139
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,500
I don't know what's got
your jock in a tangle today,

140
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,041
but if he's such a monster,
why not man-up and kill him?

141
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,000
I mean, last I checked that is
what we're supposed to do here.

142
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,333
You aimin' to start something
with me, tough guy?

143
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,458
'Cause I wanted to bash
your stupid head in

144
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,541
since the moment you w--

145
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,916
A little advice. You got
this backwards.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,375
You gotta bash my head in
before you can run your mouth.

147
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,166
[TERASAKA]
Let go of me!

148
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,875
You're all a bunch of freaks!

149
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,625
Wow. What crawled up his butt?

150
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,416
I dunno, maybe he just
does it for the attention.

151
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hmm.

152
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,125
[TERASAKA]
Earth on the brink.

153
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,791
Students training
to be assassins

154
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,625
like we're in some kinda
self-improvement camp.

155
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:34,291
Give me one good reason why
I should care about any of this.

156
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,166
I'm not gonna just smile and
fall in line with the herd.

157
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,958
I do things my way.

158
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,666
[SHIRO]
Nicely done.

159
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,250
Here. You've earned it.

160
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,875
Phase One of my
plan is complete.

161
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:51,291
[TERASAKA] Now these guys
have the right idea.

162
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,250
[SHIRO] The octopus has
an excellent sense of smell.

163
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,958
Hence why we dare not
lay the groundwork

164
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,458
for Itona's return ourselves.

165
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,375
Had he picked up even
a trace of our scent,

166
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,541
the game would've been spoiled.

167
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,083
I sympathize with your feelings

168
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,916
on the matter, Ryoma
Terasaka, believe me.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,666
And I advise you to relax.

170
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,791
You have but to follow
my plan to the letter.

171
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,833
The freak of nature
will be dead,

172
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,916

its former insignificance.

[TERASAKA]
Hm?

174
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,208
I know you.

175
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,583
You're weaker than the
red-headed one by far.

176
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,125
Your physique says
otherwise, but I see.

177
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,000
Those eyes are a dead giveaway.

178
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,416
You have sight, but no vision.

179
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,208
The only thing you see is
the path of least resistance.

180
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,541
The wolf has eyes for prey.
The cow has eyes for hay.

181
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,041
One of them's a killer,
the other his buffet.

supposed to mean--?!

There, there.

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,166
Calm yourself. We're
counting on you tomorrow.

Okay, could you please stop?

188

This crying business
is ridiculous.

'Scuse me.

For your information,
these are my nostrils.

supposed to know that?!

For some reason,

00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,791

running amok since yesterday.

195
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,791
Terasaka, thank heaven!

196
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,833
I had this awful feeling you
abandoned our class for good!

[TERASAKA growls]

198
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,458
[SHIRO] The so-called "bug bomb"
you set off in class was in fact

199

a canister of concentrated,
pollen-like allergens,

200
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,875
specially designed to
blunt our foe's senses.

201
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,208
Now we move to Phase Two.

202
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,583
So, octopus.

203
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,291
I think it's time we
stopped messin' around

204
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,416
and killed you for real.

205
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,458
Come by the pool after class.

Hey, 's all right.

You guys can come, too!

You can watch while
I shove him in!

210

You can even help me out!

Where's this coming from?

212
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,291
You always make fun
of our attempts

213
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,666
and now you expect us
to be on board with yours?

214

Dude, you pride yourself on
having the worst attitude

any of us should help you.

Ha. Whatever.
Suit yourself, man.

218
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,375
I didn't want to share
the prize money

219
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,666
with you dead-asses anyway.

220
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,250
The hell is his deal
all of a sudden?

221
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,625
The guy's mood swings
are too much for me.

222

Exactly. Count me out.

I realize he's been rather
difficult in the past,

00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,625
[TERASAKA]
Huh?

233
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,416
Are you for real
about this, or what?

234
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,041
You tell me, man. Does it
look like I'm joking?

235
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,875
I'm just sayin'.
If you've got a plan,

236
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,291
let the rest of us in
on it and we might be able--

237
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,541
Shut up!

Damn! You people make
me sick, you know that?

I ain't like the rest
of you, I have vision!

a cow's got eyes for hay!

243
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,125
[NAGISA] All right, then.
Guess he knows what he's doing.

244
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,500
Still, it seems like he's
more confident in his plan

245
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,250
than in himself.

246
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:03,666
I mean, "the wolf's got
eyes for prey"? Seriously?

247
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,208
No way he came up
with that on his own.

Yeah, there we go!

like that! Nice and far apart!

Yeah, we get it. Thanks.

this plan of yours.

Yeah. Sorta reminds
me of the way

around back in Second Year.

[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah-ha.

259
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,791
So I assume the idea is
to push me in the water

260
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,250
and have everyone converge
on me with their knives?

261
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,166
Have you worked out how
to actually push me in?

262

It's only good sportsmanship
to tell you

263
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,708

yours won't do the trick.

This is not a gun,

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,000
but rather a special transmitter

that will alert us to when
all the pieces are in place.

position, pull the trigger.

against water.

[SHIRO]
Normally, yes.

296
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,083
In fact, his mucus
can gelatinize water,

permeation pressure.

[TERASAKA] I always thought
of myself as strong.

00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,458
No one respected me.

339
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,250
You need to get with
the times, bro.

340
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,208
The alpha male crap might've
worked in middle school,

341
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,458
but it's a different story now.

342
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,000
Once you're pushed to
E Class, you're nothing.

343
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,833
And nobody's as scared
of you as they are of that.

344
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,875
[KOYAMA] Your grades have been
in a downward spiral all year.

345
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,916
One of these days, you're
in for a rude awakening.

346
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,291
People like me will be throwing
rocks at people like you.

347
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,583
[TERASAKA] That's when
the reality of it hit me.

348
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:16,125
When I realized my tough-guy act
was a joke to these people.

349
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:20,250
I was through. No one would
ever take me seriously again.

350
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,708
All the dweebs and jerk-offs
I used to push around

351
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,375
would grow up to be big shots.

352
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,916
They'd run the show,

353
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,291
and shiftless dumbasses like me
would be under their thumb.

354
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,375
When I first got put
into E Class, I figured,

355
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,041
"Hey, no prob, Everyone's
the same as me.

356
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,916
I can afford not to care."

357
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,541
But then he showed up.

358
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,958
Out of nowhere,
things changed again.

359
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,000
Suddenly we had
a goal, a purpose.

360
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,250
And now here I am.

361
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,250
A lazy, good-for-nothin'
chump with no future,

362
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,166
caught up in someone
else's master plan.

363
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,625
Dammit!

364
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
He's fast!

365
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,458
And rather stronger
than I recall.

366
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,291
[SHIRO] We reduced
the number of tentacles,

367
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,208
focusing the speed and
power in those remaining.

368
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,791
Now even a simple child
can master them.

369
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,208
[KORO-SENSEI yelping]

370
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,250
[OKAJIMA]
This is unreal!

371
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,625
That's maybe a foot of water.

372
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,875
Can it seriously throw
him off that much?

373
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,583
The water ain't
his only problem.

374
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,708
You've got some nerve!

375
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,500
Look, he just saved
you from drowning.

376
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,625
He can't go all out
'cause he's spent.

377
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,416
And his attention's
still divided.

378
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,916
[OKAJIMA]
Oh, no!

379
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,333
That branch can't support
Hara's weight! She's gonna fall!

380
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,583
[OKUDA]
He can't focus on the fight

381
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,458
because he's too
worried about them!

382
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,083
[TERASAKA] 'Specially her.
That fatty'll be toast soon.

383
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,166
[NAGISA]
We have to help!

384
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,666
[OKUDA]
How?

385
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,416
Wait, hold on a sec. This
wasn't even your plan, was it?

386
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,791
You got roped into this.

387
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,125
[TERASAKA]
Hmph.

388
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,500
Like a head of cattle, but
hey, that's what happens

389
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,958
when you got sight
and no vision.

390
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,333
Some smartass wolf comes
along and, before you know it,

391
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,666
you're on the menu.

392
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,375
Thing is, though.

393
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,291
If I'm gonna be played,
I pick the tune.

394
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,125
I've had it up to here
with these jerks,

395
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,291
and the idea of them
gettin' the prize money?

396
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,583
Don't get me started.

397
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,916
You're a smart dude, Karma.

398
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,125
You be the puppet master,
and I'll be the puppet.

399
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,083
[KARMA]
Hm?

400
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,500
Come up with
something awesome.

401
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,666
If you"re the brains, then I'm
the brawn, you got it?

402
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,708
Give me a plan and I'll
save every one of 'em,

403
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,708
fatty and the monster included!

404
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,458
I don't know. Sure you
want to be my lackey?

405
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,083
I'm pretty devious.

406
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,500
[TERASAKA]
Huh?

407
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,125
You might get killed.

408
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,666
Ooh, big deal.

409
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,750
Devious I can handle, just make
sure you've got a vision.

410
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,208
[SHIRO] Now, Itona.
Strike the killing blow.

411
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,125
What's up?

[SHIRO]
Can I help you?

413
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,291
So, bet you jerks think
you played me pretty good.

414
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,208
[SHIRO]
Does that wound your ego?

415
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,291
There's something to be said

416
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,375
for being the perfect
foil, my friend.

417
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,750
Or are you suddenly upset

418
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,875
we endangered the classmates
you care nothing for?

419
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,041
Laugh it up, man.

to be real bitch.

00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,083
He'll throttle you!

424
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,250
I wasn't talkin'
to you, Tentacles!

00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,333
[SHIRO chuckles]

426
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,208
[SHIRO]
He's tapped into his inner hero.

427
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,416
Shut him down, Itona. For good.

428
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,750
What've you done?

429
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,208
No worries.

430
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,291
They're not gonna
to kill a student.

431
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,875
We're too valuable alive.

432
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,125
As long as we're in danger,

433
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,791
Koro-sensei can't
concentrate on the fight.

434
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,833
Even Hara isn't that bad off.

435
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,083
If she falls, either he or
Itona is bound to catch her.

436
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,958
It may look like he's
in over his head,

437
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,333
but Terasaka knows
exactly what to expect.

438
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,750
Tentacle Boy will try
to knock him unconscious,

439
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,625
but if he grabs on and
rides it out, we're good.

440
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,625
[SHIRO] That's an impressive
grip you've got there.

441
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,333
Let us see if it holds up
under another lashing.

442
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:22,833

Uh.

That's yesterday's shirt.

446
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,916
The one he had on when
he bug-bombed the class.

447
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,625
Unless he did
laundry last night,

448
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,958
there's still some residue on it

449
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,958
from whatever weird
chemical was in that can.

450
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,916
I figure if it affected
Koro-sensei, it'll effect Itona.

451
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,208
And there you go.

452
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,708
Now Tentacle Boy's distracted

453
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,250
and the Octopus has
a chance to rescue Hara.

00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,750
You gotta love a good plan.

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,625
Logically, the two of them
have the exact same weaknesses.

tactics against him, and voila.

All right, here's the deal.

We're not okay with you
hogging all the prize money,

your plan revolved around

putting our lives on the line.

470
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,500
Slapping one of our own around
doesn't sit well either.

you're going to have
to face all of us.

my sleeve, just so you know.

goes a long way, man.

00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,583
Don't even go there! That was
a temporary arrangement

508
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,833
and you're not the one who
took a tentacle to the gut!

509
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,208
That's right! I was down
here taking all the hits

510
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,458
'cause you don't have the balls
to do your own dirty work!

511
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,708
True, you sorta kept your
distance the whole time.

512
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,750
Oh, don't like getting
your hands dirty, huh?

513
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,916
We can fix that.

514
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,708
[STUDENTS laughing]

515
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
I think we can all agree

516
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:03,458
Terasaka isn't exactly
cut out to be a mastermind,

517
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,708
but when tasked with putting
someone else's plan into action,

518
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,333
he's invaluable. On the field,

519
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,750
his confidence shines through
and things get done.

520
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,291
It's as simple as that.

521
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,375
No self-respecting assassination
squad should be without him.

522
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,708
[NAGISA]
Definitely.

523
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,458
Terasaka may be hot-headed,
but he belongs here.

524
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm glad he's finally
adjusting. We all are.

525
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,625
Trouble is, we're so
caught up in the moment,

526
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,375
we've overlooked something.

527
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,625
Something major, actually.

528
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,708
Koro-sensei's biggest
weakness yet.
