1
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,416
[KORO-SENSEI] Thank you
for the help, children.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,875
I really appreciate it.

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,625
[MEG] You may have more hands
than the rest of us,

4
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,125
but it'd still be
a stretch for you to carry

5
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,583
all this lab equipment
by yourself.

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,916
[KORO-SENSEI] Exactly.
Now, it's a one-trip job!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,625
No wonder you were both
elected class officers.

8
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,083
So reliable!

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,791
Thanks, but you really
could've done this without us.

10
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,250
Couple of quick trips
back and forth.

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
I supposed I could've, yes.

12
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,875
But the more the merrier, eh?

13
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,208
I have a question, sir.

14
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes?

15
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,416
Are you starting
to feel at home?

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,791
Like, with all of us?

17
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,333
Wow. I can't believe you're
really asking him that.

18
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Put in those terms,

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,916
I'd say I feel incredibly
at home as your teacher.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,666
That's strange.

21
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Really?

22
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,333
[ISOGAI]
Well, yeah.

23
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,583
A creature like you taking
any interest whatsoever

24
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,000
in a group of junior high kids
isn't exactly something

25
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,541
you see every day.

26
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,708
[MEG] I mean, you actually teach
us, so it's borderline cool.

27
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,708
Just takes getting used to.

28
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,833
Yeah, no kidding.

29
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,291
[growling, grunting]

30
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:07,291
Then there's the whole
assassination thing.

31
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,666
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]

32
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,833
[KORO-SENSEI] A vital part
of my role, I'd argue.

33
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,416
Target, teacher. We ought
not separate the two.

34
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,333
Did he seriously just
dodge three knives

35
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,666
while prepping lab?

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,625
--[school bell chimes]
--Hey, Maehara. You okay?

37
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:22,958
Eh.

38
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,333
--[KORO-SENSEI laughs]
--They should know by now

39
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,500
that was too obvious.
Am I right, Teach?

40
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,291
[KORO-SENSEI] All right,
boys and girls, let's begin!

41
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,958
[OKUDA whimpers]

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,416
[STUDENTS gasping]

43
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,291
[SUGAYA]
Whoa! It's bright red!

44
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ta-da!

45
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,375
And that's how we extract the
coloring from processed foods.

46
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,041
[STUDENTS gasp]

47
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'll, uh...

48
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,666
I'll just take the leftover
samples, thank you.

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,541
Excuse me.

50
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,750
[STUDENTS scream]

51
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,208
[SUGINO] Wait! We bought
those for ourselves!

52
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,000
Is it me, or did he
just use this lab

53
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,083
to support his junk-food
habit between paychecks?

54
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,250
My question's why a
super organism has to

55
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,500
live on a teacher's salary
in the first place.

56
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Eh?

57
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,833
I, uh...

58
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,375
Well, uh...

59
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Go on, speak up, Okuda.

60
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,500
What can I do for you?

61
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,958
Umm!

62
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,375
Poison, sir! Would you
drink it, please?!

63
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,625
[STUDENTS gasp]

64
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,750
Well, she doesn't
beat around the bush.

65
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,416
[OKUDA]
I'm sorry. Is this weird?

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
[KORO-SENSEI] It's certainly
a very straightforward

67
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,666
assassination attempt,
I'll give you that.

68
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,125
See, the thing is, sir, I'm not
very good at being sneaky.

69
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,750
I mean, everyone else
is so good at this stuff.

70
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,708
But, me? What I'm good
at is chemistry!

71
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,416
And I put my heart and
soul into this mixture!

72
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,041
--[STUDENTS murmuring]
--[MIMURA] All righty, then.

73
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,791
[SUGINO]
Um, Okuda?

74
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,458
Points for throwing in,
but no one's that stupid.

75
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Your heart and soul?

76
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,041
Don't mind if I do, then!

77
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,083
[STUDENTS gasping, chattering]

78
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,750
[KORO-SENSEI retches]

79
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
This-This is!

80
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,458
Is it really gonna work?

81
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,916
[MAEHARA]
This might be it!

82
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,083
[KORO-SENSEI squeaks]

83
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,125
[STUDENTS groan]

84
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,291
[ISOGAI]
Or he could just grew horns.

85
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Quite a kick.

86
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,875
Sodium hydroxide, I believe?
Good try, Miss Okuda.

87
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,750
If I were human, I'd most
definitely have bought the farm.

88
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,333
[OKUDA]
Oh, I see.

89
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,208
[KORO-SENSEI] Shall I try the
other two we have here as well?

90
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,583
[OKUDA]
Yes, please!

91
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Right! Down the hatch!

92
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,916

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,958
[KORO-SENSEI groans]

94
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,625
[ISOGAI]
He grew wings this time?!

95
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,083
[MAEHARA] Wow, he's starting
to look kinda fancy.

96
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Thallium acetate. Interesting.

97
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,208
Let's see what
the last one does.

98
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,541
[KORO-SENSEI retches, grunts]

99
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,875
[MEG]
Uh-oh!

100
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,291
[SUGINO]
Not sure I wanna see this!

101
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,000
[KORO-SENSEI growls]

102
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,833
[KAEDE]
That's boring.

103
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,916
[SUGINO] This just keeps
getting weirder and weirder.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,041
[ISOGAI]
I don't like this look.

105
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,375
It's creeping me out.

106
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,666
[MIMURA] So poison
turns him into an emoticon?

107
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
If you hate me, I understand.

108
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,458
But please, don't
hate assassination.

109
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,125
[OKAJIMA] What's that
even supposed to mean?!

110
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,333
[KORO-SENSEI] Also, young
lady. As your teacher,

111
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,250
I can't overlook the fact that
you handled toxic substances

112
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,083
unsupervised.

113
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,583
[OKUDA]
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

114
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't worry. I have an idea.

115
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,500
Why don't we work
together on a poison

116
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,208
that has a little
bit more of a kick?

117
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,458
[OKUDA gasps]
Uh, sure!

118
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,708
Doesn't seem like that's gonna
end in success if you ask me.

119
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,958
Might get some good
notes out of it at least.

00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,458
[KAEDE]
Yeah!

124
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,458

what I'm talking about!

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,958
[IRINA] Hey there,
big boy. How's tricks?

Hmm?

It's an absolute sauna in here.

Ugh. Aren't you on fire?

130

That's not the word
I would use, no.

131
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,708
[IRINA growls]

132
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,083
Look, save this act
for the target. Back off.

133
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,458
Ugh, I swear,
you're such a killjoy.

134
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,041
If you're gonna cut it here
as a teacher, pull it together.

135
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,583
I thought we had discussed this.

136
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,416
For your information,
it's not an act.

137
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,666
It's hotter than hell
in this dump.

138
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,666
How do they expect these kids
to function without AC?

139
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,083
I've tried to put in several
requests for renovations,

140
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,083
but the funds aren't there.
Or so I'm told.

141
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,916
[IRINA]
Seriously?

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,291
--[SUGINO] Damn it!
--[HINANO] Everyone saw, right?

143
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,750
That was a clean hit!

144
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,250
[KARASUMA] Can't be helped.
It's how things are here.

145
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Okey-dokey.

146
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,958
We're ready to add it
to the ethanol, I think.

147
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,000
Now, be extra careful.
Don't breathe in the fumes.

148
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,416
[OKUDA]
Got it!

149
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,375
[KORO-SENSEI] It's a shame your
enthusiasm for chemistry

150
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,583
doesn't extend
to other subjects.

151
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,416
Heh. Everything else
seems to go over my head.

152
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,916
Especially when it comes
to language arts and stuff.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,833
That's why I'm here, I guess.

154
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,666
I never know
the right thing to say.

155
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,958
The words don't come out or
I get 'em all turned around.

156
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,791
Tell me to express
myself and I seize up.

157
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hmm...

158
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,500
[OKUDA] It's okay.
I don't mind so much.

159
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,666
At least with math and science,
there's always a right answer.

Everything's
spelled out for you.

161
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,416
They're concise.

162
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,583
No double meanings,
no weird feels.

163
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,083
No worrying that someone'll
take your words the wrong way.

164
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,250
It makes perfect sense.

165
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
I see the appeal.

166
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,041
Tell you what, Okuda.

167
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,125
I have a special homework
assignment just for you.

168
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Remember, though. Safety first.

00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,208
[school bell chimes]

170
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,750
[KAEDE]
Um...

171
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,666
Okay, so he really asked you
to bring the poison to class?

172
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,291
[OKUDA] Yeah! He said
the stuff in this flask

173
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,875
should work like a charm!

174
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,083
He even drew a manga of
the safety guidelines

175
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,583
for proper use and storage.
I'm impressed.

176
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,500
Going the extra mile yet again.

177
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,833
[SUGINO] I know he's
unconventional and all,

178
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:19,000
but giving us the goods on
a poison that'll kill him?

179
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,125
Nice, right?

180
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,208
I think it's his way
of encouraging me.

181
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,500
I'm good at chemistry,
not words.

182
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,750
He says to focus
on my strengths!

183
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Good morning, everyone.

184
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,708
--[KAEDE] Here's your chance.
--Take your seats, please.

185
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,583
--Go give it to him!
--[OKUDA] Here it is, sir.

186
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,666
Just like you asked.

187
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah! Nice work.

188
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,958
Well, here's to
your health, children.

189
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,583
Salud!

[KORO-SENSEI retches]

193
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:49,000
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]
Thank you, Okuda.

194
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,916
Thank you very much indeed.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,875
This concoction is precisely
what I needed to level up.

196
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,958
[OKUDA]
Wait, you... I don't--

197
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,000
[KORO-SENSEI roars]

198
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Pyuu.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,458
[STUDENTS]
He melted?!

200
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,208
[KORO-SENSEI] You didn't think
that was a poison, did you?

201
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,250
On the contrary. I had you
whip up a special tonic

202
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,208
designed to increase
my fluidity.

203
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,166
[MEG gasps]

204
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
In liquid form,

205
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,875
I fit comfortably into the
tightest nooks and crannies.

206
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,708
[MEG]
What are you doing in there?

207
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,125
[KORO-SENSEI] Best of all,
I lose none of my speed!

208
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,666
Go ahead! Try to
beat me! Come on!

209
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,916
[OKAJIMA]
This is messed up, dude!

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
[KAEDE] What in the world
did you give him?!

211
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,208
[OKUDA]
You tricked me! That's not fair!

212
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hmm... Fair?

213
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,041
Verbal deception is a vital part

214
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,958
of the successful
assassin's toolkit.

215
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,083
[OKUDA]
Huh?

216
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,375
What are you
talking about, sir?

217
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,416
[KORO-SENSEI] Approaching the
target so naively

218
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,083
is a good way to
fail in your mission.

219
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,375
Even the deadliest
of poisons is useless

220
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,791
if one can't persuade
the mark to drink it.

221
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,333
Nagisa. Say you
wanted to poison me.

222
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,833
How might you go about it?

223
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,916
Huh? Well, lemme think.

224
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,458
I'd probably put it
in something you liked.

225
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,958
--[NAGISA] For you!
- [KORO-SENSEI] For me?

226
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,875
[NAGISA] Then I guess I would
offer it to you as a gift.

227
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Excellent.

228
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,125
You see, to deceive someone you
have to get inside their heads;

229
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,708
know what they respond to.
Use language creatively.

230
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:16,541
In poisoning, as in life, the
key to success is communication.

231
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,791
[BOTH gasp]

232
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Imagine that one day, you make

233
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,666
an Earth-shattering
scientific discovery.

234
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,166
How can it benefit mankind if it
stays locked inside your head?

235
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,625
Knowing the right thing so say

236
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,875
can make all
the difference, right?

237
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,416
Right! Thank you, sir!

238
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,041
[laughs] Nice move, Teach.
Turn the tables, huh?

239
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,583
No kidding.

240
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,666
[NAGISA]
Leave it to Koro-sensei.

241
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,000
To him, even a student
trying to poison him is still,

242
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,541
first and foremost, a student.

243
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,166
We're a long way off
from being able to kill him.

244
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,916
He's just that good.

245
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,000
[ISOGAI]
Quit dragging your feet.

246
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,000
We show up late again,
there's no telling what kind

247
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,750
of messed up stuff
they'll make us do.

248
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,875
[OKANO] Yeah. Last time we had
to clean out the flower beds.

249
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,916
[MAEHARA]
Heh. Man, that blew.

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,083

are the size of a house.

What are you bitching about?

252
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,583
We did all the work.

253
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,958
[MAEHARA laughs]
I was moral support!

254
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,541
[OKANO growls]
This sucks!

255
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,041
Somebody explain to me why we're
the only students in school

256
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,833
who have to put up
with this crap!

257
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,916

Hey! Is that Kunudon?

00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,583

Hello! It's me, Kunudon!

260
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,166
[BOYS &amp; GIRLS]
Hooray!

261
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,833
[KUNUDON] Today, we're going
to talk about underachievers!

262
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,750
Here, we like to give them a
special place all their own!

263
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,041
A place called E Class,
where they won't bother

264
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,708
the good boys and girls!

265
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,500
[BOYS &amp; GIRLS]
Wow! What a great idea!

266
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,000
[KUNUDON] Now we don't normally
like it when E Class students

267
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,208
set foot on the main campus.
But we do make exceptions

268
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,125
for school assemblies,
when we invite them

269
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,750
to take a stroll down the
mountain on their lunch break.

270
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,833
[OKAJIMA]
Ahh! The stupid bridge is out!

271
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,208
[MIMURA]
No way!

272
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,000
Who's the genius who
told us this was a shortcut?!

273
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,916
Okajima!

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,250
[OKAJIMA screams]

275
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,708
Discipline is key!
'Specially for E Class slobs.

276
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,166
And nothing instills
discipline like lining up

277
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,750
inside the gymnasium for
special assemblies, kids!

278
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,500
[BOYS &amp; GIRLS]
Discipline!

00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,833

Why are there snakes?!

00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,541
Come on, maggots,
get in gear!

282
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,416
Give me a "sir, yes sir!" Now!

Why are there falling boulders?!

Crap! Look out, Okajima!

287
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,333

was it to poke the beehive?!

Look out, Okajima!

289
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,541
[SUGINO] He's, uh, not having
a very good day, is he?

290
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,208
Hope the poor guy's all right.

291
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,666
[NAGISA]
Me, too.

292
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,791
[KAEDE] Ugh. Can we
be done with the rocks

293
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,500
and the bees and the things
trying to kill us, please?

294
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,416
I'm glad Okajima was around
to take the brunt of it for us.

295
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,791
Hey. Anyone hurt?

296
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,416
I think we're mostly okay.

297
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,000
Good. No rush.

298
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,333
In fact, at this rate, we're
making fairly excellent time.

299
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,458
[IRINA]
Wait for me!

300
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,750
[IRINA growls]
Way to ditch me, jerks!

301
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,291
[KAEDE]
Hey! Professor Bitch!

302
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,875
[IRINA] No one said anything
about a class trip during lunch.

303
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah, no offense, Professor,
but you look wrecked.

304
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,375
You try running through
nature in heels!

305
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,208
Mr. Karasuma?
Where's Koro-sensei?

306
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,125
[KARASUMA] We told him to
wait back at the old campus

307
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,458
for security reasons.

308
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,833
It wouldn't do for the other
students to see him.

309
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'm all alone. A shunned Sensei.

310
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,958
[Well. The main campus
isn't much further away.

311

Yeah...

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,166
That sincerely sucked.

315
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,666
Well, at least we're not late.

316
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,416
No idea how that happened.

317

Hurry up, people!

318
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,875
We've got to get in line
before they start!

319
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,333
[STUDENTS]
Okay.

Hey, Nagisa!

321
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,166
--[NAGISA] Uh?
--Wow, look at you guys!

322
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,666
I'm surprised you made it!

323
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,500
Must've been a heck of a trek
rollin' down the mountain!

324
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,958
[TAKADA, TANAKA laugh]

325
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,125
[NAGISA] Once a month,
there's an all-school assembly.

326
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,375
And even here we get treated
like the lowest of the low.

327
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,166
Not something
we look forward to,

328
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,791
but... not a lot we can
do about it, either.

329
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,083
[DEAN]
You are the cream of the crop.

330
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,625
This nation's shining elite.
Never forget that.

331
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,916
I am proud to be your dean.

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,708
But!

333
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,291
Don't get too comfortable.

334
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,708
No. Let E Class remind
us of the perils in that.

335
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:46,166
--[E CLASS STUDENTS sigh]
--[A-D CLASS STUDENTS laugh]

336
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,208
[DEAN] Now, now! It's unkind
to laugh at their expense!

337
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,541
Hey, Nagisa.
Why isn't Karma here?

338
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,500
Because he's ditching.

339
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,958
What?

340
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,458
Is he out of his mind?!

341
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,958
[NAGISA] It's not like he
doesn't know he'll catch hell

342
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,291
for blowing off assembly;
he just doesn't care.

343
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,666
Wish I had the grades
to get away with that.

344
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,583
They'd probably
just throw me out.

345
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,291
Yeah, ain't that the truth.

346
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,708
[INSTRUCTOR A]
If I may say so, sir,

347
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,958
this method is
remarkably effective!

348
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,208
It shows in the percentage of
students from our academy

349
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:20,041
who go on to top universities.
E Class aside, of course.

350
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,333
[PRINCIPAL]
We are pragmatists here.

351
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:28,333
Realists. Young people must be
prepared for the world as it is.

352
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,458
Sadly, the best way to
ignite their potential

353
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,583
is to let them see it
extinguished in others.

354
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,958
Very sound reasoning.

355
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,916
[PRINCIPAL]
Yes, of course it is.

356
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,083
Whether in school
administration or assassination,

357
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,333
I pride myself on
adherence to logic.

358
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,083
[STUDENT ANNOUNCER A]
Now we'll have an address

359
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,458
by the student council.
Student council members,

360
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,541
--come up to the podium, please.
--[BOY STUDENT A] Who's that?

361
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,041
Never seen him before.

362
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,458
[GIRL STUDENT A] He looks way
too cool to be a teacher!

363
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,833
[KARASUMA] ...take this
opportunity to introduce myself.

364
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,458
--Oh. Hello.
--[HINANO] You too?

365
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,791
Wow! Cool!

366
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,666
Yeah.

367
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,541
[KARASUMA grunts]

368
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,291
Hey. Check it, Mister K.

369
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,833
We decorated the thing
we keep our knives in!

370
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,166
So stylish.

371
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,083
They're "totes adorable," yes!
Now put them away!

372
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,041
We're supposed to
keep this on the DL.

373
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,458
The other students can't know!

374
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,041
[HINANO, NAKAMURA]
Oh, sorry.

375
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,833
[BOY STUDENT B] I think he's
the new E Class teacher.

376
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,958
Looks like he's big on
the hands-on approach.

377
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,750
No fair. Why can't the regular
teachers be that hot?

378
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,250
I mean, seriously, is there
some kind of rule?

379
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,958
[BOY STUDENT C, D growl]

380
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,750
[STUDENTS gasping]

381
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
[STUDENTS gasp]

382
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,791
[BOY STUDENT F] Whoa!
Who's the boobalicious

383
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,625
foreign-looking chick?!

384
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,750
Five minutes ago she was
down on all fours,

385
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,958
but damn,
look at 'er work it!

386
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:50,708
[IRINA pants]
Slow down. I'm dying!

387
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,416
[NAGISA]
Quick recovery, huh?

388
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,791
[BOY STUDENT G] Don't tell me
she's an E Class teacher, too?

389
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,583
[GIRL STUDENT C]
So jealous...

390
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,208
What are you doing here?

391
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,083
Don't even try
to pull rank on me.

392
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,833
I'm an educator
just like you are.

393
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,708
So you're finally
embracing your role?

394
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,625
Or, I just need an excuse
to scope out the student body.

395
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,625
Me-ow. Said nobody ever.

396
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,375
Oh. That's right.

397
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:19,000
Nagisa. The octopus
isn't around. Talk to me.

398
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,041
Gimme some intel.
You're still keeping a record

399
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,000
of all the ooey-gooey bastard's
vulnerable points, right?

400
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,583
Let teacher peek
at your notebook

401
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,875
and I'll make it
worth your while.

402
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,791
Uh. I, uh, haven't
added anything to it

403
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,125
since the last time you looked.

404
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,916
Please, sweetheart.
You and I both know

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,041
you're keeping the good stuff
all to your lonesome.

406
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,041
Actually, I've shared every--

407
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,750
Ugh. Come on now, kid.

408
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,875
Dish. Or I'll smother you.

409
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,541
[NAGISA]
Stop it, Professor Bitch!

410
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,125
I can't breathe through
your enormous ta-tas!

411
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,083
[TANAKA]
What a teacher.

412
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,625
[TAKADA]
What a... bitch.

413
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,791
[BOY STUDENT H] What the
hell? Are you kidding me?

414
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,125
[BOY STUDENT I]
The End Class douche bags

415
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,708
aren't supposed to
get any special perks!

416
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,375
[IRINA]
Oww!

417
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,166
[ARAKI] Okay. All the upcoming
student council events

418
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,916
are detailed in the handouts
you've just been given.

419
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,166
Uh. Hang on. How come
we didn't get any?

420
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,291
[OKADA]
Ionno.

421
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,083
[ISOGAI]
Uh, excuse me, sir?

422
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,791
E Class didn't get the handouts.

423
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,250
Oh. Wow, really?
That's kind of bizarre.

424
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,208
Huh. I'm so sorry.

425
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,750
I thought for sure we printed
enough for everyone!

426
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,916
Guess E Class will just
have to memorize it

427
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,125
off their neighbors'.

428
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,375
[STUDENTS laugh]

429
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,083
[ARAKI] That works out
for the best, really.

430
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,916
I mean, you people could use the
mental exercise I'm guessing.

431
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,458
What a little prick.
Somebody ought to punch--

432
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
There you go, Isogai.

433
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,583
Seriously?!

434
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,708
[KORO-SENSEI] That should
take care of it, I think.

435
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,250
All of you have a copy of
the handout now, correct?

436
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,500
[ISOGAI] Yes, Sir!

437
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,708
Never mind. We have some.
My mistake, sorry.

438
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,666
You what?! But, I--
How did you--?

439
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,666
Okay, who's the wise guy?
Who killed our fun?

440
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,000
Er, I mean. Ahem!
As I was saying before.

441
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,208
Um, if you'll take a closer look
at the events schedule,

442
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,000
you'll notice we have quite
a few things packed...

443
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,875
I thought we agreed we couldn't
let the other students see you.

444
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,416
What part of "state secret"
do you refuse to understand?

445
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Relax. My disguise is flawless.

446
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,541
No one suspects a thing.

447
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,791
Looks like somebody
got a little lonely.

448
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,791
Can't say I blame the guy.

449
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,833
[BOY STUDENT A] Hey. Was that
teacher standing there

450
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,250
a second ago?

451
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,791
[BOY STUDENT B] I dunno,
what's with him bein' all big

452
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,166
and, like, wriggly?

453
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,791
[BOY STUDENT A] Yeah.
And what's with the hot one

454
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,125
trying to stab him?

455
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,916
[BOY STUDENT B] Is that a
thing? Can she do that?

456
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,541
--I can get him, let go!
--Come on!

457
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,291
The other one's got her
in some kind of hold.

458
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,750
That class is crazy.

459
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,916
Oh well. I'll say this much
for her, she never quits.

460
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,041
[TANAKA, TAKADA growl]

461
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,875
[SUGINO] We're gonna
run on ahead, Nagisa.

462
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,458
[NAGISA] Cool. I'll grab a
drink and catch up with you.

463
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,583
[TAKADA]
Yo, Nagisa.

464
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,000
[NAGISA]
Uh?

465
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,583
You proud of yourselves?

466
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,000
Acting like you're havin'
the time of your lives?

467
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,333
Laughing during assembly.

468
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,291
Not cool.

469
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,875
You bums ever hear of respect?

470
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,750
If I was in E Class, I'd keep
my head down and my mouth shut.

471
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:10,166
Yeah, and I sure as hell
wouldn't have a reason to laugh.

472
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,500
[TAKADA] Hey. Watch it with
that look, I'm warnin' ya.

473
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,166
[KARASUMA]
Hmm?

474
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,875
[TANAKA growls]

475
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,208
This whole stupid
system is a travesty.

476
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Easy does it.

477
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,833
The boy can handle himself.

478
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:27,416
My students know how
to deal with bullies.

479
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,833
[TANAKA] Something
you wanna say, scumbag?

480
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,583
You want me to kill your ass?!

481
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,291
[NAGISA]
Kill? You're kidding, right?

482
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,166
You're really gonna kill me?

483
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,083
--[NAGISA] Heh.
--[TANAKA gasps]

484
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,958
Like you've got
the balls to try.

485
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,416
Go right ahead.

486
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,875
[TANAKA, TAKADA gasp]

487
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,125
[TANAKA] Dude, what...
What was that all about?

488
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,833
[TAKADA]
Damn. He's a psycho.

489
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
What did I tell you?

490
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,083
They have more self-respect
than to roll over for a bully.

491
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,541
[KARASUMA]
Huh...

492
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,625
[PRINCIPAL]
Interesting.

493
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:16,375
An E Class reprobate
presuming to shove his betters?

494
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:21,250
Hmph. What nonsense.
This behavior is unacceptable.

495
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,833
It would appear
a few tweaks are in order.

496
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,791
Assassination can wait.

497
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,125
For now, my priority
is the status quo.
