1
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:08,875
[KUNUDON]
Surprise!

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,125
[KIDS]
Tell us, Kunudon!

3
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,500
Hello, boys and girls!
It's Kunudon!

4
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,500
[KIDS]
Hooray!

5
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,583
[KUNUDON]
Did you know

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,166
the students with
the highest scores

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,083
here at Kunugigaoka Academy get
dibs on the best vacation ever?

8
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,166
[KIDS]
Yay entitlements!

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,500
[KUNUDON]
That's right!

10
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,958
Three days at one of the
finest resorts in Okinawa!

11
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,250
[KIDS]
Diplomatic passports!

12
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,583
[KUNUDON]
And the best part?

13
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,583
Not only do students get
to hit the books seaside,

14
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,250
your school pays for
the whole kit n' caboodle!

15
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:39,500
[KIDS]
Summer debauchery! Yay!

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,666
Wait! E Class is
going this year?

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,958
F-- that!

18
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,750
[SUGINO]
Wow, this is so cool!

19
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,208
Look at all of 'em!

20
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,750
[NAGISA
Summer vacation.

21
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,291
Three months of sweet freedom

22
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,916
from the confines of
school, or so you'd think.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,750
Uh, remind me again what
we're doing out here.

24
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,208
Oh.

25
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,625
Well, I'm not about to let
the guys in my neighborhood

26
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,041
catch me collecting
insects. Sorry.

27
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,458
At heart, I'm a city boy.

28
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,875
That doesn't mean nature
doesn't fascinate me, though.

29
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,333
Karma showed me this tree
a few weeks ago after school.

30
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,916
Pretty cool, huh?

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,750
No offense, but it's weird that
you came along with us, Maehara.

32
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,333
Never would've pegged you
for the entomologist type.

33
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,666
I figured, what the heck?

34
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,000
Okinawa's coming up, we
don't wanna be unprepared.

35
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,250
Think about it, my friend.

36
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,208
What's the one thing
we'll need to most of?

37
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,125
[SUGINO]
I dunno know.

38
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,666
Cold hard cash!

39
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,291
We're gonna be up to our
eyeballs in bikini-clad babes,

40
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,666
and that talon ain't cheap!

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,833
Now that little runt there
ain't worth much, but...

42
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,125
...we track down a stag beetle?

43
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,291
Dude! We are talkin'
mucho dinero!

44
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,458
Seriously, have you seen
what they go for online?

45
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,333
Easily enough to score
a four-star dinner

46
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,000
and kick it poolside
under an umbrella

47
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,500
with the hottie of your choice!

48
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,166
I get the feeling
he's not real focused

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,083
on what the trip is
supposed to about.

50
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,625
Yeah.

51
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,958
His idea of a good time seems
a little mature for his age.

52
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,958
[HINANO]
It's not gonna work.

53
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,208
Stag beetles are
pretty old news.

54
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,041
[MAEHARA]
Hey!

55
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,458
Hi, guys!

56
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,250
Tryin' to scrape up some
spending money for our getaway?

57
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,458
[SUGINO]
Maybe.

58
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,541
What do you know about
stag beetle trends?

59
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,625
[HINANO]
Well.

60
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,666
They were worth
a ton a few years ago,

61
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,458
but not so much, recently.

62
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,333
Artificial breeding caused
supply to outweigh demand.

63
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,916
Now a dozen aren't worth a third
of what one used to bring in.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,916
Wha? The Great Stag Beetle
Crash was a real thing?

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,166
But my buddy said the
insect-to-hot-babe ratio

66
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,083
was one to one.

67
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,916
Your buddy's out
of it, Casanova.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Girls have always been
more expensive than that.

69
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,875
You sure know
a lot about bugs.

70
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,375
Never thought
that'd be your thing.

71
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,208
Oh. Every living
creature's my thing.

72
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:16,208
I know! Since we're all here,
let's go bug hunting together!

73
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,041
With all four of us looking,
I bet we'll find a whole bunch!

74
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,666
[NAGISA]
Hinano Kurahashi,

75
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,166
poster child for
upbeat and innocent.

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,000
She also happens to know
a lot about natural science.

77
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,750
Having her around
might be a big help.

78
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,916
Right!

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,666
Not a bad haul,
if I do say so myself.

80
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,708
[SUGINO] That's pretty cool!
Did you set this trap here?

81
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,958
[HINANO] Sure did.
Put it out last night.

82
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,833
Used my own
homemade recipe, too.

83
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,291
And there's more
where that came from.

84
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,500
I set about 20. That works
out to a thousand yen each.

85
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,958
Not too shabby.

86
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,583
[SUGINO] Ahh. Pretty good
racket to have on the side.

87
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,416
I just hope we caught the one
I was looking for specifically.

88
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,458
[OKAJIMA]
Nice trap. For an amateur.

89
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,666
And you call
yourselves assassins.

90
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,208
[SUGINO]
Okajima!

91
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,541
Hey, if you're happy with a
thousand yen, that's your deal.

92
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,000
Just try not to get jealous

93
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,000
when my homemade trap makes
yours truly a billionaire.

94
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,458
[NAGISA]
Billionaire?

95
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,708
I don't mess with chump change.

96
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,000
It's Summer, guys.

97
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,375
We're gonna be on vacation
for cryin' out loud.

98
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,708
You want spending money?

99
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,291
Pretty soon I'll have
enough to buy Okinawa.

100
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,708
Check out my beetle trap.

101
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,375
[KORO-SENSEI buzzing, chuckling]

102
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, yeah. It's what you think.

103
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,625
The best way to bait
Koro-sensei is with porn.

104
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,125
[MAEHARA] Wow. For a guy
who moves at Mach 20,

105
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,875
he sure stops to smell the
roses when it comes to that.

106
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,208
[SUGINO] Look at him.
He's completely riveted.

107
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,333
[MAEHARA]
Anyone else think it's weird

108
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,166
he's dressed like
a stag beetle?

109
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,416
[SUGINO] A giant stag
beetle with tentacles.

110
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,875
Way to blend in.

111
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,416
Every wooded area has
its own secret stash.

112
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,208
Its special repository for smut.

113
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,958
You stumble across it
when you're a kid,

114
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,750
and it's like a
veil's been lifted.

115
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,958
Your eyes are opened
for the first time.

116
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,166
Later, when you've grown up,

117
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,458
you donate your own
collection to the stash.

118
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,458
The circle of life.

119
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,208
This is what it is
to become a man.

120
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,625
And this guy's got a feelin'
today might just be the day

121
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,250
we're all ushered
into adulthood!

122
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,583
[NAGISA] Eh. That doesn't sound
like the circle of life to me.

123
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,791
You'd be so proud of me.

124
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,875
I did a ton of research
into what he likes.

125
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,291
I'm too young to buy the stuff,

126
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,875
but where there's
a will there's a way.

127
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,166
Uh? Wouldn't just about anything
with big boobs do the trick?

128
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,208
Oh man, shows how
little you know!

129
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,000
[OKAJIMA]
Porn's what dreams are made of.

130
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,541
But every dream is different.

131
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,083
Workout magazines.

132
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,458
Manga. The hardcore stuff they
sell in black plastic bags.

133
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,083
Your ideal type awaits!

134
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,625
This is kinda impressive.

135
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,750
You've been swapping out
the magazines in your stash

136
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,000
for over a month to determine
what stuff he likes.

137
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,125
Okay, but why would an
adult need to look through

138
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,333
some underage kid's secret
collection? That's just sad.

139
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,958
Hey. You an' me have a lot
in common, right, Kurahashi?

140
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,583
We both get so
absorbed in our prey

141
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,375
we end up knowing exactly
what makes 'em tick.

142
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,375
[HINANO]
Uh-huh.

143
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,958
I may have a filthy mind.

144
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,833
But its served me well
in pursuit of my goal.

145
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,291
It's because I'm a self-aware,
first-class perv

146
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,625
that I know the
uncomfortable truth.

147
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,791
In the end... pornography
will save the world.

148
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,791
[ALL] 
He's so cool somehow!

149
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,833
[OKAJIMA]
Check it out.

150
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,125
Under that glorious
stack of filth

151
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,708
is a net strung with
Anit-Sensei BB's.

152
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,750
And he's so distracted,
he has no clue.

153
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,583
When I give the word,
one of you cut the rope.

154
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,958
I'll jump in and finish him off.

155
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,666
[NAGISA] I suppose
anything can be a sword

156
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,333
if you polish it enough.

157
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,916
Okajima's porn trap could
actually do the trick.

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,416
Koro-sensei, prepare
to be run through.

159
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,166
[gasps]

160
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mm?

161
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,083
[squeals]

162
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,458
[SUGINO]
Um, what's he doing?

163
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,750
[MAEHARA] Why did his
eyes go all "dwee"?

164
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,875
Yeah, I don't have any
data on that face!

165
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,291
What kind of porn
does that signify?

166
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,500
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

167
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Thought you could hide from me?

168
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
A Miyama stag beetle.

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,583
With white eyes.

170
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,666
[gasps]

171
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,041
No! Are you serious?

172
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah, hello, Kurahashi!

173
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,833
Impressive specimen, eh?

174
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,375
Wow! I've been looking for
one like this forever!

175
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,500
[KORO-SENSEI
 I know, right?

176
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,166
Imagine it being in
our own back yard!

177
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,958
Come on! Another second
and we would've had 'im!

178
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,916
[MAEHARA] I don't get what
they're so excited about,

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,208
but a giant stag beetle
and a junior high girl

180
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,958
dancing on top a pile of porn

181
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,708
isn't something you
see every day.

182
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,041
[yelps]

183
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,708
[whimpers]

184
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,333
[KORO-SENSEI yelping]

185
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
How unbelievably embarrassing.

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,875
I'm mortified beyond belief.

187
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,458
Shame on me.

188
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,166
A molder of young minds ought to
be above this sort of behavior.

189
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,625
I knew there was a trap
under all this porn,

190
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,041
and yet, each magazine
was so much more tempting

191
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,916
than the last, I hadn't the
presence of mind to resist!

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,750
[OKAJIMA]
He saw right through me!

193
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,833
So what's the big deal
with this beetle?

194
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,875
It's just a Miyama
stag beetle, right?

195
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,458
Didn't you say that
artificial breeding,

196
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,166
made 'em all pretty
much worthless?

197
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,666
Actually, these go for a lot

198
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,750
on account of being
very hard to breed.

199
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,166
A mid-sized one is worth
its weight in gold.

200
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,791
One as big as this fellah?
We're talkin' a small fortune.

201
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,166
Shut up!

202
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Also, observe
the color of its eyes.

203
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,000
Usually, they're black.

204
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,416
These, however,
white as the driven snow.

205
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,375
We've discussed
albinism before, correct?

206
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,416
So I assume you're
familiar with the concept.

207
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,958
[SUGINO]
Yeah.

208
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,166
It's like, when an animal's born
without pigment or whatever.

209
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
With stag beetles,

210
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,250
albinism is only
possible with the eyes.

211
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,791
A natural-born Miyama white-eye,

212
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,291
as they're called
in the literature,

213
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,833
is exceptionally rare.

214
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,416
A valuable academic
find, to be sure.

215
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,583
This guy goes for hundreds
of thousands of yen.

216
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,458
[GROUP]
Hundreds?

217
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,208
I told Koro-sensei a while back

218
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,833
I wanted to see
one up close.

219
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,875
He promised to use his zoom-eyes
to find one of them for me.

220
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,458
Okie dokie, boys. Which one of
you rejects wants this baby?

221
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,625
[ALL]
Me!

222
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,916
Ha, you'll have
to catch me first!

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,083
[KORO-SENSEI] I beg your pardon!
I've already done my catching!

224
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,625
[NAGISA] Whether in natural
science, assassination, or porn,

225
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,208
Summer Vacation is
a time for discovery.

226
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's hope a week
from now in Okinawa,

227
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,708
we can put what we've
discovered to good use.

228
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,958
[NAGISA] Our Assassination
Vacation is soon.

229
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,375
Not a lot of time to
make a foolproof plan.

230
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,708
But saying we've upped the
ante on our training regimen

231
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,916
would be accurate.

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,958
[IRINA]
Oh, you adorable brats.

233
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,333
Go ahead, spend Summer
vacation working up a sweat.

234
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,583
I'll be relaxing,
thank you very much.

235
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,458
You need this too,
Professor Bitch.

236
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,083
In fact, I'd say
of everybody here,

237
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,625
you need to level-up the most.

238
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,500
I'm an adult, hon. We're sneaky.

239
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,166
You'll go at him with
your customary verve 

240
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,833
and I'll piggyback on all that
hard work to steal the show.

241
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,125
[LOVRO]
Will you now?

242
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,833
Some things can be
counted on never to change.

243
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:16,708
[IRINA]
Ah!

244
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,458
Lovro, sir!

245
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,250
He's been hired on as a special
instructor for the break.

246
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,208
We need all the
pro tips we can get.

247
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,750
He seemed like
the obvious choice.

248
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,333
[LOVRO]
Relax for even one day,

249
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,750
and your killing
muscles atrophy.

250
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,458
Unless you want to fail,
wear something respectable!

251
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,750
[IRINA screams]

252
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,083
[SUGAYA]
What do you know?

253
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,666
Someone even Miss Bitch
doesn't dare mouth off to.

254
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,416
Can't say I blame her, man.
He's as scary as they come.

255
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,125
Thank you for your cooperation.

256
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,541
Do not thank me yet,
my upright friend.

257
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,291
I am afraid I could not manage
to establish the contacts

258
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,333
you requested.

259
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,125
[KARASUMA] Perhaps your
former students were put off

260
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,250
by word of the
target's difficulty.

261
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,208
[LOVRO]
It is likely.

262
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,125
In any event, we must
rely on what we have.

263
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:02,583
Now, then. Just to be clear.
The target is not here?

264
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,458
That's correct. He's taken
a sabbatical to Everest.

265
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,583
Not a big fan of the heat.

266
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,708
[LOVRO] If we are to
have any chance at all,

267
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,791
secrecy is of
utmost importance.

268
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,583
This is your plan?

269
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,125
You neutralize the seven
promised tentacles,

270
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,583
and taking advantage
of his reduced speed,

271
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:25,166
the entire class throws in
and finishes him off. Not bad.

272
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,000
But I wonder if you
would explain to me

273
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,791
this business
of "psych attack"?

274
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,875
[NAGISA] Well, the idea
is to throw him off guard,

275
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:31,958
and slow him down.

276
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,250
Oh, he likes porn.

277
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,958
Makes no bones about
where he gets it, either.

278
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,500
Figure we'll use that on him.

279
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,541
[KORO-SENSEI] Look, just promise
not to tell your classmates,

280
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,041
all right?

281
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,916
[MAEHARA] He bought our silence
with a round of popsicles,

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,666
but it's gonna take
a lot more than that

283
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,000
to keep us from
spilling the beans!

284
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,666
[GROUP] Let's gang up and
teach the perv a lesson

285
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,833
he won't soon forget!

286
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,208
It would really get in his head

287
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,000
if we threatened
to blackmail him.

288
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,916
He'll be so freaked out
by what we've got.

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,250
[LOVRO]
These children are brutal.

290
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:59,833
That said. The key to
assassination is killing blow.

291
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:04,208
The difference between success
and failure is timing and aim.

292
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,666
Be straight with me.

293
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,541
Are you worried the class
doesn't have what it takes?

294
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,416
No worry. Not at all.

295
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,250
In fact, I am quite
confident in them.

296
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,250
[KARASUMA]
That one's Chiba Ryunosuke.

297
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,541
Excels in spatial calculations.

298
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:22,041
As a long-range sniper,
I daresay he's second to none.

299
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,500
Then there's Rinka Hayami.

300
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,708
Good balance,
admirable dexterity.

301
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,125
Unparalleled kinetic
visual acuity.

302
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,000
There's no one better for
taking down a moving target.

303
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,958
[LOVRO] You never hear these
two brag about their skills.

304
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,166
They let their results
do the talking.

305
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,500
Yes. I would love to have
them as students of my own.

306
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,541
But if I speak the truth,
I would take any in this class.

307
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,708
I am amazed how well
their talents have grown

308
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,250
in so short a time.

309
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,958
There is potential here.

310
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,541
Much of it.

311
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,500
She has learned
to stabilize her aim.

312
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,708
Some discover they shoot best
from cross-legged position.

313
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,375
Well done.

314
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,708
Wow, thanks!

315
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,625
That means a lot!

316
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,041
You there. Mind how you breathe.

317
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,541
Do not force it. Find shooting
style that best suits you.

318
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,083
[NAGISA] This guy really
knows assassination.

319
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,958
I'm dying to ask him
a question. I wonder...

320
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,208
[NAGISA]
Mr. Lovro, sir?

321
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,166
[LOVRO]
Hm?

322
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,416
[LOVRO]
Him!

323
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,291
Young man?

324
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,166
I assume you know the best
assassin in the world, right?

325
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,416
But what are they like?

326
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,041
[LOVRO] At a glance,
this boy is not much.

327
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,583
Ha, ha. But on
closer inspection.

328
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,083
What a bizarre question.

329
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,875
Why are you wanting
to know, son?

330
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,833
Uh. It doesn't.
I was just curious.

331
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,875
Ah. Well. In my
considered opinion,

332
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,083
there can be no question

333
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:45,083
as to who holds the rank
of World's Greatest.

334
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,125
Of course, professional
killers are a secretive lot.

335
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,458
They are rarely known
by their given name.

336
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,000
This one is no exception,

337
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,708
save he prefers to go by
a very particular nickname.

338
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,083
"The Reaper."

339
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:01,291
Mysterious. Elusive.
Cold as ice.

340
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,541
Trails of dead in his wake.

341
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,375
Death incarnate. An assassin
from whom no target escapes.

342
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,583
It is said if a killer
cannot finish a job,

343
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:13,041
sooner or later the Reaper
will step in to do it for them.

344
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,958
[NAGISA]
Sounds pretty intimidating.

345
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,833
We'd better kill Koro-sensei
before someone like him appears.

346
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,000
[LOVRO]
Pay attention, young man.

347
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,125
I will teach you a technique
that works without fail.

348
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,958
Works without fail?

349
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:29,541
[LOVRO] Indeed. A useful
move for all occasions.

350
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,916
A gift from an old pro.

351
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:37,250
[NAGISA] And just like that, our
Summer island getaway kicks off.

352
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,791
I think we're ready.

353
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,958
[KORO-SENSEI groaning]

354
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,666
[KORO-SENSEI] A boat. Why do
we have to be on a boat?

355
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,541
Couldn't we have taken a plane?

356
00:14:55,625 --> 00:15:00,000
Ugh. My head feels like
a washing machine.

357
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,833
Oh! I can see the
island from here!

358
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,541
Take a look! We're almost there!

359
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,291
Six whole hours from Tokyo.

360
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,791
The perfect setting to for
an all-out assassination.

361
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,083
[STUDENTS]
Okinawa!

362
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,833
[STAFF MEMBER] On behalf of the
Fukuma Resort Hotel, welcome.

363
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,916
We hope your stay
is a pleasant one.

364
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,041
Tropical juice, compliments
of the house. Enjoy.

365
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,666
We are livin' the high life!

366
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,625
You ain't jokin', man.
Everything's so island-y!

367
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,708
[KORO-SENSEI] A hotel right
on the beach. Outstanding.

368
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:34,125
And a smorgasbord of
structured leisure activities.

369
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,500
We're be savin' the
you-know-what till after we eat.

370
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,125
Right now I vote we have
some fun island style.

371
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,500
Why don't we all
split up into groups

372
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,291
like we did on the
school trip to Kyoto?

373
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,666
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

374
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,916
[KORO-SENSEI] A grand idea.
Play hard, kill hard.

375
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,541
This is how top-notch assassins

376
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,250
get the most outta
their Summer Vacation!

377
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,500
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Uh...

378
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,958
That hang glider seems
to be goin' kinda fast.

379
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,416
[INSTRUCTOR B]
What the--?

380
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,791
Did that crazy bastard just
pull a ninety-degree turn

381
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,833
comin' out of a barrel roll?

382
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,791
[KORO-SENSEI imitates a plane]

383
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,166
Aw, c'mon! This isn't fair!

384
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,708
How can we keep up with
you goin' all daredevil?

385
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,208
Calculating current speed.

386
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,666
Target moving a hundred fifty
kilometers per hour.

387
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,250
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

388
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Remember boys and girls:

389
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,916
a fighter jet is only
as good as its engine!

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,625
[MAEHARA] Who the hell are you
supposed to be dressed as?

391
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Jiro Horikoshi.

392
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,208
[ISOGAI]
Ha, ha. Very funny.

393
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,541
Whoa, whoa! Jiro who?

394
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,500
[ISOGAI] Horikoshi was
an aerospace engineer.

395
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,916
[MAEHARA] Oh, yeah.
I'm just gonna know that!

396
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,666
Group one's doing all right
with keeping him distracted.

397
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,625
You have to respect
anyone ballsy enough

398
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,791
to take shots at
a guy in mid-flight.

399
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,083
Good luck not drawing
unwanted attention, though.

400
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,041
[MAEHARA]

401
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,250
[NAGISA]
No kidding.

402
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,166
Okay, people! We're up
next! It's go time!

403
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,416
Everybody do what they need to
so we can go change!

404
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,958
[SUGINO]
On it!

405
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,416
[NAGISA] The idea is to make
it look like we're having fun,

406
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,708
even though we're working.

407
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,625
What looks like snorkeling
is actually recon.

408
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,500
We need to find
the perfect spot.

409
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ho-ha!

410
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,541
[KANZAKI]
That's a new look for you

411
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,791
What's that face mean?

412
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
It means only the front portion

413
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,500
of the hang glider
was shielding me,

414
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,541
and I neglected to use
enough sunscreen.

415
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,000
Now, then.

416
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,000
Did Group Four have dolphin
watching on the itinerary?

417
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,000
[OKUDA]
Yeah.

418
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,125
It's on a boat,
though. That okay?

419
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Fin-tastic!

420
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,541
[NAGISA]
So far, so good.

421
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,166
Each group takes turns
keeping Koro-sensei busy

422
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,208
while the others set
their plans in motion.

423
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,625
Where is he right now?

424
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,583
[HAYAMI] Group three has
him touring deep sea caves

425
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,250
on the other side of
the island. He can't see us.

426
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,333
We should be good to go.

427
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,791
Oughta give us more
than enough time

428
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,583
to scout out a decent
sniper spot.

429
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,041
I suggest we be quick
about it all the same.

430
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,958
[SUGAYA]
Smooth operators, those two.

431
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,166
[TAKEBAYASHI]
If I didn't know better,

432
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,583
I'd think they've
done this before.

433
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,875
[IRINA]
Really? Aw, damn it!

434
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,666
For the love of all
that's holy, it's a beach!

435
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,250
Where'd all the hot guys go?

436
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,250
[KARASUMA]
Last of the guests

437
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,083
skipped out about
15 minutes ago.

438
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,625
I'm afraid this whole
site's been reserved

439
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,291
for E Class shenanigans only.

440
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,250
They get an entire
beach to themselves?!

441
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,541
I didn't squeeze
into this outfit

442
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,416
to get ogled by the busboy!

443
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,625
[KARASUMA]
This is their most ambitious

444
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,500
assassination plot yet.

445
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,041
Hard to believe
it's going so well.

446
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,875
Would it kill you
to ditch work-mode?

447
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,708
Come on, there's a gorgeous
babe right in front of you.

448
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,416
[KARASUMA] There's only one
thing left to worry about.

449
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
[IRINA gasps]

450
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,916
Oh, hey. Look at you,
taking charge.

451
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,541
This settings really brings
out those primal urges--

452
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,916
You asshole!

453
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,958
[KARASUMA] Hey. I have
a question for you.

454
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,500
[IRINA]
Huh?

455
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,375
You've had more than your share
of field experience, right?

456
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,541
How often does an assassination
plan work perfectly?

457
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,083
[IRINA]
It's pretty rare.

458
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,708
If you're asking for my
professional opinion,

459
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,125
let me just tell you,

460
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,625
what these kids have in mind
is far too complicated

461
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,708
not to go tits up
somewhere down the line.

462
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,458
All in all, it's not a bad plan.
I'll give 'em that much.

463
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,083
Hell, I'm not just here
to work on my tan, am I?

464
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,416
I'm gunnin' for my
share of the spoils.

465
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,833
When things go south,
and they will, I'll be there.

466
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,958
Waiting to take the kill shot.

467
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,166
[KARASUMA] However this goes
down, I just want it to work.

468
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Whew! What fun, eh?

469
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,166
Sun, surf, sand, and more sun.

470
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,583
[STUDENTS]
What's with the tan?

471
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,500
How is it, even your
teeth have a tan?

472
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,125
So much for being able
to gauge your expression.

473
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,000
Have fun while you can, sir,
'cause after dinner, it's on!

474
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,500
[KORO-SENSEI] Ah, yes!
The shipboard restaurant!

475
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,125
I'm famished!

476
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,541
[MURAMATSU] Huh. You'd think
he'd be worn out by now.

477
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,541
[TERASAKA]
I'm worn out.

478
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,875
How much longer
we gotta do this?

479
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,541
Can't we just kill him already?

480
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,125
Nah. Be patient.

481
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,791
We'll knock him tonight, then
throw in for some real R and R.

482
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,833
So epic!

483
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,083
Everything's set up.

484
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,000
There's no way we don't
have this in the bag.

485
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,208
[ISOGAI]
Neat, huh?

486
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,291
We rented out the whole
restaurant just for us.

487
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,250
We can enjoy the ocean air
and eat our dinner in private.

488
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Can we indeed?

489
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,041
Somehow I get the
sneaking suspicion

490
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,833
you're trying to get me seasick.

491
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,125
That's a fair assumption.

492
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,125
Weakening the target
is Assassination 101.

493
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,166
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

494
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Well played, my boy.

495
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,708
But is your gambit as
infallible as all that?

496
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,458
Seasick or not, a target
expecting an attempt on his life

497
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,875
isn't likely to take
it sitting down.

498
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,583
[NAKAMURA, MEG]
You look like a bowling ball!

499
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
It's the sunburn, isn't it?

500
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,250
Forget your expression.

501
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,125
We can't even tell the
front from the back.

502
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,375
Can you do something about it?
It's freaking me out.

503
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,625
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

504
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, of course! I can do plenty.

505
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,541
Have you children forgotten
perhaps my quirkiest quirk?

506
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,291
I can molt!

507
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,708
There we go. All better.

508
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,791
Um, can't you only do
that once a month?

509
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:16,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Or, strictly speaking,

510
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,500
whenever the
occasion warrants.

511
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,916
But I rely on it sparingly,
as the energy consumed--

512
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Heh...

513
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,250
[KORO-SENSEI screams]

514
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,833
[SUGAYA]
Seriously?

515
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,500
Of all the times to put himself
at a disadvantage, he picks now?

516
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,708
[MEG]
Sorta makes you wonder

517
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,000
why we haven't been
able to kill him before.

518
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,375
[NAGISA]
This is it.

519
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,500
We've been training all
summer long for this moment.

520
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,708
No mistakes.

521
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,833
Everything's in place.
This time we hit our mark.

522
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Absolute heaven!

523
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,500
[KORO-SENSEI groaning]

524
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,250
Hope you got the
most out of dinner.

525
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,208
It may turn out
to have been last.

526
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,375
Get a load of the
spot we picked out.

527
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Heh?

528
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,500
[SUGAYA] It's a floating chapel.
Nice and far from the hotel.

529
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,166
C'mon. It's all right.
Have a seat and relax.

530
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,083
Might as well. There's
nowhere for you to run, now.

531
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,666
This'll be fun.

532
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,791
Whaddya say we start things off
with a little pre-show flick?

533
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
I daresay,

534
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,083
things are about to get more
than a wee bit interesting.

535
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,041
That's right: let me see that
inventive spirit shine through!

536
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,791
Show your teacher a classroom
of true assassins!
