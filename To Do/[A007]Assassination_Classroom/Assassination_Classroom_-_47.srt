1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:10,666
[KARASUMA]
The target is liquidated.

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,333
The planet is safe.

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:16,166
Your hard work over the
past year has paid off.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,416
I imagine you'll find a few
things difficult to swallow.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,708
Being stuck under constant
surveillance, for example,

6
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,750
or the fact that you've all
been slapped with a gag order.

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:29,791
Naturally, I'll do whatever
I can to lessen the burden.

8
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,291
My apologies in advance
for the inconvenience.

9
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,083
[STUDENTS gasp]

10
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,291
[MAEHARA] It's all right,
Mr. Karasuma. We'll be fine.

11
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,000
No worries. Whatever settles
this, we're on board.

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,416
We can handle it.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,458
Seriously, we don't wanna
complicate things for you.

14
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,666
That said, though, we do
have one tiny request.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,333
[BOTH]
Hm?

16
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:54,375
Kunugigaoka's graduation
ceremony is this afternoon, sir.

17
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,625
I think we've earned the
right to be a part of it.

18
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,583
Let us walk across the stage in
honor of Koro-sensei's memory.

19
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,875
[KARASUMA]
Mm.

20
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,125
Sure. Yes, of course.

21
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,166
I'll handle things and make
the necessary arrangements.

22
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,458
E-Class, rise!

23
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,791
[ISOGAI]
Mr. Karasuma. Professor Bitch.

24
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:22,541
For everything you've taught us,
we are eternaly grateful.

25
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,583
[STUDENTS]
We are eternally grateful!

26
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,541
[MAEHARA] So, where's
the ceremony exactly?

27
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,250
[SUGAYA]
Main campus is on lockdown.

28
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,291
They're probably having
it at the civic center.

29
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,791
[OKAJIMA] Our parents are gonna
have to bring our uniforms.

30
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,583
[KARASUMA] They've been to Hell
and back, and look at 'em.

31
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,291
So tough.

32
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,708
Are these the same
kids from a year ago?

33
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,875
[NAGISA] For all his advice,
Koro-sensei never said anything

34
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,333
about the E-Class
system being unjust,

35
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,125
or that we should try
to spark a change.

36
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,375
[EMCEE]
Hinano Kurahashi.

37
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,583
Sir!

38
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,208
[NAGISA] There's no
shortage of absurdities

39
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,083
in the world, I guess.

40
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,500
I say if you have the time
and energy to brood on them...

41
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,291
[EMCEE]
Nagisa Shiota!

42
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,625
Sir!

43
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,083
[NAGISA] ...you have
time to subvert them,

44
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,958
maybe even have a little
fun in the process.

45
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,875
[ASANO]
My, what a confident look.

46
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,958
No doubt we have your
former instructor to thank.

47
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,791
[NAGISA]
A word of advice, sir.

48
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,333
Maybe go a little easier on
your students from now on.

49
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,375
See ya 'round!

50
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,958
[OKANO]
What a nice little ceremony.

51
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,041
[NAKAMURA]
I was moved.

52
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:24,791
[OKANO]
Me, too!

53
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,000
[gasps]

54
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,333
[NAGISA]
Mom. Dad.

55
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,541
What're you doing
here... together?

56
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,875
Kind of surprising, huh?

57
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,708
At the end of last
month your, uh,

58
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,333
teacher paid me a little visit.

59
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,583
[gasps]

60
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,708
[KORO-SENSEI] Right off the bat,
your son asked for a favor.

61
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,666
He prefers to be called
by his first name,

62
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,958
as opposed to his last, you see.

63
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,458
So there won't be
any awkwardness

64
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,958
if he goes back to using
his father's name.

65
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,041
He wanted to nip that in the bud
before it became an issue.

66
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,208
He's a good student.
I have no complaints.

67
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:02,541
All signs point toward Nagisa
meeting his goals by mid-March.

68
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,916
All I ask... is that you give
his graduation your blessing,

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,500
as a family.

70
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,416
He and your mother told me
how hard you've worked.

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,333
It takes a lot of determination
to come as far as you have, Son.

72
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:19,000
We've, been talking, and
feel it's best for everyone

73
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:23,833
if we follow your example and
give our marriage another shot.

74
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:24,875
[HIROMI gasps]

75
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,083
[NAGISA]
How much of himself...

76
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,666
...did our teacher
need to leave behind?

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,833
[REPORTER A] Ceremony's over!
They're letting out!

78
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,375
[REPORTER B]
Time to get some reactions!

79
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,708
[ALL gasp]

80
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,791
--[REPORTER C] E-Class!
--[KARASUMA] Easy, folks!

81
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,125
This place is off limits
to the media!

82
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,583
[REPORTER D] Tell us about
the monster! Did he die?

83
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,125
How did he die?

84
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,625
[REPORTER F] Can you tell us
how your feeling at the moment?

85
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,541
[REPORTER E] Are you kids
really the ones who killed him?

86
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,875
[REPORTER G] Gimme a break!
I'm tryin' to do my job!

87
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,208
[KARASUMA]
Have you no shame!

88
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,250
These children have already
been through enough!

89
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,291
You're all vultures!

90
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,541
[REPORTER H]
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,458
[KARASUMA] All right,
everybody outside, now!

92
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,000
There's a bus on standby
at the main gate!

93
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,291
[REPORTER I]
Excuse me-- Ow!

94
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,375
[REPORTER J]
Hey! What the--?!

95
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,333
[REPORTER K]
What's the big idea?!

96
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,916
[REPORTER L] You're messin'
with our coverage!

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,958
[GAKUSHU]
Hmph.

98
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,458
Ugh... Coverage?

99
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,666
You people are messing
with our moment in the sun!

100
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,375
Y'know, the internet's gonna
go nuts when I post this.

101
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,416
Remember, we know what
you look like, scum! Ha!

102
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
[chuckles]

103
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,583
There. Nothing to
worry about, love.

104
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,458
Permit us to be your
escort to the front gate.

105
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,125
[GAKUSHU] With graduation
comes a clean slate.

106
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,541
But abandoning former classmates
in their time of need

107
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,708
would be disgraceful.

108
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,416
I may be ruthless,

109
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,666
but as your future leader,
I'm not about to court shame.

110
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,666
[GAKUSHU]
Akabane.

111
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,375
Seems like you're the
only one coming back.

112
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,333
Fair warning,
when all this is over,

113
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,083
I'll put you on the
rack if I have to.

114
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,625
This Koro-sensei
seems fascinating.

115
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,375
You're going to give me
all the gory details.

116
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,375
[KARMA] I mean, I could,
but thick-skulled as you are,

117
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,250
you might struggle
to understand.

118
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,041
Move it. You're bringin'
up the rear.

119
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,083
[NAGISA]
Whoa!

120
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,833
Off you go.

121
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,333
[ALL chuckle]

122
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,458
[NAGISA]
So many reasons to cry.

123
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,500
[NAGISA] A day like today
I'll never see again.

124
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:53,875
[NAGISA] Goodbye,
Kunugigaoka Junior High.

125
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:59,125
Goodbye, Class 3-E.

126
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,291
Goodbye...

127
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,083
...Koro-sensei.

128
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,500
[NAGISA] Afterwards,
lots of stuff went down.

129
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,541
Kunugigaoka came under fire
for involving its students

130
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,791
in an assassination plot.

131
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,708
The whole concept of E-Class
was abolished, thankfully.

132
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,125
After we left,

133
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,791
the old mountainside building
shut its doors for good.

134
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,416
As for the principal,

135
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,666
he was tried in the
court of public opinion

136
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,250
and forced to resign.

137
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,750
Of course, he is who he is.

138
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,416
Something tells me
he had a backup plan.

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,375
Whatever else can
be said about him,

140
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,583
there's no denying he's
a man of conviction.

141
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,625
We haven't seen the last of him.

142
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,791
He'll be back on
his feet in no time.

143
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,750
[NAGAI] Anything you need,
sir, we're glad to help.

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,125
[ASANO]
Ah! Nagi! Mori! It's been years!

145
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,541
[NAGAI]
We heard you're having trouble,

146
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,250
and were worried about you.

147
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,958
[MORI] Not just you, actually,
all the kids that came after us.

148
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,000
Please, sir, there has to be
something we can do for you.

149
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,833
Let us help an old mentor
in his darkest hour.

150
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,166
In point of fact,
your timing is excellent.

151
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,125
You two can help me celebrate.
I've been saving this bottle.

152
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:37,166
New beginnings are rather high
on the list of reasons to toast.

153
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,791
Raise a glass with me.

154
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,208
Get me up to speed on your
lives. I'll air my complaints.

155
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,250
[BOTH gasp]

156
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,208
We're glad to lend you an ear.

157
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,041
[MORI]
All three of us.

158
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,416
[NAGISA]
The bounty was promptly paid.

159
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,291
[STUDENTS gasping]

160
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,708
[NAGISA]
No fuss. Just cold, hard cash.

161
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,291
Hush money, really.

162
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,291
Mr. Karasuma told us as
much and we understood.

163
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,666
So... all that was left
was how to spend it.

164
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,666
We consulted "Koro-sensei's
Rules to Live By."

165
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,083
[KORO-SENSEI] The accomplishment
is its own reward.

166
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,416
Nothing stunts your growth

167
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,583
quite like immediate access
to troves of money.

168
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,958
[NAGISA]
With that in mind,

169
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,791
we all set aside a little
something to live on,

170
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:27,708
college tuition, charitable
donations we believed in,

171
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:32,958
and one big-ticket item that
we purchased as a class.

172
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,375
The rest of it, we gave
back to the government

173
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,166
as a thank you for the
incredible year they'd given us.

174
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,958
Mr. Karasuma, excuse me,

175
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:47,583
Agent Karasuma's
career is sure to take off.

176
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:51,333
Slowly, the crescent
moon began to crumble.

177
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,083
Under its own gravity,

178
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:58,166
it would end up a much
smaller sphere than before.

179
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,875
The explosion had
moved it, though.

180
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,000
It now orbited a lot
closer to Earth.

181
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,458
After a while,

182
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,416
the shape, size, gravitational
pull, what have you,

183
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,875
would come to resemble the moon
as we'd known it all our lives.

184
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,875
The crescent that symbolized
our year together...

185
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,916
...ever so gradually...
would forget its shape.

186
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,625
[KARASUMA]
There's sectarian violence

187
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,958
brewing in the Middle East.

188
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,500
A group of radicals
is on the warpath.

189
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,166
We need a sleeper agent.

190
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,625
An operative who's willing
to infiltrate enemy ranks.

191
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,458
You'll ship out tomorrow,
understood?

192
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,041
Yeah. Sure. If that's the job.

193
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,375
[chuckles]

194
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,750
Oh, but I'm scared!
Whatever shall I do, Chief?

195
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,125
Imagine a sumptuous
creature like moi

196
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,500
getting captured
in hostile territory.

197
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,833
Or does the idea get
your motor running?

198
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,541
Your poor, defenseless wife

199
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,791
having all sorts of
horrible things done to her

200
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,958
by burly men in the desert.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,541
[KARASUMA] This assignment
reflects my faith

202
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,916
in your abilities,

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,375
but if you genuinely
see yourself

204
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,125
as poor and defenseless...

205
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,958
Ugh. Well then.

206
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,125
You give me no choice but
to assign someone else.

207
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,208
[IRINA]
Uh!

208
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,791
Wait! It was a joke!

209
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,416
Is it too much to ask for you to
show a teensy bit of concern?!

210
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,208
C'mon, sweetie!
Don't be this way!

211
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,166
[IRINA cries]

212
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,625
So are you going or not?

213
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,166
Yes! Yes!

214
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,583
[KARASUMA]
Then go get ready!

215
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,875
[IRINA]
Sir! With pleasure!

216
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,250
[sighs]

217
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,125
[KARASUMA] It's been seven
years since we've met.

218
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,791
She hasn't changed... at all.

219
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,208
[KARASUMA]
I think about those kids.

220
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,791
Our kids.

221
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:01,000
Whatever became
of them, I wonder.

222
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,166
What're they doing
with their lives?

223
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,958
[MAEHARA]
Ooo! We have a celebrity!

224
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,333
[KAEDE]
Hi, guys!

225
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:27,041
[ALL chuckling]

226
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,333
Look at you! You're in costume?

227
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,375
Are you sure you've
got time for all this?

228
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,958
Sure! I snuck off the set
during my lunch break.

229
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,666
I can't let you do the
heavy lifting without me.

230
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,916
[ISOGAI]
Awesome!

231
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,208
Okay, people, let's get
this place up to code!

232
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,750
[ALL]
All right!

233
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,208
[MEG] Yep! Class
President till the end!

234
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,625
[ISOGAI]
Hey now,

235
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,583
you're the ones who wanted
me to hold on to the keys.

236
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,958
[MAEHARA]
What can we say, man?

237
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,833
We know who best to delegate
this sort of thing to.

238
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,291
[ALL chattering]

239
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,291
Hey. You ever finish reading
Koro-sensei's advice book?

240
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,916
Nowhere near, actually.
It never ends.

241
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,250
Place is gettin' rough
around the edges again.

242
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,916
We shoulda hired a groundskeeper
when we bought the mountain.

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We can handle it.

244
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,833
If you let it get messy,
you clean it up.

245
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,083
That's one of the
old rules, remember?

246
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,083
Wow. Talk about hitting
the big time, Kayano.

247
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,375
You've made it!

248
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,791
[MAEHARA] You bet she has.
She's got the look.

249
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,375
She can do her own stunts.

250
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,625
Did you see her
dive off that cliff

251
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,250
like she was jumping into bed?

252
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,916
It'd be weird if
she hadn't made it!

253
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,250
Oh, come on.

254
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,708
I'm just using all the
cool stuff I learned here.

255
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,291
Hey, uh, Okajima?

256
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,458
Could you stop playing paparazzi
and get back to work, please?

257
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,000
[KAEDE] We wanted a memorial
to visit, but not a grave.

258
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,041
[KAEDE] After all, it didn't
feel like they were gone.

259
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:02,291
This is their home, a place
where they can dwell in peace.

260
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:06,500
Somewhere those who love
them can always come back to.

261
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,375
I've been thinking, guys.

262
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,250
We really oughta put this
place to good use, y'know?

263
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,958
Preserving it's fine and all,
but it doesn't feel like enough.

264
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,583
[MAEHARA] Okano's using the back
of the mountain a lot lately.

265
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,000
You know she put together

266
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,500
an acrobatic performance squad
for her college, right?

267
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,458
Said this was the training
ground she's used to,

268
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,666
so why not?

269
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,333
Okay, let's run the
circuit! Try to keep up!

270
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,416
[OKANO]
Let's see some hustle!

271
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,416
[ALL gasp]

272
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,958
[MAEHARA]
Pretty sweet, huh?

273
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,791
And recently Kurahashi started
giving nature tours to kids.

274
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:38,958
No kidding?

275
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,125
Well, she's always known
how to make money.

276
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,333
[HINANO] Here we go!
Are we all ready?

277
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,541
Be careful where you step, okay?

278
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,458
[CHILDREN]
Okay!

279
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,916
[KAEDE]
Huh.

280
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,875
We've grown up exactly as
Koro-sensei taught us to.

281
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,416
Just look at Manami
and Takebayashi.

282
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,916
They've literally taken a
page from our life manuals

283
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,541
and put it to good use.

284
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,166
Koro-sensei hinted at
a cell activation recipe

285
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,916
they're now researching
to make artificial blood.

286
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,791
Dear God. The lives we can save.
The number is mind-boggling!

287
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,125
Well, Okuda handled
the development phase.

288
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,458
Credit goes to her.

289
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,000
Personally I'm eager to
explore the clinical side.

290
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,625
Our, uh, name for it is
"Rh Slither Blood."

291
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,833
[KAEDE]
And there's Sugino,

292
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,583
who's become a
college baseball star.

293
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,500
[UMPIRE]
Strike three!

294
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,583
--[CROWD cheering]
--Yeah!

295
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,083
[KAEDE]
His versatile pitching style

296
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,750
caught the eye of pro
scouts from all over.

297
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,000
Incredible. So the
rumors are all true.

298
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,791
They don't call him
"Slithery Sugino" for nothin'!

299
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,500
[KAEDE] As for Terasaka,
his particular skills

300
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,000
caught the eye of a certain
professor politician.

301
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,916
Hop to! Ugh!
We're late enough as it is!

302
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,500
Damn it, kid.
Are you a man or a mouse?

303
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,458
Son of a bitch. Way to drive
me like a mule, you old fart!

304
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,791
[KAEDE]
Once he's out of college,

305
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,250
he'll be promoted to
personal assistant.

306
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,458
Yoshida and Muramatsu
are thriving.

307
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,416
They've taken over
the family businesses.

308
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,458
Purrin' like a baby kitten.

309
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,083
Ha-ha. I guess so.

310
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,833
[MURAMATSU'S FATHER]
Takuya! Get a load of this!

311
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,708
Heh! Makes your mouth
water, doesn't it?

312
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,958
[MURAMATSU]
Uh!

313
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,666
You have any idea how
much that thing cost?

314
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,125
How the hell are we supposed
to make a profit, genius?!

315
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,250
[KAEDE] Itona went to work
in his father's factory

316
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,375
right after high school.

317
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,958
Well, if this doesn't do
the trick, I know some guys.

318
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,875
They'd be happy to come
help me out with it.

319
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,416
[KAEDE]
So he's good.

320
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,958
Speaking of technical stuff,
Ritsu's completely online now.

321
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,375
[RITSU]
I'm parallel processing

322
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,916
with computers from
every corner of the globe!

323
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,875
I can make songs. I can draw.

324
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,708
I can explore my
emotional range!

325
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,416
[KAEDE] Yep. She's living
the life. A free spirit.

326
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,000
And she loves nothing more than
to help out her old classmates.

327
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,541
That's what we're up to.

328
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,958
Adapting ourselves as necessary,
seeing where life takes us.

329
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,625
Oh! D'you here about Karma?

330
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,083
Dude, he passed the national
civil service exam

331
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,208
with flying colors.

332
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,625
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

333
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,041
Good luck seein'
him tank, right?

334
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,375
Yeah, well, they say
the hard part comes after.

335
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,083
He's good, sure, but now
there'll be a lot of red tape.

336
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,750
Tons of interviews. Training.
Interdepartmental hazing.

337
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,166
Of course, if anyone can thrive
in that environment, it's him.

338
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,625
[KARMA]
Huh.

339
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,958
Gotta say, I'm likin' the
looks of my new wallet.

340
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,875
[KAEDE]
Yeah. He's gonna be just fine.

341
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,500
As a matter of fact, we all are.

342
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,416
[chuckles] Wait! Stop!
I wasn't ready! Oh!

343
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
[MEG growls]

344
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,541
O-ka-ji-maaa.

345
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,291
[screams]

346
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,958
[MEG] What part of your brain
told you that was a good idea?!

347
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,583
[OKAJIMA]
It was an accident! I swear! Ah!

348
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,958
[KAEDE]
Honestly,

349
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,750
I think whatever path
we chose in life,

350
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,416
it's a safe bet Koro-sensei
would've approved.

351
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,041
I can see him saying,
"It suits you."

352
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,291
We had one year together.

353
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:11,500
You can live a lot of
different lives in that time.

354
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,625
They become part of you.

355
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,833
They become your guide.

356
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,541
Your world.

357
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,333
[KAEDE]
There's the life of pride...

358
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,208
Outrageous! This is
ten times the estimate!

359
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,791
Don't you dare! I'm an artist;
I charge what I'm worth!

360
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,083
[KAEDE]
The life of service...

361
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,583
I thought we'd visit
the park today.

362
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,958
Is that something you'd like?

363
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,125
[KAEDE]
The life we're given...

364
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,208
I know! That show has
totally gone off the rails!

365
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:51,000
[KAEDE] The life we hope
to bring into the world...

366
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,833
Whatever happens...
we're connected.

367
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:58,125
Every one of us. Forever.

368
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,416
Trading lives back and forth,

369
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,250
across a classroom
steeped in bloodlust.

370
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:10,416
This classroom.
Our tribute to Koro-sensei.

371
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,750
And who knows?

372
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,625
Maybe one day a new generation

373
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,666
will live as many
lives here as we did.

374
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,583
So, tell me the truth.

375
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,666
Have you been keeping
in touch with Nagisa?

376
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,625
What's the story there?

377
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,458
Well.

378
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,833
There isn't one.

379
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:36,166
I'm not really on his
radar these days, sadly.

380
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,625
You know how he is.

381
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,750
Always keeping his
eye on the target.

382
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,791
Okey dokey! Hey, class!

383
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,041
I'm your teacher in training,
Nagisa Shiota.

384
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,500
Pleased to meet you.

385
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,208
[NAGISA]
It's been seven years.

386
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,250
I'm way taller
than I used to be,

387
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,583
and I'm a beloved teacher.

388
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,583
[NAGISA]
In my dreams, at least.

389
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,958
A teacher in training?!

390
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,125
You gotta be shittin' me!

391
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,208
C'mon, guys, leave
the poor girl alone!

392
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,875
[DELINQUENT D]
Why're you dressed like a boy?!

393
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,125
[DELINQUENT E]
What're you? Junior High?

394
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,625
[NAGISA]
Life is so unfair.

395
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,000
You'd think I'd
have a few inches

396
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,541
on my Junior High self by now.

397
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,458
Everyone else
shot up like weeds.

398
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,666
And Karma?

399
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,875
He's over six feet
tall now! No, seriously!

400
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,583
For my training, they put me
in the last circle of Hell.

401
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,541
Nothing like our
Assassination Classroom.

402
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,458
Totally different dynamic.

403
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,291
[DELINQUENT A] You have any
idea the hurt you're in for

404
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,875
in this place?

405
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,833
[DELINQUENT C] From now on this
is a study hall, you got that?

406
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,375
Uh, the bell's rung.

407
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,833
I'd like to ask you to
take your seats, please.

408
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,416
Oh-ho, that's cute!

409
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,416
[DELINQUENTS chuckling]

410
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,458
Shut up. You don't get
to boss us around.

411
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,166
We'll kill you.

412
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,041
What?

413
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,583
[NAGISA]
Kill... me?

414
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,583
[DELINQUENTS gasp]

415
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:05,708
[NAGISA]
Interesting word... kill.

416
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,750
Evocative, but overused.

417
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,125
It's lost some of its mojo.

418
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,125
[NAGISA]
For some of us, though,

419
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,166
it still holds the
right kind of magic.

420
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,625
[LEADER yelps]

421
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:25,166
[DELINQUENTS gasping]

422
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,791
[LEADER whimpering]

423
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,583
You're welcome to try.

424
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,041
[LEADER]
Huh?

425
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,625
[NAGISA]
You have until graduation.

426
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,166
All right, people.

427
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,375
Let's get started, shall we?
