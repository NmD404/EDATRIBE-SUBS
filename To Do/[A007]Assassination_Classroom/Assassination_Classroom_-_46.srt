1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,500
[NAGISA] From the start,
we'd been protected.

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:14,750
Because our teacher, our
larger than life mentor,

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:19,000
was as kind and as
caring as he was strong.

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,625
[NAGISA]
Kayano.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't even know what to say!

6
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,166
Nagi-- Achoo!

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,708
It's cold.

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,583
[KAEDE yelps]

9
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,791
What-What happened to my top?

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,541
[KAEDE]
Wh-What?

11
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,458
I'm so sorry.

12
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,291
Shut up!

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,083
[MAEHARA]
Easy now.

14
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,583
Hey, at least Koro-sensei
managed to fix your hair.

15
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,041
I know, but...

16
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,000
...I wish he could've done
something about my clothes.

17
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,416
So, uh,

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,416
I don't know if this is
appropriate for me to ask, heh,

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,333
but is it just me or
did she come out of that

20
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,500
a bigger cup size?

21
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,541
Koro-sensei. You can do that?

22
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,000
[sighs]

23
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
I am exhausted.

24
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,583
[NAGISA]
As we watched him collapse,

25
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,000
we couldn't shake
the impression.

26
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:21,041
He looked spent, but happy.

27
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Come now.

28
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,333
What kind of assassin lets
a target linger indefinitely

29
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:29,541
on the brink?

30
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,375
Don't you understand?

31
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:36,458
At this point, we're just
running out the clock.

32
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,375
I'm sorry, children.

33
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,583
All good things must
come to an end.

34
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,208
That's life.

35
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,458
That's the nature
of the classroom.

36
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,333
[NAGISA] The red light
from above began to swell,

37
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:58,291
indicating eloquently, cruelly,
that the hour had come.

38
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:02,291
It hurt, but we didn't
have a second to waste.

39
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,708
[ISOGAI]
Guys.

40
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,625
We have to make a decision
one way or the other.

41
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,458
[ISOGAI]
We could stay out of it,

42
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,208
leave Koro-sensei's
fate up to them.

43
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,208
Let's take a vote.

44
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:30,125
Who here doesn't
want to kill him?

45
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,125
[ISOGAI] All right,
thank you. Hands down.

46
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,125
Who wants to kill him?

47
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,958
[NAGISA]
They were a part of us.

48
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:12,708
Our guns. Our knives.
Our teacher.

49
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:26,500
[NAGISA]
This is it. This is our answer.

50
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,541
We're assassins.

51
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,875
Our target is our teacher.

52
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:40,083
[NAGISA] These were the
nonnegotiable terms of our bond,

53
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,083
the only way to
graduate with honor.

54
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:47,083
We knew what had to
be done, and it hurt.

55
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,916
You can't move if we're
all pinning you down.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,375
That right, sir?

57
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Precisely, Nakamura my dear.

58
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,041
Though I can't help but feel

59
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,500
you're being a tad
bit lax on that grip.

60
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,541
[ALL gasp]

61
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,666
[NAGISA] We didn't give
much thought to why.

62
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,291
Just tried to focus
on the task at hand.

63
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:32,291
He'd praised us, scolded us,
nurtured us all year,

64
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,875
and here we were,
holding him down,

65
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,375
clutching for all we were worth.

66
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:44,083
[MEG] Your heart, it's-it's
under your tie, you said?

67
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,000
Which one of us... is gonna...?

68
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:53,041
[STUDENTS gasp]

69
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,916
[NAGISA]
Guys... please.

70
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,833
[NAGISA]
Let me. I'll do it.

71
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,500
Sure, I got no beef with that.

72
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,958
Well, you are the
head of the class,

73
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,125
so I suppose
it makes sense.

74
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,208
[NAGISA]
Sir--

75
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
It's all right.

76
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:50,541
You can actually
stab through the tie.

77
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:54,916
There's been a hole in it since
the day it was given to me.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,041
I decided to leave
it like that...

79
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,125
...for... sentimental reasons.

80
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah, before you proceed...

81
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,875
...let me say farewell
to my fellow educators.

82
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:13,833
Miss Irina, are you
sure you won't join in?

83
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,583
I'd hate for you to
miss out on the bounty.

84
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,500
No, thank you.
I'd really rather not.

85
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,208
Who gives a damn?
It's only money.

86
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,416
What I've learned in this
class is more valuable.

87
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,791
It isn't about me.

88
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,583
It's about the bond you
share with these kids.

89
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Indeed.

90
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,083
Mr. Karasuma.

91
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,666
I thank you.

92
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,583
You've had a hand in
molding these children

93
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,500
into what they've become.

94
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,416
If you please, continue
to guide them on their way

95
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,208
after I'm gone.

96
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,666
Of course.

97

You've given me no end of
trouble over the past year.

98
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,750
But, even so, it's been
a year I'll never forget.

Rest in peace. Koro-sensei.

00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,500

Quite.

There's so much more
I could say, but alas,

103
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,541
I'll be lucky to
squeeze in what I can.

104

In lieu of tearful goodbyes,
if you'll indulge me...

please say, "Here."

through everyone,

175
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,208
[grunts]

176
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Koki Mimura.

177
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,875
[MIMURA]
Here.

178
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
So please...

179
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Takuya Muramatsu.

180
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,125
Yeah.

181
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
...in this moment...

182
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Toka Yada.

183
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,166
Here!

184
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,666
[KORO-SENSEI] ...let me be
the finest expression...

185
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,541
...of your bloodlust.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Taisei Yoshida.

187
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,416
Here!

188
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
If I die knowing I've helped

189
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,458
these 28 souls find
a brighter future...

190
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,041
[KORO-SENSEI] Autonomous
Intelligence Fixed Artillery,

191
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:14,958
Ritsu.

192
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,166
Here.

193
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
...I die exquisitely happy.

194
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Itona Horibe.

195
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,208
Here.

196
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
All things considered,

197
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,666
I'd say it's been an
exceptionally fun year.

198
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
I say this with all sincerity.

199
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,333
It's a privilege to be
assassinated by you.

200
00:13:56,416 --> 00:14:01,208
As a fellow spirit,
from one traveler to another,

201
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,750
give a yell for all life...

202
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
...and strike.

203
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,625
[NAGISA]
This is it.

204
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,125
This is the part
where I kill him.

205
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,708
[NAGISA]
I'm shaking.

206
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,000
[NAGISA]
Why can't I stop shaking?

207
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:52,291
[heart beating]

208
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,958
[screams]

209
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,125
[gasps]

210
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:16,583
[KORO-SENSEI] Don't kill me with
anguish in your heart, Nagisa.

211
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,791
Nice, deep breath.

212
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,541
Give us a smile.

213
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:30,875
[NAGISA crying]

214
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:48,458
[crying continues]

215
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:02,208
[crying continues]

216
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:21,916
Goodbye... Koro-sensei.

217
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Goodbye... Nagisa.

218
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,166
[NAGISA]
The bare minimum.

219
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,375
That's all I could
bring myself to say.

220
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,333
Gratitude. Regret.

221
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,750
I put everything
I felt into that blade.

222
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,083
Like I was channeling my soul.

223
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:51,375
With every fiber of
my being, I thanked him...

224
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,083
...with my knife.

225
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,958
[NAGISA]
As his life ebbed away,

226
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,833
it was as if he were saying,
"Congratulations."

227
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:19,333
[NAGISA crying]

228
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:32,791
[wailing]

229
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:38,833
[STUDENTS crying]

230
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:50,291
[crying continues]

231
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,958
[IRINA sniffs]

232
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:11,375
[crying]

233
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:20,750
[wailing]

234
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,541
[NAGISA] Very soon,
it would be midnight.

235
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:37,416
Graduation day...
at Kunugigaoka.

236
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,041
[NAGISA] We'd finished
the year a little early.

237
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,041
Time to turn our sights
on what lay ahead.

238
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,375
[NAGISA] Afterward, we went
back to the classroom,

239
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,708
hoping to find some
trace of Koro-sensei.

240
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,041
There were diplomas
waiting for us.

241
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:25,166
And a yearbook.
One for each of us.

242
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,666
And copies of "Koro-sensei's
Rules to Live By."

243
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,000
Apparently, the laser
fired off at some point,

244
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,875
but it mattered so little.

245
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,916
I don't think any
of us even noticed.

246
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,583
A reconnaissance squad
showed up later.

247
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:45,250
Mr. Karasuma took it upon
himself to lay down the law.

248
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,208
He told them we fell
under his jurisdiction,

249
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:54,291
that students and classroom
alike were to be left in peace.

250
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,833
Koro-sensei's book was thick.

251
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,708
It had more pages
than a dictionary.

252
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,541
And while it began as a
friendly, easy-to-read manga,

253
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,125
before long...

254
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,833
[KORO-SENSEI] I'm especially
proud of the workbook appendix.

255
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,666
And the short stories composed
for the vocabulary section

256
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,333
are absolutely riveting,
if I do say so myself.

257
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,875
You know what would
be a great idea?

258
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,750
A spinoff manga
starring me, still alive!

259
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,666
Ooo! I can be the big bad!

260
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,250
[NAGISA]
His advice was great,

261
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,750
but we got kinda fed up
with the level of detail.

262
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,666
[groans]

263
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,000
[NAGISA]
Before we knew it,

264
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,666
our tears had washed away in
the sweet release of sleep.

265
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,375
[NAGISA]
We woke to find sunlight

266
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,291
pouring through the windows.

267
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,833
[NAGISA] The cherry
blossoms were in bloom.

268
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:54,166
Small. Delicate. And strong.
