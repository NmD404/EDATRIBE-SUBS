00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:16,291
[NAGISA]
I... I got in!

2
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,750
Oh, thank goodness the
hard part's finally over.

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Congratulations
all around! Well done!

4
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,666
Those second blades twinkled!

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,791
Everyone was accepted into a
top tier school of their choice!

6
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,291
You'll be entering
into freshman year

7
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,958
like the rock stars you are!

8
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:34,083
Ah! What a tremendous
weight off my shoulders!

9
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,625
We're meant to begin
our final round

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,541
of career counseling
sessions today,

11
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,958
but there's something I'm rather
keen on doing beforehand.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,708
What might that be, you ask?

13
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,625
How to mark such
a joyous occasion?

14
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,125
Editing. Of course.

15
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,541
[STUDENTS]
Say what?

16
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, yes!

17
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,541
We will be
commemorating E-Class...

18
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,083
...with a special yearbook!

19
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,541
You're putting together
a yearbook just for us?

20
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes!

21
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,666
Oh, that's right.

22
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,375
We didn't get to have
any pictures of you

23
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,625
for the regular one.

24
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,708
Mr. Karasuma stood in
as the E-Class teacher.

25
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,375
Not that we didn't
appreciate that,

26
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,208
but it does kinda suck you
weren't in a single shot.

27
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,208
Um... he managed
to photo-bomb a few

28
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,833
under the radar, actually.

29
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,958
[SUGINO] Makes it look like
the school's haunted.

30
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Precisely!

31
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,416
Why rely on those pictures for
memories when we have these?

32
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
An entire year's worth
of candid moments!

33
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,666
A treasure trove of
student-teacher selfies,

34
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,250
thirty thousand strong!

35
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,208
Now, then, let us sort through
and find the best ones together!

36
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,541
[ISOGAI]
When did you take them?

37
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,583
[KIRARA]
Anyone else creeped out?

38
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,083
And if it so happens

39
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,083
we absolutely hate pictures
of ourselves, are we exempt?

40
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,250
Seriously?

41
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,666
My eyes are too small.

42
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Not to worry.

43
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,208
I've taken the liberty of using

44
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,791
the "big eye" filter
for maximum cuteness.

45
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,125
[NAKAMURA]
Wow. That's so nice of you.

46
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,166
You know, the shots they used
for the regular yearbook

47
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,833
are sorta by-the-numbers.

48
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,041
And if we did one ourselves,

49
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,375
maybe we could go a
little more avant garde.

50
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's the spirit!

51
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:32,000
Here we have cool beauty
Hayami at a local pet shop!

52
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,458
And here we have a wonderfully
kinetic nighttime shot

53
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,458
of Mimura on air guitar!

54
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,791
[BOTH]
He-He was there for that?

55
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
And I'm just getting warmed up!

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,916
Princess Kataoka, resplendent
in fresh royal vestments!

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,416
Sensitive Muramatsu,
reacting to an icky cockroach!

58
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,791
And Okajima,

59
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,333
tearing about the campus
in the nude for some reason.

60
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,791
[OKAJIMA]
Whoa! Hang on a sec!

61
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,375
I feel like this means
there might be some

62
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,791
questionable photos of me
floatin' around out there.

63
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,666
[MAEHARA]
More questionable than that?

64
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,666
[SUGINO] Everybody find your
photos and destroy them!

65
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,541
Leave no trace!

66
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Well, well.

67
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,000
Who would've have
thought yearbook editing

68
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,958
would get you all so fired up?

69
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,208
[ALL] Who did he think
would want to see that?

70
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Okey dokey!

71
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,916
Let's choose our picks for
the School Events category!

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,416
What do you think of
these, eh? Bring ya back?

73
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,958
[NAGISA]
Not bad.

74
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,083
This was definitely a
year worth remembering.

75
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Argh! I should've taken more!

76
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,125
This isn't nearly enough!

77
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,750
I wanted our yearbook to be
at least ten thousand pages!

78
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,666
[ITONA] Why don't we burn
'em all just to be safe?

79
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,625
[TERASAKA] Friggin'
dictionary's not that thick.

80
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Outside, boys and girls!

81
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,291
We what need is a random
assortment of cosplay shots!

82
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,958
That's it!

83
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,750
Oh, that's money.

84
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,583
Very nice.

85
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,916
Excellent! More outfits!

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,041
[KAEDE chuckles]

87
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,625
Is it me, or have
things gotten chill?

88
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,125
I mean, Koro-sensei helped us
study for the entrance exams,

89
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,958
but aside from that,
February's been a free-for-all.

90
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,375
Eh, it's more like we're
at the mercy of his whims.

91

[KARASUMA]
No. You're being spoiled.

He's just proud of how
far you've all come.

94
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,833
Figured it's time to
let you kids unwind.

95
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,250
Everything up to
now's been so intense.

96
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,791
Where's the harm in having fun?

97
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,625
That's what he's
thinking anyway.

98
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,541
Oh, I see.

99
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,458
What about you, Mr. Karasuma?

100
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,666
All things considered, do you
think we turned out okay?

101
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,000
Of course.

102
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,833
You've shaped up quite nicely.

103
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,875
In fact, if I ever
fall on hard times,

104
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,875
you'll be the ones I call.

105

to herself a lot lately.

109
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,791
[ITONA] Maybe she found
religion or something.

110
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,250

Huh?

111
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,083
Uh, what is this?

[KORO-SENSEI]
Come on now, don't be shy!

113
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,125
You simply must get in
on the cosplay action!

114
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,875
Or don't you find
the outfits suitable?

115
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,291
Oh, darling, think of
our first night together!

116
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,083
Not a chance!

00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Phew! All righty, then.

118
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,250
That oughta be enough for
all the campus photos.

119
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,291
Hang on a minute!

120
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,625
Do you mind telling us

121
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,500
why the heck we're all
stuffed in a giant purse?

122
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Alas, campus photos alone

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,375
are not remotely sufficient.

124
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,875
What's needed now are
mementos of a world tour!

125
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:21,916
You're insane!

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,708
What're you gonna do?!

127
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,125
Seems like a lotta work!

[chuckling]

129
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Nonsense.
I promise this'll be fun.

130
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:33,125
A little time, a little
effort, a little ingenuity.

131
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,833
And voila!

132
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,708

[STUDENTS screaming]

134
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,541
So all I really need to
do is pass this test?

135
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,125
Uh-huh.

136
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,791
Just think of it as your ticket
for back-to-school confidence.

137
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,375
If you can handle
what's on here,

138
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,375
you ought to be able to
breeze through first term

139
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,958
without any trouble.

140
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,875
And in your free time you can
adjust to the new environment.

00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,125
[SAKURA]
Right.

142
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,208
[SAKURA] This is my
ticket back to school.

143
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,541
This is my ticket
back to school.

144
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,541
This is my ticket... back to...

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,458

...school.

it was designed for... but...

00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,333
You've got this. Just stay calm.

Focus on the here and now.
Believe in yourself.

Okay.

154

like to be when you grow up?

Well, actually...

...I think I want
to be a teacher, sir.

160
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,041
Granted, I can't
get up to Mach 20.

161

I'm not exactly,

Excellent. I think we've got it.

but fleeting gift.

00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,250
I take it that was the last of
the career counseling sessions?

174
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mm-hm.

175
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:11,000
My, such exciting prospects
these children have.

176
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,375
The only task that remains is
editing the E-Class yearbook.

177
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,958
Seems I'll be spending my
nights here for a while.

178
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,291
[KARASUMA]
Oh yeah?

179
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,666
[KORO-SENSEI] We need an
article on the development

180
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,750
of yours and Miss
Irina's relationship.

181
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,333
If you wouldn't
mind an interview,

182
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,625
it should only take five hours.

183
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,208
Oh to hell with that! I'm gone.

184
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh?

185
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,083
Write about yourself.
You should preserve your wisdom.

186
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,625
[door opens]

187
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,250
[KARASUMA]
There's no getting around it.

188
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,625
Unconventional as
this class has been,

189
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,416
we've all learned something.

190
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,708
[KARASUMA]
The students.

191
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,958
Me.

192
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,083
[EXECUTIVE]
Report.

193
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,375
Yes, sir. He's in the
classroom by himself.

194
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,125
He'll be there for
the foreseeable future.

195
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,125
[EXECUTIVE] Well done,
Special Agent Karasuma.

196
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,583
You heard the man.

197
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:13,416
We make our move
tonight, March 6th.

198
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,416
Now, commence with
the assassination.

199
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,375
[EMPLOYEE A] Confirmed
direct hit on the school.

200
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,416
[EMPLOYEE B]
Target?

201
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,000
[EMPLOYEE A]
Getting a visual now.

202
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,708
Ha-ha! Look! Not so much as a
scratch on the entire building.

203
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:29,458
Our Anti-Tentacle-Creature
Permeable Laser satellite,

204
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,791
a.k.a. "The Spear of Heaven!"

205
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,041
Modeled on the tortoise

206
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,708
and powered by
antimatter life forms

207
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,875
the beam is amplified by
a giant particle accelerator

208
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,833
and fired from 250 miles.

209
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,083
It's designed to pass through
any and all barriers,

210
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,291
only liquefying
creatures like our target.

211
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,875
A powerful weapon
we've just deployed

212
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,833
without the slightest
hint of advance warning.

213
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,708
[KORO-SENSEI] What in heaven's
name was that? My tentacles...

214
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:02,750
[ALL gasp]

215
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,416
[EXECUTIVE]
Impossible.

216
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,250
He dodged it!
He actually dodged it!

217
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,791
[EMPLOYEE A]
A high-speed laser?

218
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,333
[EXECUTIVE]
What uncanny intuition he has.

219
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,666
No matter, this
is far from over.

220
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,291
[EXECUTIVE] Since he has the
poor manners to be alive,

221
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,791
he'll likely hedge his bets
and make a run for it.

222
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,583
But no matter, we're ready.

223
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,791
Tonight... will be
a night of surprises.

224
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,125
[EXECUTIVE]
Our Anti-Tentacle-Creature

225
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:51,250
Permeable Laser Barrier,
a.k.a.: "Shield of Earth."

226
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,708
Strategically placed camouflaged
ground facilities that emit

227
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:59,333
a matrix of laser beams,
enclosing the entire mountain.

228
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Is this?

229
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:06,916
[KORO-SENSEI groans]

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,916
[EXECUTIVE]
There's nowhere to run.

231
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,416
The lasers penetrate
into the ground.

232
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,791
A cage of light;
not to kill him,

233
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,708
merely to prevent his escape.

234
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,333
I'd hoped to finish him off
with that first shot.

235
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,333
Once we set Plan B in motion,

236
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,833
it's a fair bet all hell
will break loose.

237
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,166
Ready the ground troops!
Case B-One deployment!

238
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,333
[EMPLOYEES]
Sir!

239
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,333
[NAGISA]
What the--?

240
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,958
What's all the light?

241
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,666
[NAGISA]
We were so naïve.

242
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,875
Somehow, we got it in our heads
this would all end peacefully.

243
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,541
The government left
nothing to chance.

244
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,625
They had everything in place.

245
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,791
Right down to the smallest,
most horrible detail.

246
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:53,166
As you can see, these measures
serve to contain and eliminate

247
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,916
the clear and present danger
to mankind's existence.

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,166
Thanks to the Shield,

249
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,791
the entity in question
now has no place to go.

250
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,208
As it turns out, this is
the creature responsible

251
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,041
for the moon's
destruction last year.

252
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,250
We've only learned today
that this creature,

253
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,583
this monster, rather, has not
only made explicit threats

254
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,375
involving the
destruction of Earth

255
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,708
but has been posing as
a teacher, of all things,

256
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,250
in order to take a classroom

257
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,666
of junior high school
children hostage.

258
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,791
We don't know why, but the
evidence speaks for itself.

259
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,208
We have no choice.

260
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,291
[TOWNSPERSON A]
What's going on?

261
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,791
[TOWNSPERSON B]
What is that?

262
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,000
[SDF MEMBER A] Nothing to
see here. Move along, please.

263
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,208
[SDF MEMBER B] This road is
closed until further notice.

264
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,375
[EMPLOYEE A]
We're looking at another week

265
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,083
until the shot is charged up.

266
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,583
[EXECUTIVE]
Perhaps firing the first one

267
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,750
at 20% capacity was a mistake.

268
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,958
He still saw it coming.

269
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:43,250
Since the jig is up, the next
one will fire at 100%.

270
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,666
His death is assured.

271
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,625
In the meantime, we'll manage
the inevitable fallout

272
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,125
from people
looking to interfere.

[REPORTER A]
There they are!

00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you the poor children the
monster's been holding hostage?

284
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,500
Can you give us a few words?

285
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,916
[REPORTER C]
When did it first dawn on you

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,916
that you were being
held against your will?

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,208
How do you feel knowing
your teacher was dangerous?

288
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,500
[NAGISA]
Koro-sensei's been captured?

289
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,250
[REPORTER A] Can you tell
our viewers what it was like

290
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,958
in a classroom where the teacher
could explode at any second?

291
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,000
[FREPORTER C] Can you confirm
the allegations he was train--

292
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,416
That's enough! It's none
of your freaking business!

293
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,333
Do some basic
fact-checking, people!

294
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,750
The probability of Earth blowing
up is less than one percent!

295
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,208
Our teacher's not as dangerous
as he's been made out to be!

296
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,541
Leave him alone!

297
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,958
The stuff they're saying
about him isn't even true!

298
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,208
Yeah! Perfect!

299
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,625
Here's the human angle
we've been lookin' for.

300
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,833
Are these your own words

301
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,791
or simply what the monster
told you to say?

302
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,333
We know it must've been awful.

303
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,250
You're in a safe place.
Let it all out.

304
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,291
Clearly these boys and
girls are devastated.

305
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,375
Possibly suffering from
Stockholm Syndrome.

306
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,000
[NEWSCASTER A] No doubt the
trauma inflicted on them

307
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,208
by this reprehensible
creature runs deep.

308
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,291
Let's hope they get
treatment soon.

309
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,041
I can't imagine.
They're only babies.

310
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,291
Who could do such a thing?

311
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,500
As far as I'm concerned,

312
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,041
this devil deserves
whatever they do to him!

313
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,416
[NAGISA]
I don't get it.

314
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,916
Everyone feels sorry for us.

315
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,750
You don't have
permission to film here!

316
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,291
Pack up your equipment and go.

317
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,375
[REPORTER A] Excuse me, the

318
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,750
what's going on here, sir!

319
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,125
Oh, please! You're battering
children for ratings.

320
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,000
Don't get high and mighty!

00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,416
Everyone leave!

322
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,666
By order of the Defense Agency,
this area is off limits!

323
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,958
Failure to vacate the
premises will be actionable.

324
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,541
The students are safe.

325
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,083
They'll be taken into
protective custody.

326
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,708
[ISOGAI] Mr. Karasuma, what
have they done to Koro-sensei?

327
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,625
I'm afraid we're out of time.

328
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,208
The government had no choice

329
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,500
but to initiate their end game
strategy before it was too late.

330
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,041
End game strategy?

331
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,083
So is that what this
barrier's all about?

332
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,291
[KARASUMA]
The barrier's just a means

333
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,666
of keeping him from
being able to escape.

334
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,041
In a week, they'll use
a high-powered laser

335
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,083
to finish the job.

336
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,375
[STUDENTS gasp]

337
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,500
You're kidding me!
This was our assassination!

338
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,291
Yes, and your efforts
have not been unappreciated.

339
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,333
But it's time now
for you step aside.

340
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,958
So we do all the ground work
and you reap all the glory?!

341
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,541
This isn't fair. Why didn't
you tell us anything?

342
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,333
And how come the media's
totally making it

343
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,875
sound like Koro-sensei
manipulated us?

344
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,500
This is not cool, sir.

345
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,208
We were supposed
to assassinate him,

346
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,041
and now we're being dealt out?

347
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,208
You know Koro-sensei
won't stand for this.

348
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,125
He's expecting to be
killed by his students!

349
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,166
Come on, Mr. Karasuma! Please!

350
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,208
You've gotta tell them
to let us in there!

351
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,250
The mountain's been
fortified, I'm sorry.

352
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,166
Elite forces have
established a perimeter.

353
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,000
There're no openings
to be taken advantage of.

354
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,041
Your work's done here.

355
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,500
No, it's not!

356
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,916
There's too much we still
haven't talked to him about!

357
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,291
So many things we wanna try!

358
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,083
If you're not gonna help us,
then get out of our--!

359
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,708
You know I can't
let you in there.

360
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,416
National security is
on the line right now!

361
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,000
Now, you listen and
you listen good.

362
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,291
Do not give me a hard time.

363
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,750
Is that clear?

364
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,833
Give it up, Nagisa.
He's not on our side.

365
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,208
Just another stiff-collared
company man.

366
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,666
When it's down to the wire,

367
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,083
only thing a guy like him
ever does is follow orders.

368
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,625
[KARASUMA]
You're damn right.

369
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,750
And my orders are to protect
the people I'm entrusted with

370
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,166
at all costs.

371
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,250
Bottom line. One way or
another, he has to be killed.

372
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,791
Who does the honors
isn't up to you.

373
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:36,291
Get 'em out. Have 'em
escorted to a secure area.

374
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,458
Yes, sir!

375
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,708
Son of a bitch! Do you
believe this bullshit?

376
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,375
Did you hear what he said?

377
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,375
What?

378
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,250
About giving him a hard time?

379
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,416
I have a feeling he didn't just
choose those words at random.

380
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,541
[TERASAKA]
Okay. So?

381
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,708
Don't you get it?

382
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,416
Think back to what
he told us earlier.

383
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,583
You've shaped up quite nicely.

384
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,666
In fact, if I ever
fall on hard times,

385
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,791
you'll be the ones I call.

386
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,000
Those words.

387
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,791
I think saying "don't
give me a hard time"

388
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,666
was his way of getting across
that he believes in us.

389
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,750
Mr. Karasuma is counting
on us to handle things.

390
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,125
I'm positive.

391
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:19,458
So, let's put our heads
together and devise a plan.

392
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,625
We all know what
the goal is here.

393
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,500
We know exactly what
we're capable of.

394
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:28,958
The question is: What would
Koro-sensei want us to do?

395
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Buff, buff, shine, shine,

396
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,583
make is sparkle, make it gleam.

397
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,166
That's the way!

398
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,083
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

399
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,750
[KORO-SENSEI] Nothing like
cleaning to pass the time.

400
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
It's a bit lonely, yes,

401
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,750
but there's no point worrying
at this late in the game.

402
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Of course, if I had one wish.

403
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'd like to see them again.

404
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,916
Just one last time.

405
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'm up a creek.

406
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:25,208
At least that's what
everyone's thinking right now.

407
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:30,791
Alas, I'm a super-being capable
of moving at Mach 20 speed.

408
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,541
Fortunate, given how
much I have left to do.

409
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,958
[chuckling]

410
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
I can't bring myself to choose!

411
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,625
That does it!

412
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,000
The E-Class yearbook will
have to be super-sized!

413
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,708
[NAGISA] Countdown to
Koro-sensei's deadline,

414
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:00,583
approximately... three hours.
