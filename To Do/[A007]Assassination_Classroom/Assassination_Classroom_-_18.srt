00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Okey-dokey.

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,916
What fiendish assassination
ploy did you have in mind?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,208
First off we'd like you to
enjoy this little video

4
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,791
Mimura put together.

5
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,291
Then high rollers'll cash in
on those seven tentacles.

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,625
When you're incapacitated,

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,833
that'll be the signal for
everyone else to join.

8
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,375
What'cha think, Koro-Sensei?

9
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,458
Work for you?

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,625
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]
Splendidly.

11
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,750
We appreciate you
bustin' your butt on this.

12
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:36,875
Aw, thanks man.

13
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,416
It really came down
to the wire there.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,541
I had to work on the
final edit during dinner.

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hm.

16
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,125
A remote locale
completely surrounded

17
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,250
by seawater. The walls and
windows are more than likely

18
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:54,000
treated with an Anti-me agent.
Outright escape is too risky.

19
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:57,583
My best bet is to dodge their
attacks within the premises.

20
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,416
[NAGISA]
Sir?

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Eh?

22
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,916
Um. I'm, gonna have
to pat you down.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,083
Sorry about this, but
we can't take a chance

24
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,208
you have a swimsuit. That'd
sorta put a damper on our plan.

25
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
So cautious!

26
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,291
Admirable, but
you needn't worry.

27
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,166
[NAGISA]
He sure is cooperative.

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,333
Swimsuit or not,
once things get going,

29
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,958
Koro-Sensei can dodge
us at every turn.

30
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,416
Still, with all of us here,

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,041
he'll have his work
cut out for him.

32
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Well, children? Shall we begin?

33
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,375
Don't hold back. Come at me
with everything you've got!

34
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,791
Right. Whaddya say, guys?
Let's get to it.

35
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,916
[FEMALE VIDEO VOICE]
AC.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,791
[MIMURA]
Somewhere in Tokyo.

37
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,833
Kunugigaoka Junior High.

38
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,333
Class Three-E.

39
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,541
An average classroom,
except for the teacher,

40
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,166
who is, in fact, a target...

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
I can hear a few of them

42
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,125
shifting around in
the dark behind me.

43
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:36,500
A ruse, no doubt, to conceal
that some are leaving.

44
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,750
Alas, boys and girls, I can
establish who's outside

45
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,416
by the relative distance of
their scent. From the direction

46
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,625
of the shore wafts
the unmistakable smell

47
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:48,291
of our top snipers,
Hayami and Chiba.

48
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,208
[KORO-SENSEI] This video
is exceptionally slick.

49
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,583
You were editor and
narrator, Mimura?

50
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,916
Well done!

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,708
Professional-grade camera
work, compelling score.

52
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,833
The viewer is utterly
sucked in--

53
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,541
[MIMURA]
Thanks for tuning in.

54
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,500
Joining us tonight are
two recon specialists

55
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,166
with very intriguing intel.
We'll hear what they

56
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,041
have to tell us after this brief
public service announcement.

57
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,541
When you're a confirmed
porn addict,

58
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,750
bribery's no guarantee
against a scandal.

59
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
I gave you popsicles!

60
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,833
[MIMURA] Our subject's
preferred guilty pleasure

61
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,458
is the middle-aged executive.
The sheer size of his

62
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,250
"Cube Farm Cuties Quarterly"
collection is mind-blowing.

63
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,375
[KORO-SENSEI] Blast it,
Okajima! What is this?

64
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,166
--We had an understanding!
--[STUDENTS laugh]

65
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,250
[MIMURA] At a recent
women-only cake buffet,

66
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,958
a questionable attendee loomed.

67
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,875
Eye-witness reports
suggest, you guessed it.

68
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
My name is Koroko!

69
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,041
[MIMURA]
Hardly a master of disguise.

70
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,666
We're still not sure
how they exposed him

71
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,166
without realizing
he isn't human.

72
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,041
[KIRARA laughs]
Wow. I've got to hand it to you.

73
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,666
Ironically, it takes balls to
pull off an outfit like that.

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,458
[MIMURA] Between paychecks,
our porn addict defrauds

75
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,833
the public to secure
complimentary tissues.

76
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,208
What does he do with them?

77
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,125
The answer might surprise you.

78
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,333
He fries them.

79
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,958
That's right. Fries them.

80
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,166
As if this poor, wretched
educator's dignity

81
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,166
weren't already suspect.

82
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,125
--[MIMURA] And that's not all.
--[KORO-SENSEI screams]

83
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,875
[MIMURA] To truly plumb the
depths of this creature's

84
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,125
depravity, we've prepared a
full hour of shocking footage.

85
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,625
[KORO-SENSEI] There's a
whole hour of this dreck?

86

[KORO-SENSEI groans]
No point in killing me, class.

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm already dead.

88
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,291
Emotionally.

89
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,583
Intellectually.

90
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,666
Socially.

91
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,666
Dead.

92
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,916
[MIMURA]
Brutal, right?

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,166
But you've got to admit,
it held your attention.

94
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,416
Notice anything strange
while you were watching?

95
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,875
Like, about the venue?

What the...?

98
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,666
I couldn't possibly have
missed you flooding this place!

99
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,291
Unless...

100
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,250
...high tide!

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,250
[TERASAKA]
Weird.

103
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,541
It's like somebody trimmed
down the support pylons.

104
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,708
Seasick, shamed,
and water-logged.

105
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,875
This just isn't shaping
up to be your day.

106
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,458
Everything's conspired
to slow you down.

107
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,041
Right! Time to party, Teach.

108
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,708
Now, you made a promise.
So don't go backin' out.

109
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
This is going to be tricky.

110
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,833
But I know precisely
where the snipers are.

111
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:16,041
I just have to keep an
eye out in that direction.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,625

Commence operation... now.

Yeah, that's right.

We know a quick change
of environment throws you.

on the shoreline,

he didn't see the

protective shell around me.

173
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,083
Why "Absolute"?

174
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,583
Because it's
absolutely invincible!

175
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,041
[NAGISA]
Uh...

176
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,000
So, basically you're saying
as long as you're like this,

177
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,625
there's pretty much
nothing we can do.

178
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't fret, my dears.

179
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,958
It doesn't last long.

180
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,791
The crystals comprising this
shell tend to lose integrity

181
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,333
in about a day or so.
Once the bonds break down,

182
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,958
the shell will expand back
into its normal energy form,

183
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,666
and yours truly will
return to full size.

184
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,833
This form is
extraordinarily useful,

185
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,666
but the tradeoff is
complete imobility

186
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,750
for the duration. I can't
propel myself an inch.

187
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,208
This itself carries
its own risk.

188
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,666
Mom! Where did my thing go?

189
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,291
[MOM] It was hideous.
I threw it away.

190
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,291
[BOY]
No!

191
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,958
[KORO-SENSEI] For example, said
immobility would provide anyone

192
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,250
so inclined the perfect
opportunity for launching

193
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,708
me into space.
Something I rather dread.

194
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,000
I've done ample research
into that, however.

195
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,833
Happily, nowhere on this
planet is a rocket capable

196
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,541
of making that
flight in 24 hours.

197
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,875
[NAGISA]
He got us.

198
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,291
All that, and he got us again.

199

[KORO-SENSEI laughs]

200
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,666
[NAGISA] We exploited every
single one of his weak points.

201
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,958
And still, nothing.

202
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,166
[TERASAKA]
That's crap!

203
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,250
Nothing is invincible if you
whack it hard enough! [grunting]

204
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
You're wasting your time.

205
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,833
A nuclear blast wouldn't
leave so much as a scratch.

Oh, I see.

[TERASAKA]
Huh?

208
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,500
Well I guess that's it,
we're out of options. Huh.

209

[KORO-SENSEI screams]
You monster!

210
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,750
I can't bury my face in
my hands in this form!

211
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,333
Oh, sorry 'bout that. Let's see
if there's a way to help you

[KORO-SENSEI screams]

Anybody know where I can
find a creepy old beach bum?

215
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
I'm gonna shove Koro-Sensei
down his pants.

216
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,166
[KORO-SENSEI] No, no, no!
Someone help me, please!

217
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,541
I'd never take that form
with a bunch of kids.

218
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,125
Yeah. Not exactly
his smartest move.

219
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,416
Especially around Karma.

220
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,625
All right, that's enough.
Class dismissed.

221
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,625
For this one,
we'll let HQ decide

222
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,125
the best course of action.

223
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,916
[KORO-SENSEI laughs] Your
superiors will opt to toss me

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,375
in a pool of Anti-me liquid,
I'm sure. Good luck with that.

225
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,166
The energy displacement would
explode, as it did earlier.

226
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,583
Everything in the vicinity
will be blown sky high,

227
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,250
including your superiors.

228
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,750
[KARASUMA]
Mm.

229
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,916
[KORO-SENSEI] Still, you should
be proud, boys and girls.

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,500
Entire armies the world
over couldn't get as close

231
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,083
to killing me as you've
done tonight.

232
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,625
This was, by far,
the cleverest

233
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,291

I've ever encountered.

[NAGISA] Sure, he praises our
ingenuity like he always does.

237
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,958
But deep down,
we know we blew it.

238
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,583
This was our best shot.
How do we top this?

239
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,416
Never mind. I don't wanna
even think about it right now.

240
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,083
I need sleep.

241
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,125
Ritsu.

242
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,166
Hi, Ryu.

243
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,750
[RYUNOSUKE]
You recorded it, right?

244
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,458
As faithfully as possible,
utilizing high-speed camera

245
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,041
filters whenever they
seemed appropriate.

246
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,958
Would you like to see?

247
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,083
The second I fired, part of me
knew the bullet wouldn't hit.

248
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,083
It was like... I knew
he couldn't be killed.

249
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,791
I can only be approximate.
The time it took for Koro-Sensei

250
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,666
to adopt his Absolute
Defense Form is unclear.

251
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,500
However, by my calculations,
if your shot had been

252
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,541
point-five seconds faster,
or Hayami's thirty centimeters

253
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,333
to the left, the odds of target
neutralization would have

254
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,958
increased by fifty
percent, at minimum.

255
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,375
[HAYAMI exhales]

256
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,791
[RYUNOSUKE] The whole thing
was so easy in rehearsal.

257
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,875
I was so sure of myself.

258
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,125
I even fired from a less stable
spot at totally nailed it.

259
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,875
But then, when it
was real, I froze.

260
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,375
It's like my fingers got stiff
and my vision went all blurry.

261
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,541
Yeah, same here.

262

[RYUNOSUKE]
I just...

263
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,666
I caved under the
pressure, you know?

264
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,416
Too much was riding
on me making the shot.

265
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,333
The moment of truth was nothing
like  what we practiced.

266

I feel like I could
sleep for a month.

up to our rooms and crash.

the hard part's done.
I can't thank you enough.

340
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,833
Lady luck is definitely
smiling down on our cause.

341
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,958
--[KARASUMA grunts] Damn it!
--[KORO-SENSEI] Um... Karasuma?

342
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,791
Of all the times for
some psychotic bastard

343
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,500
to sabotage us!

344
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,625
[STUDENTS cough]

345
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,291
[SONOKAWA] Mr. Karasuma, I'm
afraid they're not cooperating.

346
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,250
Even when we play the government
card, the hotel owners maintain

347
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,541
they have the right to protect
their guests' identity.

348
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,541
Naturally.

349
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Intolerable!

350
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,375
[KARASUMA] But not surprising.
The resort our mystery man chose

351
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,208
is a known site for all
manner of illegal operations.

352
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,708
Remote, shady history.

353
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,541
It bares all the trappings of
an ideal rendezvous point.

354
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,041
The owners have connections with
Higher Ups in the government.

355
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,375
Law enforcement knows
to leave it alone.

356
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,250
[sighs] So basically there's
no way of knowing who

357
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,791
the prick is before we meet him.

358
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,166
Ah! Are we really gonna take
this psycho's word for it?

359
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,125
If he's bullshitting us
about the antidote,

360
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,458
we're all gonna die!

361
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,666
Calm down, dude, it's fine.

362
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,583
We came here to be killers,
not victims, remember?

363
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,125
Look how far we've come.
We'll figure this out.

364
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,125
Right. Yeah.
I'll try to stay positive.

365
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,000
[TERASAKA] No way we just do
what the asshole tells us to do.

366
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,916
I mean, come on, use
the runts as a proxy?

367
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,708
Send these two runt
in to close the deal,

368
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,250
and we might as well lay
down a die right now!

369
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,166
[KAEDE, NAGISA growl]

370
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,583
Okay, that was rude.

371
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,875
I'm sorry. I'm just pissed
off that someone's got us

372
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,333
by the balls. And my friend's
lives are in danger?

373
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,833
Forget about it!

374
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,041
We're so gonna die.

375
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,250
I vote we ignore what
the jackass wants us to do!

376
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,666
Let's get everyone
to the hospital

377
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,625
and forget this happened!

378
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,250
[TAKEBAYASHI]
Bad idea.

379
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,583
If we are in fact dealing
with a man-made virus,

380
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,666
a hospital would be
a waste of time.

381
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,791
Not even the most
state of the art ER

382
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,250
is be equipped to handle this.

383
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,166
There's no way for
them to treat everyone.

384
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,708
We'd be dead before they even
figured out what we have.

385
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,541
[TERASAKA]
Seriously?!

386
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,750
[TAKEBAYASHI] I vote we focus
on easing the symptoms for now.

387
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,250
You'd best start heading
to the rendezvous point.

388
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,333
That's the only way, huh?

389
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,500
[NAGISA]
Our hands are tied.

390
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,583
If Koro-Sensei could move,
we might've had a chance.

391
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,958
I'm starting to wish our
assassination attempt

392
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,666
hadn't gone as well as it did.

393
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,125
At the end of the day, this is
all happening because of you.

394
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,041
Gotta wonder if these kids'll
be willing to surrender

395
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,958
their quarry so easily.

396
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:00,958
[KARASUMA] One hour.
What the hell can we do?

397
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,000
[KORO-SENSEI] I think I
might have a solution.

398
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,041
[KARASUMA]
Uh.

399
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,625
[KAEDE, NAGISA gasp]

400
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,708
Koro-Sensei?
Everything is ready, sir.

401
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Excellent.

402
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,791
Ritsu's finished the prep
work I asked her to do.

403
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,333
If the healthy students
would step closer, please.

404
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,458
Be sure you're wearing something
you don't mind getting dirty.

405
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,625
--[KAEDE] Mm.
--[NAGISA gasps]

406
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,750
[KIMURA gulps]
So high!

407
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,375
--[phone chimes]
--[STUDENTS] Uh?

408
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,541
[RITSU]
I've successfully infiltrated

409
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,458
their network.
These are the proprietary

410
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,208
architectural schematics
of the premises,

411
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,416
complete with guard
post locations.

412
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,375
[RITSU] The highest
concentration of security staff

413
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,416
is stationed in and
around the main entrance,

414
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,416
where it's functionally
impossible to enter

415
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,458
without passing by
the front desk.

416
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,875
However, there is an
alternate point of entry along

417
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,041
the building's side,
just on top of this ledge.

418
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,875
The terrain doesn't permit
easy access, so security,

419
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,125
while present, isn't as strong.

420
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,208
[KORO-SENSEI] You don't want the
madman to have his way, do you?

421
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,583
Courage, children!

422
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,166
Ten of your classmates are ill.

423
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,166
Two others have been left
behind to care for them.

424
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,541
That leaves you to
operate on their behalf.

425
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,125
Sneak in, surprise our
mysterious adversary,

426
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,041
and steal the antidote!

427
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,791
[IRINA]
Irina Jelavich's...

428
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,041
[moans] Super-Secret
Skills Series!

429
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,166
[KORO-SENSEI] Did you know
that Miss Irina can control

430
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,000
her circulation to change
the color of her face?

431
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,625
Red indicates she's drunk.

432
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,458
Blue indicates
feelings of ill health.

433
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,750
All very effective tactics
when going undercover.

434
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,083
But, when she
tried to showcase

435
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,916
this talent, the students
accused her of being

436
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,041
a knock-off of me and her
face went red involuntarily.

437
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,500
[IRINA]
I've been doing this for years!

438
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,250
[NAGISA]
Assassination Classroom!

439
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,083

[moans] Super-Secret
Skills Series.

441
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,000
[KORO-SENSEI] Did you know
Miss Irina can arrange

442
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,250
and assemble an intricate hobby
model in under a minute?

443
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,875
While this does speak volumes
of her kissing technique,

444
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,666
we strongly recommend you not
touch the finished product.

445
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,958
Don't try this at home,
boys and girls!

446
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,791
[NAGISA]
Assassination Classroom.

447
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:51,000
[IRINA]

00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:54,208
Super-Secret Skills Series.

449
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,875
[KORO-SENSEI] Did you know
that Miss Irina is a master of

450
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,583
disguise, able to pass herself
off as practically anyone,

451
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,833
including some of your
favorite characters?
