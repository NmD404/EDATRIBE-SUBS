1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,333
[NAGISA] Having gotten our
hands on some juicy intel,

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:14,041
we took it upon ourselves
to investigate.

3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,750
At least that was our story.

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,000
To be honest, we'd
infiltrated this café

5
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,958
a good ways from school
just for the heck of it.

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,333
Wow. He looks
just like a prince.

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,083
[door opens]

8
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,458
Hi. Welcome.

9
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,791
Ah, yes. Good to
see you both again.

10
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,250
Mrs. Harada, Mrs. Ito.

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,166
Li'l Yuma. How are you?

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,208
Now, you realize we come here
more for you than the coffee.

13
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,458
Now, now. If the manager
hears you say that,

14
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,250
he's bound to get
his feelings hurt.

15
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,666
So, the usual?

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,041
Mocha for Mrs. Harada,
double espresso for Mrs. Ito?

17
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,750
Care for a slice
of chiffon cake?

18
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,208
It's our special of the day.

19
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,416
[HARADA] Ooh! Yes, please.
We'll take two.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,333
Indeed. Very good, ma'am.

21
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,083
[MAEHARA]
Our leader's not just a man.

22
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,250
He's a prince among men.

23
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,041
Ugh. I want him to die.

24
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,708
[ISOGAI]
You're really nursing that tea.

25
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,083
Sure you don't want
somethin' else?

26
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,583
Actually, yes.

27
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,000
Might as well get the most
out of keeping your job secret.

28
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,708
[ISOGAI] Ah, I get it.
Good old extortion, huh?

29
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,166
This one's on me. Enjoy.

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,708
[BOTH]
He's Prince Charming!

31
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,708
[MEG] Look how much
he can carry at once!

32
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,291
[BOTH]
He's Prince Charming!

33
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,833
Sweetheart, don't tell me your
poor mother's taken ill again.

34
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,166
[ISOGAI]
Well, you know.

35
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,708
It's just the two of us,

36
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,625
so sometimes I have to help out
in the financial department.

37
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,083
[NAGISA, KAEDE, MEG, OKAJIMA]
He's Prince Charming!

38
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,291
Yeah. The only negative thing

39
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,166
you could say about
him is he's dirt poor.

40
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,791
'Cept somehow makes
even that look cool.

41
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,750
Guy keeps his clothes
so neat and tidy,

42
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,875
you'd never know they're
fresh off the bargain rack.

43
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,291
[NAGISA, KAEDE, MEG, OKAJIMA]
He's Prince Charming!

44
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,208
[MAEHARA] Oh, and did I
mention he let me eat some of

45
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,291
the goldfish he caught
at the Summer Festival?

46
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,333
Let me tell you,
that boy can cook!

47
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,708
[NAGISA, KAEDE, MEG, OKAJIMA]
He's Prince Charming!

48
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,208
Oh, yeah. And I went to
the bathroom after him once.

49
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,791
He'd folded the toilet
paper into a triangle!

50
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,500
[BOTH]
He's Prince Charming!

51
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,791
I fold toilet paper into a
triangle. Every time I go!

52
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,416
[BOTH]
That's disgusting.

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,416
[MAEHARA]
Check him out.

54
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,125
Even middle-aged
women dote on him!

55
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,458
[KAEDE, MEG]
He's Prince Charming!

56
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,375
[NAGISA] Uh, middle-aged
women in my neighborhood

57
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,875
dote on me sometimes.

58
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,250
[KAEDE, MEG]
Who cares?

59
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,125
[MAEHARA] Did you know
Isogai gets love letters

60
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,541
from the girls on
the main campus?

61
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,916
[NAGISA, KAEDE, MEG, OKAJIMA]
He's Prince Charming!

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,416
[MEG]
Um. I get them, too, actually.

63
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,083
[NAGISA, KAEDE, MAEHARA,
OKAJIMA] Forbidden love!

64
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Alas, some things are only cool

65
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,583
when done by a cool person.

66
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,833
Like Isogai, or me, of course

67
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,291
[NAGISA, KAEDE, MEG, OKAJIMA,
MAEHARA] He's Prince Cha--

68
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,083
What are you doing here?

69
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Their honey
toast! It's absolutely divine!

70
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,500
Enough so that I
turn a blind eye

71
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,875
to Isogai's illicit
part-time job.

72
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'm rather surprised.

73
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,125
You're not the least bit irked
at his being such an ideal man?

74
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,166
[ALL]
Uh? No.

75
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Care to explain why not?

76
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,041
I don't get it.

77
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:45,041
He, uh, he's too good
a guy to be upset with?

78
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,458
Do we need a better reason?

79
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,000
[door opens]

80
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,083
[ISOGAI]
Hello! Welcome!

81
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,625
[ARAKI]
What's this? Uh, oh.

82
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,625
Looks like the rumors about
a student working here

83
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,083
are true after all.

84
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,375
Isogai, you're
such a bad student.

85
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,291
This is your second
violation of school policy.

86
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,791
I expected better. Oh, Isogai.

87
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,916
[NAGISA] It's Asano.
This couldn't get any worse.

88
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,333
[GAKUSHU] The last time you
were caught holding down a job,

89
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,625
they punted you to E-Class
without a second thought.

90
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,666
Such a shame. Have you done
no soul-searching since then?

91
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,375
Asano, I'm begging you.
Keep this on the down-low.

92
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,916
It's only for the month.
I need the money. Please.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,583
I don't know.

94
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,458
Well perhaps we can be
gentlemanly about all this.

95
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,083
[NAGISA]
You can tell when Asano's

96
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,958
up to something sinister.

97
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,708
He becomes the spitting
image of his father.

98
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:14,583
Very well, then. I'll keep
your dirty little secret.

99
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:19,250
On condition that you show
me your fighting spirit.

100
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,791
My what?

101
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,416
[GAKUSHU]
I think you heard me.

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,916
Our school has a proud
tradition of revering those

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,041
who can hold their
own in class and life.

104
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,875
Ample fighting spirit
earns enough respect

105
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,250
to forgive a flagrant
conduct violation.

106
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,500
And to show that spirit...

107
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,875
[SUGINO] Pole-toppling
at the Sports Festival?

108
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,291
Yep.

109
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,833
If we can beat A Class,
they'll let Isogai off the hook.

110
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,291
[ALL groaning]

111
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,416
Tch. You do know it's a trap.

112
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,083
They're obviously just
out to humiliate us.

113
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,416
What're we supposed to do?

114
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,250
We say no, Isogai'll
get penalized again.

115
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,791
Not a slap on the wrist either.
He could get expelled.

116
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,083
So what? I don't want
you guys getting involved.

117
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:03,500
Terasaka's right. Asano's got
something up his sleeve.

118
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,375
Besides, I'm the one
who made this choice.

119
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,083
I'll take responsibility
for it myself.

120
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,541
Let them expel me.

121
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,500
Nothing says I can't stage
an assassination off campus.

122
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,208
[ALL]
Wow what a...

123
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,750
[ALL]
...terrible idea!

124
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,041
[ISOGAI]
Huh?

125
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,958
[MIMURA] You impoverished,
cow-licked bastard!

126
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,708
What d'you mean cow-licked?

127
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,666
[MAEHARA] You're overthinkin'
it, man. Knock it off.

128
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,333
Look, only thing we gotta do is
beat the nerds at pole-toppling.

129
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,958
We got this in the bag!

130
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,458
'Course we do!

131
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,000
Hell, I'd say we're lucky the
jerks caught you workin'.

132
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,541
Golden opportunity.

133
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,916
We can payback some of the crap

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,291
they're always
dishing out on us.

135
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,833
[YOSHIDA] Topple 'em?
We'll friggin' destroy 'em!

136
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,250
[SUGINO]
C'mon, Prince Charming.

137
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,833
You guys, I...

138
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,041
All right! Let's do it!

139
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,708
[ALL]
Yeah!

140
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
How very typical of him.

141
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,291
Always putting the needs of his
classmates ahead of his own.

142
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,208
This is personal
magnetism in action.

143
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,708
Perhaps the single most
important attribute of a leader.

144
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:05,458
Heh. As a prince among men
myself, I ought to lend a hand.

145
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,083
[KARASUMA]
Pole-toppling, huh?

146
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,041
Reminds me of my
days at the academy.

147
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,041
It's not so much
assassination as war.

148
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,416
The relative size of your team
can be a major setback.

149
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,458
These kids may be well-trained,

150
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:22,000
but A-Class' team has them
outnumbered two to one.

151
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Woo-hoo! Great job, Kimura!

152
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,000
Show 'em how it's done!
That's the way!

153
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,416
Smile big for the
camera! Go, Justice!

154
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,875
Might as well be water.

155
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:48,708
No problem.

156
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,250
[ALL]
That's so cool!

157
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Indeed.

158
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,041
Assassination has improved
overall fitness, equilibrium,

159
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,375
hand-eye coordination,
and depth perception.

160
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,166
And this extraordinary
competition

161
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,750
will showcase them all!

162
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,041
[STUDENT A] Holy crap,
that pipsqueak can move!

163
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,041
[STUDENT B]
Her body's so... aerodynamic!

164
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,125
[KORO-SENSEI] You move to
the beat of your own drum,

165
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,583
an important advantage.

166
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,333
Remember that when it comes
to pole-toppling, my boy.

167
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,291
Victory is entirely up to you.

168
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,083
Something wrong?

169
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,708
Koro-sensei, the fact
of the matter is,

170
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,041
Asano is very talented.

171
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,250
I-I'm no match for him.

172
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Huh...

173
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,166
Look at it this way.

174
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,416
However talented someone is,
however gifted or well-trained,

175
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,541
the world is a mighty big place.

176
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,166
There's always someone better.

177
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,375
What do I do? I can't win.

178
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,875
The guys are gonna get
crushed because of me.

179
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Talent or not,

180
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:45,208
one person alone can
only accomplish so much.

181
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,250
[OKAJIMA]
Yeah!

182
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
You've got Asano beat

183
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,541
in one very important
respect already.

184
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,541
The ability to inspire
confidence in your comrades.

185
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,208
Should you find yourself between
a rock and a hard place,

186
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,625
there'll be quite a few
people rallying to help you.

187
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,208
You have the gift of
personal magnetism.

188
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,666
And between you and me, I'd much
rather have a fellow like you

189
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,750
as a student than Asano.

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,333
All right!

191
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,208
Guys, like always, we're
goin' into this guns blazing!

192
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,916
[ALL]
Yeah!

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,958
Next up, we have an
exhibition match!

194
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,708
E-Class must be
feelin' lucky, folks

195
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,791
'cause they've challenged
A-Class to a battle!

196
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,625
Something tells me
Kunugigaoka's elite

197
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,208
will make 'em live to regret it!

198
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,375
[NAGISA]
Who are they?

199
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,125
[OKAJIMA]
No way can that be regulation!

200
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,250
[ARAKI] In the spirit
of cultural diversity,

201
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,708
this exhibition
match will feature

202
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,500
our foreign exchange students.

203
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,291
All of them.

204
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,458
Asano's scared.

205
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,208
He brought in outsiders
to cover his butt.

206
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,458
Must be a lot riding
on this for him.

207
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,541
[TAKADA]
This is gonna be hilarious.

208
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,708
What'cha gonna do,
E-Class? You got nothin'.

209
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,500
[GAKUSHU] If they expect to
win with so few team members,

210
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,541
they'll have no choice
but to break formation

211
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,000
and go on the attack.

212
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,333
At which point,

213
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:01,250
our ironclad defensive
line will eat them alive.

214
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,833
Hey, uh, do the End Class
dorks even wanna win?

215
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,916
None of them are
on the offensive!

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,166
[ARAKI] Okay, apparently
E-Class' strategy

217
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,875
is to go all-in on defense.

218
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,791
Are they cowed by
the gap in skill?

219
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,125
[ARAKI] Whatever they're
thinkin', let the games begin!

220
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,041
[ISOGAI]
Bring it on, Asano.

221
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,708
[GAKUSHU] If you think
we can be lured out,

222
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,625
you underestimate us.

223
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,666
Offensive line, go Plan F!

224
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,791
Roger that!

225
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,083
[GAKUSHU] Our objective isn't
to bring down the pole, per se.

226
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,916
No, we intend to crush
you once and for all.

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,916
Uh, guys.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,583
[yelling]

229
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,791
Dammit!

230
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,500
We're not just gonna
roll over and take this!

231
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,708
[ARAKI]
Two men down!

232
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,583
And not just down,
flung to the bleachers!

233
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,583
Sir, this is already a disaster!

234
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,375
It doesn't matter how
tight the defense is

235
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,958
if all they do
is get picked off!

236
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,541
[KEVIN] How 'bout instead
of tryin' to hold the line

237
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,916
like a bunch of turtles,
you step up and fight?

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,666
Hmph. Or don't you know
the meaning of the word?

239
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,500
[KARMA]
Hey, partner,

240
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,333
why don't you stop yammerin'
and follow your own advice?

241
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,083
Hmph. Bring it on, man!

242
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,416
[ALL yelling]

243
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,875
Okay! Now!

244
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,666
Operation: Tentacles!

245
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,791
[ISOGAI]
Pin 'em down!

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,458
[ARAKI]
Unbelievable!

247
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,291
The E-Class team is pinning
down A-Class' offensive line

248
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,708
with the weight of the pole!

249
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,625
They're playing dirty!

250
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,125
Tough luck, big guy,

251
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,291
there's no rule against us
using the pole as a weapon.

252
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,833
[KEVIN]
Get the hell off of me!

253
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,375
Shut up and stay down.

254
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,250
[GAKUSHU]
A splendid tactic.

255
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,958
But you've only got
seven teammates

256
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,166
to create a defense with,

257
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,666
and two of them are
down for the count.

258
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,250
You've just given us
more of an advantage.

259
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,875
Guerilla team, Plan K!

260
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,500
Both flanks, move in!

261
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,833
[ISOGAI]
There's a gap dead center.

262
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,625
If we're going to attack,
is has to be now

263
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,208
while they're separated.

264
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,458
All right, let's do it!

265
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,375
Look alive, men!
Operation: Runny Nose!

266
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,416
[ALL]
Yeah!

267
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,750
I've got you now.

268
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:14,125
[ARAKI]
Oh-ho! Classic bait and switch!

269
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,166
They pulled an
offensive fake-out!

270
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,375
[KARASUMA]
It's like a chess problem.

271
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,833
The kids have made their
defensive line airtight.

272
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,916
But the tide of battle is
turning against them quickly.

273
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,791
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

274
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,416
[KARASUMA]
We should do something.

275
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,833
The Ministry of Defense
isn't gonna like it very much

276
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,333
if the students get injured.

277
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,250
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

278
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Not to worry, my good man.

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,666
I gave Isogai some helpful
tips during Social Studies.

280
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,500
On the subject of defeating
an enemy twice your size,

281
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,458
history provides an excellent
example in Hannibal of Carthage.

282
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,791
Ah, yes, called "The
Scourge of Ancient Rome."

283
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,541
[KORO-SENSEI] He led his troops
off-road, time and again,

284
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,291
popping up where the opposing
forces were least prepared.

285
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:07,833
His defense strategies were
clever, his weapons innovative.

286
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,041
The lesson here is that

287
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,791
a good tactician
thinks unconventionally.

288
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,666
Successful schemes
are often guided

289
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,000
by a touch of the eccentric.

290
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,208
[TAKADA]
Ooh! Ha!

291
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,666
The E-Class dorks are about to
get the net closed in on 'em.

292
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,750
Yeah, it's beatin' time!

293
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,500
[TAKADA, TANAKA]
Whoa, what the--?

294
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,541
[TANAKA]
Look out!

295
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,375
[ARAKI] The E-Class team
has fled the playing field

296
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,750
and is running amok among
the spectators! Total chaos!

297
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,208
[KARMA] Hey, there're no
rules about boundaries.

298
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,125
Come on. What'cha waitin' for?

299
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,916
The whole school's
a battlefield.

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,958
What're you doing? Damn it!
Quit screwin' around, guys!

301
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,458
[GAKUSHU] The most dangerous
part of pole-toppling

302
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,541
is that even with only
a handful of teammates,

303
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,083
you can clamor to the top.

304
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,125
Their strongest are...

305
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,166
[GAKUSHU]
Akabane. Kimura. Isogai.

306
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,250
Those are the three to watch.

307
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,208
[GAKUSHU]
Yuma Isogai.

308
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,583
Should E-Class lose this
friendly little match,

309
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,333
I'll report your infraction
and you'll be out in the cold.

310
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:16,416
Order your team to attack
unless you care to be expelled.

311
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,208
Fall alone or drag your
friends down with you.

312
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,750
The choice is yours.

313
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,750
Not ideal, but those are the
stakes of leading the underdogs.

314
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,125
Isogai! It's about that time!

315
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,125
[ISOGAI]
Yep!

316
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,333
And so far, it's
all going to plan!

317
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,375
[gasps]

318
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,916
[ARAKI] What? Where'd
those two come from?

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,041
Weren't they out of commission?

320
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,291
[YOSHIDA]
We practiced takin' punches

321
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,333
till we were blue in the face.

322
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,625
[MURAMATSU]
But the hardest part of it all

323
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,166
was acting like we got
flung off the field!

324
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,500
[GAKUSHU]
You're kidding me!

325
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,375
These are the goons we
pummeled in the beginning?

326
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,875
Right, we're done running!

327
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,958
E-Class, go Sonic!

328
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,166
[E-CLASS]
Yeah!

329
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,333
[GAKUSHU]
Of course.

330
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,166
The scuffle was only to
distract our attention.

331
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,375
After those two clowns
were knocked to the seats,

332
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,791
they regrouped.

333
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,791
Why didn't I see it coming?

334
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,500
Now they're taking advantage of
the chaos to rush our main unit!

335
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,166
That's their game!

336
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's our game!

337
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,833
[ARAKI] Oh! They got
right up in their grill!

338
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,833
[MAEHARA]
How you like that, Asano?

339
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,375
[YOSHIDA] There may not
be that many of us.

340
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,000
but it only takes one to
reach the top of the pole.

341
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,125
Don't tell me this punk
knows martial arts.

342
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,625
[GAKUSHU] We happen to be
standing on the same stage,

343
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,833
you and I.

344
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:44,041
Tell me, are so big a fool you
don't expect to be kicked off?

345
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,875
[NAGISA] Strong Final Boss vibe.
Definitely his father's son.

346
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,833
Uh-oh. A-Class is closing in.

347
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:55,583
Anyone else feel like we're
about to watch a massacre?

348
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Make no mistake.

349
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,208
Asano is a singularly
fearsome leader.

350
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:05,125
Provided they follow his
command, A-Class can't lose.

351
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,583
Not the sort of adversary
you can trifle with, Isogai.

352
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:13,083
Fortunately... you don't have
to take in on all by yourself.

353
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:15,875
[GAKUSHU]
What?

354
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,291
[ARAKI]
Wait a minute!

355
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,000
The E-Class offensive has
called in reinforcements!

356
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,750
[SAKAKIBARA] What the hell?
That's their defensive unit.

357
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,500
[KOYAMA]
Which means...

358
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,333
[TAKADA] They only have two
guys left at the pole?!

359
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,458
[TANAKA] How are they
even holdlin' 'em down?

360
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,333
A little thing called leverage.

361
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,166
[TAKADA]
Heh?

362
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,458
Oh yeah. Physics and stuff.

363
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,958
Ha-ha! Nice one, man.

364
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,875
They're totally
buyin' that answer.

365
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,875
It's simply a play for time.

366
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,625
The two of us can't
really hold down

367
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,208
this many people by ourselves.

368
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,708
Lucky for us,

369
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,416
these poor souls don't dare
do anything without orders.

370
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,958
Could be your boss still
has an ace up his sleeve.

371
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,625
And of course,
in times like these

372
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,375
it's better to wait and see
than take the initiative, right?

373
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,875
Stupid four-eyes!

374
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,125
Asano! We need orders!

375
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,916
[GAKUSHU]
I can't give you any!

376
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,125
[ARAKI]
Looks like the A-Class team

377
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,166
is assuming a defensive
posture, too!

378
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,291
If they can hold, E-Class
will be out of options!

379
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,291
Itona! Now! Do it!

380
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,458
Yeah, okay.

381
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,666
[chuckling]

382
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,625
[KORO-SENSEI] A secret weapon is
best saved for the last minute.

383
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,583
[GAKUSHU]
I can't lose!

384
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,583
[thud]

385
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,375
[ARAKI]
Uh... The... A-Class is, uh...

386
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,625
Team E-Class...
for the win!

387
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,750
[KORO-SENSEI] Outstanding!
My students are so cool!

388
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,458
Aren't they cool?
Look this way, please!

389
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,166
That's right! They're mine!

390
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,416
[ASANO]
Well, well, well.

391
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,583
It would appear that
by some miracle,

392
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,375
the underdogs have gotten
the better of you again.

393
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,875
You were owned.

394
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,416
I believe that's how the kids
are putting it these days.

395
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,208
Worse still, Isogai turned your
strategy to his advantage.

396
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,000
You hadn't the foresight to
account for a secret weapon.

397
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,666
This was a war of information,
gentlemen, and you lost.

398
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,250
Because of incompetent
leadership.

399
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,625
Uh, Mr. Principal.

400
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,958
Please, sir, your son
did the best he could.

401
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:17,875
[GAKUSHU]
Shut up, Kevin!

402
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,416
Ya can't win 'em all.

403
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,458
You're his father, tell him
defeat can be a valuable lesson.

404
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,208
Yes, of course.

405
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,958
You're absolutely right,
Kevin. Well said.

406
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,458
Perhaps you could teach
me the value of defeat.

407
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,666
Your words would carry
a great deal more weight,

408
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,250
if I knew what it was
to lose, yes? Well, then.

409
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:41,666
Come. Fight. All four
of you, please. At once.

410
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,416
[ALL grunting]

411
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,416
[GIRL A]
There he is! Isogai!

412
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,166
[GIRL B]
You were incredible!

413
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,500
Oh, thank you!

414
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,291
But it's pretty dangerous stuff.

415
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,791
[SUGAYA, KIMURA]
Yeah, yeah, prince among men.

416
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:59,041
Everything's different now.
It's like the mood's changed.

417
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,916
They don't treat us like
the untouchables anymore.

418
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,291
What d'you expect, man?

419
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,208
Our nothin' little team
rocked the boat today.

420
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,958
People are gonna talk.

421
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,291
[OKAJIMA]
Think about it, guys.

422
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,500
Officially, we're now even
cooler than Team Asano.

423
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,291
[FOREIGNERS groaning]

424
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:22,750
[KEVIN] I'm sorry, sir. Please.
Please accept my apology.

425
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,166
[ASANO]
Did you know...

426
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,333
...I once took down a black belt

427
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,291
on my third day
of karate lessons.

428
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,333
The first day, I was soundly
beaten, you understand,

429
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,541
by some 30-something.

430
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,750
There was so much
pain, I vomited.

431
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,166
I'd never known a more
agonizing defeat.

432
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,250
What do you suppose
I did on day two?

433
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,625
I observed.

434
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:48,250
Inwardly consumed by
flames of my humiliation,

435
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,333
certain were I to lose again,

436
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,333
I would be mortified
to point of insanity.

437
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:58,291
That I would, in effect,
die of madness.

438
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,541
On day three,
I crushed my sensei

439
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,916
without him landing
a single blow.

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,750
That is the lesson of defeat.

441
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,541
[ASANO]
Incidentally, Asano.

442
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,375
Aren't you mortified?
Losing hurts.

443
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,250
One would think the pain
is eating you alive.

444
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,291
[GAKUSHU]
You're a monster.

445
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,833
[NAKAMURA]
Hey. Check it out.

446
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,458
[SUMIRE]
Oh. It's Asano.

447
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,500
[MAEHARA]
We had a deal.

448
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,291
You gonna hold your
end of the bargain?

449
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,458
You're not gonna rat Isogai
out for having a job?

450
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,875
You may take me at my word.

451
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,041
Unlike some people I know,

452
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,291
I'm not one for
underhanded tactics.

453
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,125
But next time I won't
just take you down.

454
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,208
I will chase you into oblivion.

455
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,500
Hah. Someone's a poor loser.

456
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,125
Yeah, what a jerk. Let him
talk all the smack he wants.

457
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,708
We're totally above it.

458
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,041
[MAEHARA]
Don't pay any attention to him.

459
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,333
He doesn't even know you, man.

460
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,583
Doesn't understand what
you have to deal with.

461
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,208
Except, that's not being fair.

462
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,333
I don't know him either.
His life could be really tough.

463
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,041
Plus, I've got super
awesome classmates.

464
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,666
If being broke led me
to you, then I'm glad.

465
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,583
[NAGISA] Isogai may not
look as cool as Asano.

466
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,875
He's not on top or out front,
but before you even realize it,

467
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,250
he's right there next to you.

468
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,625
[ISOGAI] Whoa! Leftovers from
the bread-eating contest!

469
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,041
[NAGISA] That's the president
of E-Class for you.

470
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,083
A prince among men
and assassins.
