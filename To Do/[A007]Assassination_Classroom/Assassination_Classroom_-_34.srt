[NAGISA]
The math exam's last problem.

00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:17,125
Half of our grade was weeded
out before getting this far.

3
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,541
The other half had absolutely
no time to spare.

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,708

have the energy to solve it.

[NAGISA sighs]
You're so talented, Karma.

10
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,583
How is there such a gap
between the both of us?

11
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:33,000
Guess some people are
just geniuses, huh?

12
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,333
[KARMA]
Easy for you to say.

13
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,833
If you ask me,

14
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:40,500
it's not all that cut n' dry
who the real genius is here.

15
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,125
Talent is usually
an invisible trait.

16
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,375
More often than not,

17
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,916
it's the result of work
other people don't see.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,416
Take Sugino.

19
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,708
He can fit in easily
with anyone, anywhere.

totally lose herself

in something she's
passionate about.

Even Terasaka, who dives right
in without a second thought.

23
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,000
From where I'm standing,
we're in the same boat.

Still...

29
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,583
The issue at hand is whether
or not I can filter the answer

30
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,541
to this problem through
the lens of my own.

Broken down to essentials,
the problem is simple.

00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,291
Solve for the volume of
your specific domain,

40
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,000

Eight enemies total, surrounding
the cube's perimeter.

00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,958
If I determine the volume
of the eight areas

53
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,625
I've effectively sealed off,

54
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:28,291

the volume of the cube,

The whole thing's divided out

into this one itty-bitty
little cube...

00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,250

Yeah,

82
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,125
everything on the outside
is just more of the same.

83
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,833
Which means...

The world doesn't end here.

We are all in the same boat.

89
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,291
I just couldn't see it before.

90
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,458
All I could see
from inside this box

91
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,166
were fragments of
the bigger picture.

92
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,875
I have my area,
they have theirs.

93
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:24,916
We all do.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,500
That's how this works.

95
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,541
How it's always worked.

96
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,791
Everyone's the same size,

97
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,875
the same distance apart.

98
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,875
And if we're all cut
from the same box,

99
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,250
those eight contiguous
boxes can be broken up

100
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,500
into the same proportion.

101
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,416
[KARMA] Each person's
individual fragment

102
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,958
accounts for one-eighth
of the whole.

103
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:49,250
So what it boils down to is:
this box contains one whole me

104
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,375
and one-eighth of
eight other people.

105
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,333
[KARMA]
In other words,

106
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,875
inside this cube,

107
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,750
the ratio of me to the other
eight fragments is one-to-one.

108
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,625
Simple!

109
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,083
And if it's one-to-one
inside the box,

110
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,208
the volume of the area
I can call my own

111
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,291
is up to one-half of the cube!

112
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:12,125
Voila! That's my
specific domain!

113

346
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,958
That's correct.

347
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,416
Your teacher will
almost certainly

348
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,416
be hit with an explosion.

349
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,666
Furthermore,

he can't move until the
problem has been solved.

351
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,666
The first four books

352
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,166
are yours and yours alone
to open and solve.

353
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,416
I will be taking the
remainder for myself.

354
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,958
[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]

355
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,708
Kill me, or force
me to withdraw,

356
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,416
and victory belongs
unquestionably to you.

357
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,666
You and the E-Class students
will be allowed to stay here.

358
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,125
Agreed? Terasaka, look sharp.

359
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,791
Use the appropriate formula

360
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,041
to find Koro-sensei's
odds of winning.

361
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,500
[TERASAKA grunts]

362
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,083
Why do I have to solve
something so messed up?

363
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,000
An anti-Sensei grenade
won't kill you...

364
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,958
The real one will, naturally,

365
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:51,166
but we'd have to save it
for the end, so let's see.

366
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,958
Four-fifths

367
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,125
times three-fourths

368
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,125
times two-thirds

369
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,708
times one-half equals one-fifth.

370
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,666
So... 20%.

371
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,291
Well done!

372
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,666
Yeah, but hold on:

373
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,500
the Octopus sits
through four explosions

374
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,000
before you even
take a turn!

375
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,541
This game is rigged!

376
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,625
You can just bow out if you
don't like the way it's going.

377
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,041
Dunno about you, but
I call that unfair!

Young man.

379
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,375
[TERASAKA]
Hm?

380
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:17,000
Life is unfair. It's chock
full with injustice.

381

Especially if you're
not fortunate enough

382
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,541
to be one of the strong.

383
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,916
Don't you see?

384
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,291
This is why I teach the
true meaning of strength.

385
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,000
So, then. Shall we proceed?

386
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,916
Show me how serious
you really are

387
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
about your chosen
profession, Koro-sensei.

388
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,791
[ASANO]
In fact, if I were you,

389
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,083
I wouldn't waste
a single moment.

that's clearly in his favor.
And there's no way out.

396
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,166
Mathematically, the
odds of it succeeding

397
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,958
are better than
anything we've tried.

398
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:00,291
The most important
blade is strength...

the problem, and close.

on assassination,
