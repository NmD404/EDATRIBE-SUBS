1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:11,208
[NAGISA] Koro-sensei:
A mysterious super being

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,750
who's blown up half the moon

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,791
and vows to destroy Earth
by March of next year.

4
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:20,458
The powers that be have a bounty
on his head: Ten-billion yen.

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,583
We're Class 3-E of
Kunugigaoka Junior High,

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,583
also known as the End Class.

7
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:26,958
And believe it or not,

8
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,833
we're the misfits who're
supposed to assassinate him.

9
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,083
Even though we'd pinpointed
some of his weaknesses

10
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,791
before summer vacation,

11
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,750
we still haven't managed
to hit our target.

12
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,666
This is Class 3-E:
The Assassination Classroom.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,875
The bell rings,
another day begins.

14
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,333
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

15
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,958
[NAGISA] Our "assassination
vacation" was almost over.

16
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,083
Almost, but not quite.

17
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,291
We'd decided to make the most of

18
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,208
what little time we
had left on Okinawa.

19
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,375
A test of courage?
On our last day here?

20
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Of course!

21
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,083
What better activity for
a fine midsummer's night?

22
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,875
Yeah, nice try. You just wanna
have fun at our expense.

23
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,875
[KORO-SENSEI] Unlike some
who shall remain nameless,

24
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,416
I've been too cooped up in a
shell to have any fun at all!

25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,041
We're on a tropical island,
for cryin' out loud!

26
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,208
I think a test of courage
sounds like a blast!

27
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,208
No kidding!

28
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,208
Aww. But I don't
like being scared.

29
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,583
Don't worry! Koro-Sensei'll
be playing the ghosts, right?

30
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,500
Oh yeah.

31
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,041
[SUGINO]
So it won't be scary.

32
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,500
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

33
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,500
[NAGISA] There's no way we
could've known at the time,

34
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,625
but Koro-sensei's real purpose
wasn't just to scare us.

35
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,958
[KORO-SENSEI] This ocean
cavern is the ideal spot.

36
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,875
I want everyone to walk
through in boy-girl pairs.

37
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,041
So, uh, you're not bothered
by this kind of thing?

38
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,958
Nah. I don't mind spooky
stuff so much, actually.

39
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,208
Jump scares, though,
I'm not a real big fan of.

40
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,416
Don't be surprised
if I freak out a bit.

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,000
With Koro-sensei
as quick as he is,

42
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,833
he's bound to catch
me once or twice.

43
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,458
Hm? Is that an Okinawa
shamisen playing?

44
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,083
[BOTH]
Oh no!

45
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Beware.

46
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:54,250
You have entered a cave
drenched in blood and tragedy.

47
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:59,166
For here, routed in battle,
members of the Ryukyu royalty

48
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,625
met a most terrible
and violent end.

49
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,166
Is that actually true?

50
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,708
Possibly,

51
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,666
but odds are he's just making
it up to create atmosphere.

52
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,250
[KORO-SENSEI] You would be
wise to stay together.

53
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,833
Anyone left alone in this cave

54
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,333
will be haunted
by restless spirits!

55
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,375
[BOTH gasp]

56
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,166
You gotta admit it's starting
to sound kind of authentic.

57
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,500
I vote we go through
as quickly as we can.

58
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Beware.

59
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,208
You have entered a cave
drenched in blood...

60
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,166
Hearing him give his
spiel to the next couple

61
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,458
adds to the realism.

62
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,416
Now that's what I call spooky.

63
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,666
[NAKAMURA, ISOGAI scream]

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,041
[chuckles]

65
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,333
[KORO-SENSEI] No question my
students have gotten stronger.

66
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,083
But as far as they've come,

67
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,041
there's still a little
something missing.

68
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,916
Specifically....

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,583
...a love scandal!

70
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,208
A few were on the
verge of pairing off

71
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,583
before the summer break,

72
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,500
but they've been so
hyper-focused on assassination

73
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,875
no one's had time
to spark a romance!

74
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,791
Thankfully, there's nothing
quite like abject terror

75
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,416
for bringing two
people together.

76
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,166
I'll get material yet.

77
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,416
For my trashy,
based-on-a-true-story,

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,916
mass-market novel about
love-struck teenagers!

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,125
Let no one say I don't
have a big heart!

80
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,500
[chuckling]

81
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,666
[OKUDA] Afraid of not being
afraid? I don't get it.

82
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,166
Look.

83
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,208
When Nagisa faced off with
Takoka, it knocked me on my ass.

84
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,875
And not 'cause he beat him.

85
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,791
[KARMA] The way he was
during the whole thing,

86
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,000
it was like, I dunno...

87
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,458
He wasn't the
least bit affected.

88
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,666
I mean, in a fight,
I'd win. We all know that.

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,166
But to an assassin, winning
a fight doesn't mean squat.

90
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,291
That's when it dawned on me.

91
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:43,500
What scared me most of
all was not being afraid.

92
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,458
Still, though.

93
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,375
I won't lose.

94
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,333
I'll definitely be the one
who ends our teacher's life.

95
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,958
Take my word for it.

96
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,375
Okay! I can't wait to see who
finally winds up killing him.

97
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,458
Hang on a second.

98
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,833
[OKUDA]
Huh?

99
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,000
[KARMA] Wasn't this supposed
to be a test of courage?

100
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,500
'Cause it's lookin'
to me like the Octopus

101
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,125
has something a little
different in mind.

102
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Urgh.

103
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,291
Why are none of these kids
falling for each other?

104
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,291
Next couple for sure!

105
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Beware.

106
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,666
You have entered a cave
drenched in blood and tragedy.

107
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,958
For here-- Ah! Monster!

108
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,666
[KORO-SENSEI screaming]

109
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,333
I've been scaring
the crap out of people

110
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,791
since I was little girl.

111
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,541
They don't call me Miss
Courage Tester for nothin'.

112
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,041
Scariest girl in Japan.

113
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,458
Okay.

114
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,875
Well as long as you're enjoying
yourself I guess, right?

115
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,708
[panting]

116
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,708
[KORO-SENSEI] That was only an
average g-g-ghost, wasn't it?

117
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,458
Not the restless spirit
of Ryukyu royalty? Ah!

118
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,625
Oh! He has no eyes!

119
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,416
Ah! I felt something slithery!

120
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Oh! Creepy Japanese Doll!

121
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,041
Ah! Horror manga-ka
Shigeru Mizuki!

122
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,750
Oh! I'm not even sure what
this is, but I feel like...

123
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:55,666
[KAEDE] Kinda weird he's more
freaked out than any of us.

124
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,166
[NAGISA]
Yeah. We, uh, we should go.

125
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,166
[KORO-SENSEI panting]

126
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,500
[KORO-SENSEI] Good gracious.
What an unmitigated disgrace.

127
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,000
So let me get this straight.

128
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,333
This whole thing was about
scaring us into hookin' up

129
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,208
so you could have
material for a book?

130
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,500
[TOKA] We so knew that's
what you were doing.

131
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
What's wrong with wanting to see

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,333
tender feelings blossom between
two bright, young things

133
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,791
before their best
years are behind them

134
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,125
and they wind up stuck
in loveless mar...

135
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,708
[HINANO]
Well, this is awkward.

136
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,291
[SUGAYA]
Are we sure he's an adult?

137
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,125
Not that we don't appreciate
the thought and all,

138
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,208
but, come on, we're just kids.

139
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,083
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe some of us

140
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,250
don't feel like being
in a relationship?

141
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,041
And no offense, but isn't
shipping us sorta creepy.

142
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
I know. I'm sorry.

143
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,291
[IRINA] Pathetic. You call
that a test of courage?

144
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,166
There was no one in
there! What a waste.

145
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,916
You can let go of
my arm any day now.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,958
This is not what I need
after an all-nighter.

147
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,208
Ugh! Shut up!
You're a man, aren't ya?

148
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,375
It's your damn responsibility
to escort pretty women!

149
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,416
[KARASUMA sighs]

150
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,000
[IRINA laughing nervously]

151
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,500
[MAEHARA] Hey. So is anyone
thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

152
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,791
[HINANO]
That Professor Bitch is...?

153
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:04,791
[TOKA]
Uh-huh.

154
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,250
[MAEHARA]
Should we do something?

155
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,958
[NAKAMURA] We don't head
home till tomorrow morning,

156
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,750
so there's time.

157
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,458
[KORO SENSEI]
Then let's hook them up.

158
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,666
[NAGISA] Our final operation on
the island was about to start.

159
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,000
Turns out we're just as into
shipping as Koro-sensei.

160
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,916
[IRINA] Ugh! You're killin' me!
The man's so obtuse!

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,250
Isn't that a bit out
of character for you?

162
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,166
You're supposed to be
known for wrapping guys

163
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,458
around your little finger.

164
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,208
But when it comes
to her own love life,

165
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,500
she doesn't have a clue.

166
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,750
Oh, knock it off. Love?
Don't make me laugh!

167
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,333
[MAEHARA]
What? You're not in love?

168
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,041
No! I'm attracted
to the challenge

169
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,916
of conquering a
world-class square!

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,666
I just wanted to see if I
could make him fall for me,

171
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,791
that's all.

172
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,500
And I got... carried away.

173
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,666
[ALL gasp]

174
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,708
[SUGINO]
That was kind of adorable.

175
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,125
[MAEHARA]
More like embarrassing.

176
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,375
Don't judge me!

177
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,125
[NAGISA] Professor Bitch
is a lot more awkward

178
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,708
than she first comes off.

179
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,916
Maybe all the stuff
she's had to do

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,291
makes it hard for her
to own her feelings.

181
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,875
[MAEHARA] Hey. It's cool,
really. We've got this!

182
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,250
[IRINA]
Huh?

183
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,375
Let us set the stage and
you can take it from there.

184
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,750
Yeah!

185
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,583
Well, if you think you can.

186
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Excellent!

187
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,500
In that case,

188
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,000
I call the Class 3-E Love
Consultant Meeting to order.

189
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,625
[IRINA]
Eager much, Octopus?

190
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Come now, it's only natural

191
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,208
to encourage romance
between colleagues.

192
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,791
A female educator aching for the
touch of her stoic counterpart.

193
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,916
If that's not a trashy
best-seller in the making,

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,458
I don't know what is!

195
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,958
Uh, I think you're planning
something racier than we are.

196
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,458
[MAEHARA]
If we're gonna do this right,

197
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,916
we need to start by overhauling
your fashion sense.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,458
[IRINA]
Hm?

199
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,166
[NAKAMURA] I'll say. Revealing
might be appealing for some,

200
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,833
but parading the
goods doesn't cut it

201
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,041
for stuffed shirt
like Mr. Karasuma.

202
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,875
Your wardrobe should be
more... understated.

203
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,750
Understated? Huh, okay then.

204
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,458
Use the way Kanzaki dresses as
a model and you can't go wrong.

205
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,500
As a matter of fact. Is what
you wore yesterday dry?

206
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,791
Yeah. Of course.

207
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:06,750
[NAKAMURA] See? It makes
you look like a, uh--

208
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,458
[ALL] How in the world did
that make her even sexier?

209
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,458
[SUGAYA]
Well, to begin with,

210
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,541
the fit's a little
snug in places.

211
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,958
Man, I don't even
wanna tell you

212
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,208
what I think about when
Kankazi's in that thing.

213
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,333
Fine.Whatever. Huge
boobs we can work with.

214
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,708
Not like we have a choice,

215
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,416
and bust size doesn't really
matter that much anyway.

216
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,541
[KORO-SENSEI] Have we
established Mr. Karasuma's type?

217
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,541
Yeah! That girl in the ad.

218
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,958
I think he's, I don't know,
utterly infatuated with her?

219
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,833
Said she's his ideal
type, or something.

220
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,125
[KARASUMA] Whoo boy.
Now that's the whole package.

221
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,500
And the best part?
There are three of 'em!

222
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,666
[ALL] He meant his
ideal military type!

223
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,875
Well, the quickest way to a
man's heart is his stomach.

224
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,041
They serve some pretty
good stuff here.

225
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,625
We could arrange it
so the two of you

226
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,166
eat his favorite dish
together on the beach.

227
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,958
[MAEHARA] Trouble is,
I've only ever seen the guy

228
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,833
eat burgers and cup ramen, so...

229
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,291
[NAKAMURA] Doesn't exactly set
the mood for a romantic evening.

230
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,625
[KORO-SENSEI groaning]

231
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,291
[KORO-SENSEI] This match
was doomed from the start!

232
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,791
[MAEHARA]
Yeah,

233
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,375
I'm starting the think maybe
the problem is Mr. Karasuma.

234
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,583
See? He's such an idiot!

235
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
I should've seen it before.

236
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,583
A man who never laughs at
my jokes is a lost cause!

237
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,833
[NAGISA]
With no other options,

238
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,583
we settled for insulting
Mr. Karasuma.

239
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
There's no help for it.

240
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,541
Even so, let's do what
we can before dinner.

241
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,791
The ladies are in charge
of hair and makeup.

242
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,250
The gentlemen are
tasked with setting

243
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,541
just the right ambiance
for the table.

244
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,750
[STUDENTS]
Roger!

245
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,625
We're supposed to be
eating as a group, right?

246
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,083
So, where do I sit?

247
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,625
Well not here obviously.

248
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,250
It looks like there
isn't enough room.

249
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,125
Is our favorite teacher trying
to force his way into a seat?

250
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,291
Honestly, you'd just
get in the way here.

251
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,916
How about you be a
good sport about it

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,750
and eat your dinner
outside, okay?

253
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,791
[KARASUMA]
Huh?

254
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,541
Where did that come
from all of a sudden?

255
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,750
I mean I realize I'm out of
touch with young people,

256
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,500
but seriously.

257
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,541
Hm?

258
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,125
Why the hell'd just the
two of us get kicked out?

259
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,583
[IRINA]
Oh, uh. Who knows?

260
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,666
So, what's up with the shawl?

261
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,041
It was pulled off the bargain
wrack at a boutique shop.

262
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,208
I borrowed a sewing machine

263
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,708
and remade it to look
like a brand name.

264
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,291
Home Ec. always was
your best subject, huh?

265
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,916
[NAKAMURA]
All the pieces are in place.

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,750
Go get him, Professor Bitch!

267
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:39,416
[IRINA] This shawl. It wouldn't
stand a chance in high society.

268
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,041
And this amateurish
table setting.

269
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,666
Worlds apart from the posh
restaurants I frequent

270
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,416
in the line of duty.

271
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,375
Ha! And don't get me started
on the lack of privacy.

272
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,125
[IRINA]
Still.

273
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:59,083
It's fun! Who would've guessed?

274
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,750
I'm starting to love
those little brats.

275
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:06,083
I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna
seduce the square! Watch me!

276
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,625
The trip was rough.
So much happened.

277
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,166
But at least we got results.

278
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,875
I didn't count on how,

279
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,833
but I sure got to see
those kids reinforce

280
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,833
their fundamental training.

281
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,041
Optimistically, I think we'll
get him during second term.

282
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,750
Of course, you realize I'm
gonna rely heavily on you.

283
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,916
Something wrong?

284
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,916
[IRINA]
Hey. Karasuma.

285
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,166
Do you know what
it means to kill?

286
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,458
To actually end somone's life?

287
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,166
[IRINA] Got a little
dark there, didn't I?

288
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,166
Your napkin.

289
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,416
It's all bunched
up in your collar.

290
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,958
I really like you, you know.
Well, goodnight.

291
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,375
[IRINA] Ugh! You awkward,
brainless idiot!

292
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,583
You were supposed to talk about
how you feel, not how you kill!

293
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,583
[NAKAMURA]
What kind of half-assed,

294
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,166
G-rated kiss was that?

295
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,458
[IRINA]
Huh?

296
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,416
Come on! I thought grown-ups
use their tongues!

297
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,875
Do not start even start
in on me with that crap!

298
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,958
Being a grown-up is a lot
harder than it looks!

299
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't lose heart, children.

300
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,708
I'm sure she has something
appropriately indecent

301
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,583
in mind for later on, right?

302
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,000
Wrong! Don't say that,
you pervert!

303
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,791
[KARASUMA]
Uh...

304
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,500
[KARASUMA] I'm gonna go
ahead and ignore that.

305
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,250
Duty comes first. Period.

306
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:13,625
It's second term. Training
is about to get very real.

307
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,208
We have to kill him.

308
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,583
[NAGISA]
And so,

309
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,500
our "assassination vacation"
came to a close.

310
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,708
[KARASUMA]
Wait.

311
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,666
Was she practicing a new
seduction technique?

312
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,625
That was impressive.

313
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,208
[NAGISA]
Before school started back up,

314
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,291
we were all spending
the last days of summer

315
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,750
doing our own thing.

316
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,750
[NAGISA'S FATHER]
How's your mom?

317
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,500
You two getting along okay?

318
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,916
You can't be having that much
fun as strict as she is.

319
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,750
Sorry I'm not around
much anymore.

320
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,500
I wish I could be a better dad.

321
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,833
[NAGISA]
Don't worry about it.

322
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,333
She's not so bad if
you don't tick her off.

323
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,958
[NAGISA'S FATHER]
Is that right?

324
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,541
Y'know the other day, I--

325
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,208
You what? I'm listening.

326
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,958
[NAGISA]
A summer festival?

327
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
The last day of summer vacation!

328
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,458
Let's hang out and have some
mindless fun! What do you say?

329
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
I thank you.

330
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,583
[NAGISA]
Uh, thanks for the sushi.

331
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,625
[NAGISA'S FATHER]
Whoa. You're already finished?

332
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,375
[NAGISA]
Sorry. I gotta get going.

333
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,666
See ya! Let's do this again
sometime. Take care!

334
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,791
[NAGISA'S FATHER] He's cheered
up since last I saw him.

335
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,083
[KARMA]
Huh.

336
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,708
A summer festival?

337
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,166
[KORO SENSEI]
I just thought of it today!

338
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,458
I asked the whole class,

339
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,666
but almost everyone seems
to have other plans.

340
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,333
I'm starting to feel rejected.

341
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,083
[KARMA]
All right. I'll go.

342
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,333
Eh. It's not like I was doing
anything else, anyway.

343
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,458
[LOVRO]
Festival, you say?

344
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,958
I'm honored my target
would think of inviting me.

345
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,875
But I'm afraid I'm out of
country on business.

346
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:15,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Argh!

347
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,583
I'll pick you up!
It's no trouble!

348
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,416
Please! Mr. Karasuma's in a
meeting! You're my last hope!

349
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,083
If you don't come,
no one will be there!

350
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,500
[LOVRO] Don't be
ridiculous. I'm working.

351
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes, yes.

352
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,625
Well, feel free to pop by
and kill me anytime.

353
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,625
I will, thanks.

354
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,000
[LOVRO]
According to Karasuma,

355
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,166
our young friend pulled off
the secret move I taught him

356
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,250
as though to the manner born.

357
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,083
Indeed. Every country
has its Natural.

358
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,166
It's rather a shame I couldn't
bring him with me.

359
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,541
[grunts]

360
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,666
[YOUNG MAN]
From the day you were born,

361
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,208
from your first breath,
I've been beside you.

362
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,041
[YOUNG MAN] Be not afraid.
Fear not the name of the Reaper.

363
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,166
[HINANO]
And I got a super great deal!

364
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,250
[TOKA]
Yeah you did!

365
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,958
[chuckling]

366
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,708
[KANZAKI]
It's so fizzy!

367
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,083
[KORO-SENSEI] Excellent! Quite
a few more of you showed up

368
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,041
than I'd been led to expect.

369
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,791
In the event that no
one bothered to come,

370
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,500
I was contemplating seppuku.

371
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,291
Oh. Guess we really shouldn't
have showed up, huh?

372
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,541
[RYUNOSUKE, HAYAMI sigh]

373
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,541
[NAGISA] Chiba? Hayami?
Why are you guys so depressed?

374
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,791
We both got banned from
the shooting gallery.

375
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,333
It was so easy we
sorta got carried away.

376
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,333
--We needed the practice.
--[KARMA] Hey, mister.

377
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,833
So far I've only scored
as high as fifth place

378
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,500
on any of your games.

379
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,125
Seeing as that drives
down the probability

380
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,875
of winning fourth
place or above to,

381
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,041
hold on, let me give
you a concrete figure.

382
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,708
Hey, how 'bout that? 0.05.

383
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,208
I was wondering if the prizes
are worth what I've spent.

384
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,625
I mean, if you
don't trust my math,

385
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,125
we could always ask a cop.

386
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,750
All right, I get it.

387
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,791
You can have your money
back. Just keep quiet.

388
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,458
[KARMA]
Oh, I don't think so.

389
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,000
I didn't blow my cash
to get a refund.

390
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,958
I want that game console.

391
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,291
[NAGISA]
Karma sure is persistent.

392
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,583
[OKAJIMA]
He knew that guy was a cheap

393
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,708
before he even started playing.

394
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,125
[MAEHARA]
Ooh.

395
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,083
Seriously, man, is there
anything you can't do,

396
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,666
or are you just that
freakin' awesome?

397
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,208
It's all in the wrist.

398
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,750
You've gotta flick like you
would if you were holding knife.

399
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,625
That oughta do it.

400
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,166
Okay, good haul.

401
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,875
See, this is how you make a
feast when you're dirt poor.

402
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:44,916
I hear ya'.

403
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,666
Should I pan fry
them or go sashimi?

404
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,125
[MAEHARA]
Wait. That's his dinner?

405
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,541
[KAEDE]
Wow. Everybody's raking it in.

406
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,750
Yeah.

407
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,333
Turns out assassination
skills come in handy

408
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,958
in the everyday world.

409
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,041
[KAEDE] Like getting all the men
in the Chamber of Commerce tent

410
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,083
to buy you drinks?
I can see that.

411
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,500
[NAGISA]
Where's Koro-sensei?

412
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,875
Being entrepreneurial.

413
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,375
End of the month.
He's strapped for cash.

414
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,458
[NAGISA]
Huh?

415
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,583
The food stalls? Really?

416
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,041
[KAEDE] Only one at first,
but he branched out.

417
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,333
Started setting up in the
stalls that closed early

418
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,208
after they sold out
of all their stuff.

419
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,583
[NAGISA]
Uh-huh.

420
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,416
So basically he's taking
advantage of all the stalls

421
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,750
we put out of business.

422
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,791
Of course.

423
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,583
[HINANO]
Awesome!

424
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:32,791
[MAEHARA]
Cool!

425
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,916
[ISOGAI]
Gorgeous.

426
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,458
What a vacation, huh?
Sure was packed.

427
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,750
[NAGISA]
Mh-hm.

428
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,125
[NAGISA]
But something tells me

429
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,583
our second term's gonna
be even more packed.

430
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,166
So, the reward stands.

431
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,708
If he's not killed by
more than one person.

432
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,083
Given what we know transpired
over the summer break,

433
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,250
however, it's wise to
anticipate a group effort.

434
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,500
The children did have
him fairly cornered.

435
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,125
They seem to work
well as a unit.

436
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:11,791
If they succeed as a unit,
the reward will be tripled.

437
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,333
[NAGISA]
However it all plays out,

438
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,208
when this class is over,

439
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,500
none of us will be who
we were when it started.

440
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,666
[KAEDE chuckles]

441
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,750
[NAGISA]
And like most things in life,

442
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,125
this term will have
its ups and downs.
