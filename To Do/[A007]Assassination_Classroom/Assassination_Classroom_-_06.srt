Doesn't all this spread
you a little bit thin, sir?

No worries there.

I wonder.

37
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,250
Is he just prepping to
destroy the Earth, or what?

38
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,500
[NAGISA] Any way you slice it:
if you're an assassin,

39
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,000
he's a tricky target.

40

starting to wrap your head

Yes, sir.

And if you're
facing midterms,

Mr. Karasuma and the

Yes, vivid indeed, though I
don't pretend to understand

72
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,375
the situation in
every particular.

73
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,583
Nor do I feel especially
qualified to comment.

74
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,916
However I will say this,
if I may be so bold.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,208
You seem to be torn between
embracing the role

00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,958

[NAGISA]
Savior? Villain?

78
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,500
But no matter.

79
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,333
Such things aren't for men
like myself to resolve.

80
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,541
I'm hardly in a position
to save the world.

That job I must leave
to hands more capable.

So barring harm to my school,
your assassins may deal with you

83

as they will.

incentive to turn a blind eye.

Thank you for
your cooperation.

00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,375
That's a very reasonable
attitude, principal.

attractive in a man.

Though I'm happy to
give you carte blanche

91
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,541
to do what's necessary,

92
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,875
I must think of the future,
should the Earth survive.

93
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,375
In other words.

94
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,666
What becomes of my school if
Koro-sensei is assassinated?

95
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,833
[ASANO] Not to put
too fine a point on it,

96
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,291
but E Class must continue
to serve its function

97
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,083
in the grand scheme of things.

98
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,250
[KORO-SENSEI] Interesting.
So rock-bottom grades

99
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,583
and students with zero prospects
serve a "function," do they?

100
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,458
[ASANO]
Oh, yes.

101
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,541
Are you familiar with the
so-called Worker Ant Theory?

102
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,666
It tells us that in any group,
20 percent will work hard,

103
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,833
20 percent will be idle, and
the remaining 60 percent

104
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,250
will fall somewhere in between.

105
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,750
Now, imagine a group
without a middle ground,

106
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,791
where hard workers comprise
95 percent of the population,

107
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,541
and lay-abouts only five.

108
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,250
If the lazy worker ants
are stigmatized,

109
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,458
the ratio is perfectly feasible.

110
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,916
Those who under normal
circumstances fall into

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,500
the average category
better themselves

112
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,833
to avoid being associated
with the ostracized class.

113
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Very logical.

114
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,041
And, of course, unless the five
percent is kept down,

115
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,916
the incentive for
the other 95 disappears.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,958
[ASANO] Just today I
received an alarming complaint

117
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,625
from a D Class teacher.

118
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,083
It seems a student of
yours glared threateningly

119
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,958
at two upperclassmen,
such that the upperclassmen

120
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,416
feared for their lives.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,916
[ASANO] I have no doubt
the confidence to do so

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,291
stems from their attempts
to assassinate you.

123
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,791
And perhaps that's
to be expected.

124
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,208
The issue, though, is that
an E Class student

125
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,458
dared to defy his better.

126
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,958
[ASANO] Obviously I cannot
let such insolence stand.

127
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,083
As his teachers, you are
expected to remind

128
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,750
the student in question
of his place.

129
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,500
Oh, and Koro-sensei?

130
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,958
You have one second
to solve this puzzle!

131
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
What?

132
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,583
You just spring this
on me out of the blue?

133
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,625
[KORO-SENSEI grunting]

134
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,625
[NAGISA]
Whoa. What the hell is going on?

135
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,208
[ASANO] Your speed certainly
lives up to the hype.

136
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,125
I can see why most
attempts on your life

137
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,875
would be an
exercise in futility.

138
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,750
But bear in mind, my friend.
In the grand scheme of things,

139
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,416
there are many problems for
which speed is of no use at all.

140
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,791
[ASANO] Now, if you'll
kindly excuse me.

141
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,208
[NAGISA]
Ah!

142
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,666
[ASANO]
Oh.

143
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,166
Hi there! I look forward
to your midterm results.

144
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,750
Best of luck to you.

145
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,208
[NAGISA]
Uh...?

146
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,833
[NAGISA] Huh... "Best
of luck," the guy says.

147
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,416
And just like that...

148
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,958
...I revert from assassin
back to an E Class nobody.

149
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,625
[KARASUMA]
As a target,

150
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,458
Koro-sensei is
practically invincible.

151
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,916
Amateur and professional
assassins alike

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,625
have their work cut out
trying to off him.

153
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,458
But as a teacher, he's
vulnerable to the whims

154
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,666
of people higher up on
the food chain.

155
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,625
[KARASUMA] People like
Kunugigaoka Academy principal,

156
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,916
Gakuho Asano.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,291
A shrewd man who, in
the first decade of his tenure,

158
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:16,458
single-handedly hoisted
this school to top-tier status.

159
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,791
Essentially, if you teach here
there's no getting around

160
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,625
his personal vision of order.

161
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,291
That goes for us and for you.

162
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Good morning, everyone!

163
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,791
As you might guess, today,
I thought I'd make

164
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,791
even more of me!

165
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,041
[NAGISA]
This is getting ridiculous.

166
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Thinking caps on, let's begin!

167
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,791
[NAGISA] Even the afterimages
are getting sloppy.

168
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,458
[SUGINO] It's like he's turning
into a parody of himself.

169
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,125
Uh, Hey, Koro-sensei?

170
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,375
No offense, but isn't
this going to wear you out?

All right, children.

Love or hate the E Class system,
as a remedial process,

215
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,833
it can work.

216
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,916
[KORO-SENSEI] Imagine
placing within the top 50

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,625
of 186 students on midterms.

218
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,833
Make that a reality, and
securing a former teacher's

219
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,125
permission is all
an E Class student needs

220
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,125
to return to the class
from which they were ejected.

221
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,708
[KORO-SENSEI] But
given the conditions

222
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,708
we're forced to work under,
the personal setbacks

223
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,500
that landed each of you
here are difficult to fix.

224
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's why most E Class students

225
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,791
are convinced that returning
to the main campus

226
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,333
is no more than a pipe dream.

227
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,416

hurry up, I'm not a child.

[KORO-SENSEI]
Ms. Jelavich.

230
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,166
I'd like your opinion as a
professional assassin.

231
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,208
All right, what
do you wanna know?

232
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,541
[KORO-SENSEI] Now, let's say
you've been given an assignment.

233
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,000
Do you have only
one plan going into it?

234
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,666
[IRINA]
Hm? 'Course not.

235
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,541
If my profession has
taught me anything,

236
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,250
it's that Plan A almost never
comes off like you'd expect.

237
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,916
There are just
too many variables.

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,625
A good assassin has backup plans
on hand for any contingencies.

239
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,666
[KORO-SENSEI] And
Mr. Karasuma, what about you?

240
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,041
[KARASUMA]
Hm?

241
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,083
[KORO-SENSEI] When teaching
knife combat strategies,

242
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,500
do you believe the first
strike is the only move

243
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,416
of any importance?

244
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,375
The first move is important,
but so's the follow-up.

245
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,458
Never assume the
first strike will hit.

246
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,875
Because when your opponent's
trained, you have to be ready

247
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,625
to deliver the next strike with
at least as much precision

248
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,375
and skill as the first,
or, better yet,

is a successful one.

they've ranked before,

339
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,916
they're my students now.

340
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
When backed into a corner,

341
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,125
the first order of business
is assessing your options.

342
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,708
If I've taught
them nothing else,

343
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,916
I've certainly taught them that.

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,375
[NAGISA gasps]

345
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Come now, we've covered this.

346
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,833
The poor beast isn't
as terrifying as all that.

347
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,333
Start by observing that fin.

348
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,208
On closer inspection,
it's just that, a fin.

349
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,416
Next, look over each part of the
question

350
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,250
with the same
attention to detail,

351
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,375
and piece together
what you find.

352
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,541
Voila! A trivial
adversary indeed!

353
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,958
[gasps]

354
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,958
[KORO-SENSEI] Now use that
trusty blade to fillet it.

355
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,708
[NAGISA]
Of course!

356
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,166
[ONO]
Huh...?

357
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,791
[NAGISA] Take the problem
one part at time.

358
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,541
That's the trick.

359
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,666
Just like Koro-sensei's
been teaching us all along!

360
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,125
[ONO growls]

361
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,500
[NAGISA]
This question...

362
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,125
[NAGISA]
...is dead meat.

363
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,291
[NAGISA]
So's this one.

364
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,541
And this one.

365
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,666
And this-- 

366
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,916
[STUDENTS scream]

367
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,375
[gasps]

368
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,291
[NAGISA whimpers]

369
00:17:53,375 --> 00:18:04,500
[TEST MONSTER B roars]

370
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,958
[NAGISA gasps]

371
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,833
[NAGISA]
And all of a sudden...

372
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,458
...poised to strike...

373
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:14,791
...a question we weren't ready
for ambushed us from the rear.

374
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,125
[KARASUMA] Not to rock the boat,
but this is ridiculous.

375
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,541
You gotta help me out here.

376
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,625
However I look at it,
this test seems rigged.

377
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,750
[MALE TEACHER A]
I don't know what to say, sir.

378
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,875
You ought to have received
proper notification.

379
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,208
Perhaps there was some sort of
communications flap on your end?

380
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,416
But there's no point in coming
to the main campus,

381
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,000
I can tell you that. [laughs]

382
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,500
[KARASUMA] The communications
flap wasn't on our end, buddy.

383
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,416
Besides, what constitutes
"proper notification?"

384
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,916
Two days before midterms,
you decide to broaden the scope

385
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,541
and that's supposed
to be enough time for us

386
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,041
to cover everything?

387
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,375
[MALE TEACHER A] With all due
respect Mr., uh, Karasuma,

388
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,166
is it? You don't understand.
We're a prep school.

389
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,000
This sort of thing
happens all the time.

390
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,916
Our students are
expected to cram.

391
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's been our
policy for years.

392
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,375
In fact, when it was decided to
include new material

393
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,291
on this midterm, the principal
himself lectured our students

394
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,166
on those subjects personally.

395
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,500
It was wonderful.
You should've seen it.

396
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,333
[KARASUMA growls]

397
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,708
[KARASUMA]
Unbelievable.

398
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,458
Is there nothing
this man won't resort to

399
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,625
in the name of his own ideals?

400
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,583
[KARASUMA] They've put us
in a hell of a spot.

401
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,500
[KARASUMA] If Koro-sensei
leaves, we're screwed.

402
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,541
We lose everything.

403
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
I take full responsibility.

404
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,041
Clearly, I underestimated
this school's dedication

405
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:41,666
to the status quo. Forgive me
if I can't bear to face you.

406
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,333
[KARMA yells]

407
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:47,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh...?

408
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,500
[KARMA]
Have it your way.

409
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,458
Keep your back
turned if you want.

410
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,083
Just makes it easier for us
to sneak up on you.

411
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
I am in no mood, Karma!

412
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This whole situation
has me very de-- Uh?!

413
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,833
[KARMA] So they added
questions to the stupid test.

414
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:03,375
Big deal.

415
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,541
[CLASS gasps]

416
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,708
[SUGINO]
Seriously?

417
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,333
Hold the phone,
you got a hundred in math?

418
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,458
Your method worked
like a charm, Teach.

419
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,791
You gave us everything you had
and at the moment of truth,

420
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,208
it mattered.

421
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,666
So what if the midterms
decided to cover new territory?

422
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,958
I was ready.
Don't worry, though.

423
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,208
I'm not going anywhere.
You see, this is where I belong.

424
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,541
Normal Class has nothing
on assassination.

425
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:31,500
So. Where are you gonna go,
huh? Where do you belong?

426
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,541
You plan on using the fact we
didn't all make the top 50

427
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,458
as an excuse to
tuck your tail and run?

428
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,541
'Cause you're not fooling me.

429
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,208
I think you're just
scared that one of us

00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,875
is actually gonna kill you.

You could've just told us.

00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,750
Not like we'd blame you
for being afraid.

[STUDENTS laughs]

436
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,500

more straightforward

--with how you feel.
--Even if how you feel is all,

438

"oh no, I wanna run away!"

'Kay. So what's the deal?

442
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
The deal is we get our revenge

443
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,000
on this school two-fold
during finals!

[KORO-SENSEI] Children!
This is no laughing matter!

446
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,875
[NAGISA] There's no denying we
hit a wall on our midterms.

447
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,791
The same wall that's always
closed us off

448
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,250
from everyone else.

449
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,041
But for once, I'm kinda
glad to be behind it.

450
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,625
Not just glad. Proud.
Proud to be in E Class!
