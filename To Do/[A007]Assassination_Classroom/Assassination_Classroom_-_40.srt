1
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,583
From behind at
point-blank range?

2
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,541
[NAKAMURA]
Like a bolt of lightning

3
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,500
outta the clear blue sky.

4
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,583
Where in the world
has he been hiding?

5
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,375
[KARMA]
Of course.

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,083
He was shadowing Mr. Karasuma,

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,625
blending in with his
Self-Defense Force camo.

8
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,916
Waiting to pick us off from
the ideal sniper's nest.

9
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,208
[MAEHARA]
Gotcha!

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,958
This is exactly why being
around Nagisa has me on edge.

11
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,416
I guess it's one-on-one now.

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,875
Fine by me.

13
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,416
Let's finish it.

14
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,000
[SUGINO] So it comes down
to Nagisa versus Karma.

15
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,333
Ballsy tactic.

16
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,333
The kid essentially
used Karasuma

17
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,875
as his own personal blind.

18
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
A referee goes largely unnoticed

19
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,916
on the playing field.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,250
Nagisa honed in on that fact,
made himself invisible.

21
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,666
Brilliant!

22
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,458
He waited for the perfect
moment to reveal himself.

23
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,208
His instincts are that
of a natural-born killer.

24
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,166
It's not wise to underestimate
Karma, though.

25
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,416
Comparing these two on the basis
of academic performance,

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,208
he soundly beats Nagisa
in every area of study.

27
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,958
That said, the fact
must've dawned on him.

28
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,375
When it comes to
matters of assassination,

29
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,833
Nagisa is, without question,
Karma's greatest adversary.

30
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,458
[KARMA]
Damn. He's already moved.

31
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,250
Nagisa! Put down the
gun and come on out!

32
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,291
We'll settle this with blades!

33
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,291
[gasps]

34
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,416
No way! Don't be an idiot!

35
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Take him out while
you've got the shot!

36
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,458
I don't think he's gonna fire.

37
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:52,833
[NAGISA]
Karma. He always plays so dirty.

38
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,958
If I ignore his challenge
and shoot him right now,

39
00:03:56,041 --> 00:04:00,750
you can bet the red team'll be
hard-pressed to concede defeat.

40
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,041
He's counting on
me to know that.

41
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,041
[NAGISA] If I want everyone on
board with saving Koro-sensei,

42
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,708
this has to play out
on Karma's terms.

43
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,250
I have to beat him
at his own specialty.

44
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,416
Seriously?

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,333
No! They're going mano a mano?

46
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,416
It makes sense.

47
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,583
Nagisa respects Karma
in a big way,

48
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,375
and he needs him to understand
where he's coming from.

49
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,625
[OKAJIMA]
Let's move in for a better view!

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,208
Not gonna lie.

51
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,375
I'm still for not
killing Koro-sensei,

52
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:36,791
but... seeing Karma just put
himself out there like that?

53
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:41,541
When I tagged Rinka,
I felt the same way.

54
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,416
Supposing we wind up
having to kill him,

55
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,416
what would that feel like?

56
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,291
And now we watch
the flip-floppers

57
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,166
crawl out of the woodwork.

58
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,875
Must be some correlation
between strong opinions

59
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,916
and working camouflage, huh?

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,125
A class like this
pulls unexpected things

61
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,416
outta everybody.

62
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,666
You, Kayano, Mimura,
and Kanzaki, for example.

63
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,916
Some go berserk.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,208
Some get all fired up
to do better next time.

65
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,291
Some we assume are slackers turn
out to actually have a plan.

66
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,166
Some who pass
themselves off as jokers

67
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,541
turn out to be dead serious.

68
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,666
Oh, shut up.

69
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,750
[TERASAKA]
And weirdest of all,

70
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,291
not only does the
runt of the litter

71
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,500
turn out to be a
genius assassin,

72
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,541
the guy we all thought
this came easiest to

73
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,250
has gotta work his ass off.

74
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,458
So, whoever wins
this has my respect.

75
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:29,375
With the crazy skillsets we have
as a group, something tells me

76
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,458
we can handle any challenge
that comes our way.

77
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,333
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

78
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,000
[NAGISA] Ever since we
met as First Years,

79
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,916
to put it simply,
I've looked up to him.

80
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,083
[KARMA]
Excuse me, sir? What's this?

81
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,250
[ONO]
Whoa, Akabane.

82
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,375
That's second-year
stuff you're lookin' at.

83
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,291
[NAGISA] He did whatever
he pleased, without fear.

84
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,375
And he was absolutely brilliant.

85
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,291
[KARMA]
Okay. That's all I needed.

86
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,750
I can handle the rest
on my own, thanks.

87
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,500
[ONO]
Mm?

88
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,750
What? You're kidding me.

89
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,791
By the way, Teach,
I'm just gonna leave now.

90
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,458
[NAGISA]
If only I could be like that.

91
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:14,416
From where I stood, Karma seemed
to have it all figured out.

92
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,958
[KARMA]
Wait, really?

93
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,666
Nazzoni directed "Sonic Ninja"?
And it's out now?

94
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,125
That's awesome!

95
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,583
Didn't even know.
We should go see it!

96
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,250
Are you cool to come
with me, Shiota?

97
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,416
[NAGISA]
All of a sudden,

98
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,625
we were hanging out
and I felt six feet tall.

99
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,000
That was halfway
through our first year.

100
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,375
Life was good.

101
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,750
[NAGISA] But it wasn't
long before I learned

102
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,708
that all good things
come to an end.

103
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,958
Well, well,
what do we have here?

104
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,625
You beat my good buddy to a
pulp and you're still walkin'.

105
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,708
Huh? Yeah, I s'pose I am.

106
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,750
For the record,
your buddy started it.

107
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,916
He had it comin'.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,250
You're fulla crap!
See, accordin' to him--

109
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,583
Come again, please?

110
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm havin' a little trouble
understandin' ya.

111
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,583
[NAGISA]
He could do whatever he pleased

112
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,333
because he had the strength
to back himself up.

113
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,125
[NAGISA]
Not a place I was ever gonna be.

114
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:21,916
He must've gotten bored sharing
the stage with a nobody.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,083
By the time they suspended him,

116
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,041
we'd gone back to
being just classmates.

117
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,750
[KARMA] He's always been
a harmless little mouse.

118
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,625
A guy with my rep has to be
on high alert around most folks.

119
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,458
Not with him, though.

120
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,333
Looking back on it now,

121
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,083
I'm the one who put
the distance between us.

122
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,916
Even then, there was something
about him that made me nervous.

123
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,250
Now where'd he'd run
off to? Hey, Nagisa!

124
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,958
[KARMA] I could put my
guard down around him.

125
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,000
[gasps]

126
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,708
I've right been here
the whole time.

127
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,416
You didn't see me?

128
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,583
[KARMA] But for some reason,
he had me on edge.

129
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:11,416
It was like, if he wanted he
could've killed me in my sleep.

130
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,375
Always so sweet
natured and honest.

131
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,708
On the surface, we couldn't
have been more different.

132
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:23,416
Still... beneath that innocent
façade lurked something else,

133
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,375
something downright sinister.

134
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,875
I wanted to drag it
out of him. Crush it.

135
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,000
Not that there'd have been any
point fighting him in class.

136
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:37,541
Whatever he has, it's
totally beyond all that.

137
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,666
I couldn't deal. Before long,
we'd drifted apart.

138
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,333
And here we are.

139
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,291
A couple of Third Years
in a class on assassination,

140
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,250
staring each other down.

141
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,541
[NAGISA]
This is it.

142
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,916
The only way to get our
point across is to win.

143
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,208
[BOTH]
You are so going down!

144
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,208
Nagisa.

145
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
A desire to win.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,791
To conquer. The all-consuming
competitive streak of youth!

147
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,541
You must forget about
me in this moment.

148
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,750
Clear your minds. It's about
what's in front of you.

149
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:32,916
We kill!

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,375
We save!

151
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,333
I'm surprised a
tackle that well-timed

152
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,541
didn't bring him down.

153
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,083
There's a pretty big
difference in strength

154
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,500
between the two of them.

155
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Indeed.

156
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,791
If one knife connects,
it's a win.

157
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,333
Karma won't hesitate to use
the brief window of time

158
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,583
to his advantage.

159
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,500
Ah, but observe Nagisa closely.

160
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,541
He's carrying a second blade.

161
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,791
[KAEDE gasps]

162
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,916
[KAEDE] You think he'll
try the Clap Stunner?

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Unlikely.

164
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,291
Karma will've noticed
the hilt on his leg.

165
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,666
The second blade won't
come as a surprise.

166
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,958
Two assassins, their weapons
and methods worlds apart.

167
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,041
How will this
contest be settled?

168
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,375
Don't touch that dial, folks.

169
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,458
[KARMA]
If I don't wanna get inked,

170
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,000
the trick is to take
the hits like a pro.

171
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,708
[NAGISA]
Now!

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,083
[KARASUMA]
Nice. He got his knife away.

173
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,708
[NAGISA]
I've got this!

174
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,083
Both their knives
are out of reach!

175
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,666
Wait, look.
Not the one on his leg!

176
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,791
Ha!

177
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,833
Don't even bother.

178
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,458
The second you go for that
blade, the fight belongs to me.

179
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,833
I'll knock you on your ass

180
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,958
and take my sweet time
with the final blow!

181
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,083
[KARMA]
Hm.

182
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,250
Aw, that's all you got?

183
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,708
Holy crap. He's taking
Nagisa's attacks on purpose.

184
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,458
His hits have gotta be having
some kind of effect, right?

185
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,416
I mean, he's been upping his
game for a whole year now.

186
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,791
[KORO-SENSEI] Karma is first and
foremost a combat assassin.

187
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,291
He relishes process:
The bargaining, the strategy.

188
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,958
Only when he's gone
through the moves

189
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,125
will he deal the decisive blow.

190
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,791
Nagisa, on the other hand,
is a pure assassin.

191
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,916
Single-mindedly searching
for the one strike

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,208
that will secure victory.

193
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,333
Karma has trained
himself to take a beating.

194
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,666
Hit after hit,

195
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,458
he'll stand his ground and
give as good as he gets.

196
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,041
Should he hold out indefinitely,

197
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,708
Nagisa will have no honorable
choice but to accept defeat.

198
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,625
That was an axe kick!

199
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,000
Bring one of those to the table

200
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,458
and the other guy doesn't
have a chance in hell!

201
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,000
[KARMA]
Let's be real.

202
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:46,041
There'll never be another
place like this. Not ever.

203
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:51,458
No one else is gonna let me
be honest about how I feel.

204
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,000
But I will kill him.

205
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,166
'Cause, like it or not,
it's the right thing to do.

206
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,500
[KARMA]
What the--?

207
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,708
That's the last ounce
of strength he's got.

208
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,250
[KORO-SENSEI] He bit his tongue
to keep from dropping!

209
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,958
[KARMA]
Go for it, Nagisa.

210
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,708
Come at me with all that
natural talent I never had.

211
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,583
I'll break you over
my knee like a twig.

212
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,750
This game is mine.

213
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,916
It's all channeled
into that blade.

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,666
Dodge, and his bloodlust
will dissolve.

215
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,750
[KARMA]
What the--?

216
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,750
What's he doing?

217
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,416
[NAGISA yells]

218
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,000
A triangle choke!

219
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,333
With his carotid cinched,

220
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,458
it's only a matter of time
before he passes out.

221
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,666
Nagisa's choke hold is even more
effective than it was earlier.

222
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,083
[groaning]

223
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:50,958
Ugh.

224
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,833
You are going to hear me out!

225
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,083
Look at 'im!

226
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,250
How the hell is he
pinning him down like that

227
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,791
in the first place?

228
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
The element of surprise.

229
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,375
Nagisa sacrificed his greatest
skill to create a red herring,

230
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,708
opting to finish with
a martial arts move.

231
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,291
All to make a simple point:

232
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,500
Karma's own specialty
has, in the end,

233
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,541
been turned against him.

234
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,041
[KARMA] Exactly like
I tried to do to him.

235
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,625
Playing by my terms,

236
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,833
he's making it impossible for
anyone to contest the outcome.

237
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,291
Ugh. Damn it.

238
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,041
At this rate, I'm toast!

239
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,125
[gasps]

240
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,208
He's got a knife!

241
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,583
[KAEDE]
Oh no!

242
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,291
[NAGISA]
No, I can't fight.

243
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,333
I'm probably way too big
of chicken to even try.

244
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,916
Uh, unless it was absolutely
a matter of life and death.

245
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,458
I give up.

246
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,125
Uncle. Uncle.

247
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,708
You win, Nagisa. Good job.

248
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,000
[KARMA groans]

249
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:56,916
[yells]

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,458
[KARMA]
Are you listening to me?

251
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,333
That's enough!

252
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,958
Red Team has surrendered.

253
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,166
Game over.

254
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,666
Blue Team is the winner!

255
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,458
[BLUE TEAM]
Yeah!

256
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,958
Okay. Cool.

257
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,416
You worked hard for
that win, Nagisa.

258
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,541
I actually... won?

259
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,458
I beat Karma?

260
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,416
'Fore you start doin'
a little victory dance,

261
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,375
let's make one thing
perfectly clear.

262
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,833
You left your back
wide open to attack.

263
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,833
I just couldn't bring
myself to stab you.

264
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,875
Talk about bein' stuck between
a rock and hard place.

265
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,208
No one would've been satisfied
with me winning that way.

266
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,291
Can't believe you managed
to get the drop on me

267
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,666
with martial arts.

268
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,250
Seriously, dude,

269
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,833
who'd have ever thought I'd be
beaten at my own game like that?

270
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,291
[sighs]

271
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,791
You killed me.

272
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,333
Right, you wanna
save Koro-sensei?

273
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,375
Talk. I'm listenin'.

274
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,166
Are you really? No joke?

275
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,416
Quit starin' at me like that.
You look like mousetrap cheese.

276
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,375
I've seen fewer bruises
on a week-old peach.

277
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,958
Wow,

278
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,500
even in defeat you can't bear
to waste a single insult, huh?

279
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,708
Good ol' Karma.

280
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,583
[KARMA]
Please.

281
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,125
Look. Why don't we drop
all the back-and-forth?

282
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,208
I'm really not feelin'
it after that fight.

283
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,500
So what? We talk to each
other like human beings?

284
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,541
Feels kinda weird
after all this time.

285
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,583
[KARMA]
Fine.

286
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,208
I'll start us off.

287
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,833
Gimme your hand... old friend.

288
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,458
Thanks, Karma.

289
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,958
Old friend.

290
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
True feelings tend to bubble up

291
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,583
when under pressure
from a big decision.

292
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,083
Often as not, there's conflict.

293
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,916
But look. In the end,
harmony reigns.

294
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,708
Because these boys and girls
have fought in earnest.

295
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,291
they've come to
see and appreciate

296
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,625
one another's true feelings.

297
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,000
[NAGISA]
...pull your punches, Karma.

298
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,583
[KARMA] Only because I didn't
want to paralyze ya.

299
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,208
[KORO-SENSEI] Sometimes conflict
can be the best opportunity

300
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,833
to strengthen a friendship.

301
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,541
[KARASUMA]
Is that another lesson?

302
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,500
Without strife, we can't grow
or learn a damn thing?

303
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,458
[chuckling]

304
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,375
[KARASUMA] I'm sure you all have
your own thoughts on the matter.

305
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,916
I for one have no objection

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,250
to the course this
class has chosen.

307
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,791
That said,

308
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,625
I can only allow you to try
to save him on one condition.

309
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,833
You have until the end of
the month to figure out a way.

310
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:27,250
You might be taking a
break from assassination,

311
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:31,083
but many others involved aren't.
Their efforts are in full swing.

312
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,791
If it turns out he
needs to be killed,

313
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,916
I believe you should
be the ones who do it.

314
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,208
Make me a promise.

315
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,125
However January plays out,

316
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,708
February onward, you'll focus
on the original objective.

317
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,916
Whether you save or kill,
give it all you've got.

318
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,708
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

319
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,583
[TAKEBAYASHI]
To put this in general terms...

320
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,250
...what about world leaders?

321
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,041
Is assassinating Koro-sensei
their only game plan?

322
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,208
I doubt it.

323
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,791
Bear in mind,

324
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,666
the larger goal is to save the
Earth from certain destruction.

325
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,333
They can't afford
to be unilateral.

326
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,875
Odds are they've
explored options

327
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,416
that don't involving
killing him.

328
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,333
Why don't we look into what
those options might be?

329
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,625
He's right.

330
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,541
There're research facilities
all over the world

331
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,916
dedicating themselves
to the problem 24/7.

332
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,958
Needless to say, their
work is highly classified.

333
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,458
Finding out what they know
will be next to impossible.

334
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,208
Infiltration of the
project database complete!

335
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,583
[KARASUMA]
What the--?!

336
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,875
[RITSU] If it's online,
I can access it. No problem.

337
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,666
What can I say? I've learned
a lot in the last year.

338
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,291
Nice job.

339
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,541
[ISOGAI]
Wow.

340
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,333
Every lab in existence
has to be on this thing.

341
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,250
Jackpot!

342
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,291
[RITSU]
Uh-oh.

343
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,791
I've combed through
all the files,

344
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:21,208
but I'm not seeing any trace
of the information we need.

345
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,875
[ISOGAI] I guess the
higher-ups only hand off

346
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,833
that kinda stuff in person.

347
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,833
[MAEHARA]
Great.

348
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:26,958
So is anybody even
doing research

349
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,458
on how to save Koro-sensei?

350
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,125
Guys, look. There's
a lab in the U.S.

351
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,166
"Preventing destructive
antimatter chain reactions

352
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,666
due to tentacle-cell
aging and fission."

353
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,916
I'm no scientist, but that
seems like a definite hit to me!

354
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,291
"Last samples return from
ISS on January 25th."

355
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,791
What is ISS? Anybody know?

356
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,083
Wait a minute. That's...

357
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,083
Whoa!

358
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,416
The International Space Station!

359
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,000
They're conducting their
research in outer space!

360
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,041
Um, it's possible!

361
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,708
Certain types of research
require zero gravity

362
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,250
or a perfect vacuum.

363
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,625
And, well, of course,

364
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,541
if there's a chance it
could cause a big, uh,

365
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,208
catastrophic explosion,

366
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,708
there'd way be way less
collateral damage.

367
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,208
[ISOGAI] Couldn't we just ask
for the data as colleagues?

368
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,791
You could, sure.

369
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,458
But sadly you kids are just
one outpost among many.

370
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,791
With all the red tape involved,

371
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,125
that data might
not make it time.

372
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,250
Mr. Karasuma.

373
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,541
[BOTH]
Uh?

374
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,375
[KARMA]
I know what you're thinking.

375
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,500
Killing him is still
the backup plan.

376
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:33,000
Trust me. We're not going
to go into this half-cocked.

377
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,791
If there's any hope
of saving him at all,

378
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,291
we'll do whatever it takes.

379
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,625
If not, this class will stick
to the original game plan.

380
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,375
Won't we, Nagisa?

381
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,625
[NAGISA]
Mm.

382
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,291
That's been our understanding
from the start.

383
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,041
Before we do anything,
I need a blueprint.

384
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,375
Be square with us.

385
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,791
How serious are the rules
we're about to break?

386
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,375
[KURASAMA grumbles]

387
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mr. Karasuma. Miss Irina.

388
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:00,208
Will you give the students
and I a moment?

389
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,583
What we're about to discuss
might potentially cause

390
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:06,791
one or two liability
issues for you.

391
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,083
Okey dokey!

392
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,250
Here's essentially what
you're trying to do.

393
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,500
You need to grab a quick peek
of the research data in question

394
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,541
before it reaches America
from Outer Space.

395
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,875
Yeah, but as for the how...

396
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
How indeed!

397
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,041
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

398
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Lookie, lookie!

399
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,833
Guess where this beautifully
streamlined bucket of bolts

400
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,208
is about to be sent?

401
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,041
Is that a manned rocket?

402
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Precisely!

403
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,833
A proof-of-concept craft
developed right here in Japan.

404
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,708
Test dummies have been given the
honor of taking the first trip.

405
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:40,041
But what if they were
replaced with actual people?

406
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,916
[STUDENTS gasp]

407
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,750
You're serious...

408
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,041
[chuckles] That's it.

409
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,750
Our teacher's officially
gone off the deep end.

410
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes!

411
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,666
Consider this the
Assassination Classroom's

412
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,083
out-of-season research project!

413
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:56,875
Ground control to Major Tom:
The ISS has been hijacked!

414
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,833
[NAGISA]
Whoa. No way.

415
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes, way! All the way!
