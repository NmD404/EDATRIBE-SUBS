00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,041
[KUNUDON]
Surprise!

2
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,666
[CHILDREN]
Tell us, Kunudon!

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,833
Well hello there, boys 'n girls!

4
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,083
Fall's here at last!

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,458
And you know what that means!

6
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,916
Food, studying, and festivals!

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,083
Kunugigaoka Academy's Fall
Festival is the real deal!

8
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,666
[CHILDREN] With a great
return-on-investment ratio!

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,958
[KUNUDON] Head-hunters
from top tier corporations

10
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,875
come to scout out
potential hires,

11
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,875
so be sure you make
a good impression!

12
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,458
[CHILDREN] Unemployment
is at an all-time high!

13
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,791
[KUNUDON]
Don't be like those students

14
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,125
whose poor business sense

15
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,416
makes them a laughing stock
of the upper class!

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,333
[CHILDREN]
Nouveau riche!

17
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,583
Hurray!

18
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:46,375
[EMPLOYEE A] Our franchise
is happy to lend its support.

19
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,750
Kunugigaoka's Annual Festival
is extraordinarily popular.

20
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,750
Projected sales of our
product is one thing,

21
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,958
but the publicity would be huge.

22
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,291
Mr. Asano.

23
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,250
These are very impressive
figures you've drawn up.

24
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,583
I believe we have a deal.

25
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,750
A pleasure doing
business with you.

26
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:06,791
[ALL] Uh! What Junior High
kid gets a corporate sponsor?

27
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,666
[GAKUSHU]
No blind spots.

28
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,500
E-Class will be blown
out of the water.

29
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,541
[MAEHARA]
Wow.

30
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,875
The main campus
is really goin' nuts

31
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,791
over this year's festival, huh?

32
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,125
The hype is insane.

33
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,375
Probably 'cause they think
we're up to something.

34
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,583
Word is Asano made a deal with
some big restaurant chain.

35
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,041
Yeah, well. I wouldn't
put it past the guy.

36
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Then we will go for the jugular.

37
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,291
Figuratively, of course.

38
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,250
This competition will
be decided by skills

39
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,000
not assassination related.

40
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,250
I really don't wanna lose
to the A-Class jerkwads.

41
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,208
But what are we supposed to do?

42
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,958
[NAGISA, KAEDE]
Mm.

43
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Asano has the right idea.

44
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,333
This all about providing
something unique.

45
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,625
Give people a bargain
and you'll draw them in,

46
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,166
even on a shoestring budget.

47
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,083
[MAEHARA] Sounds nice,
but how we gonna do that?

48
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Come now, children!

49
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,333
The answers are all around you!

50
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,916
E-Class can give customers
a one-of-a-kind bargain.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,083
On this baby!

52
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,041
And this!

53
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:34,958
And these.

54
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,208
And these!

55
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,625
Ingredients that have a
lot in common with you!

56
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,958
You're all tucked away
in the mountains

57
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,250
where your value tends
to go unnoticed!

58
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,500
I get it!

59
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,125
We'll hit our customers
where they least expect!

60
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,166
What a cool idea!

61
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,833
An assassination restaurant!

62
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
In a manner of speaking, yes.

63
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,291
Now brandish these secret blades

64
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,625
like you're going
in for the kill!

Don't miss out!

00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,625
Genuine acorn noodles,
made from genuine acorns!

00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,458
The brand new taste
sensation straight from

69
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,916
the mountain's natural
goodness to your mouth!

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,166
Ah! Upperclassmen!

71
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,208
You know value for money
when you see it,

72
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,333
but you've never had
anything like this!

73
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,250
[RYUKI] Yeah? Can it
seriously be all that?

74
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,416
Oh, yes!

75
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,833
Come experience the
fresh-picked taste!

76
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,375

77
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,833
[RYUKI panting]

78
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,250
[RYUKI]
Hey. Cool place you got here.

79
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,791
[SUGINO] Uh! The high school
thugs from our class trip!

80
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,333
What the hell are
you doing here?!

81
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,791
Hey, guys.

82
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,166
Huh, come to kidnap
another girl?

83
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,833
Yeah, 'cause I'm an idiot.

84
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,375
You think I want your freak
show of a teacher on my back?

85
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,916
No thanks.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,125
'Course, I don't gotta get
physical to wreck your day.

87
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,625
Not at all. I could just
start tellin' everybody

88
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,750
your food tastes like crap.

89
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,291
Maybe write a bad review online.

90
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,458
[SUGINO growls]

91
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,916
C'mon, bring out the grub, son.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,208
[OKUDA]
Our signature dish...

93
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,708
Acorn noodles!

94
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,291
Whoa! This looks great!

95
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,541
Uh, hey, Ryuki?

96
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,375
Would it be okay if
I get a Mont Blanc!

97
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,000
Dude! I gotta try
the smoked fish!

98
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:14,791
Pretty please!

100

Your stupid is showing!

101
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,208
[RYUKI]
Heh. One bite and I'll puke.

102
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,791
Only a Junior High kid
would cook this up.

103
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:29,125
[RYUKI gasps]
It's delicious!

104
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,458
Originally we were gonna do a
more impressive reaction shot,

105
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,666
but sadly there's already
another cooking anime

106
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,958
that's called dibs on that.

107
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,125
Do what?

108
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,500
Not bad, right? I spent
like a solid week

109
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,583
researching and
refining the recipe.

110
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,875
The noodles are
made from acorns,

111
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,416
thickened with grated yam.

112
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,041
The flavor was super
earthy, though,

113
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,000
so I went with a rich
dipping broth.

114
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,333
Turned out to be
the perfect balance.

115
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,583
It was hard work,
lemme tell ya.

116
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,708
but the end product is tonkotsu
soy-sauce acorn noodles

117
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,166
fit for a king!

118
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,291
No kiddin'.

119
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,291
I ain't never tasted
nothin' like it.

120
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,666
For Muramatsu, it's
kind of a miracle.

121
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,708
Well, so much for blandness
being a selling point.

122
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,666
Hey, Itona!

123
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,333
Shut up and get back to work!

We should try everything!

[PUNK D] Let's do the "Slender
Caesar Mushroom" next!

126
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,208
It sounds awesome!

127
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,166

tastes like crap, dumbasses!

[IRINA]
Oh... oh, dear.

129
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,416
Aw. You boys don't
like any of the food

prepared for you?

No, no! It's amazing!

00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,791
[IRINA]
Really?

134
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,291
Then might I recommend the
persimmon-loquat gelatin?

135
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,166
The texture is as
soft as my skin!

136

[RYUKI]
Yes, ma'am!

137
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,208
And why stop there?

138

00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,583
It would make me so very happy.

[RYUKI chuckles]
I need more cash.

141
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,041
There's an ATM at the station.

142
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,625
You can pull out all
the cash you need.

143

Be right back!

144

[IRINA]
Okay! I'll be waiting!

145
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,833
[NAGISA] Not ideal,
but I guess it's a start.

Yada's at the bottom of the
mountain drawing in customers.

147
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,708
And Professor Bitch
is at the top.

148
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,875

combo right there.

getting started.

00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,583

pulling in customers.

Hey Asano!

We have events every
hour on the hour.

My idol singer friends
and some comedians I know

165
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,083
are performing for free.

166
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,500
The cover charge includes
unlimited food and drinks.

167
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,083
When whatever's playing on
one side of the stage ends,

168
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,291
the next show begins
immediately on the flip side.

169
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,583
The entrance fee is only good
for half the performance space,

170
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,208
so people will
keep going around,

171
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,458
shelling out their hard-earned
cash for each new act.

172
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,416
Before long, their
stomachs'll be full,

173
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,291
and E-Class high and dry.

174
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,333
Right, gentlemen. Let's do this.

175
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,500
I'll start hammering
out a few power riffs.

176
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,916
You guys get ready.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,500
[AUDIENCE chattering]

178
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,833
[AUDIENCE cheers]

179
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,333
No, seriously.

180
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,000
Is there anything he can't do?

181
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,416
[ARAKI]
I know!

182
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,375
To be honest,  it's rather
disgusting how good he is.

183
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,416
[ARAKI] He's good.

184
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,208
But remember:
he's not infallible.

185
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,083
Well he sure isn't going
to lose to E-Class,

186
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,416
I guarantee you that!

187
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,125
That'd be a nice change of pace.

188
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,083
I'm sick of seeing our
leader get his butt kicked

189
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,833
by those friggin' nobodies.

190
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,500
He's not the only Chosen
One at this school.

191
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,958
I mean, after all,

192
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,750
we learned our instruments
between study sessions, too.

193
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,708
Whaddya say we get out
there and back him up?

194
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:43,916
[SEO]
Yeah!

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,166
[CUSTOMER A]
This, please.

196
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,041
[SAKURA]
Ah-ha! There you are, Nagisa!

197
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,000
Look who I've got in tow!

198
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,333
Hey, Sakura!

199
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,750
You brought Mr. Matsukata
and the gang!

200
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,625
Aw, that's sweet,
Nagisa you kept in touch.

201
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,458
Yeah.

202
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,333
I help her study sometimes.

203
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,916
I had to show up!

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,958
When your personal tutor asks
you to try out their restaurant,

205
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,500
you really don't have a choice.

206
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,958
Good business strategy.

207
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,458
With this bunch, we'll make
bank on volume alone!

208
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,041
Sorry we don't have deeper
pockets, but we're here.

209
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,208
[slurping]

210
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:13,916
Oh, my now!

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,291
Now this is superb!

212
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,708
Something so tasty is bound
to sell out before long.

213
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,458
[NAGISA] It's been kind
of a struggle, actually.

214
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,791
Cooking it is one thing, getting
the word out there is another.

215
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,291
Really?

216
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,958
I wouldn't worry
too much, though.

217
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,708
You guys have like this
mysterious power, y'know?

218
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,916
Of course.

219
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,958
Keep doing what you do
and word'll get out.

220
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,791
Let your customer base find you.

221
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,208
[SAKURA]
Thanks again!

222
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,250
[CHILDREN]
Bye!

223
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,583
[MATSUKATA]
Come along now, Sakura.

224
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,791
[NAGISA]
Huh.

225
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,166
Keep doing what we do
and word'll get out.

226
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,583
It'd be great if people
started talking.

227
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,000
We just have to be patient.

228
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,666
I'm just gonna come
out and say it.

229
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,458
I, uh, heard all about your mom.

230
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,958
And why your hair's long.

231
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry I teased you so much.

232
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,750
Honestly, I never meant to
hurt your feelings, Nagisa.

233
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,750
No, no. We're all good.

234
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,541
I can take a little ribbing from
you and Karma. It's no big deal.

235
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,916
Oh, good.

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,458
But I'll go a little easier
on you from here on out.

237
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,458
[YUJI]
Wassup?

238
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,041
[NAGISA]
Oh crap, I know that voice!

239
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,666
Nagisa! Long time no see!

240
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,333
No! No! Not Yuji!

241
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,333
We know him?

242
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,208
Oh, wait.

243
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,750
That guy from Summer vacation!

244
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,041
The one who thought
you were a chick

245
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,875
and totally had a thing for you!

246
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,833
How... how'd you find out
where I went to school?

247
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,041
It was easy,

248
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,833
I just looked up the
island's guest registry.

249
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,708
Uh, I've been kinda
stalking you online

250
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,333
and I saw the big
Autumn Festival.

251
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,500
[NAKAMURA humming]

252
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,000
[NAGISA]
Um, okay.

253
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,375
Hey Nakamura!

254
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,250
What the--? Stop!

255
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,000
[NAGISA growls]

256
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,375
Okay, I promise this
is the last time for real.

257
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,458
We just had a conversation
about this!

258
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,166
The kid is loaded, isn't he?

259
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,625
So, c'mon, don't be shy,

260
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,166
we have to raise our customer
average any way we can.

261
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,291
[NAGISA grunts]

262
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,041
Take one for
the team, Nagisa!

263
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,000
Like it or not, the fate
of this enterprise rests

264
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,291
on your skills as a hostess!

265
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,416
[NAGISA yelps]

266
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,583
[YUJI] Man, did I pick the
right time to come or what?

267
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,375
Pretty lucky I got you
as a waitress, huh?

268
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,375
Yeah. Great spot, too.

269
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,833
Thanks for bringin' me here.

270
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,625
I'm lovin' the privacy!

271
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,875
[NAGISA]
And I'm lovin' that fact

272
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,333
that no one else can see us.

273
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,250
Huh?

[slurping]

275
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,250
[NAGISA]
Cue cards? Really?

276
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,125
[NAGISA]
So, um, you know what I want?

277
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,250
I, uh, "want you to eat
all of my favorites."

278
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,500
Sure thing, babe!

279
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,250
Just ask and I'll get
everything on the menu!

280
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,916
[NAKAMURA laughs]
This idiot's a total goldmine.

281
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,750
And a big eater.
Rake in the cash, Nagisa!

282
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,458
Did I tell you I stopped smokin'
those sketchy cigarettes?

283
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,125
You were so worried about me,
it got me thinkin'.

284
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,000
[NAGISA]
Ah....

285
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,583
Here we go.

286
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,541
[YUJI]
Oh! This looks amazing!

287
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,666
Lemme get a pic!

288
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,083
[NAGISA]
I feel bad about it,

289
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,208
but if I don't keep it up
things'll get more awkward

290
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,958
than they already are.

291
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,666
[NAGISA] Okay, that is
definitely crossing a line!

292
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,958
[RED EYE] Hey! Brought
you a gift, Karasuma.

293
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,208
[NAGISA]
Uh!

294
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,666
[RED EYE] The colors up
here are breathtaking.

295
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,916
I heard some rumors that
the Reaper took you out.

296
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,541
He tried, it was rough
there for a while.

297
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,000
But hey, I aint
no spring chicken.

298
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,333
[KARASUMA] I'm gonna need
you to conceal that gun.

299
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,625
Who the heck is that?

300
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,041
And is he packing?

301
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,125
Want me to call the police?

302
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,250
Whoa! Whoa!

303
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,041
It's okay, uh...
We know this guy.

304
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,208
He's...

305
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,500
"Mr. Yoshioka from
the local hunt club."

306
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,708
Yoshioka?

307
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,041
What kind of name is
that for a foreigner?

308
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,958
[NAGISA]
Oh, he changed his name.

309
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,541
Big anime fan.

310
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,708
Oh. Guess that makes sense.

311
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,041
Uh.

312
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,125
Well enough about this Yoshioka
dude, or whatever.

313
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,958
Nagisa. Can...

314
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:47,458
Can I...

315
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,416
Like...

316
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,166
Ask you what you think--

[screams]

318
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,416
[NAGISA sighs]

The Octopus extended invitation.

321
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,041
Yes, of course.

322
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,208
I'm just glad to see
you're still alive.

323
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,000
Your protégée's been worried,
you should talk to her.

324
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,125
[LOVRO]
Indeed.

325
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,500
Wha... what's with
the creepy old dude?

326
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,666
He step out of a horror movie?

327
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,416
He's Mr. Mild Yagyu.

328
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,291
He's kind of a big deal on
the Asakusa theatre scene.

329
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,833
That guy's a comedian?!

330
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,291
He and Mr. K were talking
about a, uh, a bit!

331
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,583
Yeah. His protégée used
to be on the circuit,

332
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,666
but retired and
became a teacher.

333
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,708
[YUJI]
Mm-hm...

334
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,625
[GASTRO]
Ooo-hoo!

335
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,750
My gun's never tasted so good!

336
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,333
Oh wow!

337
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,125
I wouldn't turn down a bowl of
this stuff if it were poisoned.

338
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,000
Fellow comedians from Asakusa!

339
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,250
Ha, ha!

340
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,708
The one eating wasabi
Mont Blac is building up

341
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,208
his tolerance for an
extreme-eating sketch!

342
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,500
What can I tell you, huh?

343
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,666
We get to know all
sorts of people.

344
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,708
Give it a rest.

345
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,291
Huh?

346
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,666
I can tell you're lying.

347
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,166
My old man's a big
name in the industry.

348
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,208
I've been seeing
burnouts and wannabe's

349
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,708
suck up to him since
I was a little kid.

350
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,041
I know a front when I see one.

351
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,250
I can spot phonies
from a mile away.

352
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,541
The girl I met on the island?

353
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,166
Let's just say a fake
smile doesn't suit her.

354
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,791
You got me there.

355
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,333
Some talent, Yuji.

356
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,833
If you wanna use that word.

357
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,666
Not a lot of good about
the baggage you take

358
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,041
from a skeevy childhood.

359
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,833
Look, I'm sorry.

360
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,041
I didn't mean to lie to you.
It's not your fault.

361
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,416
I've essentially
looked like this

362
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,041
ever since I was a little boy.

363
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,083
It's kind of a pain.

364
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,625
"Little boy"?

365
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,875
[NAGISA]
Lately,

366
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,500
I've learned that even a
talent you're ashamed of

367
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,875
can be a source of confidence

368
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,000
if you used it to
help someone else.

369
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,708
So I'm starting to make peace
with how girlie I look.

370
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,916
I'm a guy.

371
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,625
Is the point I'm trying
to get across here.

372
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,791
Well that's another lie.

373
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:49,500
[NAGISA]
No.

374
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,875
Well that's another lie.

375
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,750
[NAGISA]
It's not. I promise.

376
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,333
[NAKAMURA]
Show him the goods already!

377
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,166
[NAGISA]
What?!

378
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,708
Look at me and say this
is the face of a liar.

379
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,875
This is for real...?

380
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,750
[NAGISA] From the right angle,
our flaws can be weapons.

381
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,583
If I've learned nothing else
from this classroom, it's that.

382
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,166
It's what we do.

383
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,416
It's how this café
came together.

384
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,666
It's what brought
everyone here today,

385
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,875
what made us a part of
so many peoples' lives.

386
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,708
This may sound weird, but, the
thrill is out of this world!

387
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,500
Hey! Hold on!

388
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,791
I'm sorry I tricked you!

389
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,375
Here, I'll give you
your money back!

390
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,458
[YUJI]
Whatever. I just...

391
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,541
I feel like a total
idiot is all.

392
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,458
Peace out.

393
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,125
What? Aw, why's he leaving?

394
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,833
I was gonna see what
he'd be willing to pay

395
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,375
for a cosplay shoot!

396
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:49,208
Exactly how much money d'you
expect to make off me?!

397
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,625
[NAGISA]
Sorry, Yuji.

398
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,708
Bad move on my part.

399
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,416
[HINANO] Well, I suppose our
first day went sort of okay.

400
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,416
[MIMURA] They posted
the sales report earlier.

401
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,916
Honestly at this
rate we don't have

402
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,166
a snowball's chance in hell
of catching up to A-Class.

403
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,166
Uh?

404
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,166
[REPORTER A]
Pick up the pace!

405
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,541
We'll miss the morning
broadcast!

406
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,166
[STUDENTS]
Wha...?

407
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,416
Is that a TV crew?

408
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,041
I don't get it,
what're they covering?

409
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,083
The only thing up there's
the E-Class building.

410
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,791
[MAEHARA, MIMURA]
What the hell?!

411
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,375
Look you guys!

412
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,916
Somebody posted an online review
that's spreading like wildfire!

413
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,125
I did a little digging to try
and track down the source,

414
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,750
and you'll never believe this.

415
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,875
It's by Yuji Norita!

416
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,333
Who happens to be,

417
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,333
wait for it, the biggest name
in the food blogosphere!

418
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,666
[FUWA]
Since he grew up rich,

419
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,041
he's tried everything
from caviar to crocodile,

420
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,291
so the boy's palate, annoyingly
enough, is highly developed.

421
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,291
He's got a money-is-no-object,
I'll-try-anything approach.

422
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,458
People love it!

423
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,541
Okay, then.

424
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,750
[YUJI] Of all the places
to find great food,

425
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,916
you wouldn't think a school
festival would be one of them.

426
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,458
But let me tell you: this place
was "out of this world."

427
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,666
The menu changed
my whole outlook.

428
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,916
Sustainable, organic.

429
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,583
They've turned a poor location
into a big advantage.

430
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,833
"From the right angle,
our flaws can be weapons."

431
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:13,541
Those words come from a buddy
of mine who works there.

432
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,666
When I heard them,
I thought to myself: wow.

433
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,791
I've been so spoiled
all my life.

434
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,833
Living in the shadow
of my big-shot dad.

435
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,875
The privilege I've grown up in?

436
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,500
That's my weapon.

437
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,125
I can use it to help people.

438
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:32,916
Which is exactly what I'm
trying to do with this blog.

439
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,791
Trust me.

440
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:34,916
You've only got one more day,

441
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,875
so cut a beeline up
that mountain now.

442
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,375
You won't be disappointed.

443
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,958
Taste it while you can and
it'll change your life!

444
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,291
[NAGISA] After that,
we ran ourselves ragged.

445
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,750
With every new order,
we foraged.

446
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:47,708
Cooked.

447
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:48,791
Served.

448
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,291
And sold.

449
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,791
Just about everybody
we knew showed up.

450
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,041
People from school.

451
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,583
People from other places.

452
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,250
Everybody.

453
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,166
Uh-oh, guys!

454
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,208
This isn't good!

455
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,166
We're almost out
of acorn noodles!

456
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,500
We sold a heck of a lot more
than I thought we would.

457
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,208
Doesn't change the
fact that A-Class

458
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,333
will have made
more revenue.

459
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,583
[SUMIRE]
It's okay,

460
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,708
the side menu have been
selling like crazy, too.

461
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,041
I say in the time
we've got left,

462
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,500
we should just stick with them.

463
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,916
We can go a little deeper
into the forest if we need.

464
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,916
Pad our ingredient reserves?

465
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hm...

466
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,625
[HINANO, NAGISA]
Huh?

467
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,208
[KORO-SENSEI] No, I think
it best to stop here.

468
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,291
But, sir, if we do
that we won't win.

469
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Perfectly all right.

470
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,166
Any more foraging and we
run the risk of upsetting

471
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,500
the mountain's
delicate ecosystem.

472
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,666
[HINANO]
Hm....

473
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
We're all interconnected.

474
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,250
Every action resonates
through the web of life.

475
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,041
Can you feel it,
boys and girls?

476
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,541
The intricate bonds
of shared fate,

477
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,750
of lives that have been touched?

478
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,333
People who've taught you.

479
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,666
People you've helped.

480
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,250
People who've caused
you trouble.

481
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,916
People you've caused
trouble for,

482
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,375
unlikely friendships,
bitter rivalries.

483
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,833
We're all part of one another!

484
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,083
Ah-ha.

485
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,916
So today was just
another lesson all along.

486
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,791
Aw, man, I really wanted
to win this thing.

487
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,250
[TOKA sighs]

488
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,416
Oh, I'm very sorry.

489
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,041
We're all sold out-- [gasps]

Really? Well, you are popular.

491
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,625
Uh!

[NAGISA] Here you go: our last
crimson-glory-vine juice.

It's good.

00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,708
[HIROMI]
Thank you.

496
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,000
I have to say, this class
is really something.

497
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,625
I can see why you're
passionate about staying.

498
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,083
Yep.

499
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,750
So, uh, about all
the unpleasantness

500
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,875
the other evening...

501
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,750
Looking back at it now, I knew.

502
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,208
My boy's grown up.

503
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,208
He's ready to cut
the apron strings.

504
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,583
That business about
graduating from me,

505
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,333
you meant every word.

506
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,333
I don't know where you found
the strength to say it,

507
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,875
but somewhere along
the way, you got tough.

508
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,458
Just, please, for right now,

509
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,541
stay with me a little longer,
till you're of age.

510
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,458
That's all I'm asking.

00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,833
The world'll be
yours soon enough.

512
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,541
I'm not ready to let go of
my baby just yet, Nagisa.

513
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,625
Whatever else I may be,
I'm still your mother.

514
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,208
[KORO-SENSEI] Every connection
we encounter in this world

515
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,291
teaches us a little something
about ourselves.

516
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,541
So please,

517
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,583
as a friend, let me give
you a proper birthday.

518
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,833

The connection we had.

Am I doing right by
what it taught me?

Hey.

00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,416

just apologized to me.

523
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,416
Apparently she tried
to start a fire?

524
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, that.

525
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,958
Water under the bridge.

526
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,458
Good enough.

527
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,291
Now maybe you can explain
what she whispered in my ear.

528
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,708
She promised she would
keep my toupee a secret!

529
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,041
What does that mean?!

530
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,500
[whistles]

531
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,625
[yelps]

532
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,625
[STUDENT A]
A-Class is amazing!

533
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,708
They even beat out
the high-schoolers!

534
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,208
[STUDENT B]
Well, it is Asano.

535
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,708
[STUDENT C]
Yeah, but check out E-Class!

536
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,291
They managed to come in third,

537
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,125
and that's after shutting down
halfway through the second day!

538
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,250
If you ask me, that's an
even bigger accomplishment.

539
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,750
So did you actually visit?

540
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,500
After all the hype they
were getting on TV?

541
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,708
How could I not?

542
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,208
I don't get it, man.

543
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,166
I thought bein' in Class E was
supposed to be punishment.

544
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,541
But, they're all like doing
really well for themselves.

545
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,916
I'm actually a little
bit jealous.
