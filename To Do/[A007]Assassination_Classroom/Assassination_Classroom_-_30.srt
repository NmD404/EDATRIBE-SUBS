1
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,708
So he's holding
the kids hostage.

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Indeed.

3
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:22,125
I suspect he's using them as a
means of luring me to my death.

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,250
[REAPER]
Aw, shucks.

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,791
Well that certainly throws
a monkey wrench in my plan.

00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:29,666
[STUDENTS gasp]

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,208
Mr. Karasuma and Koro-sensei!

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:35,000
But I though he was in Brazil
for that big soccer game?

9
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,416
So be it. Plan 16.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,541
[IRINA] Hmph. This is
my moment to shine.

11
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Wh-what's this?

12
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,916
[KARASUMA]
The room's going down!

13
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,875
[KARASUMA]
Huh? Irina!

14
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't worry, my dear. Stay calm.

15
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,291
[KARASUMA]
I'm guessing this is your show?

16
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,541
[REAPER]
You've heard of the Reaper, yes?

17
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,625
That would be me.

18
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,208
[KARASUMA]
Lovro has mentioned you before.

19
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,708
[REAPER] Precisely why I
left the old fool alive.

20
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,291
See, when clearing the playing
field of competitors,

21
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,500
it helps if my reputation
precedes me.

22
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,708
Now, be a sport and lower
that gun, won't you?

23
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,875
Or shall I ventilate
your friend?

24
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,791
[KARASUMA] How is he
obscuring his presence?

25
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,083
[REAPER]
Heh.

26
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,916
Her neck's been fitted
with explosives.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,708
Same goes for the children.

28
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,666
I give the high sign,
they detonate.

29
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,625
[KORO-SENSEI] You suppose if
my students are threatened,

30
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,416
I'll agree to die quietly.
Is that it?

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,833
Well, I am curious.

32
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
No one else is around.

33
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,208
So, if I'm mindful of his gun...

[STUDENTS chattering]

41
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,416
That was disappointingly quick.

42
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,458
Didn't even get to
liquidate a hostage.

43
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,083
Oh, well. Let's go say
a fond farewell.

44
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Miss Irina.

45
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,375
[KAEDE]
Koro-sensei?

46
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh. Hello, class.

47
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,458
I trust you're all unhurt?

00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,541
[MAEHARA] No offense, sir, but
I can't believe he caught you.

50
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Heh. The bars are forged

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,375
of anti-Me material, I see.

52
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,833
Tricky stuff to work
around, to be sure.

53
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,458
But you'll be thrilled to know
my body has at last overcome it!

Behold, boys and girls,

56
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,875
my top-secret weapon!

57
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,708
The tongue!

58
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,041
[KORO-SENSEI] Coated by
protective digestive juices,

59
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,916
I'll have the bars worn down
to nothing in two days.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,625
[STUDENTS]
We don't have that kind of time!

Not to interrupt, but if you
want their neck braces

to explode, by all
means keep licking.

Okay. Let's get on with it.

'S about to be flooded.

[REAPER]
We are in a drainage canal.

When I send the signal to
the control room above,

71
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,833
water will come gushing in
at 200 P.S.I. per second.

72
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,958
And these bars will essentially
become a giant noodle press.

with the kids in there?

Of course I am.

happen, didn't you?!

I'm sorry.

81
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,833
Results are the only
priority here.

82
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,583
You wanted professionalism.

83
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,708
[KARASUMA grunts]

84
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,166
I realize my method
seems a bit harsh.

85
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,125
Would you prefer it if I let the
best chance of saving the world

00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,708
slip through our fingers?

00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,000
[KARASUMA] Sir.

88
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,666
What if a situation comes
up where killing him

89
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,625
means sacrificing the children?

90
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,375
Do we have a specific
policy on that?

91
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:44,500
Uh, let's see here. Take it
on a case-by-case basis.

92
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,541
Odds are it'll come down
to that at some point

93
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,250
before this is all over, so,

94
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,250
I... I'm certain you'll be
able make the right call

95
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,833
on our behalf.

[KARASUMA]
Here we are.

97
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,166
And in effect, it's my call.

98
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,291
Save the kids,
or save the world.

99
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,833

government's official stance.

[REAPER]
Hm?

101
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:11,000
Saving the world isn't worth
the lives of 27 children.

102
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,750
If these kids are no more than
so much collateral damage,

103
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,916
I'm going to shut you down.

Wow. He's so cool!

106
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,625
[KARASUMA]
FYI, Irina.

107
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,166
Huh?

108
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,250
A true professional gives a
damn about the bigger picture.

109
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,250
[REAPER] If I spend much more
time dealing with this nuisance,

110
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,916
my plan will fall apart.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,166

Karasuma may stand
apart from the herd,

117
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,958
but the Reaper goes further.

118
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,500
Exhibit A: he trapped
the Octopus.

I've set a booby trap.

00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,291
While Karasuma's
trying to disarm it,

124
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,375
shoot him in the back.

Understood.

[KARASUMA] Something's
not right about this door.

127

Probably a trap. I don't
have time for this.

I'll open it and
take a chance.

That do the trick?

130
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,833
Well, at the very least
it slowed him down.

131
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,958
Huh. Little more "umph"
to that than I expected.

132
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,875
[REAPER] You have an excellent
nose for this sort of work.

133
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,625
Clearly I underestimated you.

[REAPER]
Ah, the more skills you pick up,

137
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,958
the more you want to use.

138
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,625
It's second nature
for an assassin

139
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,791
to revel in his bag of tricks.

140
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,000
[REAPER]
Mind your aim, Irina.

Oh, don't worry.

You're going to die.

144
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,666
You know it.

145
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,791
[IRINA] Believe me,
I'm more than prepared.

146
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,166
I don't expect you
to understand that,

147
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,291
but some people can relate.

148
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,416
The Reaper and I are cut
from the same cloth.

149
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,916
[REAPER]
She's right.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,916
Do you know what I was before
I was called to this work?

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,708
A scared kid living moment
to moment in a warzone

152
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,833
where every second, every
breath promised to be my last.

153
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,750
A place that taught me you
can only rely on three things.

154
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,166
Skill, money, and death.

155
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,875
Irina and I know what it is

156
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,708
to be nurtured on
blood and darkness.

And what it means to be a pawn.

[REAPER]
Wow. You're alive.

Shame you're not in a
position to chase me.

164
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,708
Full disclosure?

165
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,208

173
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,458
Are you okay?!

174
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,708
[KARASUMA]
Uh?

175
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,125
[KARASUMA]
What's wrong?

176
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:51,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, thank goodness!

177
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:52,833
I finally got through!

178
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,833
We heard an explosion!

179
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:54,916
Are you hurt?

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,250
[KARASUMA]
I'm all right,

181
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,125
but I'm afraid Irina's
trapped under the rubble.

182
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,375
[ALL gasp]

183
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,291
[KARASUMA] I don't have
time to dig her out.

184
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,250
The Reaper's getting away.

185
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,708
[HINANO]
Wait!

186
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:07,583
You have to do something,
you can't just leave her!

187
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,541
[KARASUMA]
Kurahashi...

188
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,333
Look, the woman
took her chances

189
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,583
when she partnered
with that psychopath.

190
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,083
Being a pro means
assuming a level of risk.

191
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,333
That's part of the job.

192
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,541
What does that have
to do with being pro?!

193
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,875
I know I'm only
a kid, but still.

194
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,833
Poor Professor Bitch!
She's barely even 21!

195
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:32,625
[HINANO] And childhood was
a total nightmare for her.

196
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,125
If life's a puzzle,

197
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,666
Miss Irina didn't
get all the pieces.

198
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,291
Who can say what she'd be
now if she had, y'know?

199
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,333
Please, sir.

200
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,625
Don't leave her behind.

201
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,125
I'm begging you.

202
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,375
[KARASUMA exhales]

203
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,208
[TOKA] You forgive us
when we screw up, right?

204
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,791
What's the difference with her?

205
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,958
[OLGA]
The village has been wiped out.

206
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:01,041
This one escaped, killing a
militia member in the process.

207
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,500
What do you think, my dear?

208
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,125
[LOVRO grunts]

209
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,000
[LOVRO]
Good eyes.

210
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,333
[gasps]

211
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,666
[LOVRO]
You have one decision, child.

212
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,666
Follow our bloodstained path
into life of an assassin,

213
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,916
and the horrors you've witnessed
so far will become routine.

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,291
You're free to seek
peace, of course.

215
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,333
But you'll be hounded by
nightmares all your life.

216
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:31,250
Only by embracing them
can the horrors be tamed.

217
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,708
[LOVRO] A cruel choice
for a child to make.

218
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,791
We will find refugee camp.

219
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,166
Hm?

220
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,083
There's no turning back.

221
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,333
[IRINA]
There you have it.

222
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:53,250
All my life I waded through
a cold sea of blood.

223
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,500
Death by betrayal
is a fitting end.

224
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,291
[IRINA]
I'm just glad it's all over.

225
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,833
If I'd held out much longer,

226
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,416
I might've remembered
what the sun felt like.

227
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,416
[KARASUMA grunting]

228
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,708
[IRINA gasps]

229
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,750
Well don't just
lie there, damn it.

230
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,208
I can't hold this much longer.

231
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,458
[IRINA gasps]

232
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,083
[REAPER]
Uh... What in the...?

233
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,958
They've all escaped?

234
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,625
[REAPER]
No matter.

235
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,666
Killing a few ought
to rein 'em in a bit.

236
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,458
[beeping]

237
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,375
[REAPER]
They took them off?!

238
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,708
Oh, they're good.

239
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,083
[growls]

240
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,333
[ITONA]
Those collars were crap.

241
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,625
All his RC can do is
detonate and unlock.

242
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,875
And if it'd been up to me,

243
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,291
I'd have made it
so the bombs go off

244
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,708
when the person tries
to get out of 'em.

245
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,041
It's just bad design.

246
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,916
[TERASAKA growling]
This really sucks.

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,375
[MIMURA] I'm impressed by
the design for these outfits,

248
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,916
though! They're so lightweight!

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,208
Good thing the security
camera has a blind spot.

250
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,166
He couldn't see us
makin' the camouflage.

251
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,250
Excellent job on
the shading, Sugaya.

252
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,500
[SUGAYA]
Hey, no prob.

253
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,583
My paint worked
great on this fabric.

254
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,958
Do I have an eye for
color-matching or what?

255
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,500
[MEG]
Fantastic.

256
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,000
The RC Creeper Squad

257
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,250
is never gonna let us
hear the end of this.

258
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,666
[MAEHARA] So...
What about Koro-sensei?

259
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,833
[MIMURA] He comes with his
own built-in camouflage.

260
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:18,958
[NAKAMURA]
Meaning he's essentially

261
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,583
buck-naked right now.

262
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Now I'm ruined for marriage.

263
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,041
[MIMURA]
Stop blushing! He'll see!

264
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,875
[KARASUMA] Your left arm's
probably fractured.

265
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,250
[IRINA]
Mm.

266
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,458
Anywhere else you feel
pain or discomfort?

267
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,416
[IRINA coughs]

268
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,083
Huh? Hey, you're bleeding.

269
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,666
I'm fine.

270
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,916
Seeing you shirtless just has me
all hot 'n bothered, that's all.

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,958
I was worried there might
be some head trauma.

272
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,625
It's good to know this
is status quo for you.

273
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,166
Hm?

274
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:45,958
[IRINA]
Huh?

275
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,500
[KARASUMA]
He's back.

276
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,791
The kids figured he would be.

277
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,500
[KARASUMA]
Listen to me.

278
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,541
E-Class is a far cry from
the world you grew up in.

279
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,875
But...

280
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,625
What the hell, I'll just
come right out and say it.

281
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,541
O-Our world really needs you.

282
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,708
[IRINA]
Huh?

283
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:10,875
[REAPER]
Irina?

284
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,000
Where's Karasuma?

285
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,041
[IRINA]
No idea.

286
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,291
He was already gone
when I came to.

287
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,458
Pretty underhanded stunt,
by the way.

288
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,833
Did you have to try
and kill me, too?

289
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,916
Sorry, couldn't be helped.

290
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,250
My hands were tied.

291
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,375
"Can't make an omelet,"
and all that.

292
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,000
There may be honor
among thieves,

293
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,750
but assassins traffic
in deception.

294
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,333
What do I care?

295
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,750
Who am I to talk?

296
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm just a bitch who switches
from one man to another.

297
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,208
[REAPER]
Mm?

298
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,750
You...

299
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,666
You're out of your mind!

300
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,666
[KARASUMA]
Y'know, I've been wondering.

301
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,625
Is this Reaper guy all he's
cracked up to be, or what?

302
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,666
[REAPER groaning]

303
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,750
[STUDENTS gasps]

304
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,916
[KAEDE]
What was that splash just now?

305
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,666
[REAPER gasps]

306
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,666
[KARASUMA]
Don't get me wrong.

307
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,458
Your skills are on point.

308
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,750
You just don't have
any endgame strategy.

309
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,833
Huh?

310
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,375
[REAPER] You've certainly
dressed me down.

311
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,375
[KARASUMA]
What the...?

312
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,916
[REAPER] Surprised?
Don't be. After all,

313
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,375
having no face makes it a whole
lot easier customize disguises.

314
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,958
Heh.

315
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,458
Yours will make a delightfully
rugged addition to my wardrobe!

[BOTH grunting]

318
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,875
[NAKAMURA]
What's going on down there?

319
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Um, er.

320
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,000
The Reaper has a knife!

321
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,500
No, wait! It's a wire!

322
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,750
He tried to strangle
Mr. Karasuma, oh, wow!

323
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,708
Karasuma parries and
does the... thing!

324
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,291
A-And, the Reaper stops him
but then Karasuma comes and,

325
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,291
oh, wow, somehow this is so wow!

326
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,666
What a stupendous fight!

327
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,583
We can't understand
what you're saying!

328
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Stupendous!

329
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,833
Explain it so we can visualize!

330
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,250
[KARASUMA] I shouldn't have
pulled him into close-quarters

331
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,250
combat. Should've figured
he was hiding something.

332
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,041
Can't let this drag
out any longer.

333
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,791
[REAPER]
Ah, ha, ha.

334
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,875
I feel I should tell you,
Mr. Karasuma.

335
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,583
I might've overstated the tragic
circumstances of my childhood.

336
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:17,333
As a matter of fact I might've
made the entire thing up.

337
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,958
[KARASUMA]
You bastard.

338
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,291
When I was just a boy, an
assassin killed my father.

339
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,750
[KARASUMA grunts]

340
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,708
[REAPER] I wasn't particularly
torn up about it.

341
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,708
However, seeing the way his
killer moved, so swift, so sure,

342
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,083
it did give me something
to think about.

343
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:39,333
I said to myself:
what a beautiful skill!

344
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,166
I was captivated.

345
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,791
In that moment I knew:
Assassination is high art!

346
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,125
And the culmination
of that art?

347
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,041
[KORO-SENSEI gasps]

348
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,166
[REAPER]
Let me show you.

349
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,333
[KARASUMA groans]

350
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,416
[REAPER]
The Reaper's hidden scythe.

351
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,291
A simple ten-caliber.
Nothing fancy,

352
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,333
but its miniscule bullets pass
easily through muscle and bone

353
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,125
to pierce the aorta.

354
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:17,208
Every heartbeat widens the hole
just a tiny, little bit, until.

355
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:21,041
Well, I'm sure you get the idea.

356
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,833
A fine composite art,
you'll agree.

357
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,625
That's the province of a Reaper.

358
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,208
[REAPER]
What?

359
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,916
This is...

360
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,708
--[KARASUMA grunts]
--[REAPER groans]

361
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,833
[REAPER chokes]

362
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,208
[KARASUMA] Thought
there'd be a good opening

363
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,083
if I timed it just right.
Nice to see the Reaper

364
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,041
has the same weak spots
as everybody else.

365
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,041
His tentacle?! Seriously?!

366
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
I can slip at least one

367
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,833
through without injury
if I'm careful.

368
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,083
[REAPER] You faked me out
with tomato juice?

369
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,958
[KARASUMA] Sorry, friend.
You screwed up.

370
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:02,250
Messing with my students and
my colleague was a bad idea.

371
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,000
Wait!

372
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,666
Who else could conceivably
kill him if not me?

373
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,083
You'd be surprised

374
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,500
what a classroom full of
motivated kids can accomplish.

375
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,583
[REAPER groans]

376
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,791
[KARASUMA]
I think it's about time for you

377
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,791
to quit the killing game.
But hey, with all those skills,

378
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,416
they'll love you at the
unemployment office.

379
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,083
[STUDENTS gasp]

380
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,875
[KARASUMA] The man had skills,
make no mistake.

381
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,833
But he just put too much stock
in 'em.

382
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
The man who set him on this path

383
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,500
was a first-rate fool.

384
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,666
His talents might've
served him just as well

385
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,041
on the straight and narrow.

386
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,166
I suppose it all boils down
to the world we know.

387
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,958
How it shapes the value
we put on life.

388
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:48,875
[NAGISA grunts]

389
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:49,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes. Well said.

390
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,666
Wouldn't you agree, Miss Irina?

391
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,250
[IRINA]
Uh... H-Ha...

392
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,791
[OKANO, MAEHARA]
Uh...

393
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,208
[MAEHARA]
Where you think you're goin'?

394
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,416
[STUDENTS yelling]

395
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,750
[IRINA screams]

396
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,916
[IRINA growls]
Go on and do your worst!

397
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,416
Think I'm not ready?

398
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
You li'l punk bastards are one
rung below animals anyway!

399
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,375
The boys pent-up,

400
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,791
the girls all insanely jealous!

401
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,875
Now's your chance to set
all those emotions off

402
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,833
like sexual fireworks!

403
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,541
Do you ever listen to
what you're saying?

404
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,583
Just shut up and come back to
school tomorrow like always.

405
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,208
No more takin' off
for days at a time.

406
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,625
And besides, you never
finished that story.

407
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,625
Conning Arabian
royalty, remember?

408
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,583
You had the region
on the brink of war.

409
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,166
If you don't come back,

410
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,208
you can kiss your copy of that
French manga you lent me goodbye

411
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,166
"Boys Over Flowers?"

412
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,666
Okay, just to be clear:
you do realize

413
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,458
I was going to kill you all?

414
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,458
[TAKEBAYASHI]
I don't see the problem.

415
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,375
A fair amount of treachery
is to be expected.

416
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,958
These things come with the
territory, do they not?

417
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,541
[IRINA]
Ah...

418
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,000
[NAKAMURA] I mean, c'mon, if we
can't handle a foul-tempered,

419
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,208
backstabbing bitch,

420
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,208
we really wouldn't have
a lot of room to say

421
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,458
we're cut out to be assassins.

422
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,666
[KARASUMA]
They're right, y'know.

423
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,250
Huh?

424
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,958
--[STUDENTS gasp]
--[KORO-SENSEI] Ah-ha!

425
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,833
[IRINA gasps]

426
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,125
[KARASUMA]
For you.

427
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,083
And before you ask,
nobody put me up to this.

428
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,625
Consider it taken from a
vanquished enemy in your honor.

429
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,708
Happy Birthday.

430
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,041
Sorry if I'm a little late.

431
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,833
[IRINA] He just shoves it in
my face like a barbarian!

432
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,916
And it's not even
a proper bouquet!

433
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,791
Un-friggin'-believable!

434
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,375
I should give the man
a piece of my mind!

435
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,833
Yeah, I'll tell him off!

436
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,583
It's lovely.

437
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,958
[STUDENTS chattering]

438
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,041
[FUWA] I do believe we have
some potential, guys.

439
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,500
[HINANO] No fair, I already
called dibs on him.

440
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,791
[TOKA] Oh, sweetheart.

441
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mr. Karasuma?

442
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,000
A word before this situation
takes a turn for the racy?

443
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,208
Trust me, it won't.
What do you want?

444
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Today was almost tragic.

445
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,416
I don't want the children
embroiled in something

446
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,958
like this again.

447
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,833
I must insist on an environment
where they can kill safely,

448
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,541
immune to the intrigues of
madmen like the Reaper.

449
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,750
Right there with ya.

00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,125
[ONAGA] "Should any student
become collateral damage

Uh. Uh...

Safe to say you've taken a
liking to these children,

Mr. Karasuma?

456
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,708
They have the right to a
reasonable expectation

457
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,041
of safety, don't you think, sir?

00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,125
[ONAGA]
Fine. Condition accepted.

459
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,750
In any event, we, uh...

460
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,541
We're no longer seeking out
freelance help in these matters.

461
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,000
Too dangerous.

462
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,625
The time's come for
us to move forward

463
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,916
with the final
assassination project.

When you get right down to it,

465
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,125
I have no clue where
this class is headed.

[KARASUMA exhales]

467
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,625
[KARASUMA]
How's your arm?

468
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,541
[IRINA]
It's all right.

469
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,791
[KARASUMA]
Either way,

470
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:57,333
this world of ours...
is a good place to be.
