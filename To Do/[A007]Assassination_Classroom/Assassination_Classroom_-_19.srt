1
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:14,125
[NAGISA] Success was so close,
we could practically taste it.

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,833
But then it happened.

3
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,041
Koro-Sensei revealed his
Absolute Defense Form.

4
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,500
To make matters worse,
we were poisoned.

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:25,708
And with our mentor temporarily
immobile, the only real option

6
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,125
is to deal with the
culprit by ourselves.

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ten of your classmates are ill.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Two others have been left
behind to care for them.

9
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,125
That leaves you to
operate on their behalf.

10
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,750
You must sneak in, surprise
our mysterious adversary,

11
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,583
and steal the antidote!

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,541
It's too dangerous. Whoever the
hell this guy is, he's a pro.

13
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,250
This scenario's been planned
out to the last detail.

14
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,250
[KORO-SENSEI] Perhaps the
wisest course of action would be

15
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,083
to simply hand me
over, is that it?

16
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,250
--Unconditional surrender?
--[KARASUMA growls]

17
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
The choice is yours.

18
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,250
[ISOGAI]
Uh.

19
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,125
It's just... this is so hard.

20
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,166
[SUGAYA] I mean, look how
high we'd have to climb!

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,750
[IRINA] Ten to one they'd
plummet to their deaths

22
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,000
before getting halfway up.

23
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,000
[KARASUMA grunting]
It's not worth the risk.

24
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,125
We play by the enemy's rules.

25
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:14,000
Nagisa, Kayano.
Be on your guard.

26
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:18,333
[ISOGAI grunting]
C'mon. What're we scared of?

27
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,500
It's just a ledge. No big.

28
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,916
[OKANO] I know, right?
What have we been training for?

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
[HAYAMI]
Truth.

30
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,500
--[IRINA gasps]
--[KORO-SENSEI laughs]

31
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,083
[ISOGAI] Oh, yeah.
See? We can handle this!

32
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,583
Now, whoever's waiting at the
top may be a different story.

33
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:35,000
So, hey, Mr. K? It'd be
cool if you came with.

34
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,500
We need a commander.

35
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,625
Help us make this bastard pay!

36
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,833
Show him what it means
to mess with E Class!

37
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Look at that.

38
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,250
Clearly these are no
ordinary teenagers.

39
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,833
You have a 15-member
special forces unit

40
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,291
at your beck and call.

41
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,541
But I only count fourteen.

42
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,166
Probably because you
didn't count me.

43
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,041
[KORO-SENSEI] Quickly, my
friend. Time is of the essence.

44
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,875
[KARASUMA]
Mm...

45
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,000
All right, listen up! When
we reached the summit,

46
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,958
our objective is the
hotel's top floor.

47
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,708
This is a stealth infiltration,

48
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,500
so our best weapon is
the element of surprise.

49
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,000
I want you to use the same
hand signals and link-ups

50
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,958
we've been drilling in P.E.

51
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,791
The only difference here
is who we're targeting.

52
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,125
You've got three
minutes to memorize the map.

53
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,916
Know the terrain.
We commence in five!

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,791
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

55
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,875
[STUDENTS groaning, coughing]

56
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:18,750
[OKUDA] Time's running out.
Fifty minutes left.

57
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,625
Last one up's a rotten egg!

58
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,166
Oh, man. Okano moves
like a mountain goat.

59
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,375
Yeah. She smokes just about
everybody at this stuff.

60
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,041
I'm gonna say this knowing
it's perfectly obvious.

61
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,583
But getting old looks
like it sucks.

62
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,666
[IRINA] You idiot! I swear
on my life, if you drop me!

63
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Let no one say my

64
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,458
students don't have
exceptional balance!

65
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,541
[KARASUMA]
You're welcome.

66
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,958
I make 'em scale
the cliff out back.

67
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, I see. Well, that accounts

68
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,625
for their remarkable
proficiency at fly-boarding.

69
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,500
Ah! Holy crap on a spoon, will
you ladies stop gabbing already?

70
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,416
[RYUNOSUKE] So, uh,
remind me why Miss Bitch

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,916
felt obligated to come along?

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,541
[MEG] Yeah. She hates feeling
left out. Character flaw.

73
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:04,083
I wouldn't mind her so much if
she wasn't such a boat anchor.

74
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,500
Karma, wait! Slow down!

75
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,750
[KARMA]
Um, if you hadn't noticed,

76
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,291
we're kind of on
a schedule here.

77
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:14,416
Yeah, you've got a point.
Right, let's do it!

78
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,250
[KARMA]
Sharp rock. Careful.

79
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,750
[gasps] That was almost ugly.

80
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,333
--[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]
--[IRINA growls]

81
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,291
[IRINA] Don't even act like I
weigh that much! I'm a feather!

82
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,375
C'mon. Work them guns!

83
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,416
[NAGISA] I wonder...
If this guy knows about

84
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,208
Koro-Sensei, who in
the world could he be?

85
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,041
Ritsu, I want you to run a final
check on our infiltration route.

86
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,291
Right! Displaying
interior map now.

87
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,750
[RITSU]
Analyzing data.

88
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,916
All elevators require a unique
pass code for every floor.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,958
Stairs are the less conspicuous
option, but there's a catch.

90
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,208
Access doors are
arranged at odd angles

91
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,250
to each other across
respective foyers.

92
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,833
And the stairs themselves
cover a lot of ground.

93
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,500
We risk detection
at several points.

94
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,541
Cool, it's kind of
like a TV station.

95
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,000
What are you talking about?

96
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,291
Yeah. I hear they make the
layout confusing on purpose.

97
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,708
It's a precaution
against terrorists.

98
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,958
Ah! I learned something today.

99
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:22,333
Ironic bad guys love this sorta
place as a rendezvous point.

100
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,041
[RITSU]
Side door locked. One moment.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,875
[KARASUMA] Let's move.
There's not much time.

102
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,458
[ISOGAI]
Yes, sir!

103
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,750
Why the hell do they have so
many damn security guards?

104
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,791
That's a lot of guys for
all of us to sneak past.

105
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,250
[KARASUMA] Maybe it's best
if only one or two of us

106
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,791
take it from here? No, safety
in numbers; we don't know who

107
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,166
we're up against.
How should we do this?

108
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,875
Come on, people. What are we
waiting for? Let's just do it.

situation we're in right now?

There's too many of us!

it, ma'am. No harm done.

I'm performing on next week.

tune. I'll help me sober up.

you're in good hands.

169
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,041
--Let's go.
--[KAEDE] Mm.

170
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:42,333
[IRINA] That's right,
boys. I call the tune.

171
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,875
[KARASUMA] Okay. We've
cleared the lobby area,

172
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,291
so we should be in good shape.

173
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,458
If we're stopped, we'll
say we're staying here.

174
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,791
But, sir. We're a bunch
of junior high kids.

175
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,083
I mean, look at us, right?
We shouldn't be here.

176
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,666
Why not? There are
a lot of kids here.

177
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,791
Where do you think the offspring
of the ultra-rich stay

178
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,583
when they travel? That's right.

179
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,250
Only the best for daddy's
little prince or princess.

180
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,583
You should see
some of the antics

181
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,041
those trust-fund
brats get up to.

182
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Excellent! So, walk around

183
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,375
like you own the place.
Turn those noses up

184
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,833
and no one will be the wiser!

185
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,041
Let's practice.
Show me entitled!

186
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,958
[STUDENTS chatter]

187
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
There it is.

188
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,250
[KARASUMA]
Little too much there, gang.

189
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,333
Reel it in some.
Don't encourage them.

190
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,041
[KORO-SENSEI] It occurs
to me, we haven't no idea

191
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,583
what our enemy looks like.

192
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,625
Even posing as typical guests
we're vulnerable to attack.

193
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,833
Best marshal our efforts
toward staying vigilant.

194
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,000
[STUDENTS]
Whatever.

195
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,666
Thank you. I mean it.
You guys rock.

196
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,375
[OKUDA]
Oh. It's nothing.

197
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,041
[TAKEBAYASHI] Their
temperature's still rising.

198
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,791
If we don't get
the fever to break,

199
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,250
there's the possibility
of permanent brain damage.

200
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,583
[OKUDA grunts]
I'm on it.

201
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,958
Oh, um... Do you think
there's a chance this virus

202
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,458
could, I dunno, spread
to everyone on the island?

203
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,125
[TAKEBAYASHI] I don't
think it works like that.

204
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,958
We haven't come
down with symptoms.

205
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,208
[OKUDA]
Uh...

206
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,541
[TAKEBAYASHI] I believe
what we're dealing with

207
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,500
is spread orally. You'd
have to eat or drink after

208
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,166
someone already infected.

209
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,541
So the threat to random
bystanders is fairly low.

210
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,625
Which means the other team
shouldn't transmit it anyone.

211
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,791
[OKUDA] How would someone
specifically target us

212
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,666
for infection? When? Where?

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,583
People really think
we belong here.

214
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,041
They're not even
making eye contact.

215
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,083
It makes sense if you
think about where we are.

216
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,625
This place has a reputation.

217
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,875
Folks come here to
keep a low profile.

218
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,041
Heh. You know, at first
I was sure everybody here

219
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,333
would be a problem. But
getting the top floor's

220
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,250
turning out to be a lot
easier than we thought.

221
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,208
Glad Mr. K's with us, though.

222
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,833
Feels a lot safer with
him leading the charge.

223
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,041
[TERASAKA laughs]
Who said this was gonna be hard?

224
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,416
Hey, we're not there yet.

225
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,875
But, the clock's tickin'.

226
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,791
I say we switch off stealth
mode and storm the joint!

227
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,000

Huh.

[TERASAKA, YOSHIDA]
Huh?! Uh!

Oh, no! Mr. Karasuma!

[KARASUMA grunting]

237

[SMOG]
What gave me away?

238
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,291
I pride myself on being
as nondescript as possible.

239
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,541
Happens to be one of my
strongest selling points,

240
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,791
Little Miss Helmet Head.

241
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,291
I've seen you before.

242
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,666
You gave us those complimentary
drinks back at our hotel.

243
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,000
[STUDENTS gasp]

244
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:28,250
Tropical juice, compliments
of the house. Enjoy.

245
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,833
[NAGISA]
Whoa. She's right!

246
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,875
[FUWA] Why would you be here if
you worked for the other place?

247
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,125
It doesn't add up.

248
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,625
[ISOGAI]
Hey, yeah!

249
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,333
Ha! You've got a
good eye for faces.

250
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,958
So it was you that
got everybody sick!

251
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,125
Ha! Is that right?

252
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,083
I'd love to see your
evidence, Sherlock.

253
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,750
Tropical islands are a hotbed
for all sorts of icky viruses.

254
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,625
Uh, well...

255
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,125
[FUWA laughs]
And yet we were split up

256
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,083
and on different parts
of the island all day.

257
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,875
The only time we were
together was for dinner

258
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,458
on the shipboard restaurant.

259
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,500
But Mimura and Okajima bowed out
of dinner to work on the video,

260
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,958
and it just so happens they're
both under the weather;

261
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,500
which makes your free drinks
the only viable suspect.

262
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,750
And since you served them...

263
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,791
you, sir, are the
poisoner! Elementary!

264
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,166

265
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,583
That was seriously amazing!

It's like we're on television!

267
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,666
[FUWA] Hm. I credit my
taste in detective manga.

and whatever remains,

Ah, yes. Shonen Jump is
every sleuth's best friend.

271
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,916
The writer's go all out.

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,791
So, manga?

273
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,083
[FUWA]
Hm? Yeah. Why not?

274
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,458
Best way to read the classics.
Locked door murder mysteries,

275
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:38,291
vanished heirs, phantom
blackmailers. You name it.

276
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,458
I don't get the reference!

00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,958
Why is this suddenly
an advertisement?

Well, congrats on
uncovering my identity,

but I'm afraid it's
a little too late.

He's a poisoner, children.

284
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,708
An expert at the surreptitious
application of his craft.

285
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,916
Not to toot my own horn, but the
gas was a homemade concoction.

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,416
One whiff turns enemies
into statues.

287
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,125
Fresh air disperses the
runoff, so there's no trace.

288
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,583
Now, then.

289
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,625
I guess it's safe to assume
you're not here to trade.

290
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,625
I'll have to tell the big man
negotiations deteriorated.

291
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,250
Oh well, you win some,
you lose some.

292
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,125
[SMOG]
That was fast.

293
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,625
Crap. They're
blocking the exits.

First rule, coming
up against an enemy.

295
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,625
Scout the exits,
block their retreat.

296

Cut off their communications.

isn't that right, Mr. K?

[KARASUMA]
Sorry, pal.

299

You were a tad too quick
to show us your true colors.

300
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,750
You should've kept quiet and
reported us to your boss.

[SMOG] Hmph. You can
still speak, huh?

First rule when up against
numerous enemies.

303
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,875
Cut off the head,
and the body dies.

incredible strength.

00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,958
What about now makes it
feel like summer vacation

337
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,166
all of a sudden?

338
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Because my students

339
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,625
are acting independently of me.

340
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,333
That's what summer's
about, really.

341
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,583
Extended breaks from the routine
of school foster autonomy.

342
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,041
You learn to think
and act on your own.

343
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,291
The prognosis for anyone else in
this predicament would be grim.

344
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,500
But you have the tools to
meet your foes head-on.

345
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,708
This is an
assassination vacation.

346
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,291
It's up to you to
make the most of it.

347
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,500
[GASTRO] Start with
primo seafood stock.

348
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,791
Don't skimp on the green
onions or the minced garlic.

349
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,458
Then, just a dash of steel!

350
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,000
[GASTRO]
It's how you soup-up a gun.

351
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,875
See, when the broth seeps
down the barrel, it gets cold.

352
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,083
[VOICE ON PHONE chuckles]

353
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,291
Well, that makes
my blood curdle.

354
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,000
I assume the gun's
not on safety?

355
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,791
Eh. I know what I'm
doin'. Just relax.

356
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,416
It'll still shoot
when the time comes.

357
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,958
A good firearm's gotta have the
personality of a gourmet meal.

358
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,291
Just the right balance of
the four cardinal flavors:

359
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:24,250
savory, sweet, sour, and fatal.

360
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:28,333
You have personality. Are your
friends as odd as you are?

361
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,958
[GASTRO]
Don't judge.

362
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,166
When you pull off as
many jobs as we have,

363
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,750
you develop a few quirks.

364
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,583
In this industry it's a sign
of being worth your salt.

365
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,166
Take Smog. He's all about
the signature poisons.

366
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,958
Built a world-class lab
to feed his obsession.

367
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,791
You gotta admire that
level of dedication.

368
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,916
Quite. What of your
other associate?

369
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Grip, was his name?

370
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,208
[GASTRO]
Yeah...

371
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,958
Grip. That one's a prime
cut of grade-A weirdo,

372
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,458
even by our standards.

373
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,333
[TERASAKA]
Mm.

374
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,791
[SUGAYA]
Um, okay.

375
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,208
Why's that dude just
standing out in the open?

376
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,916
Gives me the heebie-jeebies.

377
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,166
Yeah. I'm definitely picking
up a kill-or-be-killed vibe.

378
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,875
Well, to be honest, mostly kill.

379
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,458
[KARASUMA] A scenic walkway
with an unobstructed view.

380
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,625
So much for surprise attack,
or safety in numbers.

381
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,125
Dammit. What I wouldn't
give for a real gun.

382
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:39,125
Who'd have known I needed to
pack heat for a trip like this?

383
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,833
[STUDENTS yelp]

384
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,916
[GRIP]
Boring.

385
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I can hear your
footsteps, people.

386
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,833
I wanted to kill
someone interesting,

387
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,666
not a bunch of amateurs.

388
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,791
Ain't your squadron leader
supposed to be some kinda

389
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,791
special forces dick, or
did he get bagged? Hun.

[KARASUMA whimpers]

391
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,708
Hun. Tough break.

392
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,500
Guess the gas got to him before
I had the chance, hun.

393
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,041
Smog live, or did they
kill each other at

394
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,916
the same time, like men?
Hun, lemme see ya.

395
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,541
[TERASAKA] He cracked the
freaking window with his hand!

396
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,750
[KIMURA]
Yeah... That's not all.

397
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:14,750
[FUWA] Nobody's got the nerve to
say it, but the way he talks.

398
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,500
Dude. What's with all
the stupid "huns?"

399
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,166
[STUDENTS] Why does he always
say what we're thinking.

400
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,041
Hun. It's how samurai's talk.

401
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,041
Read someplace they
used to do it all the time

402
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,291
to sound intimidating.

403
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,333
I like the way it plays.
Makes me feel badass.

404
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,125
[NAGISA]
Okay. So, he's a little off.

405
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,416
[GRIP]
This is actually the first time

406
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,916
I've tried it out, so no big.

407
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,583
Hun, I might decide to drop
it once I've killed you.

408
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,375
No one else's heard me talk
this, so it'd be a clean slate.

409
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Your hands, sir.

410
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,125
Are those the only "tools of the
trade" at your disposal?

411

as pie. Someone pats me down,

still snap their neck.

me I can crush a skull.

Funny thing 'bout
bein' this good.

00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,750
The better you get at sendin'
folks to the sweet hereafter,

the more you crave usin'
you gifts for somethin'

Hm.

430
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,583
[KARMA] You seem fairly
average for a professional.

431
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,333
And I can break glass,
too, if that's all it takes.

432
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,958
What I wouldn't do is
call in reinforcements

433
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,541
as an opening move. But
then I'm not especially

434
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,250

bunch of amateurs."

[KARASUMA, ISOGAI gasp]

440
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Karma typically enters a fight

441
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,750
with his chin angled upward.
It shows disdain.

442
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,416
He's literally looking down
his nose at his opponent.

443
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
This is different.

444
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,666
[KORO-SENSEI] True, his words
may be dripping with arrogance,

but his eyes are
staring daggers.

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,875
He's alert, locking
his opponent's gaze.

447
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,416
Finals were quite a blow
to his precious ego.

448
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,250
But I suspect he's
taken the lessons

449
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,333
of that failure to heart.

450
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,666
[KARMA]
Heh.

451
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,541
[GRIP] Hmph. All right. Put your
money where your mouth is.

452
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,541
[KORO-SENSEI] Go at him with
everything you've got, Karma!

00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,125
You're going head-to-head...
with an adult!
