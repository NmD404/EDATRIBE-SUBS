00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,541
[KUNUDON]
Surprise!

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,625
[KIDS]
Hey! It's Kunudon!

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,875
Hiya, kids! Are you
ready for this?

4
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,875
[KIDS]
Sir, yes, sir!

5
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,625
Look sharp, it's finals!

6
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,333
The most important
test of the year!

7
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,000
I hope you've studied.

8
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,625
Here at Kunugigaoka Academy,
grades are everything:

9
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,125
and we all know what happens
to boys and girls who fail.

10
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,208
[KIDS]
They become gutter trash!

11
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,666
Speaking of. How to we think
E Class will do on the finals?

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,583
[KIDS]
They'll bomb! Hooray!

13
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,041
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

14
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
The basics, you've got down pat.

15
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,291
No question there.

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,416
And if your performance First
Semester is anything to go on,

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,041
I believe we can
reasonably expect

18
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,333
your scores to sky rocket!

19
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,208
So what's the deal?
Will it be like last time?

20
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,916
Either we place in the top 50
or you pack it up and go?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Nope! With midterms,

22
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,541
I've come to realize my focus
on rank was too shortsighted.

23
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,916
Phooey to that.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,750
Far better that each of you
have individual goals

25
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,083
tailored to affect
personal academic growth.

26
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,000
Therefore, I've devised
the perfect target:

27
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,708
an objective customized
to your needs as assassins.

28
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:07,958
[KORO-SENSEI gasps]

29
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Not to worry, Terasaka my boy!

30
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,500
Even you can do well
if you believe it!

31
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,500
[TERASAKA groans]

32
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Now, then.

33
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,458
You'll recall Shiro
revealed to us

34
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:20,750
that the loss of a tentacle
results in diminished speed.

35
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,375
One less appendage

36
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,791
and already the integrity of my
doppelgängers is compromised.

37
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,500
Note that several
of them have now become

38
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,666
childhood versions
of yours truly.

39
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,583
[NAGISA]
'Kay. Seems logical.

40
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Lose another, and presto!

41
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,541
Even more child-clones
thrown into the mix!

42
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,458
Along with fretful parent-clones
struggling to make ends meet.

43
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,875
[NAGISA]
Now it's getting a little sad.

44
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Lose another.

45
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,500
And the father-clone
has walked out,

46
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,083
leaving the poor,
beleaguered mother-clone

47
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,125
to fend for her latchkey
brood however she can.

48
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,208
[NAGISA]
Ugh. Brutal.

49
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
The main take away here, class,

50
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,500
is that each tentacle
kerplooied represents

51
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,666
ten percent reduction
in my agility.

52
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,333
Which brings me to
my proposition.

53
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,416
Those of you who get the
highest scores on your final,

54
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,583
and or the best ranking
in each individual subject,

55
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,833
are vouchsafed the right

56
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,125
to obliterate exactly
one tentacle a piece.

57
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,666
[STUDENTS gasp]

58
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,125
[KORO-SENSEI] This is how we
do finals here, boys and girls.

59
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,458
This is the
Assassination Classroom!

60
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,875
Ask yourself.

61
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,625
Are you prepared to inch
ever closer to the grand prize?

62
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,125
[STUDENTS gasping]

63
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,666
[NAGISA]
I've gotta hand it to him.

64
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,583
The one thing Koro-sensei
does better than anything,

65
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,208
is motivate.

66
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,791
[ASANO] Frankly,
your suggestion appalls me.

67
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,875
I'm an educator. I've no vested
interest in seeing E Class fail.

68
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,666
[IRINA] Uh. Well,
obviously, I can see that.

69
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,875
It's this stuffed shirt
who needs convincing.

70
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,125
[ASANO]
Hm. Let me be perfectly clear.

71
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,833
The chief aim
of this institution

72
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,875
is to foster student autonomy.

73
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,375
Our students determine their
own level of achievement.

74
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,625
My role is ancillary.

75
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,416
I do nothing. Only monitor.

76
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,833
[IRINA]
Hard to trust a man

77
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,041
who throws ten-dollar
words in your face.

78
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,291
That crap about "automony." Ugh.

79
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,583
Yeah, well. All we can really do

80
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,583
is hope none of the tricks
he pulls this time are new.

81
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,166
Hey. Since Koro-sensei's
rewarding their test scores

82
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,625
with tentacle-takeouts,
we need to get in there.

83
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,625
What do you think about me
teaching Phys Ed for a while?

84
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,166
C'mon, pweeze!
I could give them an edge!

85
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,041
[KARASUMA]
Stick with Language Arts.

86
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,375
Stop that.

87
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,083
A tentacle for each top
score earned on our final.

88
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,041
I know! It's exciting, huh?

89
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,291
[KARMA]
That's rare.

90
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,916
You're really fired up
about this, aren't you?

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,750
Of course! I know science
backwards and forwards.

92
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,833
This is my shot. I finally get
to contribute to the cause!

93
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,750
What's cool is everybody's
good at something on the test.

94
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,041
Koro-sensei'll lose so many
arms he won't have a prayer!

payback's a bitch?

we can actually go head-to-head.

[SUGINO laughs]

103
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,083
[SUGINO] Doesn't sound like you
hold out a lotta hope for me.

Listen, somethin'
you should know.

105

Right now, as I'm
talkin' to you,

the Main Campus conference rooms

doing an independent study hall.

108

It's being led by
a bunch of geniuses.

We are the best and brightest.

Alas, storm clouds are moving
in, ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,958
casting their pall over
our brilliance from below.

136
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,750
We know E Class
attempted to scratch

00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,625
and bite their way into the top
fiftieth percentile on midterms.

138

Now that finals are upon us,

measures must be taken to
drive the Untouchables out.

slices through.

150
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,375
Mr. President,
about question three.

151
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,375
Ah. That is a puzzler.

152
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,791
Try again. Be sure to
complete the square first.

153
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,000
You know the axis equation.
X equals A, so.

154
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,875
Oh! Of course!

155
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,708
[SHINDO] You gotta figure
high scores are a given

156
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,333
with this bunch.

157
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,791
The head honchos have ambition,
charisma, reputations to uphold.

158
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,708
And above all, the desire
to keep you down.

159
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,875
You know this.

160
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,833
If you place the particle
after this word,

161
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,166
the meaning of the sentence
changes completely.

162
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,583
But you wanna be careful.

163
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,458
Pronouns and how they're
used should change

164
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,125
depending on the speaker.

165
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,083
Come on! This
isn't rocket science!

166
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,541
I've seen babies more
eloquent than you.

167
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,791
This single innovation
affected fundamental change

168
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,583
across the whole field
of information theory.

00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,000
Are you even listening?

170
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,125
Don't assume this
won't be on the exam!

171
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,666
What's the matter,

172
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,541
This is O-Chem. Memorization
is your only hope! Ah!

173
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,875
Asano has perfect
scores in every subject.

174
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,125
The other four are experts, man.
You can't be messin' around.

175
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,125
It's serious business.

176
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,375
They're hardcore.

177
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,291
They don't want you guys
back on the Main Campus.

178
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,166
It's a point of pride.

179
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,791
Thanks for the tip, Shindo.

180
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,916
They don't have
to worry for now.

00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,875
We're not looking to go back.

182
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,833
It's kind of personal. I'd
explain, but I really can't.

183
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,583
Let's just say, uh...

184
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,416
Beating A Class is
in our best interest.

185
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,875
We're fighters. You know this.

Hm. More power to ya.

00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,583
Just remember, this is your
fight, so leave me out of it.

00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,500
[OKAJIMA]
Yeah...

189
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,041
[KAEDE]
First in every subject?

190
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,541
[NAGISA laughs nervously]

191
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,708
[ISOGAI]
Hey, guys! Wait up!

192
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,208
[NAGISA]
What's goin' on?

193
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,000
[ISOGAI] You wanna hit the books
at the Main Campus library

194
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,833
tomorrow after class?

195
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,125
I reserved us a spot.

196
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,458
Actually, been holdin'
on to this for a while.

197
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,250
Normally, we're dead last
on the waiting list,

198
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,875
so, this little miracle
is like a platinum ticket.

00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,916
--[NAGISA, KAEDE] Count us in!
--[NAKAMURA] Me, too!

Look at how fired up they are.

201
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,541
It was certainly worth putting
my tentacles on the line.

202
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,750
[GAKUSHU]
Yes, sir.

203
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,958
As instructed, I've raised
the bar considerably

204
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,791
with regards to
A Class's test scores.

205
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,875
I trust that you're satisfied?

206
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,791
[ASANO]
Sadly... no.

207
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,666
I require results, young man.

208
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,291
A status report in and
of itself is meaningless.

209
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,000
You know as well as I,

210
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,875
excellence is not rewarded
so much as expected, son.

211
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,000
If you and your classmates
rank in the top 50

212
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,416
and secure the top spot
in all subjects, you pass.

213
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,666
[GAKUSHU] All to keep the E
Class upstarts firmly in line.

214
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,666
I understand the principle
all too well, forgive the pun.

215
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,583
Why you cling to it
is somewhat lost on me.

216
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:24,083
Yes, granted, their grades
may be on the upswing,

217
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,416
but they can only get so far.

218
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,458
They won't trump their
betters. It's unthinkable.

219
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,500
Don't let that confidence
be your undoing, my boy.

220
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,208
Things change.

221
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,500
The scales can tip in favor
of the rabble in an instant.

222
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,916
The elite do well to take heed.

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,833
Those at the top must
mind their balance.

224
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,291
An excellent point
very well made.

225
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:52,291
I'll see to it that we get
results, sir. You may rest easy.

226
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,000
One more thing.
A simple question.

227
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,875
Not asking as a student,
but as your son.

228
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,375
Oh, dear. I do hope you don't
expect special treatment.

229

[GAKUSHU]
No, no, wouldn't dream of it.

[GAKUSHU] You haven't
raised an idiot, father.

235

Any fool can see the
idlers have more claim

236
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,416
to your attention these days
than in years previous.

237
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,750
Hard as it is
to give credit to,

238
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,125
I just can't shake the idea

239
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,708
that you're involved
in something shady.

Rumors of strange happenings.

Eye-witness accounts of

of junk food.

suggestive disembodied whispers.

[ASANO]
Huh.

246
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,000
What gives? Mass hallucinations,
or something else?

247
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,625
[ASANO]
If I didn't know better,

248
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,666
I'd say you were digging for
something to use against me.

249
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,291
Why on earth would I do that?

250

But you could hardly
blame me if I were.

I am your protégée.

like a well-trained dog.

One day the master might
find himself on the leash.

[ASANO laughs]

258
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,041
[ASANO] Or the dog might find
himself in thrall to his master

[ARAKI] Well, look at that.
It's the E Class crew.

00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,083
Why even bother? This
place is wasted on you.

their total subjugation to

Upon observance
of full compliance,

Sounds like a

Not bad.
