1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,625
[NAGISA]
End-of-term exams were over.

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:13,250
Victory was total, but no sooner
had we gotten the results

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,791
than the principal
showed up,

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,166
Koro-sensei's walking
papers in hand.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,166
The man challenged his
rival to a one-sided game.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,125
Come now, Koro-sensei.

7
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:27,083
Validate my ideology and be
the cornerstone of my vision.

8
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,208
[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,125
[ASANO]
Mm?

10
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Alright-y, then!

11
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,583
Open, solved, and closed!

12
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,541
Fortunately, I just so happen
to remember more or less

13
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,333
which questions are on what page

14
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,083
in this particular
series of books.

15
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,125
Math was the only trouble spot.

16
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,875
That one's been loaned
out to a student

17
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,500
for so long I'd forgotten.

18
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,708
[TOKA, OKANO gasp]

19
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,375
You know these books
backwards and forwards?

20
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,500
A rather remarkable coincidence.

21
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, not just these.

22
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,000
I've committed all of Japan's
test materials to memory.

23
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,000
You say no moving out
of the blast radius

24
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,666
until the given
problem is solved?

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,166
Very well.

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,291
That little caveat is nothing
to a passionate educator.

27
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,833
I'm sorry, sir.

28
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,083
You sincerely thought you'd
gotten the better of me, huh?

29
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,416
My, my.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,916
A-Class' crushing defeat
must have you in a tizzy.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,375
I'm afraid this
one-dimensional stratagem

32
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,333
may wind up getting
the better of you.

33
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,625
There we have it.
The last book.

34
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,458
Your turn, I believe.

35
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:38,958
What does it feel like,

36
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:43,166
staring your own
demise in the face?

37
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,458
They say one's life
flashes before one's eyes.

38
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,250
What do you see, Principal?

39
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,916
What's flickering by in
that exemplary brain?

40
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,666
[NAGAI]
Sir?

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,708
[MORI]
Sir?

42
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,083
[IKEDA]
Mr. Asano?

43
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:37,833
[NAGISA] Two monsters,
teaching at the same school.

44
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:41,166
One to atone for his strength.

45
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,791
The other to atone
for his weakness.

46
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,666
[ASANO]
A noble effort, Ikeda.

47
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,166
Maybe next time. Hey.

48
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,583
A deal's a deal. So, study
and behave yourself today.

49
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,125
Uh. Aw, dang! No fair, sir.

50
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,541
You're totally a superhuman
or something.

51
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,250
Hey, Mr. Asano?

52
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,750
Why does a beast like
you start a cram school

53
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,333
in an abandoned shack like this?

54
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,333
I'd have thought you'd graduated
from some big college

55
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,916
with loads of credentials
and stuff.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,875
No offense, sir, but it seems
like a waste of talent to me.

57
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,083
Not to mention how far
we all gotta hike.

58
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,333
Come now, Nagai.

59
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,625
Nothing is for naught
in this world of ours.

60
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,875
This mountain is
wonderfully scenic.

61
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,000
And the hike is good exercise.

62
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:23,625
[NAGAI whimpers]

63
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,666
What about funds?

64
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,416
Bet this place is in the red.

65
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,458
Don't worry, Mori my dear.

66
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,291
My stock portfolio more than
makes up for the deficit.

67
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,583
I don't mean to brag, but I'm
something of a financial wiz.

68
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,666
As you can see,

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,416
this month I'm happily
in the black.

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,041
[STUDENTS]
He's superhuman!

71
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,416
So why does someone
so awesome

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,375
get into teaching
in the first place?

73
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,958
If you wanna make
us that awesome,

74
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,625
you've got your work
cut out for you.

75
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,875
Don't overthink it.

76
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,958
All I ask is you try
to be good students.

77
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,458
Remember, the bar is set
differently for everyone.

78
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,125
But your enthusiasm
is an asset, Ikeda.

79
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,041
As is Mori's cleverness.

80
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,458
[MORI laughs]

81
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,666
[ASANO] And of course
Nagai's diligence.

82
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,208
You see?

83
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,625
Each of you has your very own
strength, but you're right.

84
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,333
I do have my work
cut out for me.

85
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,083
To properly teach you,

86
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,208
I'm going to need to
have all your strengths

87
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,291
combined and more.

88
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,125
[STUDENTS sigh]

89
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,500
[ASANO]
The private cram school

90
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,458
was off to a promising start.

91
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:21,000
Three students of my
inaugural term were ideal.

92
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,958
In the peace and quiet
of the mountain

93
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,000
I could shape their minds
to my heart's content.

94
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:30,166
A model education.
My dream come true.

95
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,541
Ow!

96
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,083
Aw c'mon, don't be a baby.
I gave you a heads-up.

97
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,541
Next time move.
What're you, a snail?

98
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,750
Uh. We just got out.

99
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,625
Really? Why're you so rowdy?

100
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,250
Whatever. Basketball
stars can't just study!

101
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,125
Gimme a break.

102
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,375
I've got tons of pent-up energy!

103
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,833
[ASANO] You don't say?
A basketball star?

104
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,541
Heh. Fine dream.

105
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,000
[STUDENTS sigh]

106
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,875
[ASANO] How 'bout you and I
play a little one-on-one?

107
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,666
[IKEDA]
U-Uh. Yeah, right!

108
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,833
Like I could win
against a superhuman!

109
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:58,750
Good point.

110
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,375
I have one or two abilities

111
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,958
you haven't cultivated in
yourself just yet, huh?

112
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:03,833
[IKEDA grunts]

113
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,375
[ASANO]
Interesting.

114
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,541
Your classmates could just as
well say the same about you.

115
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,250
[STUDENTS gasp]

116
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,125
[IKEDA]
I, uh, sorry, Nagai.

117
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,666
[NAGAI]
Oh, it's cool.

118
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,666
[ASANO]
Everyone has faults.

119
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,500
We all have to grow
into our strength,

120
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:23,708
but also come to understand how
it affects those around us.

121
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:28,625
I put everything I had into
my daily lesson plans.

122
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:33,541
In just one year the students
were coming along brilliantly.

123
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,041
[ASANO]
What's this?

124
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,833
[MORI] A Kunugi oak-leaf
tie clip! Neat, huh?

125
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,916
[NAGAI] We pooled our
allowances together to buy it.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,708
[IKEDA] Pro'ly peanuts
compared to what you make

127
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,958
off your stock portfolio.

128
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,166
Now, now.

129
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,416
Just because it's grown
a thousand percent--

130
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,666
[STUDENTS]
Wow.

131
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,625
You seriously could've
kept that to yourself.

132
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,166
I... I'll cherish this.

133
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,291
Ha, ha. Hey, you got us into
our first-pick schools!

134
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,875
Yeah! No way we could've
done it without you!

135
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,833
When I grow up, sir.

136
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,500
D'you, mind if I come
and visit some time?

137
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,250
[ASANO]
How time flies.

138
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,625
They'd grown into such
wonderful students.

139
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,333
[ASANO]
Parents saw my track record.

140
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,416
Soon, children enrolled
from all over.

141
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,625
Three short years later, my
little cram school was booming.

142
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,291
[ASANO]
Ah! How long has it been?

143
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,625
Ikeda! Great to hear from you!

144
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,291
[IKEDA]
Long time no see!

145
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,166
Things are going
good for you, huh?

146
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,625
[ASANO] Can't complain.
What can I do for you?

147
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,708
Oh, nothin' really.

148
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,291
I just wanted to catch up
and see how you were doin'.

149
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,125
[ASANO]
That's very kind. Thank you.

150
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,708
Uh, ah, what about you?

151
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,333
Not out there causing
trouble, I hope?

152
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,833
[IKEDA]
Ha! No sir!

153
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,041
I'm just a regular Samaritan
now, thanks to you!

154
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,583
Anyway, you sound busy.
I should let you go.

155
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,708
Let's do dinner sometime!
Your treat, of course.

156
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,166
Later!

157
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,166
[ASANO] I have business in that
neck of the woods next week.

158
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,125
Perhaps I'll stop by.

159
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,125
[ASANO gasps]

160
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
[NEIGHBOR A]
They said it was a suicide.

161
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,458
[NEIGHBOR B] Some horrible
older boy on his team

162
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,916
drove him to it, apparently.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Used to beat him up,
and take his money.

164
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,625
Poor thing couldn't
take it anymore.

165
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,958
[NEIGHBOR A]
That's awful!

166
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,125
And he'd been such a sweet
boy since junior high.

167
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,708
[NEIGHBOR B]
Still, though.

168
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,708
I mean, you'd think the young
man would stand up for himself.

169
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,500
[ASANO] What on earth have I
been teaching these children?

170
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,500
How to be good students?
What was I thinking?

171
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,916
Does dying make you
a good student?

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,833
I have an obligation
to make them strong,

173
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,125
or this will have
been for nothing.

174
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,166
But then, what is strength?

175
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:07,125
[ASANO] Until I have the answer,
I have no right to teach.

176
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,750
[ASANO] From there,
things changed quickly.

177
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,541
I learned all sorts
of strengths.

178
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,083
I sweet-talked the men who
drove my student to suicide,

179
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:22,875
put them on the road toward a
disastrous gambling addiction.

180
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,916
That's how I fine-tuned my
brainwashing techniques.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,708
Soon, I opened another school,

182
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:34,250
and the old campus building
that symbolized my weakness

183
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,708
would stand as a
lesson to others.

184
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,791
Strong. I wanted to
make them strong.

185
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,583
Strong young men and
women who could survive,

186
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,791
sacrificing others if need be.

187
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,625
[ASANO]
To that end,

188
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,666
I would need more
funding, more staff.

189
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,208
If it could serve my
goal, I would use it.

190
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:02,791
All to educate, to
breed true strength.

191
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,708
[ASANO]
Yet here I stand,

192
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,500
abandoned by the strong
and the weak alike.

193
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:12,333
The only thing before me,
certain death.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
What will it be, Principal?

195
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,750
Will you open the
last book, or fold?

196
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,166
You may be an exceptional
human being, sir,

197
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,208
but taking a grenade blast
won't end well for you.

198
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,208
[YOSHIDA] This was your
idea, 'case you forgot!

199
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,458
But hey it's no big deal,
just gracefully admit defeat.

200
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,791
And just so you're aware,

201
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,583
fire Koro-sensei all you want,

202
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,000
it doesn't make any
difference to us.

203
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,166
Don't get us wrong,

204
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,666
it'll be sad to leave
this place behind.

205
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,791
But whatever comes, we're
going right along with him.

206
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,333
[ISOGAI]
That's right!

207
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,625
Even if we gotta run away from
home, or hole up in a cave!

208
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,458
We'll keep this class going.

209
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,541
It's not over until March!

210
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,541
[ASANO] Why have I
indulged them this far?

211
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:57,000
E-Class has been a thorn
in my side all year.

212
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:02,583
Such presumptuous, bald-faced
defiance. Such a stain.

213
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,583
[ASANO]
Koro-sensei.

214
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Eh?

215
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,500
[ASANO]
You may well destroy the Earth.

216
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,625
Even so, as far as my
educational philosophy,

217
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,125
it would make absolutely
no difference whatsoever.

218
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,166
[gasp]

219
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,833
[ASANO]
Whether now, or in March,

220
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,833
death will come for
us all in the end.

221
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,958
[ASANO]
Strength won't matter.

222
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:30,083
My students won't suffer
alone, and, in a way,

223
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,458
my vision will have
been fulfilled.

224
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:43,875
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]
Somebody forgot about my molt.

225
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,250
[ASANO]
Your once-a-month trick?

226
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,833
And why precisely would you
not use it on yourself?

227
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,666
[KORO-SENSEI] Because I was
saving it for you, silly man.

228
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,125
I suspected if I won, odds were
fairly good you'd think nothing

229
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,708
of blowing yourself to bits.

230
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:03,375
[ASANO] But, how could you
be so sure of what I'd do?

231
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,333
[KORO-SENSEI] Because,
we have a lot in common.

232
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,666
[ASANO gasps]

233
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,375
[KORO-SENSEI] We're both
stubborn education fiends,

234
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,916
willing to forfeit our lives

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,083
for the privilege of
molding young minds.

236
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,625
I hope you won't mind,

237
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,291
but I took the
liberty of speaking

238
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,000
to your old cram
school students.

239
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,916
I wanted to get their
impressions of you as a teacher.

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,041
Imagine my surprise
upon learning

241
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,208
that the idea of teaching you
exemplified 12 years ago

242
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,750
is identical to mine.

243
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,250
Though as far as students are
concerned, I've been lucky.

244
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,666
E-Class is a marvelous
proving ground.

245
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,833
There are a fair number
of students, you see,

246
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,166
and they all share the
same predicament.

247
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,625
These boys and girls
work as a team,

248
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,833
unafraid to ask for help
or to hold each other up.

249
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,250
And if I may point out,

250
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,083
credit for conceiving of and
implementing this class,

251
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,166
goes first and foremost to you.

252
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,916
[KORO-SENSEI] There you have it.
Don't you see, sir?

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,291
You've been abiding by the same
vision you began with all along.

254
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,416
Incidentally, I'm the only
thing this knife can kill.

255
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,916
The taking of human life plays
no part in our approach.

256
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,333
You and I are one and
the same, Principal.

257
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,291
We don't teach killing,
we teach life.

258
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,583
So why not stay
true to ourselves

259
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,000
and continue down this road?

260
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,791
[ASANO]
Playing outdoors is fine, Ikeda.

261
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,833
Playing hooky? I don't think so.

262
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,333
Heh. I'm an athlete.
I can't be cooped up.

263
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,875
Right? Gimme a break!

264
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,750
I propose a game.

265
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,375
Once every school day.

266
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,333
You have my permission
to try and attack me.

267
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,458
Manage to get a hit and I'll let
you skip class for that day.

268
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,208
[IKEDA] You serious?!
You'd really let me do that?!

269
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,375
[ASANO]
Sure.

270
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,625
You gotta deal, sir!

271
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,958
If I hit ya, I get to
ditch! No take-backs.

272
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,916
You have to see it through!

273
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,500
My philosophy's always
been right on the nose.

274
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,208
Students have to be strong.

275
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,708
My successes over the
past 12 years prove this.

276
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:01,416
And, I suppose, so long you
acknowledge its proper function,

277
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,791
I see no reason why
you and E-Class

278
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,291
can't remain here as you are.

279
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:11,583
[KORO-SENSEI laughs] Still too
proud to admit defeat, I see.

280
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,625
[ASANO]
Oh, and do mind if pop by

281
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,125
and try my hand at killing
you once in a while?

282
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Be my guest.

283
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,291
Always happy to oblige
a worthy rival.

284
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,250
That pristine façade
is crumbling.

285
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,333
You've lost. I can
tell by your face.

286
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,958
Something I can help
you with, Asano?

287
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,166
No, no. Just thought I'd
come by to cheer you up.

288
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,750
That and show you
my wounded face.

289
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,791
Perhaps some monetary
compensation

290
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,625
would help ease the pain a bit?

291
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,916
[ASANO] Ha, ha. Feel free
to take me to court.

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,166
Though of course,
don't expect to win.

293
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,375
You'll never win
against me, Asano.

294
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,083
No matter how strong
you think you've become.

295
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,291
[GAKUSHU] And what makes
you so certain of that?

296
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,916
Because I don't intend
to ever stop growing.

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,125
As a teacher. Or as a father.

298
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,500
[HINANO]
So, yeah. About that reward?

299
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Huh? Oh, yes!

300
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,708
In return for ranking
in the top 50,

301
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:17,416
I promised to share
a critical weakness.

302
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,916
Well, children,

303
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,875
I have in fact very little
power. I'm designed for speed.

304
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,625
When at a perfect standstill,

305
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,500
one of my tentacles can be held
down even by a single person.

306
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,291
Hey, wait, if eight of us
teamed-up on you all at once--

307
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,166
You're saying we could
essentially paralyze you, right?

308
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,791
[OKAJIMA] Man, if we
had known that sooner,

309
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,291
this would have
been easy as pie!

310
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,666
[MAEHARA]
This is bunk!

311
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,666
You only told us 'cause you
knew it'd be impossible!

312
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Not having any luck?

313
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,916
The trick is to pretend you're
hand-fishing for slime eels.

314
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,875
[STUDENTS]
A drama festival?!

315
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,375
[MAEHARA] But we're about to
take high school entrance exams.

316
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,708
[ISOGAI]
I know, I know.

317
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,916
I did complain to
the student council.

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,583
Asano fired back, though.

319
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,000
[GAKUSHU]
What's the problem?

320
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,666
Memorizing lines and stage
directions quickly

321
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,333
is good mental exercise.

322
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,583
It's part of the curriculum.

323
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,333
Besides, you'll figure
something out.

324
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,125
You always do.

325
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,916
At least he gave us respect.

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,083
[KARMA] You could be
the leading lady, Nagisa!

327
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,166
Just, y'know,
throwin' it out there.

328
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,958
[NAGISA] Why do I get a
bad feeling about this?

329
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,875
[KANZAKI]
What about Kayano?

330
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,916
[KAEDE]
Huh?

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,750
The preschoolers adored you.

332
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,958
You had 'em on the
edge of their seats.

333
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,291
Um, I don't know if that--

334
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,541
[TERASAKA] That ain't gonna
play in junior high.

335
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,958
People need to identify
with the main character,

336
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,041
and you're too short.

337
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,458
[KAEDE]
Shut up!

338
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,958
I'd rather be in charge
of handling props anyway.

339
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,000
[SUGINO, NAGISA]
Uh...

340
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,291
Right.

341
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,041
So then for our main crew,
Mimura will direct,

342
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,458
and Hazam will write, naturally.

343
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,375
[KIRARA]
Mm?

344
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,458
[ISOGAI]
Thoughts on our leads?

345
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
You know, I'm available.

346
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,458
[OKAJIMA] You're supposed
to be a state secret!

347
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,125
[MAEHARA] This is our play!
No adults allowed!

348
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,541
[KORO-SENSEI] But I have the
makings of a phenomenal lead!

349
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,208
What if this is my
one and only shot?

350
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,333
You can't deny me the limelight!

351
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,916
All right, then.
I have a play.

352
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,958
One where you can be the
lead without upstaging us.

353
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,333
Everybody's happy.

354
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,666
[KORO-SENSEI laughing]

355
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,500
[ISOGAI]
Great. Sounds like plan.

356
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,166
[MAEHARA] Let's put on a
show the likes of which

357
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,083
those main campus
chumps have never seen!

358
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,458
[buzzing]

359
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,375
[TANAKA]
Okay. E-Class goes on next.

360
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,958
Heh.

361
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,375
I say we eat loudly and sneer
through the entire performance!

362
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,916
[KANZAKI]
A peach.

363
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,375
[BOTH]
Uh...

364
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,291
The greatest medical
minds are baffled,

365
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:38,458
but by some strange miracle
there's a baby growing inside.

366
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,958
[RITSU] Upon hearing this,
the old man's eyes lit up.

367
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,541
"Excellent," he thought.

368
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,458
"This peach will bring riches!"

369
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,625
[SUGINO] What a stroke of
luck! A miracle indeed!

370
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,541
People will pay good money
to see this peach!

371
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,041
They'll come from far and wide!

372
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,125
I'll be richer than any king!

373
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,500
Mm?

374
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,291
[RITSU]
Divorce papers.

375
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,833
The old woman had been thinking
of leaving him for some time.

376
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,750
His greed, choice of words,

377
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,208
and complete disregard for
child welfare decided her.

378
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,875
At long last, she's had enough
of his selfish nature.

379
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,583
The marriage was over.

380
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,500
For good.

381
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,500
[RITSU] The rift between
them was as wide

382
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,791
as the river in which
she'd washed his clothes

383
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:23,041
for over 30 years without
thanks or acknowledgement.

384
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,541
The atmosphere at home had
become as dry and as suffocating

385
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,583
as the smoke from
a mountain wildfire.

386
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,291
The peach rightfully
belongs to me.

387
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,166
I am the head of this household,
do you understand woman?!

388
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,833
I'll decide how to
divide our property!

389
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,125
Uh?!

390
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,916
[RITSU]
Lawyers.

391
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,333
[TAKEBAYASHI]
We'll be representing your wife

392
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,375
from here on out. Any
and all communication

393
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,666
must be handled through
our office directly.

394
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,208
Regarding the miracle peach.

395
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,375
Since this marriage has
technically been on the rocks

396
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,458
for over a decade, we're
well past the mandated

397
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,291
cut-off date for carving
up your combined assets.

398
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,500
Oh, and fair warning: our client

399
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,250
is seeking reparations
for emotional distress.

400
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,250
[RITSU] For 30 years she'd
born her husband's cruelty,

401
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,791
his disinterest.

402
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,750
Not only had he consistently
failed to bring home the bacon,

403
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,333
the old woman possessed
incontrovertible evidence

404
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,500
of his infidelity.

405
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,333
In court, he wouldn't
have a prayer.

406
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,708
In desperation he hired a band
of thugs to strong-arm her.

407
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,541
But, being incompetent, they
were hauled off by police.

408
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,708
The old woman shed her
misery and started over.

409
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,416
She gave the miracle peach pride
of place in her lovely new home.

410
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,125
Life was sweet, as it
had been in her youth.

411
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,541
Happiness and serenity
surrounded her.

412
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,416
[KANZAKI]
Hooray!

413
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,916
[RITSU] A dog, a monkey,
and a pheasant.

414
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,541
An unlikely trio, trained
to attack human beings,

415
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,541
devouring their food with
the abandon of wild animals,

416
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,083
in thrall to their
wicked master.

417
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,500
All-consuming greed had
driven the old man

418
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,458
to unspeakable evil.

419
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,500
Perhaps the fabled demon-haunted
island of Onigashima

420
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,625
is none other than
the human heart?

421
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,958
The miracle peach will
bear its child very soon.

422
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,125
Will it, too, be prey to demons?

423
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,333
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]

424
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,958
[TANAKA]
Uh...

425
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,541
[STUDENTS chattering]
Great. My appetite's ruined!

426
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,791
[KIRARA chuckles] Say what you
will about my writing style,

427
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,708
words leave an
unmistakable mark.

428
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,625
[KORO-SENSEI] I did it!
I transported them!

429
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,416
What the hell did I
just sit through?

430
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,375
[ASANO] He has my school
in his grip as surely

431
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,791
as if his very tentacles were
wrapped around the campus.

432
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,458
Even so, carefree
though they seem,

433
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,916
E-Class won't get a fairy
tale sort of ending.

434
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The Ministry of Defense
has big plans, and yet,

435
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:56,208
based on my experience
of such things,

436
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,333
the only person qualified to
predict what may happen next,

437
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,125
is me.

438
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,541
I can't help but wonder,
Koro-sensei.

439
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:08,875
Can one be a teacher amidst
the coming storm?

440
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,208
[KUNUDON]
Surprise!

441
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,458
[CHILDREN]
Not needed, Kunudon!

442
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,333
[ASANO] Now that he's
served his purpose,

443
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:51,041
Kunigigaoka's beloved mascot has
been transferred to E-Class.

444
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,541
[KUNUDON] Huh? Hey!
What are you lookin' at?

445
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,125
Yeah, that's right:
I used to be somebody!

446
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,291
[CHILDREN]
Yay for unemployment!

447
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,458
Bye-bye, Kunadon!
