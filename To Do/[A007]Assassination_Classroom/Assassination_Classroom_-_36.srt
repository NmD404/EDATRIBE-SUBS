00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,458
[NAGISA]
How 'bout that play, huh?

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,625
Talk about fun!

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:14,000
Sugino gave the
performance of a lifetime.

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,250
[KIRARA]
Didn't know you had it in you

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
to make such an evil face.

6
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,625
The whole time all
I could think about

7
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,958
was how it must've
looked to Kanzaki.

8
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,291
I was hideous.
She probably hates me now...

9
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,125
That's not true, silly!

10
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,833
I... actually thought it was
cool you could be so believable

11
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,416
--in the role.
--[SUGINO] Seriously?

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,291
Wow! Maybe I oughtta retire from
baseball and pursue acting!

13
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,875
[KORO-SENSEI] No need
to pick one or the other,

14
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,500
pitchers need to act.

15
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,666
Ah, what a pleasure
to see unexpected talent

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,291
on full display!

17
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,458
[NAGISA]
Aw, man.

18
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,750
That's gonna be
a pain to clean up.

19
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,250
[KAEDE] Yeah, I was cleaning
up and my hand slipped.

20
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,708
Sorry.

21
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,000
These are the beads we used
for the river in our play.

22
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,583
I got 'em on loan from
a prop supply store.

23
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,875
No worries.
We'll tackle it together.

24
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,083
Thanks, Nagisa!

25
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,583
I didn't wanna get in
the way of everybody's

26
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,708
assassination plans,
so, y'know...

27
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah-ha.

28
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,375
I was wondering where the pair
of you suddenly disappeared to.

29
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,750
[KAEDE chuckles]

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,083
[KORO-SENSEI] I'm glad to be
of assistance if needed.

31
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,583
Oh. That'd be wonderful, sir!

32
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,666
[KORO-SENSEI whooping]

33
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,750
[NAGISA]
He's got his back to us.

34
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,291
Defenseless.

35
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,541
Of course, if it
were really that simple,

36
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,541
we wouldn't have had to
work so hard this past year.

37
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Something smells fishy...

38
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,708
Oh, during the school festival,

39
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,250
we used this place
to smoke fish.

40
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,416
[KAEDE]
So many different school events.

41
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,875
Uh-huh. No kidding. Feels weird.

42
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,541
Once this is cleared up,
they'll all be behind us.

43
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,833
Yeah. Lot of
memories though, huh?

44
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,000
Makes me think of the first time
Koro-sensei showed up here.

45
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,458
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]
You children were

46
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,125
complete amateurs back then.

47
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,125
I know--I couldn't get
anywhere near you.

48
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,708
Neither could Sugino.

49
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,375
[KAEDE]
Remember how when Karma came,

50
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,833
he grilled you about
Koro-sensei and even then,

51
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,541
nothing he tried worked?

52
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,541
[NAGISA]
Or how jealous I was of Itona?

53
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,416
I was so sure he was
gonna get him first.

54
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Whoa-ho!

55
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,041
Another of Okajima's hidey
holes, apparently.

56
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,375
[KAEDE]
This class let me do so much.

57
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,375
Stuff I'd have never
done on my own.

58
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,583
Not to be ungrateful,
but this is kinda sad.

59
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,416
First of all, I can't even swim.

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,958
When my mind's fixed on
something, I just keep rolling.

61
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,041
I guess.

62
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,666
That's what it is
to be an assassin.

63
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,791
Not even your close friends
get to see your true blade.

64
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,916
[KAEDE]
I'll get you.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,208
It's only a matter of time.

66
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,750
[KAEDE]
As for my true blade...

67
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,583
[KAEDE]
...I have more than one.

68
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,250
Didn't you notice?

69
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,958
[STUDENTS gasping]

70
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:50,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Whoa! A pitfall!

71
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,750
Oh, Koro-sensei.

72
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,666
How I love you!

73
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,375
Please die...

74
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,333
Kayano... You...

75
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,125
[KAEDE]
I watched closely.

76
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,041
Saw different assassins
try and fail.

77
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,458
But the one thing they used
that seemed most effective...

78
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,333
...was a simple pitfall.

79
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,250
[KORO-SENSEI grunting]

80
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh no! An anti-me pool!

81
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,625
I have to get above ground
quickly before it's too late!

82
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,416
[KAEDE]
Pretty good, right?!

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I know exactly how
your tentacles move.

84
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,166
After all, I studied you
for over a year.

85
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,791
From the best seat in the house!

86
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,083
[KORO-SENSEI groans, grunts]

87
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,166

[NAGISA]
Koro-sensei, are you all right?

93
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,791
What in the world?
What just happened?

94
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,333
Are those what I think?

95
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,416
[MEG] Since when does
Kayano have tentacles?

96
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,875
Aw, dammit.

97
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,083
And I attacked you
with everything I had.

00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,041
You're slipperier
than I thought.

99
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,583
Clearly.

Oh, yeah. Sorry.

00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,500
FYI: My real name's not Kaede.

I'm Aguri Yukimura's
little sister.

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,375
[KORO-SENSEI gasps]

105
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,875
[KAEDE]
You get it now, don't you?

106
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,750
Murderer.

107
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,625
Wait, Yukimura?

[gasps]

109
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,416
[NAGISA] When the girl
we all thought we knew

110
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,916
suddenly dropped the act,
her face looked cruel--

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,500
like it belonged
to someone else.

112
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,916
[KAEDE]
Oh well.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,083
No point cryin' over spilt milk.
I'll just have to reset.

Let's give it another whirl
tomorrow, Koro-sensei.

Don't worry:
I'll tell you where.

00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,125
[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]

117
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,041
[KAEDE] Now that we've
fought tentacle-to-tentacle...

118
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,041
...I'm feelin' pretty
good about this.

119
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,791
Like I can kill you.

120
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,291
It's unthinkable.

121
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,166
If she grew those tentacles
without a maintenance regimen,

122
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,541
the pain would've been
beyond hellish.

123
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,583
There's no way she could've
powered through it--

124
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,958
not with a straight face.

125
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,291
Yeah, whatever.

126
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,583
I'm stuck on her being
Yukimura's little sister!

127
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,250
She, uh, used to be our
homeroom teacher, right?

128
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,875
Oh, man. Unbelievable.

129
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,375
I thought I recognized
Kayano from somewhere.

130
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,083
Seeing her with her hair down
and that evil look on her face

131
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,041
jogged my memory.

132
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,083
Do you remember Haruna Mase?

133
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,666
The acting prodigy who could
disappear into any role

134
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,625
they threw at her?

135
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,000
She turned her back on
the business years ago.

136
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,041
She looks and acts
so different now.

137
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,583
I-I didn't even make
the connection!

138
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,541
[NAGISA]
Which one is real?

139
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,041
The girl or the actor?

140
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,000
[SHIRO] When I first
set foot in the classroom,

141
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,875
I was surprised
to say the least.

142
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,250
Who knew an unexpected
reunion awaited me?

143
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:21,208
Aguri Yukimura's younger sister,
a.k.a. Akari Yukimura,

144
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:26,458
ingratiated into the enemy camp
under a false name.

145
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,541
I realized who she was
and investigated.

146
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:33,958
As suspected,
she was hiding tentacles.

147
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,125
Not only did she understand
how they worked

148
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,000
and how to use them,
she gleaned the knowledge

149
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,333
in a remarkably short time.

150
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:45,333
As tenacious
as she is intelligent.

151
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:49,333
Able to maintain the facade
under unimaginable pain.

152
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:54,333
Simply put, her mental fortitude
cannot be overstated.

153
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,541
Nor can her considerable
acting prowess.

154
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:03,041
Day after day, no one could
guess her murderous intent.

155
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,833
She has a gift
for assassination.

156
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,750
And in E Class,
that means something.

157
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,541
[KAEDE]
I was on my way to see her.

158
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,833
We had a lot
of catching up to do.

159
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,708
[KAEDE] The talent agency
had put my career on hold.

160
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,833
People stopped noticing
me on the street.

161
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,375
Where's this freedom
been all my life?

162
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,958
I'm almost tempted
to apply for a day job!

163
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,000
[KAEDE whimpers]
What just happened...?

164
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:13,000
[KAEDE] I was small, so I could
crawl through the rubble easily.

165
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,208

what was waiting for me...

Wake up! Aguri, please!

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,250
[KAEDE sobs]

172
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,500
[KAEDE whimpers softly]

173
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,833
[KAEDE]
That's when I saw them.

174
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,958
On the ground next to her.

175
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,083
Vials of tentacle seed.

176
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:17,250
I don't know why I felt
the need to take one with me.

177
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,875
I guess... some part of me
understood if I was going to

178
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,833
avenge my sister's death,

179
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,333
the stuff in that vial
would be necessary.

180
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,541
"The Weaponized
Tentacle Prototype

181
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,458
is compatible with
human physiology.

182
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,125
Provided a strict
regimen is adhered to,

183
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,250
otherwise, the pain
is excruciating."

184
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,625
[KAEDE]
Nothing to it.

185
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,166
On principle, no different
than being an actor.

186
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,625
When my mind's fixed on
something, I just keep rolling.

187
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,166
[ONO] I believe this is
the first instance

188
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,416
we've seen of someone
passing the entrance exam

189
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,541
out of the blue.

190
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,208
Forgive me.
Kaede Kayano is it?

191
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,750
Yes. Thank you very much, sir.

192
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,458
[KAEDE]
Forged ID papers.

193
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:06,041
The name of a bit part I'd
played in a made-for-TV movie.

194
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,625
And, presto, I was in.

195
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,625
[KAEDE] Excuse me, but I
understand this school has

196
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,500
a special class for students
with behavioral issues?

197
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,250
[crash]

198
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,625
[KAEDE]
Or is that just a rumor?

199
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,666
[KAEDE] If my instincts were on
point, in Kunigigaoka's E Class.

200
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,125
I'd find the monster
that murdered my sister.

201
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,166
Oh, Akari.

202
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,833
You're so lucky you're cute.

203
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,833
What I wouldn't give to have
taken after mom's side

204
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,166
of the family.

205
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,208
[KAEDE]
You're cute, too!

206
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,416
Please! When it comes to looks,

207
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,875
hair color's all we
have in common.

208
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,916
[KAEDE]
So I dyed it.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,708
Why the monster
wanted to take over

210
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,875
my sister's teaching position,
I had no earthly idea.

211
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,333
But... unless I wanted him
to walk away scot-free...

212
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,666
[KAEDE whimpers]

213
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,791
[KAEDE] ...I had to
stay in character--

214
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,041
play the part to perfection.

215
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,166
Hello. You must be the new girl.

216
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,250
[KAEDE] Mm-hmm! Just
transferred here today!

217
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,833
[KAEDE]
Your hair's really long.

218
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,708
Yeah.... Eventually
I wanna cut it short,

219
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,958
but for now I don't have
much of a say.

220
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,333
[KAEDE] Even if I don't
stand out, I'll be watched.

221
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,916
Let's play around with
the casting a bit.

222
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,333
Someone else can be
the main character.

223
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,458
Kaede needs to blend in
with the scenery.

224
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,166
There you go!
Now we look the same!

225
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,333
Kaede Kayano!
Pleased to meet ya!

226
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,250
[KAEDE]
The tentacles spoke to me,

227
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,500
asked me what I wanted to be.

228
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,000
[KAEDE]
"That's easy," I said,

229
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,541
"an assassin."

230
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:58,000
I choked back the pain,
hid my burning hatred.

231
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,083
All the while silently
picking my moment.

232
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,208
[KAEDE]
If I die, so what?

233
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,250
Revenge will have been worth it.

234
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,583
[SHIRO]
Just as I thought.

235
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,500
You don't heed instructions.

236
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,625
Did I or did I not
warn you to wait

237
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,625
until my preparations
were complete?

238
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,416
[KAEDE] What makes you
such an authority?

239
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,166
Look at the piss-poor shape
you left Itona in.

240
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,625
[SHIRO] This attitude of yours
may well be an indicator

241
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,916
of metabolic imbalance.

242
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,166
If you continue to ignore the
dangers of untamed tentacles,

243
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,666
it's only a matter--

244
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,625
Mind your own business.

245
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,583
I can kill him
without your help.

246
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,833
Understood?

247
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,708
[SHIRO chuckles]
So mercilessly cold...

248
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,000
And to your own family.

249
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,041
I'll kill you!

250
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,958
You'll die like
the animal you are!

251
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,541
--Give me back my mother now!
--[KARMA] Uh-huh.

252
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,083
--Give her back to me!
--Definitely Kayano.

253
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,458
[MAEHARA]
That's crazy.

254
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,875
It's like she's a split
personality or something.

255
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,458
[SUGINO] That'd explain how
she's been able to keep

256
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,958
her identity a secret.

257
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,583
[NAGISA] Kayano might've
always done her own thing,

258
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,000
but still, we all adored her.

259
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,166
[NAGISA]
Why was she so close to me?

260
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,708
Was I part of her cover?
Did my bloodlust disguise hers?

261
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,291
Now that I think about it,

262
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,458
the whole pudding thing
was just a ruse.

263
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,833
We'd have gotten suspicious
if she hadn't contributed

264
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,791
something to the cause.

265
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,041
[NAGISA] Turns out the harmless,
ditzy Kayno we all thought

266
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:40,500
we knew isn't even real.
It's all been a performance.

267
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,291
Excuse me, sir.
Why did Kayano, well...

268
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,375
Why did she call you a murderer?

269
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,333
[ISOGAI] Does it have to
do with your past?

270
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,208
[KIMURA] Talk to us,
Koro-sensei, please.

271
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,875
What happened? We trust you.
So just be honest with us.

272
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,333
He's right. We deserve
to know the truth.

273
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:04,166
Please. It's unacceptable
to stay quiet.

274
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,500
You understand.

275
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,916
Unless you tell us something,
we're done here.

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,250
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is.

277
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
I don't blame you.

278
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,125
Very well, then. It's time
my past came to light.

279
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,958
I'll tell you on one condition:

280
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,541
You hear my
big secret as a class.

281
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,625
Meaning of course,
that we must find Kayano.

282
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,208
[cell phone vibrates]

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,750
So you showed up.

284
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,916
Great! Let's end this!

285
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,583
[KORO-SENSEI sighs]

286
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,000
I gave you your name.

287
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,666
Practically makes me
your mother.

288
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,666
What's the old joke?

289
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,541
I brought you into this world,
I can take you out of it?

290
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Listen to me.

291
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,375
It's too dangerous for you
to keep using those tentacles!

292
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,666
They have to be removed;
your life is in jeopardy!

293
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,500
[KAEDE] What are you
babbling about?

294
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,250
They're in peak condition!

295
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,583
You're not gonna break
my composure with a bluff.

296
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,583
Kayano.

297
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,875
I thought we were your friends.

298
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,500
But this whole time,
you were acting?

299
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,916
All the stuff we've done?

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,166
What we've been
through as friends?

301
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,750
It's what I do.

302
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,750
I'm an actor. I act.

303
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,125
Watching Nagisa take
that beating from Takaoka.

304
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,625
It took everything
I had not to step in.

305
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,458
When I was kidnapped by thugs,

306
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,208
kicked in the ribs
by the Reaper,

307
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,041
I was pissed enough
to have killed them.

308
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,750
But I maintained.
Never once let the mask slip.

309
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,500
Poor, pitiful Kayano.

310
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,708
The frail little girl
everybody loved.

311
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:59,166
You did all this
for your big sister?

312
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,583
[KAEDE]
Koro-sensei murdered her.

313
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,791
She never hurt anyone.

314
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,166
All she wanted to do was teach.

315
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,875
How she used to
brag about all of you.

316
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,833
[AGURI] Come on, now.
Put your minds to it!

317
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,458
Apply yourselves and E Class
can open up a world

318
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,250
of possibilities!
You can do it!

319
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,958
That's all fine and good,
Miss Yukimura,

320
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,083
but... we gotta do
something about your shirts.

321
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,000
[gasps] What are you
talking about?!

322
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,750
This style is hot right now!

323
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,125
Kayano, we... We know.

324
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,166
We only had her a
couple of weeks.

325
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,333
It was March of last year.

326
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,833
But that was long enough
to see that she was

327
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,041
a passionate teacher.

328
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,083
Could Koro-sensei
murder someone?

329
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,625
I mean, like, actually
in cold blood?

330
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,166
I just don't see it.

331
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,250
Nothing we know about him
remotely jibes with that!

332
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,208
Yeah! Maybe you're wrong.

333
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,333
Maybe you don't have the whole
story yet! Give him a chance!

334
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,375
C'mon, Kaede you've
been here for a year.

335
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,583
You should know what kind of
person he is by now.

336
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,666
I get it.

337
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,041
We have to deal
with him eventually.

338
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,625
But you can't think
he murdered your sister.

339
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,958
This shouldn't be about revenge.

340
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,875
That's not how this works.

341
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,583
Feel like you're overheating,
but the nape of your neck

342
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,041
is ice cold?
It's a good indication

343
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,083
your metabolism is shot.

344
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,291
Which means those tentacles have
just about taken the wheel.

345
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,000
You fight in that condition,
they'll sap your life force.

346
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,250
Trust me. I have experience.

347
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,375
Worst-case scenario, you die.

348
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,125
Shut up. I don't recall
asking you for a prognosis.

349
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,541
[BOTH gasp]

350
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,583
[KAEDE]
Every weapon comes at a price.

351
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,166
But if it's the least bit
usable, you polish it.

352
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,500
Guess who taught me that,
Koro-sensei?

353
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,916
If my body overheats,
so much the better!

354
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,375
I'll use it to my advantage.

355
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,458
Flaming tentacles can
do a lot of damage!

356
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
No! I must insist--

357
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,291
[STUDENTS scream]

358
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,166
See? I'm in the best
shape of my life.

359
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,458
Every cell in my body's
on high alert.

360
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,416
All your weaknesses
are mine to exploit.

361
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,958
Stop it, Kayano!

362
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,458
This is insane!
Even if you win, it's suicide!

363
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,125
If I've learned anything
in this class,

364
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,416
it's that no target is worth
sacrificing yourself for!

365
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,875
Aw, that's so sweet of
you to be concerned.

366
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,333
Still, though.

367
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,875
If you think I care...

368
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,291
...you're wrong.

369
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,291
[KAEDE] When my mind's fixed on
something, I just keep rolling!

370
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,041
[laughs]

371
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:29,166
[KORO-SENSEI grunting]

372
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,250
[MIMURA]
Holy crap...

373
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,416
[OKAJIMA]
It's like a meteor shower!

374
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,041
[NAGISA] This is the real
Kayano, not the character.

375
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,250
This is the person
behind the mask.

376
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,291
[KAEDE laughs]
Ripped off a chunk!

377
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,458
Look at that,
it's still all wriggly!

378
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,333
She's been in boss-battle mode
for maybe 15 seconds

379
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,125
and already the tentacles have
gotten a foothold on her brain.

380
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:51,250
[KAEDE laughs] Aw, what's
the matter, Koro-sensei?!

381
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,250
The headaches aren't
an issue anymore!

382
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,333
Wow! This pain's
starting to feel good!

383
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,041
[ITONA] If she's that far gone,
it's too late.

384
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,208
Whether she gets her revenge
on Koro-sensei or not,

385
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,875
another few minutes of this...

386
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,125
...she's dead.

387
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,416
[gasps]

388
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,708
[NAGISA]
Kayano...

389
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,125
Is this...

390
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,583
Is this really how you wanted
the assassination to go?

391
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,583
Come on! It's high
time for you to die!

392
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Kayano...

393
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,041
Kill you! Murderer!

394
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,583
Kill you! Kill you!
Die, die, die, die...!

395
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,916
[KAEDE]
Koro-sensei...

396
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,916
Please...

397
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,625
Save me...
