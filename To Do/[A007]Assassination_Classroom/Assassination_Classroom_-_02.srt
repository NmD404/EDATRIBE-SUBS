00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hmm...

2
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,583
The moon is all they're talking
about in the States, too.

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,708
Does no one care
about anything else?

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,291
[SUGINO]
There he is.

5
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,416
Chillin' out back before first
bell, not a care in the world.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,833
Readin' a Hawaiian newspaper
casually picked up

7
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,666
from Hawaii on the way here.

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,875
Nice. Good work, Nagisa.

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,375
Thanks. I owe ya one

10
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,750
[NAGISA] 
Hm. You're welcome.

11
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,875
Best of luck, Sugino.

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,250
Heh. Ten billion big,
here I come.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,250
[NAGISA]
We are assassins.

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,541
Our target...

15
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,125
...is our teacher.

16
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Top of the morning to you!

17
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,500
[BOTH gasp]

18
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,916
[KORO-SENSEI] It's usually
considered polite to reply.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,541
[gasping]

20
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,000
[NAGISA]
Uh... Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

21
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,083
Good morning, sir.

00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
A baseball embedded with

23
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,875
government-issue
anti-me BB's? Creative!

24
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,708
Points for choosing a method of
delivery

25
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,000
quieter than the pop
of a standard air rifle.

26
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,666
Unfortunately...

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,791
Once airborne, the weapon
gave me nothing but time.

28
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:20,625
Ample opportunity, in fact, to
organize a defensive maneuver.

29
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,750
[KORO-SENSEI] A quick visit to
the equipment room, and, ta-da!

30
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,625
I had, pardon the pun,
a handy solution.

31
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:29,958
[BOTH groan]

32
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Tick-tock, children.

33
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,750
Graduation will be here
before you know it.

34
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,791
Right, then. Homeroom,
if you would please.

35
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,625
[SUGINO sighs]
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:45,125
[SUGINO] Damn it. Well,
so much for my fastball.

37
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,666
Big shock there, I guess.

38
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,750
It was a good throw.

39
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:52,041
[SUGINO sighs]

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,250

"April is the cruelest month,

41
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,375
breeding lilacs

42
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,000
[NAGISA]
What are the facts?

43
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,416
This guy vaporized
70% of the moon

44
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,583
and plans to destroy
Earth in March.

45
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,250
He can do it, the issue
is how to stop him.

46
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,500
Oh, and for some reason,
before ending the world,

47
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,750
he wants to teach a bunch of

48
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,833
last-chance
Junior High nobodies.

49
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,958
The Ministry of Defense was
quick to make the most

50
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,583
of the situation.
They gave us a mission:

51
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,416
Kill our teacher,
save the planet.

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,333
We're onboard because
the reward money is crazy.

53
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,375
Ten billion crazy.

54
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,125
Hey, hey, Nagisa.

55
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,750
I hear that you
and Sugino's plan

56
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,333
didn't go so well this morning.

57
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,750
[NAGISA]
Hmm... You could say that.

58
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,583
Seems like it's really
bothering him, too.

59
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,083
[SUGINO sighs]

60
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,625
[KAEDE] What's there to get
all bent outta shape about?

61
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,666
I mean, it's not like any of us
could've done better.

62
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
...cultural familiarity has...

63
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,708
[NAGISA] The Japanese word for
"unkillable" is "korosenai".

64
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,250
[NAGISA] So we've named our
unkillable teacher...

65
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,166
"Koro-sensei."

66
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,208
[gasps]

67
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:24,875
Huh...?

68
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:25,916
[SUGAYA gasps]

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Sugaya!

70
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,333
[KORO-SENSEI] Not a bad
likeness, I'll give you that,

71
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,000
but I'm a little hurt
by the jaw line.

72
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,250
You don't have a jaw!

73
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,000
[school bells chime]

74
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,125
[KORO-SENSEI] That's lunch,
people. If you'll excuse me,

75
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,791
I have some important off-campus
business to attend to.

76
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,291
[ISOGAI]
Tofu from China?

77
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Actually...

78
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,833
I'm catching a ball game
in The Big Apple.

79
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:48,375
Ciao!

80
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,416
[STUDENTS yell]

81
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,791
He sure knows
how to make an exit.

82
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,250
I know! That thing is startin'
to get on my nerves.

83
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,625
[HINANO]
Talk about unfair.

84
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,708
We're stuck here while
he flies all over the world,

85
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,375
he could at least
bring souvenirs.

86
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,000
[MEG] Think about what he'd
probably bring back:

87
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,500
are you that hard-up
for a mortar shell?

88
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,875
I just sayin' an
exotic snack would be nice.

89
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,750
It's not like he has to
sneak 'em though customs.

90
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,125
You've dedicated a lot of
thought to this.

91
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,250
So, hey, what's
New York's chief export?

92
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,250
I dunno, booze?

93
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,791
Sucks we're not drinking age.

94
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,000
What about something greasy
from one of those food trucks?

95
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,166
[OKAJIMA]
Man! New York girls are hot!

96
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,416
Especially the blondes!

97
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,875
Oh, yeah!

98
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,708
[OKAJIMA] Damn! Can you
imagine if one came back

99
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,083
with him as a transfer student?

100
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,583
[ISOGAI]
Oh. Mr. Karasuma.

101
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,083
Children. Any progress on
killing the tentacled menace?

102
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,916
Define progress.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,375
[STUDENTS sigh]

104
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,958
[KIRARA]
This is E Class, yo.

105
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,208
You gotta lower
your expectations.

106
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,958
All due respect, sir.
He's too quick.

107
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,625
[MIMURA] Like so quick you
can't even see him sometimes.

108
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,291
[OKAJIMA] You said so yourself:
he tops out at Mach Twenty.

109
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,625
How do we kill
something like that?

110
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:52,708
[KARASUMA]
I don't know.

111
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,833
But you kids had
better figure it out.

112
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,416
Seriously?

113
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,708
[KARASUMA] Seriously.
You're the only hope we've got.

114
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,583
[gasps]

115
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,083
He teaches willingly.

116
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,458
Putting himself in
the line of fire by choice.

117
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,958
[STUDENTS groan]

118
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,833
[CROWD cheers]

119
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,750
[KARASUMA] If we allow that
creature to live,

120
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,500
come March, Earth will be
totally annihilated.

121
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,833
And, in case you need a
reminder of how powerful he is,

122
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,708
take a look at what's
left of our moon.

123
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,000
That'll be our planet in a year.

124
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,208
In short, he's too
dangerous to take lightly.

125
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,541
That's why this classroom
is the last stand

126
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,875
between mankind and extinction.

127
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,708
[NAGISA] If you give a group of
outcasts and misfits like us

128
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,416
a chance to play hero.

129
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,625
Things are gonna get
interesting, to say the least.

130
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,500
Can we do it?

131
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,083
It's a tall order,
especially given everything

132
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,833
we don't know about our target.

133
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,416
We can't even say why
Koro-sensei wants to blow up

134
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,166
the planet in the first place,

135
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,833
let alone what he gets
out of teaching us.

136
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,250
[indistinct chatter]

137
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,625
[SUGINO sighs]

138
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,916
[KORO-SENSEI] There you are.
This may come in handy.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,541
Thank you, Koro-sensei.
Wait, what-what are you eating?

140
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
A coconut I grabbed in Hawaii.

141
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,000
Care for bite?

142
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,250
You shouldn't eat the husk.

143
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,125
[KORO-SENSEI] Solid throw
yesterday, by the way.

144
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,708
Hah. Yeah, right.

145
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,208
Says the guy who could probably
throw a ball faster and farther

146
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,166
on accident than I'll
ever be able to on purpose.

147
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Are you on a team?

148
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,458
I used to be.

149
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
And you're not any longer?

150
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,416
They, uh...

151
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,125
They kicked me off.

152
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,250
Teams are only for
D Class and above.

153
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,458
We're here to get
our grades back on track.

154
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,125
Extra-curricular stuff
like sports isn't allowed.

155
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Sounds suspiciously

156
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,458
like discrimination.

157
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,625
[SUGINO] I'd have
gotten booted either way.

158
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,958
C'mon. You saw my pitch.

159
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,916
I'm too slow.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,541
I never struck anyone out,

161
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,333
wound up bench-warming
most of the season.

162
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,958
I was so depressed I got
just as slow hittin' the books.

163
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,166
That's why I got packed off
here to the mountain.

164
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Sugino?

165
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,541
[SUGINO]
Hm?

166
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,750
[KORO-SENSEI] May I give you a
friendly piece of advice?

167
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,541
Need to make sure
these get turned in.

168
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,708
[NAGISA]
That's weird.

169
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,708
What do they have to talk about?

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,833
Holy crap. He's ticked off
he tried to kill him!

171
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,166
[gasps] And now he's
literally up in arms!

172
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,958
Please, sir! Don't do this!

173
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:41,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Huh?

174
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,125
He was just doing
what he had to!

175
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,416
The deal was you couldn't
hurt any of us!

176
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,083
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]
There it is.

177
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,708
I thought I recognized
that pitch style.

178
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,875
You were imitating
major-league pitcher Arita.

179
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,333
[SUGINO gasps]

180
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,666
[KORO-SENSEI] That's right.
These tentacles don't lie.

181
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,291
[KORO-SENSEI] Your shoulders
are significantly less

182
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,833
flexible than your
idol's, I'm afraid.

183
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,666
What exactly are
you trying say?

184
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
That the famous Arita fastball

185
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,000
that you were trying
so hard to copy...

186
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,083
...is simply never
going to be your thing.

187
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,250
[SUGINO gasps]

188
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,416
[NAGISA gasps]
That's not fair.

189
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,541
You don't know. How could you?

190
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,208
That's ridiculous.
You can't just...

191
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,333
Look, don't worry about it.

192
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,083
[NAGISA]
I get it, why even bother?

193
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,333
Hey, we're just E Class, right?

194
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,625
We're just a bunch of losers
and lost causes!

195
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,083
[sighs]

196
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
You misunderstand me.

197
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,458
I base this entirely on
firsthand experience.

198
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,958
First-through-eighth-hand
experience!

199
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,041
[BOTH]
What is wrong with you?!

200
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
I even got his autograph!

201
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,458
[NAGISA] You actually
asked him for an autograph?

202
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,500
After you assaulted him?!

203
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Unbelievable, right?

204
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,666
--He was so nice about it!
--[SUGINO] He's right, though.

205
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,125
--I almost died!
--Some of us are born

206
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,125
with talent,
some of us not so much.

207
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Talent is relative.

208
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,000
Arita's wrists and elbows
aren't as flexible as yours.

209
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,708
Like I said, these
tentacles don't lie.

210
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,333
Given enough time and practice,

211
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,125
you could become just as
good a player, if not better.

212
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,583
And besides, why settle
for being an imitation?

213
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:24,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Next time,

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,458
try assassinating me
in your own style.

215
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,833
[SUGINO]
More flexible, huh?

216
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,500
I never realized.

217
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,041
[SUGINO]
How 'bout that.

218
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,666
My own style.

219
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,208
[NAGISA]
Excuse me, sir?

220
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hm?

221
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,875
Did you really fly
all the way to New York

222
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,208
just to give Sugino
a piece of advice?

223
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Why not? I'm his teacher.

224
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,333
Well, it's just that
most teachers I know

225
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,041
wouldn't go that far
for a student,

226
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,125
and I mean, here you are
planning to blow up the planet

227
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,125
by the time we
graduate and all that.

228
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,166
[KORO-SENSEI] Nagisa,
the details aren't important.

229
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,791
Let's just say I'm here
to make good on a promise.

230
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,000
One I don't take lightly.

231
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,666
Ah...

232
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,500
[KORO-SENSEI] The Earth
will be destroyed, yes,

233
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:25,291
but my first priority is to
you and your classmates.

234
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,166
Nothing beats giving you kids
the credit you're due.

235
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,541
Not even me
blowing up the Earth.

236
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,833
Koro-sensei...

237
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,708
[NAGISA] Could you maybe not
write problems like this

238
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:40,750
on the back of our tests?

239
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Whaa?!

240
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,833
We get it. You're fast.

241
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,666
No point being all
weird about it, right?

242
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,166
[KORO-SENSEI] Aww...
It's only a bonus question...

243
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,291
Honestly, sir, it feels
more like a penalty.

244
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh... Yeah, well...

245
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,125
Anyway, I hope my students
take assassinating me

246
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,166
as seriously as I
take their education.

247
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,416
Not that'll you'll ever
pull it off, of course.

248
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,666
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

249
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,541
[SUGINO grunts]

250
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,750
[gasps]

251
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,208
[NAGISA]
Wow! Nice one!

252
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,291
Broke so fast
I could barely see it!

253
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,000
[laughs]
All in the wrists and elbows,

254
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,541
I'm perfecting a curve ball
that plays to my strengths.

255
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,333
Between that and the
changeup I'm working on,

256
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,208
I've already got a
half-decent arsenal.

257
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,750
Nothing Koro-sensei can't see
comin' from a mile away,

258
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,916
but what are you gonna do?

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,916
I'm sticking with it, though.

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,500
Perseverance is key...
in baseball and assassination!

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,958
[NAGISA] With supersonic speed
and, um, multitasking tentacles,

262
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,625
Koro-sensei definitely
has the advantage.

263
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,125
Killing him won't
be easy. Still...

264
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,625
Can I bother you for a sec?

265
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,000
I wanna take a couple test shots
at you, if that's okay.

266
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,250
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]
Glutton for disappointment?

267
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,166
[NAGISA] He was such
an awesome motivator.

268
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,416
The kind of mentor who really
knew how to light a fire in you.

269
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,958
We were having,
well, a ball with him.

270
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,166
[MEG]
There he is.

271
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,041
[MAEHARA] Hey. You think that
ice really comes all the way

272
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,291
from the friggin' North Pole?

273
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,375
[MIMURA]
Why not?

274
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,708
He hits up every
other place on the map.

275
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,416
Focus! Think of the
money we're gonna split.

276
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
[GROUP]
Koro-sensei!

277
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hmm...?

278
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,791
--[ISOGAI] I hope you brought
--[GROUP laughs]

279
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,708
--enough shaved ice
--[GROUP laughs]

280
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,291
--for all of us!
--[GROUP laughs]

281
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,333
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles] Are the
children opening their hearts

282
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,625
to me at last?
Such beaming smiles!

283
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,666
[GROUP laughs]

284
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Such little savages!

285
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,625
[GROUP grunts]

286
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,333
[coughing]

287
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,375
[KORO-SENSEI] Not the worst
tactic you've tried.

288
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,666
But your smiles were
a bit too forced.

289
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,625
I wasn't born yesterday,
boys and girls.

290
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,083
Now put away these
silly anti-me knives,

291
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,041
and take a moment to stop
and smell, if not the roses,

292
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,791
then these lovely specimens.

293
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,500
Are these from
the flower bed?!

294
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,750
For your information, sir,

295
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,708
we grew these "lovely
specimens" from seeds!

296
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,916
[KORO-SENSEI shrieks]
No kidding?!

297
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,125
[TOKA] Why would you
do something so mean?

298
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,041
We'd been waiting for them to
bloom for months,

299
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,875
--and now they're...
--[KORO-SENSEI] I'm so sorry!

300
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,333
Forgive me, children! Allow me
to, uh, get you fresh bulbs!

301
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,208
[OKANO]
Don't plant them at Mach Twenty!

302
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
No, of course not.

303
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,375
[MEG]
Tulips need a delicate touch!

304
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Delicate. Got it.

305
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,708
[MEG]
Stop trying to impress us!

306
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,875
[MAEHARA] He's going to
a lot of trouble for a guy

307
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,333
who's about to
blow up the planet.

308
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,958
[ISOGAI] Yeah, kinda seems
like a conflict of interest.

309
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,000
[OKANO]
Drain the soil properly!

310
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
One step at a time!

311
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,791
[MEG] It's probably
too late for them to grow now.

312
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,000
What's with the sea urchin
going all Earth Day on us?

313
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,416
[KAEDE]
Oh hey, Nagisa.

314
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,333
What'cha writing
in your little book?

315
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,500
It's a running list of all the
chinks in Koro-sensei's armor.

316
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,250
A good assassin keeps tabs
on his target's weak spots.

317
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,250
[KAEDE]
Hmm...

318
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,791
Wow. Is that kind of thing
really a weakness?

319
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,333
[NAGISA sighs]

320
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,208
[SUGINO] Nagisa wouldn't
put it in there if it wasn't.

321
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,083
Thank you!

322
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,000
Every detail gives us an edge.

323
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,625
[SUGINO]
"Height: About three meters.

324
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,625
Weight: Lighter than he looks.
Birth date: unknown.

00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,125
Weak points: Unknown..."

326
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,250
What the hell is this?

327
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,375
Doesn't seem like
a lot to go on.

328
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,166
Maybe not at the moment.

329
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,208
[NAGISA]
The learning curve is steep.

330
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,541
Most classes don't have
murder on the syllabus.

331
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,166
We are the exception.

332
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,208
Then again, we are E Class.
We're the exception, period.

333
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,500
[KARASUMA]
The Ministry of Defense

334
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,916
appreciates your cooperation.

335
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,125
My being brought in
as the new P.E. Teacher

336
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,583
of Class 3-E is
unorthodox, we realize.

337
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,666
But, necessary.

338
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,666
I'll be there
chiefly to observe,

339
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,666
and to offer the
students tactical advice.

340
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,625
My teaching certificate is still
valid, so that's something.

341
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,500
[PRINCIPAL]
You have my blessing, sir.

342
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:52,708
Just see to it their education
and safety come first.

343
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,708
Thank you for your
time, principal.

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,125
[MALE MOD MEMBER A] I figured
we'd meet with more resistance.

345
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,541
[KARASUMA] Hmph. He's being
compensated handsomely

346
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,875
for his trouble.

347
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,666
All this seems rather
convenient if you ask me.

348
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,916
A creature with god-like
powers, untouchable,

349
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
beyond the reach of the
military who wants to teach?

350
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,791
Thankfully we've
kept it a secret.

351
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,791
The principal is involved
and the E Class students.

352
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,833
But as far as we can tell,
no other civilians have a clue.

353
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,333
--[TANAKA] I'm gonna die!
--[KARASUMA gasps]

354
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,208
--This is end of the world, man!
--[TAKADA] For you!

355
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,041
Stop screwin' around and
get those grades up, man!

356
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,875
Have you seen
the satellite campus?!

357
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,291
It's a nightmare.

358
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,416
No cafeteria, no food,
bathrooms look like something

359
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,583
out of a horror movie,
the kids are psychos,

360
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,416
the teachers fear
for their lives.

361
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,166
Once you're there,
you're basically done.

362
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,958
Colleges won't touch your
transcript with a ten-foot pole.

363
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,291
[TANAKA]
I know, I know.

364
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,000
Dude, whatever keeps me
outta E Class, I'll do it.

365
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
[KUNUDON]
Surprise!

366
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,625
[BOYS &amp; GIRLS]
Hooray! It's Kunudon!

367
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,000
Hello, kiddos! That's correct!

368
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,666
It's Kunudon,
your school mascot!

369
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,458
I'm gonna be telling you all
about the sort of

370
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,833
super amazing things we do
here at Kunugigaoka Academy!

371
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,208
[BOYS &amp; GIRLS]
Yaaay!

372
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,625
I bet you already know that
we make learning fun,

373
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,083
but I bet you didn't know we're
one of the top-ranked schools

374
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,250
in the country!

375
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,958
[BOYS &amp; GIRLS]
Wow! That's amazing!

376
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,125
That's because we emphasize
teamwork and equality!

377
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:22,125
[BOYS &amp; GIRLS]
Hooray! Equality!

378
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,541
Time-tested strategy.

379
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,791
Single out a group as
undesirable and the rest will

380
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,791
fall in line to avoid
being one of them.

381
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,458
Social engineering at its
finest. Very effective.

382
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,208
Makes our job a little easier
than it might be otherwise.

383
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,583
Say what you will, E Class
is ideal for our purposes.

384
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,250
Remote. Secluded.

385
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,291
Full of ticking
teenage time-bombs.

386
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,708
Hey, Mr. Karasuma!
What are you doing here/

387
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,000
New job assignment. As of
tomorrow, I join the faculty

388
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,125
as a P.E. teacher.

389
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,625
Oh, that sounds cool!

390
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,041
It should be fun, yes.

391
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,750
Then I get to call you
Professor Karasuma from now on!

392
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,791
So where exactly is
your target now?

393
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,833
Apologizing.

394
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,208
He messed up
the tulips we planted

395
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,958
so he's reduced his speed
and he's letting us all

396
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,291
take whacks at him.

397
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,166
Is he totally the coolest
teacher ever, or what?!

398
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
A few more minutes of this

399
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,708
and all is forgiven, right?

400
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,625
You're a very lucky class,
I'll have you know;

401
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,958
not many teachers would put
themselves in this position.

402
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,333
So, uh, any luck yet?

403
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,916
Uh... No.

404
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
This is pretty much
all a game to him.

405
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,958
[sighs] This is not what the
Ministry of Defense has in mind.

406
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,791
Wait, hang on a minute.

407
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,208
There's bound to be a
corresponding weakness.

408
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:36,541
[KORO-SENSEI laughs] Shoot and
stab to all you want, class!

409
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,208
Even with this handicap,
I am too fast for you!

410
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,083
Only in your dreams
do you have any hope

411
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,416
of getting the deed done--

412
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,041
[ALL groan]

413
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,000
[ALL]
Kill him!

414
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,208
[KORO-SENSEI] Wait, wait, wait!
This isn't part of the deal!

415
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:55,166
Easy! Oh crap, oh crap,
oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!

416
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,791
Well, your notes are bound to
come in handy at some point.

417
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:58,875
Right!

418
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,375
That's why I'm jotting
everything down.

419
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,291
[KORO-SENSEI] My tentacles
are all tangled in the ropes!

420
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,750
This isn't what I had in mind!

421
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:08,125
Stop it, stop it all of you!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

422
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,791
[OKAJIMA]
Hey, get back down here!

423
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,125
[KORO-SENSEI] Ha-ha!
What's the matter, children?

424
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,916
Can't jump this high?
Oh, wait, of course not!

425
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,750
--[KORO-SENSEI laughs]
--[OKAJIMA growls]

426
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,583
Aw, man! We were so close!

427
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,708
[laughing continues]

428
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:26,208
[KORO-SENSEI pants, sighs]

429
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,583
[KORO-SENSEI] Guess who's earned
themselves extra homework?

430
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,041
[STUDENTS]
No fair!

431
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,916
[KORO-SENSEI cackles]

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,250
[MIMURA] Where's he going?

433
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,291
We're getting closer to a
solution, I can feel it!

434
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,250
Keep this up and it's
only a matter of time

435
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,416
before we got him!

436
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:49,041
[STUDENTS chatter, laugh, cheer]

437
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,833
[KARASUMA]
A bunch of junior-high kids,

438
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,041
keyed up about killing.

439
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,041
Strangest class ever.

440
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,166
So, whaddaya think?
Do we have a decent chance?

441
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,583
Oh, yeah, no doubt!

442
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,458
'Least I hope so, or it's
gonna be a really awkward

443
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,416
graduation ceremony.

444
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,166
[KARASUMA]
It's a funny thing.

445
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,416
The system's given up on
these kids, and look at 'em.

446
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,250
[ISOGAI]
If we lure him here.

447
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,708
[KARASUMA] They've got
so much positive energy.

448
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,541
So much... purpose.

449
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,166
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]

450
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,208
[FEMALE MOD MEMBER 2A]
As you can see, our situation

451
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,416
is a desperate one.
Needless to say,

452
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,458
this information is shared in
strictest confidence.

453
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,458
Break the non-disclosure clause,

454
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,208
and you will be subject
to a memory wipe.

455
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,000
[KARMA]
Yikes.

456
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,625
Your fellow classmates
have already been debriefed.

457
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,541
They've done their best,
but so far to no effect.

458
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,125
Once your suspension has ended,
you'll report to E Class

459
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,958
and access the situation.

460
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,750
From there, you are authorized
to proceed as you see fit.

461
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,208
[KARMA]
Whatever.

462
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,250
You expect me to take him
down with this? Seriously?

463
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,375
[FEMALE MOD MEMBER A]
Correct.

464
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,041
That knife, while
harmless to humans,

465
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,750
is designed specifically
with your target in mind.

466
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,208
[KARMA]
Huh. Human. Not human.

467
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,791
Doesn't matter to me.

468
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,083
[KARMA]
Either way, I'm good.

469
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,625
[KARMA]
Should still be a lot of fun.

470
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,833
I've always wanted
to kill me a teacher.
