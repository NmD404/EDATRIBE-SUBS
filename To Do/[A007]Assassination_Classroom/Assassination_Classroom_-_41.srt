00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes!

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,375
Consider this the
Assassination Classroom's

3
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:14,000
out-of-season research project!

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:19,166
Ground control to Major Tom:
The ISS has been hijacked!

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,708
[NAGISA]
With those words,

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,958
one of E-Class's most daring
escapades was, well, launched.

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
"The reentry capsule carrying

8
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,416
the research data will
plunge into the Pacific Ocean.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,458
As a precaution
against potential theft

10
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,416
by the super-creature to
which the said data pertains,

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,541
the capsule will remain unopened
while en route to the lab."

12
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,333
An insightful provision
on their part.

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,791
I'm not equipped to handle
heavy objects, you see.

14
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,791
A five-ton capsule might as well
be a reinforced bank safe

15
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,916
for all I'd be able to carry it.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,041
[OKANO]
Which is why we'll get them

17
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,333
to show us the goods
before reentry.

18
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,875
Still, though, does Japan
really have the tech

19
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,958
to launch an unmanned
rocket into space?

20
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
It's hard to believe,

21
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,750
but as it so happens, yes.

22
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,750
Of course, I might've
had a little something

23
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,166
to do with that,
but it's whatever.

24
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,750
[NAGISA]
There were a lot of unknowns.

25
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,000
A lot to be terrified of.

26
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,083
But when there's a problem
to tackle, we come together.

27
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,166
And when we come
together, blast off.

28
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,041
[ISOGAI]
Okay. We have a plan.

29
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,041
Time to put that
plan into action.

30
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,750
First off, the rocket
only holds two people.

31
00:02:58,833 --> 00:02:59,458
Who's going?

32
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,500
[MALE STUDENTS]
Me!

33
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,125
Huh. 'Kay.

34
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,833
Ah. Wonderful. Boys'll be boys.

35
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
This is an experimental vessel

36
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,833
with as yet no
successful flights.

37
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,208
Who's goin' now?

38
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,916
[MALE STUDENTS groan]

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
I thought so.

40
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,000
[ITONA]
I want to go anyway.

41
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,458
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

42
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,375
I love technology. The whole
idea makes my mouth water.

43
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,333
It's just... It's clear
to me who should go.

44
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,500
Nagisa. Karma.

45
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,708
What?

46
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,958
Look, I'm not that fond
of taking big risks,

47
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,708
especially with my
life on the line.

48
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:35,041
Why don't you send Terasaka
and a dummy instead?

49
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,291
They're both expendable.

50
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,500
Asshole!

51
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,666
Karma the Fighter in
case there's a scuffle,

52
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,041
and Nagisa the Assassin
just to be safe.

53
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,375
That seems like a pretty
ideal hijacking team to me.

54
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,833
Great.

55
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,250
Everyone save up some money
so we can cover the costs.

56
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,500
Don't even think of
skippin' out on this, man!

57
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,000
You nearly killed each other

58
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,875
tryin' to get us all
on the same page!

59
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,666
Be responsible for once in
your life and take charge!

60
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,375
[NAGISA]
Karma?

61
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,083
I say we give it a shot.

62
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,000
What's better than
a trip to outer space

63
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,416
with your best friend?

64
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,166
Eh? Come on!

65
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,708
Sure. Fine.

66
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,375
I did promise to hear
you out, didn't I?

67
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Excellent! Then it's settled.

68
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,125
Whoa! Check it out!

69
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,083
Cool! This where they
do the count down?

70
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,375
[GROUND CONTROL B] Sorry,

[GROUND CONTROL A] Where're
their visitor ID cards?

72
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,500
We're here for a field trip,
but we got kinda lost.

73
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,125
[TOKA] We followed
some random science guy

74
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,208
and wound up in here.

75
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,000
Oops, I guess! Sorry!

76

00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,166
'Kay, Ritsu, I'm in
the control room now.

78
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,750
You said any of these computers
should do the trick, right?

79
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,708
[RITSU]
Affirmative.

80
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,041
[KIMURA]
Okay.

81
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,291
I'm plugging you in and
getting out of here, stat.

[GROUND CONTROL B]
Hey! Stop tickling me!

Installation of

onto the control room mainframe.

86
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,541
Successful.

87
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,041
Both the onboard flight systems
and the ground control network

88
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,583
now operate on my command.

89
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,750
We're good to go.

00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,500
The first hurdle has
been cleared. Nice.

Hey, Ritsu?

92
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,500
Looks like a big chunk of our
entry root is above ground.

93
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,125
There anything you
can do about that?

94
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,375
[RITSU]

95
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,833
And I'm confirming your
current position now.

96

[RITSU]
There you are.

97
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,583
How 'bout I shut down
the security camera

98
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,375
in that sector for ten seconds?

99
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,416
Sounds good.

adjust their angle.

There, that should
take care of it.

00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,625
Please be careful.

106
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,750

Will do.

I'm relaying the pre-recorded

You can swap them out now.

00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,166
with a big ol' hug, eh?

175
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,541
[MIZUI]
Roger that.

176
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,708
[MIZUI]
Hm?

177
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,291
Where's the dummy?

178
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,708
[MIZUI yelps]

179
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,208
[ISS GROUND CONTROL A]
What? Communications are down.

180
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,500
What's going on?

181
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,500
[CREWMAN B]
Huh?

182
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,083
Oh. Hi there!

183
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,916
[KARMA]
Hey! You're Mizui, right?

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I've seen you on TV.

185
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,333
What the--?

186
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,958
They didn't say anything
about kids being onboard!

187
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,416
[CREWMAN C]
Somethin' wrong?

188
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,833
Heh, the comm link
with Earth has been cut.

189
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,958
Excellent job. Thanks.

190
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:08,875
[clears throat]

191
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,416
So we have a bomb.

192
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,833
We wanna keep things
nice and peaceful-like.

193
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,958
Back away please.
Let's talk this out.

194
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,416
It's gettin' a little cramped
in here for my taste, boys.

195
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,125
I vote we move this inside
where there's more elbowroom.

196
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,458
Yeah, that's right. Let's go.

197
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,333
[NAGISA]
Okay, so,

198
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,958
all we're after is a copy of the
American team's research data.

199
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,416
That's it.

200
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,958
You have my word we won't be
making any other demands.

201
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,708
[KARMA]
You probably already know this,

202
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,000
but our teacher is the
monster you're studying.

203
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,583
No telling what
he'll do to the planet

204
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,500
if you refuse what
we're asking for.

205
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,666
He's capable of anything.

206
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,250
[KARMA] Okay. These fellas
got calm in a hurry.

207
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,375
I guess that's a career
astronaut for ya.

208
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,625
Well, first of all let me give
you kids a big round of applause

209
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,791
for the balls it
took to get this far.

210
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,833
Uh, thank you, I guess?

211
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,291
But, really,

212
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,208
you can't seriously think
we're that easy to take out.

213
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,166
We're not gonna drop to
our knees over a bomb.

214
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,000
Think about it.
We're astronauts.

215
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,583
We came up here
knowing full well

216
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,458
that death is an
occupational hazard.

217
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,000
[CREWMAN A]
Hm.

218
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,416
What'd'ya say we
put down the weapons?

219
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,833
We're willing to talk this
out like civilized people.

220
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,750
But first, you kids
let our crew mate go.

221
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,458
This is nuts.

222
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,541
Even if you do steal the data,
how do you plan on getting home?

223
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,375
You gonna ask the guys you just
threatened to give ya a lift?

224
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,208
We can manage on our own.

225
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,666
Our classmate worked out
the return-orbit calculations

226
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,041
to the last decimal point.

227
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,375
Yep!

228
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,333
So there's that. And of
course our teacher can do

229
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,333
whatever fine-tuning
we need from midair.

230
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,083
That's incredibly reckless!

231
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,625
Is this fun for you?

232
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,833
We all think we're invincible
when we're young, but damn.

233
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,500
[KARMA] Look, pal, I'm not
here 'cause I wanna be.

234
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,833
Uh-uh. I'm here 'cause
my friend asked me.

235
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,375
Seriously?

236
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,416
[KARMA]
We know we're not invincible.

237
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,750
We've actually given it a lot
of thought the last few months.

238
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,291
Look at us.

239
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,708
We're a bunch of kids prepared
to assassinate our teacher.

240
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,583
That puts us in a
unique position.

241
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,708
We understand how
fragile life is.

242
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,625
Just like you, am I right?

243
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,666
[CREWMAN A] You put a lotta
stock in the harebrained schemes

244
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,708
your target cooks up, huh?

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,333
Well, boy,

246
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,583
guess I'll take it upon myself
to accept your demands.

247
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,000
We'll let them see the files.

248
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,125
[CREWMAN D]
Huh?

249
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,666
In exchange,

250
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,666
you can earn those files by
helping us unload our supplies.

251
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,875
Let's put these kids to work

252
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,333
so they can get what
they need and go.

253
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,500
[NAGISA] In the end,
more than anything else,

254
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,041
I think the crew
just wanted to give

255
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,500
a couple of junior high kids
the experience of a lifetime.

256
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,333
This might actually
save his butt.

257
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,166
Maybe, yeah.

258
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,083
[KARMA] That'd be enough
for you, wouldn't it?

259
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,708
What's that s'posed to mean?

260
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,458
Eh, I'm not goin' against
the class's decision

261
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,625
to save him or anything.

262
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,250
Your side won, fair and square.

263
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,166
I'm just curious if
that's what he wants.

264
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,750
[CREWMAN A]
There you go.

265
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,041
Every last file.

266
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,250
If there's a way to
defuse him, it's in there.

267
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,208
[RITSU]
No signs of falsification.

268
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,375
Relevant experimental
data's veracity confirmed.

269
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,583
I'll download a copy.

270
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,208
That should just about do it.

271
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,416
Now to get back and run
some tests of our own.

272
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,750
Yeah. We wouldn't want
to overstay our welcome.

273
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,666
Hey, pops!

274
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,458
[CREWMAN A]
Hm?

275
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,208
Heads up. Present for ya!

276
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,041
[yelps]

277
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,458
It's filled with
sweet-bean jelly,

278
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,000
so knock yourselves out.

279
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,333
[ALL]
Oh no.

280
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,750
Aw, don't sweat it.

281
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,833
Just tell the brass you
erred on the side of caution.

282
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,416
[NAGISA] We're very, very sorry
if we cause you any trouble!

283
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,375
At least you got to
kill some time, right?

284
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,416
[BOTH chuckle]

285
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,958
[MIZUI]
Look at 'em.

286
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,458
Swimming in zero gravity like
they're at a friend's place.

287
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,541
Stealing classified intel like
they're trading in video games.

288
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,916
Piercing the atmosphere like
they're just heading home

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,666
from a normal day at school.

290
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,500
Junior High sure isn't what it
used to be when I was a kid.

291
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,250
We just met the next
generation of heroes.

292
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,250
Come back soon.
Legally next time, though.

293
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,750
I'm an earthbound boy.
No offense, guys.

294
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,916
But rest assured,
the second I'm in power,

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,541
the space exploration program's

296
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,833
gettin' a big-time
budget increase.

297
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,333
[CREWMAN A]
Ha! I'll hold you to that.

298
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,333
Is it me, or does time
move faster in outer space?

299
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,666
[KARMA]
Mm.

300
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,166
[NAGISA] Let's hope
the odds are in our favor

301
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,708
for making it back
home in one piece.

302
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,000
Ritsu? Ritsu?

303
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,750
[RITSU]
Don't worry. I'm on it.

304
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,000
I've been crunching the
numbers like a boss.

305
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,666
Safety is virtually a
mathematical guarantee.

306
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,583
For all intents and purposes,
this ship is my physical body.

307
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,541
Sit back and relax.

308
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,125
I've got sensors scanning
all data parameters.

309
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,250
More than ever processed
before, in fact.

310
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,250
External temperature.
Air pressure.

311
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,375
Velocity. Even the scenery!

312
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,916
Pretty nifty, huh?

313
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,375
I also have a clear read
on your respiratory rate,

314
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:22,250
blood pressure, body
temperature, small talk.

315
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,458
To be so connected.
To be in motion.

316
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,125
It feels so...

317
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,625
...so wonderful!

318
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,500
This mission has been great.

319
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:35,375
We have the data we came for,
and my intelligence has evolved!

320
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,708
Hey. Do you wanna
know something?

321
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,208
It may be hard to believe,

322
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,708
but I've just processed
my very first emotion.

323
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,833
There's no other word for it.

324
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:49,041
Being a part of this class
has made me... happy.

325
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Right on schedule!

326
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,250
I imagine it must've been
quite a grueling trip!

327
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,416
[yelps]

328
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,083
Are you all right, sir?

329
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,250
[KORO-SENSEI] It appears
I didn't need to intercede

330
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,083
in the negotiations after all.

331
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,666
I bet those daring cosmonauts

332
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,791
were enormously
impressed with you!

333
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,375
Probably, yeah.

334
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,666
[KORO-SENSEI] Hold tight, I'm
gonna give you a little shove!

335
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,000
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

336
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,375
Onward, to--! Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

337
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,125
[SUGINO] Yeah! They made it!
They're back home!

338
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,125
[YOSHIDA]
Woo-hoo!

339
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,916
[ISOGAI]
Keep going! Almost there!

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,416
[NAGISA]
We doubted each other.

341
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,291
Worried. Rattled sabers.

342
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,083
But when all was said and done,

343
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,708
at the end of that
crazy-long month,

344
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,125
we went into space!

345
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,958
[STUDENTS]
Hooray! They did it!

346
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:06,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Phew.

347
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,291
What in the name
of God did you do?

348
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,458
[KORO-SENSEI yelps]

349
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,541
I can't begin to conceive
how much damage.

350
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh, this won't reflect on you.

351
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,500
I coerced the
students into going.

352
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,958
No one else knew of my plan.

353
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,041
You two have
plausible deniability,

354
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,250
At any rate, we have a
lovely bonus to show for it.

355
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,416
Human pilots yield much
better data than test dummies.

356
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,250
This will push the space program
forward by at least a decade!

357
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,708
Oh! And did I mention
Ritsu discovered

358
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,583
a more efficient trajectory
than previously known?

359
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,250
I give this to
you in good faith.

360
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,666
No hard feelings?

361
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,083
[KARASUMA growls]

362
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,291
You're unbelievable.

363
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:48,416
[STUDENTS cheering, laughing]

364
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,250
It's good to be home.

365
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,166
[MAEHARA]
Whoa! You gotta be kidding me!

366
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,458
I'm glad you got it and all,
but, I mean, for real.

367
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,000
This stuff might as
well be in Greek.

368
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,375
[OKUDA] Let me have a look.
I speak science, so...

369
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,750
Okay, in laymen's terms,

370
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,583
the things they were
doing on the Space Station

371
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,916
found that the risk of explosion
for a creature with tentacles

372
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,208
is inversely proportional
to its size.

373
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,166
Uh, that means the bigger
it is, the more stable.

374
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,708
The smallest ones
carry the greatest risk.

375
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,125
So a mouse would
be likely to explode,

376
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,250
whereas the probability
of a human with tentacles

377
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,375
going berserk and blowing up

378
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,500
is way lower than
originally thought.

379
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,875
Does that make sense?

380
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,958
Uh! So in other words--

381
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,208
Wait. Hang on, it says,
"The drug indicated below

382
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,375
is administered and
a silicon compound

383
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,583
used to stimulate
the flow of blood."

384
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,750
Oh, I get it.

385
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,708
By relieving muscular tension,

386
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,791
you decrease the chance of
the creature going critical.

387
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,375
Of course!

388
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,916
[ISOGAI, MAEHARA]
Tension?

389
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,958
[OKUDA] "When the following
conditions are satisfied,

390
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,666
the possibility of explosion,
even if initially high,

391
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,458
drops to less than one percent."

392
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,958
[ISOGAI]
One percent?

393
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,125
[OKUDA] "Likely, the organism's
cells will degenerate

394
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,625
before an explosion can occur,

395
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:40,416
evaporating over the course
of, on average, 90 years."

396
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,291
[TERASAKA] So this drug
they're talkin' about,

397
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,458
can we make it or what?

398
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,000
[OKUDA]
Yes, it's very simple.

399
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,208
As a matter of fact, the
compound I made a while ago

400
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,291
is almost identical
in structure.

401
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,500
[ALL]
Seriously?

402
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,541
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles nervously]

403
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,083
[FUWA]
Wow!

404
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,083
So, the key to solving this
has been front of us all along?

405
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,333
But are we sure?

406
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,583
I mean, it just seems a
little too easy is all.

407
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,166
[KAEDE]
Easy?

408
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,708
I don't think I'd call the
road we've been on an easy.

409
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,166
Kayano.

410
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,750
[KAEDE] My sister gave her
life to help Koro-sensei.

411
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,833
To keep him from going rogue.

412
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,333
And he chose to follow
in her footsteps,

413
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:19,666
risking his neck just to give
us a chance in the world.

414
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,833
If we hadn't put our
own lives on the line,

415
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,041
how far could we go?

416
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,083
Would we have found the drug?

417
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,708
Even more importantly, would
we have grown into a class

418
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,458
that could travel into space?

419
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,666
Look at it this way.

420
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,041
Less than one percent
is practically zero!

421
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,375
Even if we don't kill him,

422
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,791
we could still keep the
earth from blowing up!

423
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,916
[STUDENTS chattering]

424
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,791
Uh. Wait a minute. What
about the assassination?

425
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,375
[ALL]
Uh?

426
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,458
We've been working on it
as a class since first term.

427
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,416
Are we calling it off?
Is that what we've decided?

428
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,375
Uh... I guess this means
it kind of is, yeah.

429
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,166
Maybe...

430
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,791
[ISOGAI]
Should we talk it out more?

431
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:04,458
Nagisa, this was your idea.
What do you wanna do?

432
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,291
However minute the
possibility may be,

433
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,708
the government's not
going to cancel its plans.

434
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,958
Not as long a creature
like him is running loose.

435
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,375
I wanna be respectful
of the whole class,

436
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,750
particularly since
we've made it this far.

437
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,041
[NAGISA] We talked it
out and we decided.

438
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,083
If we couldn't kill Koro-sensei
by the March deadline,

439
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,208
we'd stop being
assassins-in-training

440
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,458
and opt for a more traditional
student-teacher dynamic.

441
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,791
But until then,
we'd brandish our blades

442
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,833
with the strength
of our convictions.

443
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,000
After all, in this classroom,

444
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,708
assassination isn't just the
bond we share with Koro-sensei,

445
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,250
it's the bond we
share with each other.

446
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,000
[NAGISA]
That was our decision.

447
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,333
Here we go.
