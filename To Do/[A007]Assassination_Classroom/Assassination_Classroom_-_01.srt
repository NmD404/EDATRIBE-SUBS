All right, people.

if you would do the honors.

Aim!

Oh. Oh, my.

Well, why don't I just call roll

Here.

[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
What's that?

14
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,250
I'm afraid I couldn't make it
out over all the gunfire.

The whole class opened fire

31

even have a scratch.

[NAGISA]
Yep.

We're assassins,
and our target...

00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,291
...is our teacher.

00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,750
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
No luck today either, eh?

36
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,500
That's really too bad.

00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,958
What's the lesson here?

38
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,333
Numbers are no substitute
for inventiveness, perhaps?

39
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,666
That any hack can point
a gun and pull a trigger?

Some of Column A,
some of Column B?

41
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,291
I get that you were
trying to cast the net

as widely as possible,
so to speak,

43
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,291
but the approach
lacked originality.

00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,166
When the target clocks
at Mach Twenty,

45
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,083
an assassin has to
think outside the box.

[MAEHARA]
Ha. Right. Mach Twenty.

47

it all started with

Some sources estimate over 70%.

and then there was him.

Hello! How are you?

104
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,875

gonna be your new teacher!

things wrong with this picture.

call "classified."

come right out with it.

[NAGISA]
Uh. Okay.

126
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,166
I'm not at liberty to discuss
the details at this juncture.

127
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,500
I'll just say he's
telling the truth.

128
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,625
His threat is all too real.

129
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,125
As of this coming March.

130
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,125
He will obliterate the Earth.

131
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,583
Apart from you, the only people
who know this are world leaders.

132
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,541
If word of this leaks out
to the public,

we'll have widespread
panic on our hands.

134
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:33,166
He must be terminated soon
and with extreme prejudice.

Which means that you
must become assassins.

Now, you'll notice
he's incredibly fast!

137
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,958
And for some reason,
he likes grooming eyebrows.

[KARASUMA] You're looking at
a being so powerful

141
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,291
he can obliterate over
half the moon in seconds.

142
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,791
So fast, he's been
clocked at Mach Twenty.

143
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,500
A world where
he's allowed to live

144
00:07:56,583 --> 00:08:01,625
is a world waiting to be
destroyed, plain and simple.

all sound so grim, doesn't he?

I've graciously made
your government an offer.

148
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,083
"Stop making fools of yourselves
trying to kill me," I said.

149
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,666
"And let me teach Class Three-E

150
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,916

institution!"

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,375
[NAGISA]
Seriously?

152
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,666
[KARASUMA]
We didn't have much of a choice.

153
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,875
We have no idea
what his motives are,

154
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,375
but we agreed on the condition
that none of you students

155
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,666
would be harmed in any way.

156
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,375
[KARASUMA]
The advantage is twofold.

157
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,291
On the one hand,
we'll know his whereabouts

158
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,750
a good portion of every
weekday, which is something.

159
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,583
On the other, he'll be in
close range to thirty people

160
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,125
with the means and
incentive to kill him.

I distinctly remember saying
no guns discharging

[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Back row, young lady.

166
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,500

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,916
[NAGISA] Why would this "thing"
want to be our teacher?

And how are we going
to assassinate him

170
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,958
if the government can't?

171
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,791
Those're the questions we
should have asked at the start,

172
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,583
but I guess we got distracted.

and you get ten billion.

[STUDENTS gasp]

175
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,416
[KARASUMA]
It's only fair.

176
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,000
Kill him, save the Earth.

177
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,916
If that doesn't deserve
a life on Easy Street,

178
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,375
what are we fighting for?

179
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,958
He doesn't think can do it.

180
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,208
Use that.

181
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,791
Green stripes indicate
he's feeling superior.

182
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,708
We have some experience with it.

183
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,041
[MAEHARA]
Freaky.

184
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,416
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Truth be told, I'm not worried.

185
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,791
The military couldn't kill me,

186
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,208
why would anyone
assume students could?

187
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,333
After all, you don't
even have fighter jets!

188
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,875
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Hard to keep tidy, fighter jets.

189
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,666
[MEG]
What's with the cleaning fetish?

190
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,916
[KARASUMA]
It's all on you.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,416
Find the cracks in this
smug bastard's defenses

192
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,708
and exploit them.
The weapons you'll be provided

193
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,416
are harmless to humans
but extremely fatal to him.

194
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,625
And, it goes without saying,

195
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,625
we'll need to keep
this between us.

196
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,708
The clock is ticking.

197
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,500
Decide whether you'll
stand for our home

198
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,416
being blasted to space dust.

199
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,750
[OCTOPUS TEACHER] That should
just about cover it, I think.

200
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,166
What do you say we hit the books

201
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,208
and make the final year
of your lives a productive one?

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,541
[NAGISA] So that's it.
We have a year to live.

203
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,333
If we can't find a way
to kill our teacher,

Earth is gonna be history.

Oh? That's lunchtime, everybody.

207
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,875
Excuse me while I pop over
to China for a quick bite.

208
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,291
You have my cell number,
any killers feeling

209
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,083

[STUDENTS gasp, yell]

211
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,083
[NAKAMURA]
Okay, math...

212
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,791
If he's traveling
at Mach Twenty...

213
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,500
[NAGISA] It'll take ten
minutes tops to reach

214
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,458
his favorite take-out
place in Sichuan.

215
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,041
[MAEHARA]
So, just to be clear:

216
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,041
we've absolutely
ruled out missiles?

217
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,375
[ISOGAI]
Are you kidding?

218
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,041
Even if we had access
to that kind of hardware,

219
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,416
he can break the sound barrier.

220
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,916
[NAKAMURA]
While grading.

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,250
[ISOGAI] My homework even
came back with a doodle on it.

222
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,500
[NAKAMURA]
All things considered,

223
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,583
you have to admit
he's not doing a bad job.

224
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,208
[HINANO] I know, right?
He tutored me on algebra

225
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,708
and I killed it on
our pop quiz the next day!

226
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,500
Yeah. Kind of a shame.

227
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,041
We get our grades up just
in time for the world to end.

228
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,000
[OKAJIMA] Well, college
wasn't happening either way.

229
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,208
[NAGISA] Flying super-cephalopod
bent on world-destruction?

230
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,125
Check.

231
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,416
Impossible target?

232
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Check.

233
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,416
But he might be the best damn
teacher any of us has ever had.

234
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,250
Forget that we're all
would-be assassins,

235
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,333
and that most people
probably see us as average,

236

garden variety third years.

237
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,541
At least on the surface.
Underneath it all, though.

238
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,250
Class Three-E has
always been different.

239
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,083
[TERASAKA]
Yo, Nagisa.

240
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,666
Look alive, little man.

241
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,166
Time to put our money where
our mouth is and get this done.

242
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,625
[NAGISA]
Mm...

243
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,000
[TERASAKA] So we know the
octopus's face changes color

244
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,666
depending on what mood he's in.

245
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,000
Have you been keeping track
like I asked? Gimme the specs.

246
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,625
You got it.

247
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,750
I guess for starters, green
stripes mean he feels cocky.

248
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,208
So that's something.

249
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,041
When we give a wrong answer,
his face goes dark purple.

250
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,458
When we answer correctly,
bright red.

251
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,791
What's interesting is every day
after lunch, without fail--

252
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,666

Blah blah, whatever!

253
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,500
We got more 'n enough.

254
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,458
When his guard's down,
that's when we make our move.

255
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,291
Well, at least you do.

256
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,666
Yeah. About that, I--

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,708
Don't start!
We've been over this!

Everyone expects us to be
thugs and murderers anyway!

You know what the E
stands for, right?

End of the line.

mountain every day for the view?

Sorry to burst your bubble, man,
but society don't want us.

like us have a shot

at the kind of
cash at stake here?!

This is our one-way ticket
out of the boonies!

What else were they gonna do?

277
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,791
[BOY STUDENT B] That's one
less name in my contacts,

278
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,041
I'll tell you that.

279
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,333
[BOY STUDENT C]
Yeah. How messed up is it that

280
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,291

someone like him?

Okay, hi, sir. So, what...
what's with the missile?

285
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,541
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
A souvenir from a strike force

286
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,333
that tried to bring me down
over the Sea of Japan.

287
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,208
[NAGISA] Must be lonely spending
your life in the crosshairs.

[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Quite the opposite, actually!

289
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,875

291
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,458
[OCTOPUS TEACHER] Now, then.
Inside for fifth period, please.

292
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,625
Sure...

There's no denying it.

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,458
He is amazing.
Confident. Capable.

295
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,791
Powerful enough to make
people stand up and take notice.

Even if they are
trying to kill him.

Everything I'm not.

Everything I'll never be,
no matter how hard I try,

00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,041
or how many chances I'm given.

300
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,875
Because of you, I received
the worst teacher's evaluation

301
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,583
of my career,
you un-teachable brat.

302
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,458
Far as I'm concerned, this
campus can't eject you

303
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,916
fast enough.

304
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,916
[NAGISA] I can do this.
I have an advantage.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,166
I'm as invisible to him
as I am to everyone else.

[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Okie-dokie!

307
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,416
Your assignment this afternoon
is to compose a short poem.

308
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,958
The final line should read
"was tentacles all along"

309
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,416

What? Huh?

310
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,791
[KANZAKI]
Excuse me, sir. Really?

311
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,875
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Really!

312
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,416
When you've completed
the assignment,

313
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,750
kindly bring it forward.

314
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,416
You will be graded on
creativity, grammar,

315
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,083
and overall beauty
of expression.

316
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,583
Here's an example:

317
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:09,291
"Not the storm of garden's
snow of flowers moving on,

318
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,625
but sprouting there instead
was tentacles all along."

319
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,875
Yeah, because that
makes a whole lot of sense.

320
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,375
Sheesh.

321
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,458
[OCTOPUS TEACHER] You may
go home once you're finished.

--[STUDENTS gasp]
--What? But, sir!

323
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,333
"Was tentacles all along?" 

324
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,166
[OCTOPUS TEACHER] Should get
those li'l synapses sparking

325
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,500
and the imagination slithering!

[OCTOPUS TEACHER sputters]

327
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,000
[MAEHARA] Could you
please knock that off?!

328
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,250
Um, sir? Question!

329
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,708
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Huh? Of course!

330
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,750
Fire away, Kayano!

331
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,916
Do we always have to
call you sir?

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,250
You haven't given us your name
and I think we need one.

333
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,750
I mean, it'd be kinda awkward

334
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,666
if we don't call you
anything, right?

335
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,916
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Ah. Well, now...

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,041
Oversight.

337
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,583
Yeah, a little bit.

338
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,666
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Hmmm...

339
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,500
Trouble is, I don't have
the sort of name

340
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,625
you just give to people.
Why not pick one for me?

341
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,958
[MAEHARA]
What could go wrong?

342
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,458
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Just focus on meter and syntax.

343
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,041
M'kay.

344
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,375
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
I'll take a short break

345
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,375
while you take up your pens.

346
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,916
[OCTOPUS TEACHER] Ah!
Seems the muse favors Nagisa.

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
[chuckles]

348
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,458
[gasps]

349
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,625
[NAGISA] Every day after lunch,
without fail, he gets sleepy.

350
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,333
I can tell he checks out
when his face turns pink.

351
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:29,416
Kayano's question threw
him off, he seems distracted.

352
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,458
All signs point to this
being the right moment.

353
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,916
[NAGISA]
Prep-school flunkies know

354
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,875
how to slip between the cracks.

355
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,041
It's what we do.

356
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,291
Parents and teachers are
always yapping at us

357
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,083
to "apply ourselves."

358
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,291
[NAGISA]
Apply ourselves.

359
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,875
[OCTOPUS TEACHER] What did I say
about thinking outside the box?

360
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,125
[NAGISA]
All right, then.

361
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,750
Here goes nothing.

362
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,083
[OCTOPUS TEACHER gasps]

363
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,041
[TERASAKA]
Hmph!

364
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,291
[STUDENTS scream]

365
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,541
Ha! Yeah!

366
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,708
We did it!

367
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,083
--[KAEDE] Nagisa!
--[YOSHIDA] Yeah!

368
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,333
We're gonna be billionaires!

369
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,541
Sayonara!

370
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,041
--You jerks!
--What the hell have you done?!

371
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,083
Hah! Never saw a suicide
bomber comin', did ya?

372
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,375
[KAEDE]
Terasaka!

373
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,750
What'd did you make Nagisa do?!

374
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,000
What? I'm sorry,
you have a better idea?

375
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,875
I gave him a
modified toy grenade

376
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,625
filled with those stupid BB's.

377
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,625
And a spoonful or two
of gunpowder

378
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,000
so they'd scatter at a
high enough speed.

379
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,416
--[STUDENTS gasp]
--Don't worry,

380
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,541
it wasn't enough
to kill anybody.

381
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,916
I'll pitch in
on his medical bills.

382
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,291
Huh...?

383
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,250
Whoa. He doesn't even
have a mark on him.

384
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,625
And, what the hell
is this membrane?

385
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,958
Did the body, like--?

386
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,166
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
It's not a body, it's a husk.

387
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,833
I shed my skin once a month.

388
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,625
I wrapped it around
your classmate

389
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,500
to protect him from the blast.

390
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,375
[OCTOPUS TEACHER] I'm gonna go
out on a limb here

391
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,291
and assume you
didn't see this coming.

392
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:08,916
[OCTOPUS TEACHER] Terasaka.
Yoshida. Muramatsu.

393
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,291
[STUDENTS whimper]

394
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,500
[NAGISA] Okay, that's a face
we haven't seen before.

395
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,541
[whimpering continues]

396
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,583
[OCTOPUS TEACHER growls]

397
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,791
[NAGISA]
Pitch black must mean pissed.

398
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,333
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
This was your doing. Wasn't it?!

399
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,458
Who...? Us...?

400
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,875
It was all Nagisa!

401
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,333
[STUDENTS scream]

402
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:35,458
[TERASAKA]
Huh--?!

403
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,708
[STUDENTS scream]

404
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,958
[gasping]

405
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,083
[TERASAKA]
The nameplate off my house!

406
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,958
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Here's the deal, kiddos.

407
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,750
The agreement I have
with your government

408
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,791
forbids me from harming you.

409
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,333
But there's a catch.

410
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,916
If you pull another
irresponsible stunt

411
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,833
like that again....

412
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:59,041
There's nothing that says
I can't harm someone else.

413
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,458
Family... Friends...

414
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,208
Everyone in the world except
for you, if I feel like it.

415
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,416
[STUDENTS whimper]

416
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,750
[NAGISA] Suddenly it's clear
how hard this is going to be.

417
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,625
We can't run, we can't hide.

418
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,000
Slipping between the cracks
isn't an option.

419
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,833
--[NAGISA] The only way out...
--[OCTOPUS TEACHER laughs]

420
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,416
--...is to kill him.
--[OCTOPUS TEACHER laughs]

421
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,250
[TERASAKA]
Go on! Threaten us!

422
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,000
I ain't afraid of no squid!

423
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,041
Where do you get off
blowing up the moon?

424
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,166
We got rights, you know!
Call us irresponsible!

425
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,291
We're just defending ourselves!

426
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,750
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Of course. I know that.

427
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,500
I'm not calling you
irresponsible

428
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,125
for trying to kill me.

429
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,708
No, no, no.

430
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,750
As a matter of fact, Nagisa here
gets full marks for technique.

431
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,708
His composure was
simply outstanding.

432
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,500
However!

433
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,708
None of you cared
if he was injured.

434
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,041
Not even Nagisa
himself, it seems.

435
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,291
Students with that attitude

436
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,916
aren't fit to
assassinate anyone.

437
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You must believe yourself
worthy of your target.

438
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,375
That means taking pride in
what you do, in yourselves,

439
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,541
and each other.

440
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:12,125
All of you are more than
the sum of your parts.

441
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,375
[NAGISA]
Chewed out at Mach Twenty,

442
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,625
reassured by a tentacle wag.

443
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,958
It's a bizarre education.

444
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,875
But one I think is
starting to grow on me.

445
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,916
I guess, when you spend your
whole life being invisible,

446
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,500
well, it's something to
feel like you're being seen.

447
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,958
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Heh.

448
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,791
[FEMALE RESEARCHER A]
If you....

449
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,041
If you could sacrifice a
little bit of your time.

450
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:46,666
Give the children the tools
they need to succeed.

451
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,625
Such wonderful tentacles.

452
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,208
With hands like these,
you could reach them.

453
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,541
I know it in my heart.

454
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,291
[OCTOPUS TEACHER] Here's a
puzzler for you, Nagisa.

455
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,250
Given that I have
no intention of being killed.

456
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,375
Though, of course,
I have every intention

457
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,708
of enjoying our time together

458
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,875
before the planet
goes kerplooie.

459
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,833
What, exactly, are
you going to do about it?

460
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,458
[gasps]

461
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,000
[NAGISA] That's the
big question, isn't it?

462
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,208
It's not like we have
a lot of experience

463
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,000
figuring out how to
save the world.

464
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,125
I have a feeling, though.

465
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,166
One way or another...

466
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,833
...we're gonna be fast learners.

467
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,750
I think you'll find out
I can do plenty, sir.

468
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,291
Just you wait and see.

469
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,750
[OCTOPUS TEACHER laughs]

470
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,375
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
That's the spirit!

471
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,375
No one leaves
until I'm vanquished!

472
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,458
[STUDENTS groan]

473
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,791
[NAKAMURA]
Way to go, Nagisa.

474
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,750
[MAEHARA]
This is totally balls!

475
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,583
[NAGISA]
Yep. We're assassins.

476
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,041
Our target...

477
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,041
...is our teacher.

478
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,125
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Wipe it clean...

479
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,125
[SUGINO]
Man, I don't wanna be a killer.

480
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,875
[MAEHARA]
Ugh. We are so screwed.

481
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,708
[OKAJIMA]
We still don't know his name.

482
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,833
How do you say
"un-killable" in Japanese?

483
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:56,541
[NAGISA]
Huh?

484
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,166
Koro-sen-nai?

485
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,166
[gasps]

486
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,166
Koro-sen-say!

487
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,416
[NAGISA
"Koro Sensei?" 

488
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,666
[OCTOPUS TEACHER]
Huh?

489
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,666
[NAGISA]
That feels right.

490
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,875
Just us and Koro-sensei.

491
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:14,291
Here in our
Assassination Classroom.
