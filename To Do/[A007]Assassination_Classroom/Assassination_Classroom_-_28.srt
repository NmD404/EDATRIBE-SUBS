[KORO-SENSEI]
Okey-dokey, boys and girls!

2
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:13,208
The Second Term midterms
are only two weeks away!

3
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,291
The time has come
to surpass A-Class!

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,041
I want us going
into this red-hot!

5
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,291
Hotter than hades!
Hotter than the sun!

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,708
[MAEHARA]
That's too hot!

7
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,000
[NAGISA] Ever since we
sidestepped Asano's little trap

8
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,833
at the sports festival, E-Class
had been hunkering down

9
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,833
for the midterms.

10
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,166
We were stoked.

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,208
But at the same time,
the atmosphere was uneasy.

12
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:37,333
Only five months left until
the assassination deadline.

13
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,583
The clock was ticking.
We were impatient.

14
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Payback time!

15
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,750
[ALL whooping]

16
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,291
What a rush!

17
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,333
[YOSHIDA]
Yeah!

18
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,291
[OKAJIMA]
Wha'd I tell ya?

19
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,875
Coolest shortcut ever!

20
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,333
[BOTH]
Yeah it is!

21
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,875
[ISOGAI]
Guys! Wait up!

22
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,000
Hey! Not outside of class!

23
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,958
Relax! It's fine!

24
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,708
After the pole-toppling match?

25
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,416
People'd be suspicious
if we didn't do this!

26
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,458
[NAGISA]
This is incredible!

27
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,083
We should always
take this route!

28
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,916
[BOTH gasping]

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,791

Hm? Uh!

32
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,333
What was that noise?
Y' all right?

33
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,291
[gasps] Oh my word!

35
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,333
It seems the gentleman
has a hairline fracture

36
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,208
of the right femur.

37
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,791
Doctor says he should be on
his feet in about a week or so.

38
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,875
What complicates this is that
you kids are a state secret.

39
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,500
He'll likely settle
out of court,

40
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:27,041
but my men have to
negotiate a gag order.

41
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,083

I can't believe we--

42
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,125
[whoosh]

00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:35,958
[KORO-SENSEI growling]

44
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,625
Koro-sensei.

45
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,750
It... It wasn't our fault.
The street was too narrow.

46
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,416
Yeah, and who'd think
an old man'd be

47
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,416
ridin' his bike
through there, y'know?

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,833
Exactly.

49
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,375
I mean, what we did was
reckless and everything, sure.

50
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,833
But we were doing it to, like,
sharpen our skills and whatnot.

51
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,083
We gotta unwind. We're
under a lot of pressure.

52
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,875
Savin' the world's a big deal--

53
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,375
[KORO-SENSEI] Will that be
reported as my bringing harm

54
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,125
to some of the students?

55
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,458
[KARASUMA]
I'll overlook it this once.

56
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,875
I knew the risk
when I introduced

57
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,208
a higher level of training.

58
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,041
I take full responsibility.

59
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,916
You clearly weren't
ready. This is on me.

60
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,750
Sir, we're...

61
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,250
[BOTH]
Sorry.

62
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,041
[STUDENTS]
Sorry.

63
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Perhaps you've grown too strong

64
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,208
for your own good.

65
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,041
You were drunk on power.

66
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:40,541
You neglected to put yourselves
in the shoes of someone weaker.

67
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,791
That makes you no different
than your counterparts

68
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,833
on the main campus.

69
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,791
[NAGISA] It stung to be
called out like that,

70
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,916
but what could we
say in our defense?

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,375
We screwed up. It's
the least we deserved.

72
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,291
[ripping]

73
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,416
[KORO-SENSEI] We are now exactly
two weeks away from midterms.

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Consider yourselves prohibited
from studying for them.

75
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,083
This isn't a punishment.

76
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,750
There are simply other, more
important things to study first.

77
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,833
I ought to have included them
in the syllabus earlier.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,791
[KARASUMA] Please, accept
the offer, Mr. Matsukata.

79
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,041
[MATSUKATA]
No!

80
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,458
For all intents and purposes,

81
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,458
I'll be bedridden for
upwards of two weeks!

82
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,458
After what they pulled?
Standard restitution won't fly!

83
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,583
Oh, no! I'll need
something special.

84
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,166
Something with a bit of
groveling involved, I think--

85
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,083
What the hell?
What just happened?

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,583
Am I losing my damn mind

87
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,166
or did this room just become
a florist's all of a sudden?

my sincerest apologies!

how contrite I am, good sir!

caused you a world of trouble!

[TEACHER] Attention,
children. I have news.

00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,208
I'm afraid that Principal
Matsukata has been hurt,

96
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,041

him for a little while.

worry, he's fine.

And until he's back, these
young men and women

100
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,125
will here to lend us hand.

Why do I have to watch
these freakin' zygotes

Hey, we're a team.

to learn their lesson,

112

has to be onboard.

I'm sorry, guys.

114
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,083
Aw, it's all right.
We got ourselves into this.

115
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,000
We should've had the sense to
know someone could get hurt.

116
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,291
Yeah, whatever.

117
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,666
As long as I get to
appoint myself supervisor.

118
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,916
Though with you clowns,

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,625
it's more appropriate
to call me ringmaster.

[MURAMATSU, YOSHIDA]
Hey!

121
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,041
Huh. I propose we can stealth
study for midterms at home.

122
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,958
And thank our lucky stars
we got off so light.

123
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,625
Two weeks unpaid work?

124
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,000
Small price to pay for
the old man's silence.

125
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,416
We should be grateful.

plan on doing for us now?

You descend on our habitat
like a swarm of locusts.

can do is work off

some the oxygen you're
sucking up, you losers.

spent the past two of 'em

They don't call Sis Sakura
the Elite Neet for nothin'.

142
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,125
Isn't she way too
old for this place?

I don't know, dude.
Don't judge.

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,791
Maybe she just
really likes it here.

145

The real question is
whether you troglodytes

That section of the
floor is all wonky.

You're getting it fixed,
right? The building.

I mean, it does seem to be
getting sorta rickety.

If only we had the funds.

himself to the bone.

All 28 of us are
here for two weeks.

Yeah, a whole lotta things.

00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,458
You were gonna smack me
around either way, weren't ya?

174
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,958
Oh, wow. The fight
chorography is good.

175
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,333
No kidding!

176
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,250
And the girl's acting really
draw me into the story.

00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,833
Knock it off!

[KIDS gasping]

180
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,458
[KAEDE] Suddenly, the
mage's magical chloroform

181
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,500
put the beast to
sleep, unharmed.

182
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,125
And, thanks to chemistry, they
all lived happily ever after.

Sneaky!

[KAEDE]
That's our show, boys and girls!

[SUGAYA]
Kayano's fantastic with kids.

187
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,291

Plus, she's their size.

00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,208
So, what're we doing
with all this stuff again?

191
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,541
Oh, you'll see. Chiba
and Ritsu have blueprints.

192
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,041
[SUGAYA] Cool. Leave
the decorating to me.

193
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,333
[KIMURA, OKAJIMA, MAEHARA]
And drop.

194
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,708
That's awesome!

Aw, she's so adorable!

Uh-oh. Is the poor
kitty cat lost?

You kids are wonderful.

200
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,958
Who'd have thought these
children would ever be tutored

201
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,666
by students from a prestigious
junior high school.

Don't expect much, ma'am.

203
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,666
Kunugigaoka might be great,

204
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,208
but our class is definitely
bottom of the barrel.

[NAGISA] Sharp as she is,
Sakura's falling behind.

to primary school,

How do I explain these

someone her age can understand?

211
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,166
Man, this whole teaching
thing's harder than it looks.

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,625
Oh come on! I don't
have all day! Ugh.

213
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,916
At this rate I'll be middle-aged

before Tokyo University
accepts me!

215
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,916
Hey, this takes time.

216
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,583
[NAGISA]
So, uh...

217
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,333
Why'd you drop out
of primary school?

218
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,708
If you don't mind me asking.

219
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,083
[SAKURA]
Huh?

220
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,625
Why do you think,

00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,541
They treated me like poop.

222
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,375
[SAKURA]
It doesn't make sense.

223
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,833
You'd think kids that age
would be sweet and innocent,

225
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,500
Yeah, well the second they
learn how strong they are,

226
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,708
all they care about is picking
on the ones half their size.

227
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,708
[NAGISA]
That was a little on the nose.

228

[SAKURA] I know what you're
gonna say, so don't bother.

"It gets better. Stick it out,
otherwise the bullies win."

230
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,458
That's the same line
my parents feed me.

231
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,458
[SAKURA]
Whatever.

00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,833
I mean look who I'm talking to.

00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,333
You're weaker than I am.
You know how it is.

Oh dear.

I don't think she knows
how to get down.

Poor widdle thing
probably doesn't have

241
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,416
that much tree-climbing
experience.

242
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,875
Ya see what I mean?

243
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,083
The higher you go,
the more dangerous it is.

244
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,166
That's what courage gets you.

245
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,583
Thanks, but this gal prefers

246
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,625
to keep her feet planted
firmly on the ground.

247
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,166
Great, now we're dealing
with a cat in a tree.

248
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,291
I'll handle it.

249
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,458
C'mon, man. Like we
did in pole-toppling.

[NAGISA]
Look at it this way.

253
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,333
Let's pretend the tree
is primary school, right?

254
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,416
Where we're standing
is, well, this place.

255
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
We all start here, essentially.

256
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,583
And it's where our
strength comes from.

[KIDS]
Whoa!

258
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,000
We were looked down on, but
we never stopped looking up.

259
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,000
Even when the height made us
feel dizzy or insignificant,

260
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,166
or scared the crap out of us.

261
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,666
We learned how to climb by
taking it one rung at a time.

262
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,291
Who's a good, kitty?
Ow, my eye!

263
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,708
We reached the top,

264
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,625
but along the way we
forgot what it meant

265
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,458
to be scared of heights.

266
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,500
So every now and
then we lost our grip.

00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,125
Start from where you are now.

And not the sort of stuff
they cover in school.

At least not when
you're a student.

00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,500
How could a fellow

284
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,250
Well, anyway, let's hope
that ramshackle lean-to

the additional weight.

linked to the battery charger.

00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,541
this was all just a whitewash.

345
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,166
[SAKURA]
Hey, Nagisa!

346
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,000
Ta-da! I came in second!

347
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,500
Wow! That's fantastic!
Great job, Sakura!

348
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,041
The trick you told me
to do really worked!

349
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,125
I snuck in for the math portion
of the test like a ninja.

350
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,041
I finished. I left. Poof.

351
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,333
Pretty cool, huh?

352
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,125
The bullies were too busy
with their own exams

353
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,083
to mess with you.

354
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,000
[SAKURA]
Mm.

355
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,416
I caught them by surprise.

356
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,541
The teacher was the only person
who knew I was coming.

357
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,958
We call that getting the
drop on your opponent.

358
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,416
It's how we do
things in E-Class,

359
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,333
and it's done wonders for us.

360
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,791
Unveil your best attack

361
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,416
before the enemy even
gets into position.

362
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,875
I'm so proud of you. Keep on
using those hit-and-run tactics.

363
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,250
When you're ready
for primary school,

364
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,708
you'll have a full arsenal.

365
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,333
[SAKURA]
Um, so...

366
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,708
[NAGISA]
Uh?

367
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,500
You'll, uh, teach me
some more tricks, then?

368
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,916
Absolutely!

369
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,333
[MAEHARA]
That is one scary dude.

370
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,291
[MEG] He's terrifying
because he has no idea

371
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,041
how terrifying he is.

372
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,000
You little ratfinks.

373
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,375
You've left me no room
to complain, damn it.

374
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,875
Oh! Welcome back,
principal. Look at this.

375
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,708
[MATSUKATA] Suppose it's time
to run along back class now.

376
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,458
I believe there's some
important work ahead of you.

377
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,666
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

378
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,541
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

379
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,791
[KIDS]
See you later!

380
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:15,875
[NAGISA]
And with that,

381
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,666
our very special lesson
was at an end.

382
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,125
Still, though...

383
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,541
[NAGISA] The midterms
were the very next day.

384
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,625
[NAGISA]
It was a disaster.

385
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,041
The majority of E-Class got
booted out of the top spots.

386
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,458
[ALL sigh]

387
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,750
[ARAKI]
What a total letdown.

388
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,250
Oh well. Guess that first
time was just a fluke, huh?

389
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,375
[SEO] We didn't even need to
crush you at pole-toppling.

390
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:52,083
Aw, what's the matter, dorks?
Kitty cat got your tongue?

391
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,750
Grades are the end-all
be-all of this institution.

392
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,083
The bottom feeders have no right
to address the top echelon.

393
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,625
[KARMA]
No kidding?

394
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:04,000
Then by that logic I guess
you got nothin' to say to me.

395
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,708
[KORO-SENSEI] Despite
being forbidden to study,

396
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,291
one student remained undaunted
by the two-week handicap.

397
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,833
Of course, substantial traces
of prep work were clear

398
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,208
when I popped by the day
of Summer Festival.

399
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,708
One can't help but admire
the young man's initiative.

[sighs]

401
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,625
[KARMA]
I shouldn't get cocky.

402
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,958
Teach'll probably be all like,

403
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,208
"Nah, it doesn't count
'less you come in first."

404
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,375
Whoa, Karma.

405
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,958
Don't you people get it?

406
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,958
I'm the only one here you gave
it his all this time around.

Everybody else was
pulling their punches

to give you idiots a fair shot.

See, they were bein' nice
'cause we knew losing

410
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,750
would be worse for
you than for us.

411
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,208
Excuse me?

412
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:44,583
So, yeah. This was a freebie
and you only get one.

C'mon, guys.

00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:54,083
[NAGISA] Ha. Thank you, Karma.
You just covered for us.

[ISOGAI] We're sorry for
the trouble, Mr. Karasuma.

No harm, no foul.
All in a day's work.

[ALL gasp]

420
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,333
Did you kids take anything
away from this experience?

421
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,500
[STUDENTS]
Uh?

422
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,500
[NAGISA] That we're not
in this just for the money

423
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,500
or to bump up our grades.

424
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,041
We're in this to get stronger,

425
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,416
and to use that strength
for the greater good.

426
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,583
To help people.

Knowing how to kill gives us
the power to save the world.

00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,750
Intelligence gives us the power
to change someone's life.

429
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,208
And we learned not to be
reckless with our strength.

430
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,916
From this point forward,
we'll be careful.

Failure and frustration

432
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,125
can be wellsprings for growth.

Something tells me my boys
and girls will be richer

434
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,083
for this experience.

435
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:51,208
From here on out, they'll apply
themselves more thoughtfully.

436
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,541
Now then,

with the foie gras

00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh? Wh-What's going on?

445
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,166
I scarcely had time to breathe!

[KARASUMA] Brand new equipment
from your pal, the government.

448
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:32,166
I told them not to tip their
hand, but they couldn't resist.

449
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,250
They felt it was important
that you see for yourself

450
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,833
how discreet they can be.

451
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,208
[KAEDE chuckles]

452
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ooh.

453
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,958
Whatever you teach us,
we'll use it to kill you.

454
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,500
That's how Assassination
Classroom works.

455
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,750
But don't worry, sir,
you have our word.

456
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,000
We'll use what you
teach us for good.

457
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,291
See, as far as we're concerned,

458
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,041
our strength is for
protecting people.

459
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,041

Full marks for that answer.

460
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
When first I came to this class,

461
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,166
what bloodlust I
found was aimless,

462
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,916
and even then only a handful
of you possessed it.

463
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,541
There was negligible danger
of being assassinated,

464
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,750
but the atmosphere was stagnant.

465
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,291
Now however,

466
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:15,000
the whole campus is alive with
razor-sharp killer instinct.

467
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,833

I bet one of these days

468
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,541
you'll meet someone
just as important to you.

Indeed.

At the moment, I seem to be
surrounded by several.
