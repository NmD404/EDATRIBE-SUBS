1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,166
Keep eyes on the target.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,291
Right. Don't let
yourself be distracted.

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,708
If you can't predict his moves,

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,833
you can't effectively counter
his evasive maneuvers.

5
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,666
[KARASUMA] Not too shabby
for four months of training.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,791
Every day these kids
show more promise.

7
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,333
Take Isogai and
Maehara, for example.

8
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,083
Catlike reflexes.

9
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:33,083
When they work together, often
as not, their blades hit home.

10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,291
Then there's Karma.

11
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,875
At first blush, all
sarcasm and laziness,

12
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:40,666
but behind that facade lurks
the instinct of a killer.

13
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,125
[KARASUMA]
And the girls.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,750
Okano's gymnastics background
makes her moves hard to predict.

15
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,541
Meg easily has the
reach and momentum

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,291
of her male counterparts.

17
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,375
These are the standout,
would-be assassins of the group.

18
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't forget Koro-sensei.

19
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,541
The ideal teacher.

20
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,833
A man of grit and character whom
none have the heart to kill.

21
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,833
This is my interior
monologue, damn it.

22
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,166
No one wants your two cents.

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,416
[KARASUMA]
Truth be told,

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,041
the other students may
have a long way to go,

25
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,041
but they've come a lot
further than I dared hope.

00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,708

Ouch.

[gasps] Sorry!

31
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,666
That block was a
little over the top.

Ah. I'm good, no worries.

You gotta see stuff
like that comin'.

Yeah...

36
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,666
[KARASUMA]

37
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,625
What the--? Did I just have a
momentary lapse of sanity?

[KORO-SENSEI grunts]

39
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,208
Man, I'm having no luck
hitting that guy.

40
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,875
[OKAJIMA] There's, like, zero
chinks in Mr. Karasuma's armor.

'Scuse me, sir?

42
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,166
We were wondering if you'd like
to grab a bite to eat with us.

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,625
Sorry, no. I'd love to,

44

Oh.

46
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,083
[MIMURA] Zero chinks
in his personal life, too.

47
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,125
[OKANO]
He's definitely a man

48
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,916
who prefers to keep
his distance.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,625
It's like there's a wall
of ice between him and us.

50
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,958
Yeah, don't get me wrong,

51
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,041
He's super cool and
everything, I mean...

52

it's only 'cause he has to be?

Handmade éclairs from Le Hermes!

Um, these look sorta
pricy, sir. Are you sure?

65
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,458
Yeah! Chow down, kiddos!
I didn't break the bank

66
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,041
so we could stare at
these babies all day!

67
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,458
You really know your way around
brand-name sweets, don't 'cha?

Nice.

So, you're gonna take over P.E.

72
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,000
to help Mr. Karasuma
get caught up?

Yep! Those are my marchin'
orders from the brass at HQ.

time to himself--

must be Koro-sensei.

Now, things are gonna
be tougher than usual,

just saving them for yourself?

How you kosher with this idiot?

00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,833
If he was a toupee, a chinstrap
couldn't make him look phonier.

00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,791
Even Karma can tell,
and he's not here today.

Look, he and I go back
to the Airborne Brigade.

We're not best
friends or anything,

I have, he's a great teacher.

He speaks their language.

105

That's what you
want in an educator.

106
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,041
[KARASUMA] I think maybe
I've been going about this

107
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,375
the wrong way.

108
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,041
My approach was to draw
a line, stay professional,

109
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:59,291
but taking on the role of father
figure might be more effective.

Rule number two. We're
a family, and I'm the dad.

the dad ain't in charge

a family in crisis.

for you, sit it out.

That said, I'd much rather
see you stick it out.

A father loves each of his
children unconditionally.

been filling their heads with

172
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,625
while my back was
turned, it stops now.

173
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,166
Ha. Sorry, big guy.
This isn't your class.

174
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,208
You teach your subjects,
I'll teach mine.

175
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,541
In Phys Ed, I call the shots.

176
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,916
Nothing I've done falls outside
acceptable corporal punishment.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,833
I gotta train these
kids to kill you.

178
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,375
That doesn't leave
me a lotta time.

179
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,875
I don't have the luxury
of goin' easy on 'em.

180
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,625
What, are you gonna attack me?

181
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,375
Over a dispute about
educational philosophy?

182
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,583
'Cause that's what this is,

183
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,875
you just don't care
for the way I teach.

184
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,333
[KORO-SENSEI] The man will crush
those children, body and spirit.

185
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,166
And he's right, and
I don't care for it,

186
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,166
but civility dictates I let
him teach as he sees fit.

187
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,875
That's why I'm counting on you.

188
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,041
You're on par with
this fellow, are ya not?

189
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,083
I need you to shut him down.

190
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,583
[KARASUMA]
Me? That's rich.

191
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,333
[TAKAOKA] Bet this really
grinds your gears, Karasuma.

192
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,041
Me stealin' these kids
out from under you.

193
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,875
You were always top
dog of our old brigade,

194
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,208
never gave a damn
about what I could do.

195
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,583
And yet, here I am

196
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:28,041
throwin' a monkey wrench
into your shot at promotion.

197
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,916
Let half of these snot-nosed
punks be pulverized.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,875
If I can shape the other half
into octopus-killin' warriors,

199
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,916
it'll be me reapin' the glory
when the deed is done.

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,291
You'll be lickin' my boots

201
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,666
till the day they
put you out to pasture.

202
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,125
[SUGAYA]
This is seriously not funny.

203
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,125
[OKAJIMA] 300 squats?
We're gonna freakin' die!

204
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,791
Mr. Karasuma, please.

205
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,583
[TAKAOKA]
Watch it.

206
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,000
[gasps]

207
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,083
Mr. Karasuma ain't part
of our family, doll-face.

208
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,708
Someone needs a lesson.

209
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,541
Disrespecting daddy
makes him very angry!

210
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,625
[HINANO screams]

211
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,333
[KARASUMA]
That's enough.

212
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,000
If you hurt these kids, then
you'll have to answer to me.

213
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,541
Ah! There it is. I was wonderin'

214
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,291
when you were gonna throw
your chips in, old buddy. Heh.

215
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,458
[TAKAOKA] Waitin' to
make this interesting.

216
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,708
What's the big deal?

217
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,166
Who are you to criticize
how I choose to teach?

218
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,333
If this is something you an'
me need to settle like men,

219
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,625
then I'm up for the challenge.

220
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,333
Just remember,
we're teachers first.

221
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,875
Here's what I propose.

222
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,375
Cherry pick your star pupils

223
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,666
out of the students you've
trained by your methods.

224
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,291
Set 'em on me, and if their
knife so much as grazes my aura,

225
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,250
I'll concede that the way you
train is superior to mine.

226
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,666
No fuss. No back pedaling.
I'll pack it in and leave.

227
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,041
[STUDENTS gasping]

228
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,041
[TAKAOKA]
We won't be using these, though.

229
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,166
No, sir, we won't.

230
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,666
[STUDENTS gasp]

231
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,625
When the object is to
kill a human being,

232
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,666
you can't rely on toys.

233
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,750
So we'll be using
the real McCoy.

234
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,833
[KARASUMA]
He wants to use an actual knife?

235
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,416
This is ridiculous!

236
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,375
These kids aren't prepared to
take down a real human being,

237
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,458
and you know it!

238
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,375
Don't get all concerned
citizen on me,

239
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,583
they ain't gotta kill
nothin', just come close.

240
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:17,833
And I'll do you a solid by
defending myself barehanded.

241
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,500
[TAKAOKA] This little
trick works beautifully

242
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,916
in the big leagues, too.

243
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,541
Take a fresh-faced recruit

244
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,500
wielding a blade
for the first time,

245
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,666
pummel the poor bastard within
an inch of his life, unarmed,

246
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,500
and bingo! Instant
Alpha Dog status.

247
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,083
What're you waiting for?
Pick yourself a champion.

248
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,375
Or save us the headache

249
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,250
and agree to let me run
this show from now on.

250
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,625
[KARASUMA] Wish I could
say I was sure about this.

251
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,708
Are his methods
as bad as all that?

252
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,541
Maybe his
take-no-prisoners policy

253
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,000
is what saving
the world calls for.

254
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,291
[KARASUMA] I'm not sure
of anything anymore.

255
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,500
Still, look at 'em.

256
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,041
How could I put one of
these kids on the spot?

257
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,291
Do I even have a star pupil?

258
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,625
[KARASUMA]
Nagisa. You're up.

259
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,541
[SUGINO] What?
Wait, are you kidding?

260
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,750
In my eyes, we're all
fellow soldiers on a mission

261
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,958
to save the Earth
from destruction.

262
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,083
Whatever our differences
are, we share that goal.

263
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,583
The least you kids deserve
for being put in this situation

264
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,875
is my respect.

265
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,625
I may not be much
of a father figure,

266
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,541
but I appreciate your dilemma.

267
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,958
So if you don't
feel comfortable,

268
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,291
you don't have to
take up the knife.

269
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,250
Our duty as teachers is
to prepare you for life,

270
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,041
not force you into it
kicking and screaming.

271
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,041
[NAGISA] This man always
looks me in the eyes.

272
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:49,000
My own family can't even do
that. But him? No problem.

273
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,958
Man. There must be so much
he's not allowed to tell us.

274
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,833
And I can't imagine
why he's choosing me.

275
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,625
[NAGISA]
But...

276
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,791
[NAGISA] If he sees fit
to hand me the knife,

277
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll trust his
decision and take it.

278
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,833
Either way, Takaoka
is out of control.

279
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,958
Somebody has to do something.

280
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,708
I'm your guy.

281
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,916
Oh, come on. This twig?

282
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,666
Eyes must be goin'
in your old age.

283
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,416
What would possess that
dumb bastard to pick him?

284
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,708
This is gonna be
a train wreck.

285
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Patience. You'll see.

286
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,916
You think Nagisa will
get anywhere near him?

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,083
I don't think so. Guy's a pro.

288
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,333
Hell, how would you do
with a real knife?

289
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,041
[KAEDE]
Oh, Nagisa.

290
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,125
Ready when you are.

291
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,583
[TAKAOKA]
This is gonna be fun.

292
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,541
Time to school these kids in
the art of real humiliation.

293
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,416
Dodge. Taunt. Beat.

294
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,875
Wash, rinse, repeat.

295
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,875
[KARASUMA] It's important you
understand this is real to him.

296
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,083
He intends to make
an example out of you.

297
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,583
Treat this like any
other assassination.

298
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,625
You don't have to be
stronger than your target.

299
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,708
Just get one good strike
in and the job is done.

300
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,916
That's it. One.

301
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,375
[TAKAOKA]
It's dawning on him.

302
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,958
Stakes are pretty high when
the knife in your hand is real.

303
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,708
He's thinking, "Wait a second,
this is for keepsies.

304
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,583
I can't take the life
of another human being."

305
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,666
There's nothin' sweeter than the
sight of a rookie turning pale

306
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,333
at the thought
of his first kill.

307
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,166
[NAGISA] Okay, this is bound
to be a little different

308
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,416
than what I'm used to,
so I need to stay focused.

309
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,041
Just remember
Mr. Karasuma's advice.

310
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,333
One strike. I just
need one strike.

311
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,458
[NAGISA]
I just need to kill him.

312
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,458
So I'll give him a smile.

313
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,416
Walk towards him calmly.

314
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,916
Totally nonchalant. Like
I'm on the way to school.

315
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,375
[NAGISA] And before he knows
what's up, this gets real.

316
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,791
That's right.
You're about to die.

317
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,416
No one keeps it together
when they realize that.

318
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,791
Even Koro-sensei
gets thrown off.

319
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,375
And you're nothing
compared to him.

320
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,291
Once you lose your balance,
all it takes is a little tug.

321
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:24,041
Here, let me help
you down. There we go.

322
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,291
You can block from
the front. No problem.

323
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,875
But when it's an attack
from behind? Good luck.

324
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,375
Looks like I win.

325
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,791
[STUDENTS gasping]

326
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,333
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

327
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,833
[KARASUMA]
What the hell?

328
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,708
Not something you see every day.

329
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:47,750
Son of a bitch. The talent
this kid's got in unreal.

330
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,875
The way he strolls
up to the target,

331
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,625
hiding his intent
until the last second.

332
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,458
Springing on them like a python.

333
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,083
That explains the chill
I got from him earlier.

334
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,666
This goes beyond
the instincts of a killer.

335
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,416
Nagisa isn't a normal boy.
He's a natural-born assassin.

336
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,166
But should I nurture a gift
like his, or shut it down?

337
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,375
Oh, wait a second.

338
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,125
Was I s'posed to use
the back of my knife?

339
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'll take that, thank you.

340
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,875
Game, set, and
match, Mr. Karasuma.

341
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,041
[KARASUMA grunts]

342
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Outrageous!

343
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,541
Giving one of my
students a real knife!

344
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,208
Have you lost your marbles?

345
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,208
He could have been
hurt, or worse!

346
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,000
[NAGISA chuckles]

347
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,583
[KARASUMA] Pretty sure you're
quick enough on your feet

348
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,041
to have kept that from
happening. Still, though...

349
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,333
[STUDENTS chatting]

350
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,916
Easy, guys. Let's not make
a big deal out of it, okay?

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I just did what Mr. Karasuma
told me to, that's all.

352
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,958
Ow! What was that for?

353
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,291
[MAEHARA]
Sorry, uh...

354
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,250
I needed to make
sure that was you.

355
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,041
Sincerely, though.
You're awesome!

356
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,375
That whole ordeal
was a total rush!

357
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,583
[NAKAMURA] That smile on your
face right before you got him...

358
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
If ever a man unsure of himself

359
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,750
right up the moment
of truth, it's you.

360
00:16:58,833 --> 00:16:59,708
Think so, huh?

361
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mh-hm.

362
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,333
--[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]
--[thud]

363
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,541
[BOTH]
Hm?

364
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,875
You ungrateful punks!

365
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,708
You think it's fun shaming
your father figure, huh?

366
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,583
Having the time of your lives
pretending you've won?!

367
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,083
Hope it was worth it

368
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:19,875
'cause daddy's about rip you
apart. Mind, body, and soul!

369
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh-uh-uh.

370
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,250
[NAGISA] Not gonna lie, if we
went for a round two, I'd lose.

371
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,375
But I'll tell you something.

372
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,583
Whatever you do, you're
not the boss of us.

373
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,458
Mr. Karasuma is
our P.E. teacher.

374
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,000
That's all there is to it.

375
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,625
When you try to be our dad,

376
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,666
it just makes us
feel like children.

377
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,541
Mr. Karasuma may come
off as all business,

378
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,375
but he treats us as equals.

379
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:48,666
He's approachable, he's cool,
and he's got nothing to prove.

380
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,583
Thanks for trying,
but he's the Class Dad.

381
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,166
Am I the Class Mom?

382
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
To teach is also

383
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,875
to confront such answers
head on. Moreover,

384
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:08,041
to do so by drawing from the
well of their confidence in us.

385
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,208
A student confidently
answers a question

386
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,041
you yourself were troubled by.

387
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,958
And that's only the beginning.

388
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
To teach is also

389
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,291
to confront such answers
head on. Moreover,

390
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,416
to do by drawing from the well
of their confidence in us.

391
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,791
[yelling]

392
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,208
[KARASUMA] Sorry if my
colleague's a bit too big

393
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,625
for his britches.

394
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,208
He's not in a position
to threaten you.

395
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,416
Don't give him
another thought.

396
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,958
I'll negotiate with my superiors

397
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,916
to put things back
the way they were.

398
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,375
[STUDENTS]
Mr. Karasuma!

399
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,916
[TAKAOKA groaning]

400
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,791
It's gonna take more than
that to be done with me!

401
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,791
You'll get this job
over my dead body--!

402
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,666
[ASANO]
That won't be unnecessary.

403
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,583
[KARASUMA]
Principal Asano.

404
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,541
[ASANO] I trust you'll forgive
the intrusion, everyone.

405
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,583
I came to see our
new hire in action.

406
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,000
And it must be said,

407
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,333
your methods are nothing
short of a travesty.

408
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,041
Granted, fear is
the engine of education,

409
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,791
but a teacher able to instill
fear only through violence

410
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,541
is nothing but a brute.

411
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,708
And I do not employ brutes.

412
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,333
[TAKAOKA]
But I was only trying to--

413
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,333
[ASANO]
Your walking papers.

414
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,916
The Ministry of Defensive
does not call the shots here

415
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,708
and I intend to
keep it that way.

416
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,583
This is my school
and my school alone.

417
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,166
Remember that.

418
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,333
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it!

419
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,250
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

420
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:40,250
[TAKAOKA crying]

421
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,750
The man got handed
a pink slip?

422
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,458
Does that mean
Mr. Karasuma's back

423
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,791
to being our gym teacher again?

424
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,708
[STUDENTS cheering, laughing]

425
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,041
[KORO-SENSEI] I see the
principal's confident as ever

426
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,958
in his methods.

427
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,041
[KARASUMA]
That makes one of us at least.

428
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Eh?

429
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,708
[KARASUMA] What if Nagisa said
he wanted to be an assassin

430
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,125
when he grew up?

431
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,541
Could you lead him there
with a clear conscience?

432
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,250
[KARASUMA] I don't think
he realizes it yet,

433
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,250
but he's got what it takes.

434
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,458
[KORO-SENSEI] That's certainly a
tricky one, I'll give you that.

435
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,000
Alas, such dilemma's
come with the territory.

436
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,750
Every teacher
secretly frets over

437
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,958
whether the path he sets his
students on is the right one.

438
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,000
But he points the way to the
best future he can see for them.

439
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,500
Questions of right and wrong
are often open-ended.

440
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,250
We ask them, but the students
must live their own answer.

441
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,583
The pleasure of
seeing them do so

442
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,875
is what makes this
job exhilarating!

443
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,875
[KARASUMA]
Hm.

444
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,041
[NAKAMURA]
Mr. Karasuma, sir?

445
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,458
We were wondering,

446
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,333
since we kind of got your
job back for you and all,

447
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,833
maybe we've got something in the
way of a li'l thank you coming?

448
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,958
Yeah. Mr. Takaoka
would've given us

449
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,208
a buncha sweets
for being so good.

450
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,083
Well now, I'm not much
of a connoisseur.

[IRINA]
Sucker!

455
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,333
[KORO-SENSEI] Uh, surely
I deserve some thanks, too?

456
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,375
[OKANO]
Ha. Oh yeah? For doing what?

457
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,791
[SUGAYA] You've pretty much been
on the sidelines the whole time.

458
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Au contraire, boys and girls!

459
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,375
I was scrutinizing your plight
in thoughtful silence

460
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,083
in hopes of demonstrating
to Mr. Karasuma...

461
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,625
[HINANO]
Whatever. Let's go, Class Dad!

462
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,625
We can show you all the
best places to buy...

463
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,041
[KARASUMA]
Sure.

464
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,750
I might have my share of doubts
about being a teacher.

465
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,791
But this place is really
starting to grow on me.

466
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:26,041
[KORO-SENSEI gurgling]

467
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,000
[OKANO]
Gross! Is that how he grovels?

468
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,208
[NAKAMURA] How badly
does he want this stuff?

469
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,458
--[OKANO, NAKAMURA scream]
--[KORO-SENSEI] Please, please!
