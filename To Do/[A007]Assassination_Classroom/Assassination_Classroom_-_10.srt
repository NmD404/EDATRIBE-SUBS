1
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:14,791
"Oh, sexy guy. It's a miracle!"

2
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:15,583
See?

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,000
Simple.

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,916
Icebreakers like this guarantee
a good first impression.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,625
Now, I'm sure we all know
someone who's absolute crap

6
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:26,333
with small talk. Ha.
Maybe we are that person.

7
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,375
The trick is to put yourself
in the shoes of your target.

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,166
Kimura, throw me
an ice-breaker, quick!

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,000
Uh.

10
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,041
Hey, there?

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,375
[IRINA]
No, no!

12
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,458
You're just shifting
the burden of conversation.

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,375
If you want a meaningful
response, the other person

14
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,333
has to feel you're
pulling your own weight.

15
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,125
Try coming at them guns blazing
with an interesting observation.

16
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,625
[KIMURA]
Okay?

17
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,833
[IRINA] Conversation is a
challenge for the best of us,

18
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,166
and that's okay.

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,750
Don't think in terms
of finding the right words.

20
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,125
Let them find you.

21
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:54,166
Just let the conversation flow.

22
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,166
Finesse it like
a full-tongued kiss.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,291
[IRINA]
Ugh!

24
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,416
Teaching is such
a pain in the ass!

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,333
At least the students are
finally taking a shine to you.

26
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,416
Oh, yeah. Sure.
'Cause that's a load off.

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Come on, I'm an assassin.

28
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,791
I'm supposed to be
killing people,

29
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,000
not hunting octopus with brats.

30
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,958
And while we're on the subject
of tentacled pervs...

31
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,916
...the son of a bitch is
staring at my tits!

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,625
Sipping tea doesn't
make it classy!

33
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Have I mentioned

34
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,375
how much I admire
your "perky" teaching methods?

35
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,458
Shut your face!

36
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,416
--[KORO-SENSEI giggles]
--[IRINA grunts]

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,583
[KARASUMA]
Stand down.

38
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,041
You know he's just
pushing your buttons.

39
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:04,916
Yeah, well...

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,625
I'll push his buttons!

41
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,083
[KARASUMA]
Hmm...

42
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hm. She's feisty today.

43
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,958
[KARASUMA] Huh. Can't
imagine why that might be.

44
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,416
[IRINA]
I have better things to do

45
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,625
than twiddle my
thumbs in this dump.

46
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,291
If I could just bag the
squirrelly bastard.

47
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,375
[IRINA gasps, yelps]

48
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,500
[IRINA whimpers]

49
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,166
[IRINA] 
A snare trap?

50
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,791
Who the hell?!

51
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,958
[LOVRO]
You catch me off guard, Irina.

52
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,166
Watching you babysit
bunch of kids.

53
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,583
It's like TV comedy show.

54
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,333
Sir. Why are you here?

55
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,875
[KARASUMA]
What's going on here?

56
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,791
This is your only warning, pal.

57
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,458
Let her go.

58
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,750
[LOVRO]
Don't worry about it.

59
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,875
She knows how to handle herself.

60
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,500
[IRINA gasps]

61
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,416
[IRINA grunts]

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,541
[KARASUMA]
Right.

63
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,916
So, uh.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,791
Have we met each other
somewhere, or is it just me?

65
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,458
We haven't met in person.

66
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,375
But you know my reputation.

67
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,875
I do freelance work
for government.

68
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,000
As matter of fact,
I'm the guy who arranged

69
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:08,000
to bring Irina Jelavich into the
mix. I'm human resources man.

70
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,291
[KARASUMA grunts]

71
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,250
[KARASUMA]
Lovro the Assassin!

72
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,625
One of the most dangerous
men who's ever lived.

73
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,166
Now retired.

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,458
Trains assassins and books gigs
for them all over the world.

75
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:22,333
Makes a killing.
No pun intended.

76
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,750
At the crucial moment,
he came through for us,

77
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,875
Jelavich is his protégé.
But why is he here now?

78
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,458
This Koro-sensei fellow
happen to be near?

79
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,708
I think he's in Shanghai
picking up some almond jelly.

80
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,458
Left about a half-hour ago.

81
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,375
Should be back any minute.

82
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,708
[LOVRO chuckles]

83
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,208
So rumors of his speed
haven't been exaggerated.

84
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,958
Well. Good.
Glad I came when I did.

85
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,000
You run along home, Irina.
I'll take it from here.

86
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,000
It's clear you're out
of your depth.

87
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,666
[IRINA gasps]

88
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,791
[LOVRO]
Don't get me wrong:

89
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,250
on undercover jobs,
you're the best.

90
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,375
Once your cover's
been blown, however.

91
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,166
Well, let's face it,
you're no Charlotte Corday.

92
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,958
[IRINA] You have to
give me a chance, sir!

93
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,916
I can do this! I know I can!

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,666
[IRINIA yelps]

95
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,958
[IRINIA whimpers]

96
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,208
[KARASUMA]
He's fast.

97
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,708
[LOVRO]
What have I always taught you?

98
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,208
Everyone has their strengths
and their weaknesses.

99
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,166
A good assassin knows
when to go home.

100
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Congratulations!

101
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,083
You're exactly half wrong
and half right.

102
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,458
[KARASUMA]
Hey, hey. Cool it, Game Show.

103
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Another ridiculous nickname?

104
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you determined never
to call me Koro-sensei?

105
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,500
It's you.

106
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
I agree.

107
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,500
As an assassin, our beloved
Irina is nothing special.

108
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,333
Frankly, she's crap.

109
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,708
No one was asking you!

110
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,791
[KORO-SENSEI] Having said
that, she belongs here.

111
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,666
She is, in fact, a perfect
fit for this class.

112
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,083
[IRINA]
Huh?

113
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,416
[KORO-SENSEI] To prove
my point, I propose a kill-off.

114
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,375
Let us see which
of you passes muster.

115
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,208
Who is the better assassin?

116
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,791
The rules are simple.

117
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,708
Whomever kills our friend Mr.
Karasuma first is the winner.

118
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,083
[KARASUMA]
Excuse me?

119
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,625
Why the hell am I the target
here all of a sudden?

120
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
It has to be you, silly.

121
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,500
I'm un-killable.

122
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,750
[KARASUMA grumbles]

123
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Here. You have all day tomorrow.

124
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,541
Oh, I see.

125
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,875
So it's to be a
pretend assassination.

126
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,625
Why not? Heh.

127
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,666
There are worse ways
to pass time.

128
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,500
[KARASUMA sighs]

129
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,000
[KARASUMA]
Suit yourself.

130
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,583
[IRINA] Is this your idea
of sticking up for me?

131
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Heh-ah?

132
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,541
Shut up! I know what this is:
you're hedging your bets on me

133
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,208
because you think
I'm easier to manage

134
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,958
than some new schmuck, right?

135
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,833
Well, if you don't think I've
got what it takes to kill

136
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:30,000
Karasuma and you, somebody's
in for a rude awakening!

137
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Huh...

138
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,541
[KARASUMA] So there it is.
Expect a few disruptions today,

139
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,625
and hopefully it won't interfere
with your studies too much.

140
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,458
Just carry on
as normal, all right?

141
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,166
Eh...

142
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,000
[NAGISA]
Poor guy.

143
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,708
He just can't catch a break.

144
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,083
[IRINA]
Yoo-hoo!

145
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:47,708
[ALL gasp]

146
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,583
[KARASUMA]
Hm?

147
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,291
[IRINA] Excellent work today!

148
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,500
I'll bet you've worked up
quite a thirst. Aww!

149
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,333
Have an ice-cold beverage!

150
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,208
[KURASUMA groans]

151
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,458
Here, go ahead
and knock it back.

152
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,958
It tastes like a rainbow!

153
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,125
[ISOGAI]
She drugged it.

154
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,000
[MAEHARA]
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

155
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,958
Probably some sort
of muscle relaxant.

156
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,041
Immobilize and stab,
oldest trick in the book.

157
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,416
[IRINA]
Uh!

158
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,625
[KARASUMA sighs]

159
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,000
[KARASUMA]
What do you take me for?

160
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,333
No man in his right mind

161
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,583
would let you close
enough to give him a drink.

162
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,291
[IRINA growls]

163
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,375
Well. Why don't I
just put in here

164
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,583
so you can take it at
your leisure--Ow!

165
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,500
Oh... Ohh!

166
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,958
Pick me up, Karasuma!

167
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,583
--Carry me piggyback? Please?
--[KARASUMA] Um, no.

168
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,458
Have some self-respect.
This is sad.

169
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,875
You okay, Professor Bitch?

170
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,208
Hey, no offense,

171
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,583
but that little ploy
wouldn't have fooled anyone.

172
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,916
My options are limited, okay?

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,708
I can't seduce someone
who knows my M.O!

174
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,750
Chalk it down to
occupational hazard!

175
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,500
It's like a paid escort trying
to put the moves on her old man!

176
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,833
He knows her too well for
her charms to land their mark!

177
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,833
[ISOGAI, MAEHARA]
That's sick!

178
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,833
[IRINA]
Damn it.

179
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,708
I'm racing against
the clock here.

180
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,541
When Lovro's got
a target in his sights,

181
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,250
it's only a matter of time.

182
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,750
He strikes like
a thief in the night.

183
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
What do ya think?

184
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,041
Exhilarating being
the kill-ee, isn't it?

185
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,541
Oh, it's a barrel of laughs.
Wait a second...

186
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,166
Exactly what happens if
I manage to dodge them both?

187
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,625
[KORO-SENSEI] Huh...
I hadn't thought of that.

188
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,166
I suppose in all fairness,
you'd be the winner.

189
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,541
What do I win?

190
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,083
[KORO-SENSEI] How about
I agree to stand stock-still

191
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,958
in front of you for
an entire second?

192
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,791
You may shoot and or
stab me at will.

193
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,958
Don't tell the others, though.

194
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,875
We don't want kickoff
a feeding frenzy.

195
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,083
The pot might be a little too
rich to keep everyone honest.

196
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,083
[KARASUMA]
Hmm...

197
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,958
Whatever you say.

198
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Heh?

199
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,291
[ALL gasp]

200
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:44,875
[KARASUMA grunts]

201
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,250
[IRINA]
Head-on?

202
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,083
[KARASUMA grunts]

203
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,125
[KARASUMA yells]

204
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,541
[KARASUMA]
With all due respect, my friend,

205
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,083
how straightforward did you
think this was going to be?

206
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,208
You've got skill, but frankly
the years haven't been kind.

207
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,541
Until recently, I was in
the Elite Special Force.

208
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,416
[LOVRO]
He is tough one.

209
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
[IRINA] If Lovro can't
get his hooks into him,

210
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,708
what the hell chance do I have?

211
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,166
Hey, wanna win?
Step up your game.

212
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,250
You've only got today.

213
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,666
[BOTH scream]

214
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,458
Hold on a sec,
why are you scared?

215
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't worry about it!

216
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,041
Just do your best,
and try not to lose!

217
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,208
[KARASUMA]
FYI: With a good knife,

218
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,083
I can strike five
times in a second.

219
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,916
So, should be fun.

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,500
[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]

221
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,708
[IRINA gasps]

222
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,375
--Sir, you... your hand
--[KORO-SENSEI] Uh?

223
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,916
[LOVRO groans]

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,416
I suppose I can't expect to
kill today in this condition.

225
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,583
[KORO-SENSEI yelps]

226
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
What kind of talk it that?

227
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,000
Nonsense! That's what it is!
You can do this! Think positive!

228
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,416
[LOVRO]
Even if I wasn't a relic.

229
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,416
Even if I could kill that man.
You'd still be out of my reach.

230
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,625
Same goes for Irina
when you get down to it.

231
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,875
If I can't do it,
neither can she.

232
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Very well.

233
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,166
If giving up is your choice,
don't let me stop you.

234
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,041
But at least stick around
to support your protégé.

235
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,875
After all, whatever else
one might say about her skills,

236
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,375
she's certainly proven herself

237
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,791
a capable wielder
of death before.

238
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:13,750
[LOVRO]
Hm.

239
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,791
Once upon a time, yes.

240
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,125
[IRINA]
Level with me, okay?

241
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,791
Do you honestly believe I can
take down someone like Karasuma?

242
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Of course.

243
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,333
I can't speak to what you may

244
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,833
or may not have learned
at the feet of your guru.

245
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,541
But based on what I've
seen you accomplish

246
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,500
since you've been here, I'd
be a dolt to think otherwise.

247
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,541
Case in point.

248
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,583
The lingerie you
ordered yesterday!

249
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,666
If that's not initiative,
I don't know what is!

250
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,500
[IRINA]
Uh! Perv!

251
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,458
[KORO-SENSEI] If you want
others to believe in you,

252
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,375
you've got to believe in you.
Show them what you've got:

253
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,375
Karasuma, this Lovro
fellow, the children.

254
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,166
[IRINA]
Hm.

255
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,208
[chatter]

256
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,791
Yo. Have a look at
this, man, it's Mr. K.

257
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,250
[NAGISA]
Huh?

258
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,750
[KAEDE] Oh, yeah. He's been
eating his lunch out there

259
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,000
a lot lately for some reason.

260
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,708
While he's smackin'
on his sandwich,

261
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,166
the spider move in for the kill.

262
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,833
Looks like Professor Bitch
is gonna go for it.

263
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,416
Mind if we talk for
a sec? You an' me?

264
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
What now? I'm aware this
is a pretend assassination,

265
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,083
but I'm done screwin' around.

266
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:15,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Huh.

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,708
She has a knife, I see.

268
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,083
Surely she knows he can smell
the ruse from a mile away.

269
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,375
The woman's a fool.

270
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,583
[IRINA]
Aw, come on.

271
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,541
Don't be such a
stick in the mud.

272
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,458
I'm a girl willing to do
whatever it takes to stay here.

273
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,333
You know that about me.

274
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,041
No more screwin' around.

275
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,333
Unless that's what
you'd prefer in exchange.

276
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,375
One good turn
deserves another, yeah?

277
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,750
You just call the game, love.

278
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,791
[KARASUMA]
It's as simple as that, huh?

279
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,000
If I take her knife,
this nonsense will be over.

280
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,333
All right, fine. Jab me.

281
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,083
Just be quick about it, though.

282
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,000
[IRINA gasps]

283
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,958
[IRINA]
You're a good sport.

284
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mr. Lovro,

285
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,750
you've been Miss Irina's teacher
for some time, have you not?

286
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,166
[LOVRO]
Hm?

287
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,500
[KORO-SENSEI] You've noted
her communication skills,

288
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,541
her versatility with words?

289
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,500
To watch her pass
that on to her students

290
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,458
is to watch a master at work.

291
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,125
She's fluent in ten languages

292
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,500
because she's fluent
in the ways of people.

293
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,041
When she finds the right words,
there's no one she can't reach.

294
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,625
And nowhere, I suspect,

295
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,416
is she in more command of her
particular gifts than here.

296
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,458
What do ya suppose
she's been up to?

297
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:23,958
[LOVRO grunts]

298
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,208
Gott im Himmel.

299
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,375
'Kay.

300
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,916
Ready or not, here I come!

301
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,416

[BOTH grunt]

304
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,166
[OKAJIMA]
Didn't see that coming!

305
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,500
Man, this is hot!

306
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,250
[SUGINO]
Yeah! Who's the bitch now?

307
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,875
[KORO-SENSEI] She's building
the skills to kill me

308
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,458
in much the same way
she'd acquire a new language.

309
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,750
Methodically, feeling
out the terrain,

310
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,875
drilling vocabulary,
so to speak.

311
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,083
One look inside her bag

312
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,333
and you'll see there's
no room for doubt.

313
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,166
This is definitely
a woman with a plan.

314
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,916
[IRINA]
Say goodnight!

00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,125
Take it easy, huh?

00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,291
[IRINA]
Great.

318
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,791
If this comes down
to strength, I'm boned.

319
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,958
What am I s'posed--

320
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,375
[IRINA gasps]

321
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,666
Karasuma?

322
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,166
[KARASUMA grunts]

323
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,416
Let me kill you.

324
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,791
Pretty please?

325
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,333
[KARASUMA growls]

326
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,666
Pretty sure it's bad form for
a killer to beg permission!

327
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,458
This is ridiculous!

328
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,916
[IRINA grunts]

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,083
[KARASUMA sighs]

330
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:22,958
Oh fine.

[IRINA gasps]

332
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,208
[KARASUMA]
Better to get it over with

333
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,500
than spend all day
listening to you whine.

334
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,375
You go, girl!

335
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,916
She won!

336
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,916
Callin' it! Professor Bitch
was the first one to hit him.

337
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,708
[KARASUMA]
It's not like I lost anything.

338
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,541
Koro-sensei was full of it.

339
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,666
He'd never just stand there and
let me take pot shots at him.

340
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,250
[IRINA sighs]

341
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
You have to respect

342
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,250
a pupil willing to
challenge the master.

343
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,541
Especially when the deck
is stacked against her.

344
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,791
Imagine what the children

345
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,750
get out of seeing her
rise to the occasion.

346
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,458
Yes, that feisty, can-do spirit
is an example for us all.

347
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,958
When push comes to shove,

348
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,208
if there's any chance
of assassinating me,

349
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,875
her being here is
essential to it.

350
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,375
[IRINA]
Sir, I--

351
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,625
You're the worst
student I've ever had.

352
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,083
But, as a teacher,
I don't hold a candle to you.

353
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,291
If you can kill 'im.

354
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,208
Do it.

355
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,291
[IRINA gasps]

356
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,375
Absolutely! Yes, sir!

357
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,458
I did it!

358
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,625
[NAGISA]
Harsh. Arrogant. Foul-mouthed.

359
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,625
But when you see her
in her element,

360
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,500
she's a pretty damn
good teacher.

361
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,541
[IRINA laughing]

362
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,583
Hey! The hell's with
the suit of armor?

363
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Nothing in our little bet

364
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,125
prohibited basic self-defense.

365
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,375
[school bell chimes]

366
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,583
[KORO-SENSEI humming]

367
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,000
[ISOGAI] You're in a
good mood today, sir.

368
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,750
Afterschool plans?

369
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
As a matter of fact, yes.

370
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,750
I'm flying to Hawaii for
a blockbuster premier.

371
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,000
This particular movie

372
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,208
I've been chomping at
the bit to see for ages!

373
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,666
Seriously? Wow. No fair.

374
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,166
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

375
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
What's Mach Twenty good for

376
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,875
if I can't be first in line
for an international hit?

377
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,333
[MEG]
Sonic Ninja?

378
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,250
[NAKAMURA]
It's a big comic book movie.

379
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,958
They've been hyping it
since last year.

380
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,500
[KORO-SENSEI] Don't worry,
I'll give you all the gory...

381
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,000
[BOTH sigh]

382
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Okie-dokie, then.

383
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,125
I'd best be on my way.

384
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,500
[NAGISA]
Koro-sensei! Wait up!

385
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,541
We wanna come
with you. Please?

386
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh-ho! Fans of the franchise?

387
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,208
Oh, yeah.

388
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,125
We've been waiting for the
sequel for, like, ever.

389
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'm a little surprised

390
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,666
you're into comic books, Karma.

391
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,583
It's actually not my thing.

392
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,833
I really dig the
director, though.

393
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,416
It's his first genre film.

394
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,625
[RITSU]
I'd like to come, too.

395
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,125
If you don't mind.

396
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,166
I hope I'm not bothering you.

397
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,625
Um.

398
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,833
No offense, Ritsu, but what
are you doing in my phone?

399
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,458
I took the liberty
of uploading myself

400
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,250
into everyone's mobile devices.

401
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,833
This way communication between
students is streamlined,

402
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,083
and I'm fun-sized!

403
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,083
This version of me
is called Mobile Ritsu!

404
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,333
[NAGISA] Someone else that
can do almost anything.

405
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,333
[RITSU] If it's not too much
trouble, I'd love to know

406
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,916
what it's like soaring
through the air at Mach Twenty.

407
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,125
I can even take aerial photos
for Koro-sensei's dossier!

408
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Well then, children,

409
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,291
let's go to the movies!
Brace yourselves for a flight

410
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,583
through the stratosphere
at super-sonic speed!

411
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,750
Okay.

412
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,125
I know we asked him on a whim,

413
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,833
but I'm kinda having
second thoughts.

414
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,500
What'd we just sign on for?

415
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,041
Yeah, well.

416
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,791
If we survive, maybe next time
we'll think of safety first.

417
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh now, don't be afraid.

418
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:24,416
I'll accelerate gently so as
to not shock your systems.

419
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,166
[NAGISA, KARMA screaming]

420
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,250
Uh, okay!

421
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,708
[KARMA chuckles]

422
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,583
[KARMA]
Wow!

423
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,250
Check it out: the Pacific Ocean!

424
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,791
[NAGISA]
All right.

425
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,083
I'm surprise there's not
more wind or whatever.

426
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,708
It is because you're using your
head to deflect most of it?

427
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,083
[KORO-SENSEI] Excellent
powers of observation, Nagisa.

428
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,958
The secret, you see,
is my aerodynamic skin.

429
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,208
Normally, my head is
soft and squishy.

430
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,208
When exposed to high
pressure, however,

431
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,791
it hardens like a shell.

432
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,250
That's how I can withstand the
effects of Mach Twenty speed.

433
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,625
Did you know that something
very much like my skin

434
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,333
plays a role in your
day-to-day life?

435
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,208
[NAGISA]
Uh.

436
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
To explain,

437
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,833
let's explore the concept
of dilatancy...

438
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,833
[NAGISA] Is he seriously giving
us a lecture midflight?

439
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,458
This could be your best chance
to assassinate him, Karma.

440
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,750
He's distracted juggling
two things at once.

441
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,541
Except I don't wanna die.

442
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,541
We're over open water
at the speed of sound;

443
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,208
physics doesn't
support that plan.

444
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,500
Koro-sensei has us
right where he wants us.

445
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,833
We've got no choice
but to listen and learn.

446
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
And that is how

447
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,333
bulletproof vests
are manufactured,

448
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:39,333
utilizing the fascinating
science behind dilatancy.

449
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,833
I've made you that much smarter,

450
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,708
and in the time it takes
to catch Sonic Ninja.

451
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,250
[NAGISA]
We're really here.

452
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,000
We're in Hawaii, and we
know what "dilatancy" is.

453
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,750
[KARMA]
Man, it's freezing in here.

454
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
It's an island thing.

455
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,541
They're all about
cranking the AC.

456
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,666
Let's bundle you up so
no one catches pneumonia.

457
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,000
Here!

458
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,375
[KARMA]
Hmm.

459
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:07,000
This is so cool! I've never
been to a movie theatre!

460
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,458
Hey. Don't they cut out a bunch

461
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,708
of stuff for
distribution overseas?

462
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,208
We gettin' the real deal here?

463
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Where's your sense of adventure?

464
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,541
It shouldn't be
all that different

465
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,875
than what we see back home
once it comes out over there.

466
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,750
And if it is,
so much the better.

467
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,708
It'll be like seeing the same
artwork from different angles.

468
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,250
Here. My tentacles can
be used as earphones.

469
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,333
I'll offer a running
commentary as we watch

470
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,458
just in case any nuances of this
version go over your head.

471
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,416
Now, sit back and
enjoy the show!

472
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,958
[NAGISA]
Wow.

473
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,416
This... is so... awesome!

474
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,333
[NINJA A]
Hi-yah.

475
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,500
[MOVIE NARRATOR] Evil doesn't
take a vacation. No one...

476
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,458
[NAGISA] A brooding hero
trying to save the world.

477
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,291
Kids my age eat this stuff up,
but what about Koro-Sensei.

478
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,541
Is he really into the
whole super hero thing?

479
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,791
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

480
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
This would be even better in 3D.

481
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,916
[MARY ANNE]
Oh my god!

482
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,375
[NAGISA]
Nevermind.

483
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,875
[ADAM]
Kill me if you must.

484
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:12,833
But first, behold
my true identity.

485
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,291
[MARY ANNE]
My brother?

486
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,750
[NAGISA]
What a cliffhanger.

487
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,041
They really know
what they're doing;

488
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,166
I'll go nuts waiting
for the next installment!

489
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,291
I don't know. I feel
like the filmmaker

490
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,250
copped out making
the bad guy the brother.

491
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,875
[NAGISA]
Oh... Well.

492
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,791
If you want to find out how the
series ends, I can calculate it!

493
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,458
I'll just make an algorithm of
every movie ever made!

494
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,875
Give me a couple minutes.

495
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,666
Nah, I'm good, thanks.
Between the two of you, wow.

496
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,708
Huh?

497
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:42,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Long-lost siblings!

498
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,916
Can you imagine?

499
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,583
Merciful heavens,
how cruel fate can be!

500
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,666
[KORO-SENSEI crying]

501
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,958
Well, what do ya know?
Guess it really got to him.

502
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,250
Damn, my bad.

503
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,500
[RITSU]
He's been blubbering like that

504
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,208
all the way from Hawaii.

505
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,375
[NAGISA] Thank you for
taking us with you, sir

506
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,625
[KARMA]
G'night.

507
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes, yes. Goodnight, children.

508
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,625
Be careful on the way home.
Oh, and I'd like you to write

509
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,166
a detailed synopsis of the film

510
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,208
in your own words
for class tomorrow.

511
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,000
[NAGISA]
Whoa!

512
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,583
You're giving us homework?

513
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,750
[KORO-SENSEI] Small price to
pay for a free trip to Hawaii!

514
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,875
[NAGISA sighs]

515
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,000
[KARMA]
What's up?

516
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,333
Something on your mind?

517
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,833
[NAGISA] It's just been
an interesting day is all.

518
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,916
We got flown to Hawaii
at Mach Twenty

519
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and given a lecture on natural
science over the Pacific Ocean.

520
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,416
[KARMA]
Ahh, we lead a weird life.

521
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,750
[RITSU] Personally, my favorite
part of the whole experience

522
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,083
was watching
Koro-sensei protect you.

523
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,291
I've never seen
anything like it.

524
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,000
Did you realize he was
using his tentacles

525
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,750
to fend off dust
particles and debris?

526
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,125
[NAGISA]
When you think about it.

527
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,791
We saw the world through
Koro-sensei's eyes today.

528
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,000
[KARMA]
Hmm...

529
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,708
The more I get to know the guy,

530
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,291
the more I feel like
his everyday life

531
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,041
is something we can't
even comprehend.

532
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Stiff upper lip, old boy.

533
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,291
No more tears.

534
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,958
I'm needed at Mimura's for
a one-on-one math tutorial.

535
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,875
[SHIRO]
Well?

536
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,958
Did your eyes follow his course?

537
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,375
[SHIRO]
Good.

538
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,083
Then you can kill him.

539
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,875
You mean... him?

540
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:15,875
[SHIRO]
Yes.

541
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,916
Your brother.

542
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,625
Though as of tomorrow,
he'll also be your teacher.

543
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,375
[SHIRO]
Now.

544
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:29,750
It's time to reap vengeance for
what's been done to our moon.
