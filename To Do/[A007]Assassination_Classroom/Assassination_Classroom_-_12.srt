00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,875
[SUGINO sighs]

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,875
[SUGINO] The crappy
weather's finally over!

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,375
It's gonna get hot soon.

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,708
Let's start spending
more time outside.

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:17,958
I wanna be more active.

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,750
Sounds good. You know I'm game.

7
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,875
What would the two of you
say to some fishing?

8
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,583
Fishing? That sounds like
it'd fun. What's in season?

9
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,083
In the Summer months,
delinquents are out in droves.

10
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,083
Use Nagisa as bait,
and there's no limit

11
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,833
to how many of the bastards
we can shake down.

12
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:35,208
[NAGISA] I didn't realize
delinquents had a "season."

13
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,708
[SUGINO] Seriously,
though, let's do something.

14
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,083
[NAGISA]
There's always the beach.

15
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,708
[STUDENT B]
Play hard today!

16
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,750
[KARMA]
Hm?

17
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,666
[PLAYER A]
Good one, capt'n! Nice throw!

18
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,250
[SHINDO]
Hey, hey! Look who it is!

19
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,250
Long time no see, Sugino!

20
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,625
[PLAYER B]
Whoa!

21
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:55,458
--[PLAYER A] Check it out, guys!
--[PLAYER C] Sugino!

22
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,333
[SUGINO]
Hey!

23
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,833
[CLUB MEMBER D]
'Sup, dude?

24
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,458
Way to never come by and say
hello to your old teammates.

25
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,041
[SUGINO]
Ha. Yeah, I know. I suck.

26
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,500
[CLUB MEMBER D] You're
pitching in the big tournament

27
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,791
next week, right?

28
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,416
[SUGINO] Well, they
haven't decided on it yet,

29
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,750
but I'd sure like to.

30
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,416
[CLUB MEMBER C]
Man, it'd be epic if you did!

31
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,750
Yeah.

32
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,708
You have no idea how jealous
we are of you, man.

33
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,458
You get to be in E Class
goofin' off all day.

34
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,833
[CLUB MEMBER B]
We've gotta hit the books

35
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,416
and practice like our lives
depended on it. Blows.

36
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,666
[SHINDO]
Hey, c'mon. Be nice.

37
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,375
Don't make such a big deal out
of it. He won't understand.

38
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,291
Burning the candle at both ends
is a privilege of the gifted.

39
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,208
[KARMA]
Humility much?

40
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,125
Wow, sounds to me
like somebody thinks

41
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,791
they're one of the chosen ones.

42
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,208
[SHINDO]
Heh, I am.

43
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,250
You don't believe me? Fine.

44
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,958
See how you feel after
watching me in the tournament.

45
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,750
There's great, then
there's everybody else.

46
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,708
Now guess which one I am.

47
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:47,458
That's just the way things are.
I don't make the rules.

48
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah-ha!

49
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,291
A friendly, class-versus-class
baseball tournament, eh?

50
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,250
A healthy body promotes
a healthy mind.

51
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,708
Approved! Except, uh...

52
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,375
I note that E Class
isn't included

53
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,875
in the tournament bracket.

54
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,666
They leave us out to keep
things nice and even.

55
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,708
It's hard to have a tournament
with an odd number of teams.

56
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,750
We get to play the exhibition
game at the end, though.

57
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,833
So, there's that.

58
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Exhibition game?

59
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,875
[MIMURA] Yeah. It's a
spectacle, basically.

60
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,333
We get split up by gender,

61
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,041
pitted against the Baseball
and Girl's Basketball Team

62
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,125
while everyone watches.

63
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,708
[KORO-SENSEI] So it's not
exactly a consolation prize.

64
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,875
Nope.

65
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,375
--[chair clatters]
--[KORO-SENSEI grunts]

66
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,000
[TERASAKA] If you dweebs wanna
be a laughingstock, fine.

67
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,166
Me an' the boys got too much
self-respect. We're out.

68
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,791
[ISOGAI] Hey, hold on
a second! You can't just--

69
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,916
Oh, fine.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,958
We should ask Sugino
for some pointers.

71
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,541
He's the baseball guy.

72
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,916
What do you say, man? Any tips?

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,125
Not to be negative,
but we're screwed.

74
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,125
Like, royally.

75
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,833
The Kunugigaoka Team has
Shindo as their captain.

76
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,958
Dude can throw a fastball
like nobody's business.

77
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,958
High schools are
already scouting him.

78
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,000
[SUGINO]
It's not even fair.

79
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,375
Not gonna lie, though.

80
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,208
I'd give anything to beat him.

81
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,666
And not just put up
a good fight.

82
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,625
I wanna beat the arrogant
S.O.B. at his own game.

83
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,166
Baseball is my
first love. My life.

84
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,083
It took getting kicked off
the team to understand that.

85
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,208
The odds aren't
in our favor, but--

86
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,333
[KORO-SENSEI] Swing,
battah-battah! Sa-wing, battah!

87
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,750
Oh. Right.

88
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,333
I forgot you don't
need much persuading

89
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,916
when comes to anything baseball.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,166
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

91
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
I've wanted to be the feisty,

92
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,958
no-nonsense coach in a
sports flick since forever!

93
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,541
Don't worry, I won't
push you kids around,

94
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,125
but I brought a table to flip!

95
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,416
[SUGINO] You've put a
lotta thought into this.

96
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
[KORO-SENSEI] I've watched
all of you grow more focused

97
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,625
on which direction you'd
like to head in lately,

98
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,208
and it's been marvelous.

99
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,875
Whatever the odds, the name of
the game is always, "Kill! Win!"

100
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,875
And to reward that
fighting spirit,

101
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,916
Coach Koro will
teach you a strategy

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,416
guaranteed to
secure our victory!

103
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,291
[ARAKI]
Whoa-oh! It's a high one!

104
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,958
And the center fielder
practically catches it

105
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,791
with his eyes closed!
Game over, folks!

106
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,791
The winner of the Third Year
Baseball Tournament is A Class!

107
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,041
This really blows.
Why do we even play?

108
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,458
I know. The exhibition game
oughta get our minds off it.

109
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,000
Nothing like watching
real losers getting beat.

110
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,500
[TAKADA]
Oh, this is going to be a riot.

111
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,208
[ARAKI] All right. Time
for the exhibition game.

112
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,875
E Class versus the
Kunugigaoka Baseball Team.

113
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,916
Only the chosen ones get
bragging rights, my friend.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,333
Remember that. Victory goes to
the player with the most skill.

115
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,791
On the field, and
in the classroom.

116
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:08,208
So not a lot of hope for you,
but whatever. Good luck.

117
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,583
Let's play some ball!

[KIMURA]
Holy crap.

120
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,791
Why are they so fired up
all of a sudden?

121
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,708
Even better question:
where's our coach?

122
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,583
Isn't he s'posed to
teach us his "method"?

123
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,166
He's over there.

124
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,708
Mr. Karasuma told him he can't
draw attention to himself,

125
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,541
so he's using forced perspective
to look like a baseball.

126
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,458
He'll signal us with
the color of his face.

127
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,833

Oh, yeah. Real smooth.

One! Two! Three!

129
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,166
One! Two! Three!

130
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,500

Hmm.

Good advice.

135
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,875
Treat the other team like our
target and we can't go wrong.

136
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,250
This will be excellent practice

137
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,083

with the pros.

like a crappy away game?

00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,583
Sneaky little creep.

170
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,291
[ANNOUNCER] Batter number
two: Catcher, Shiota.

171
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
One! Two! Three!

172
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,333
[ARAKI]
Holy cow! A push bunt!

173
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ha, ha. They're good,

174
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,625
but they're still just
junior high kids.

175
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,166
Even pros get
discombobulated by bunts.

176
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,583
[ARAKI] But there's nowhere
to throw it! No outs!

177
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,500
Runners on first and second!

178
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,083
[SHINDO]
What the hell?!

179
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,958
I, uh... I don't think I care
for how this game is going.

180
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,333
No way!

181
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,333
This is nuts! You don't bunt
a fastball like Shindo's

182
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,958
and get it to go
where you want it to.

183
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:14,875
That's not how this works!

184
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,750
So far, so good,
Coach! Nice job.

185
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,333
Practicing against you
really paid off.

186
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Pitcher Koro
throws a staggering

187
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,041
300 kilometers an hour!

188
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,291
Infielder Koro sets up
an impregnable barrier

189
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,541
of dopplegängers!

190
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,291
Catcher Koro breaks
your concentration

191
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,041
with expert trash-talk!

192
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,500
[KORO-SENSEI (CATCHER)]
I saw you out behind the school

193
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,583
playing air guitar, Mimura.
Ooh, that fret technique.

194
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,083
[MIMURA]
I can't do this!

195
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,916
[KORO-SENSEI] Now we study
the opposing team's strategies.

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,416
To this end, Takebayashi here
has been spying on them

197
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,333
non-stop for the
past three days.

198
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,791
[TAKEBAYASHI] 
Aren't I the lucky one.

199
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,000
Shindo's pitches top out

200
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,625
at approximately 140.5
kilometers per hour.

201
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,041
He throws curveballs and
fastballs exclusively.

202
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,250
Fastballs 90% of the time.

203
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,875
[SUGINO] He sticks with
what he does best.

204
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,250
At the Junior High Level,

205
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,708
a good fastball is the only
thing you really need.

206
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Precisely!

207
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,791
Which means if we get our
heads around his fastball,

208
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,333
we're in good shape!

209
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,916
So, for the remainder
of practice,

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,333
I'll be slowing down
my pitch, considerably,

211
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,291
and imitating
Shindo's form to a T.

212
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:14,041
Same stance, same force, as if
the boy himself were throwing.

213
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,125
And after dealing with

214
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,333
the pitches I've been
hurtling at you,

215
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,208
Shindo's "fastballs"
should seem like

216
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,875
they're moving in slow motion.

217
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,375
[ARAKI]
And we have another bunt!

218
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,000
[KORO-SENSEI] Furthermore,
we can answer all these pitches

219
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,666
by restricting
ourselves to bunting.

220
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,625
[ARAKI]
Fair ball! Astounding!

221
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,583
It's come to a dead stop
right on the line!

222
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,083
Batter three is safe!
Am I seeing this?

223
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,916
Zero outs and the bases loaded!

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,666
A rare off-day for Shindo!

225
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,291
Maybe he's not feeling well.

226
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,000
[ANNOUNCER] Batter number
four: Pitcher, Sugino.

227
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,750
Sugino!

228
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
One! Two! Three!

229
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,750
[UMPIRE]
Play ball!

230
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,000
[ARAKI] Shindo readies for
the next pitch, and what's this?

231
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,958
Sugino plans to bunt!

232
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,916
[SHINDO]
Uh. What the--?

233
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,875
Something's not right
about these people.

234
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,458
Are they playing baseball,
or... something else?

235
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,583
[SUGINO]
I know I've got nothing

236
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,291
on the strength of
your throwing arm.

237
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,333
But real strength
is a different story.

238
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,750
It isn't about striking
hard, or often.

239
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,041
[SUGINO] Real strength
is about striking true!

240
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,166
Heads up!

241
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,416
[ARAKI]
He hit it!

242
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,875
The ball is headed deep
into right center field!

243
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,291
I don't believe it!

244
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,708
The runner on first is
following his buddy on second

245
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,291
--and making a dash for home!
--No! This isn't real!

246
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,291
[ARAKI]
And... Sugino, the hitter,

247
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,833
-- lands safely on third!
--[SUGINO] Yeah! That's right!

248
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,041
[ARAKI]
You're not seeing things, folks!

249
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,875
We just had a
base-clearing triple!

250
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,708
This is unprecedented.
E Class has scored...

251
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,916
What the hell's
going on out there?

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,291
[ASANO]
You're looking alarmingly pale

253
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,125
this afternoon, Mr. Terai.

254
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,208
It appears you might be
coming down with something.

255
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,333
I recommend you get some rest.

256
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,666
Your team will worry,

257
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,958
and when they worry, it
undermines their playing.

258
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,250
No! I'm fine! Honestly, sir!

259
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,791
Matter of fact,
I've never felt better!

260
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,791
Come, don't be foolish.

261
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,958
You're not well.

262
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,750
That's the only
possible explanation

263
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,291
for this catastrophe.

264
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:04,833
Faculty members at this
academy do not fail otherwise.

265
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,541
As I suspected, the
poor man has a fever.

266
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,500
Take him to the
infirmary, immediately.

267
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,833
[MANAGER]
Yes, sir!

268
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,500
[ASANO] I'll act as coach
while you recuperate.

269
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:17,083
Wha--? What are you gonna do?

270
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:22,000
Do? I think I'll create a
teachable moment about hubris.

271
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,750
Wow. That was a beating.

272
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,791
No worries. There's
always next time, yeah?

273
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,791
It was my fault. My suckage
dragged the whole team down.

274
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,458
Aw, c'mon. That isn't true.

275
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,708
[NAKAMURA]
We all sucked.

276
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,250
t's just, the other team
had huge, jiggly boobs.

277
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,416
Ugh! Made me so mad
I couldn't concentrate.

278
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,791
What on earth is
the deal with you

279
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,250
and your hatred of big boobs?!

280
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,541
[KAEDE]
It's complicated!

281
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,125
Anyways. Let's hope the boys
are doing better than we did.

282
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,625
[SHINDO]
Principal, sir.

283
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,916
We're at the top
of the first inning,

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,041
and the final boss
already throws in.

285
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,291
[ARAKI] Ah, okay.
This explain it, folks.

286
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,875
According to a note
I've just been handed,

287
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,458
Coach Terai has
been severely ill

288
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,916
since before the game started.

289
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,041
Apparently, the team is so
concerned about his health,

290
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,750
their hearts haven't
been in the game.

291
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,333
Not one to languish
in the bleachers,

292
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,833
our illustrious principal has
stepped up to take the reins!

293
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:14,833
[CROWD cheering]

294
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,333
[ANNOUNCER]
Batter number five:

295
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,666
--Second Baseman, Maehara.
--[ARAKI] All right! 

296
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,166
--Second Baseman, Maehara.
--Let's play some ball!

297
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,125
[ARAKI] You've got to wonder
how this is going to-- Wait!

298
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,166
The players are
converging on the infield!

299
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,583
This is highly unusual.

300
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,250
I think it's safe to say
they're on to our bunt strategy.

301
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,125
What the hell, dude? They can't
actually do this, right?

302
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,750
[TAKEBAYASHI] Technically,
if it's in fair territory,

303
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,916
they can defend
however they want.

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The umpire could call them
on it if we felt like it,

305
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:40,666
but he happens to be on their
side. So, fat chance of that.

306
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,916
[ASANO] We must redirect
the game's flow.

307
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,125
Sugino is a formidable talent.

308
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,916
He kept up his skills by
joining a municipal team.

309
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,541
No denying the boy's
making an effort.

310
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,708
But the fact is
neither here nor there.

311
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,916
Everyone makes an effort
in their own way.

312
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,833
What separates you
from the common ilk

313
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,041
is a sense of destiny.

314
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,250
Forge ahead to meet your future,

315
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,583
and rabble like him will
fall in the thousands

316
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,083
before the force
that propels you.

317
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,250
Don't think of this
as merely baseball.

318
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,666
Rather, think of it
as a reconnaissance,

319
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,500
as clearing your path of debris.

320
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,958
Now, do as destiny demands.

321
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,000
[ARAKI]
And he's popped it up!

322
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,458
Maehara is intimidated
by the infielder pressure!

323
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,875
That's one out.

324
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,791
[OKAJIMA]
This is messed up!

325
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,000
How am I s'posed to bunt my way
around a B.S. setup like this?

326
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,291
A little guidance, Coach!

327
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
One! Two! Three!

328
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,000
[OKAJIMA]
You mean we've got nothing?!

329
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,583
[UMPIRE]
Strike three! Batter out!

330
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,166
Strike three! Batter is out!

331
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,416
[ARAKI] Bam! Three outs,
one after the other!

332
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,916
The Shindo we all know
and love is back!

333
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,416
Good work, my boy.
Now, keep it up.

334
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,000
Four-seam fastballs are
what will turn the tide.

335
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,416
I want to see high drama.
Throw as if to crush them.

336
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,250
Sir!

337
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,041
And allow me to reiterate.

338
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,083
This is far more
than just a game.

339
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,583
It is a benchmark on
your climb to the top.

340
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,750
[BASEBALL CLUB]
Sir!

341
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,750
[SHINDO]
Let's turn this around!

342
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,333
[BASEBALL CLUB]
Yeah!

343
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,916
[KARASUMA] The man knows how to
light a fire under his students.

344
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,958
Not unlike someone else we know.

345
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,250
Gifted motivator,
photographic memory of faces,

346
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,500
strengths, weaknesses.

347
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,583
Their teaching methods
are one and the same.

348
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,208
And yet, as molders
of young minds,

349
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,291
the two are
diametrically opposed.

350
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:27,375
They're on a collision course
with each other. I can feel it.

351
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,666
Ah-ha! I think I get it!
So, you hit a ball with a stick.

352
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,541
[ANNOUNCER] Batter number one:
Left Fielder, Hashimoto.

353
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,875
Play!

354
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,458
[ARAKI] Sugino of E Class
throws the first pitch.

355
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,791
[HASHIMOTO]
Huh?

356
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:39,333
[UMPIRE]
Strike!

357
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,750
[CROWD cheering]

358
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,500
Yeah, Sugino, that's the way!
Don't let 'em get a hit.

359
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,000
None of us can
catch worth a damn.

360
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,916
[chuckles] No worries,
I'm on it.

361
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,541
Shindo, repeat after me.
"My strength is infinite."

362
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,666
"My throw will be a
force to reckon with."

363
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,416
[SHINDO]
"My strength is infinite.

364
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
My throw will be a
force to reckon with."

365
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,458
"I will overpower my enemies."

366
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,333
"I will overpower my enemies."

367
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,791
"They will be trampled."

368
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,875
"They will be trampled."

369
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,250
[ARAKI]
No way!

370
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,125
--Two batters struck out
--[KORO-SENSEI] Psst. Karma.

371
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,666
--in a row!
--[KARMA] Huh?

372
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,041
[KARMA] Not the best idea to be
right under my feet, Coach,

373
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,833
'less the object is
to get stepped on.

374
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,500
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

375
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,750
[KORO-SENSEI] You're the first
up to bat next inning, correct?

376
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,375
How about we shake
things up a bit, eh?

377
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,958
[ARAKI] We're at the top
of the second inning

378
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,375
and the invincible bunt defense
is still the order of the day!

379
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,791
[ANNOUNCER] Batter number
eight: Left Fielder, Akabane.

380
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,041
[KARMA]
Hmm.

381
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,458
Move it, kid. Get your tail

382
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,958
--in the batter's box.
--Hang on.

383
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,000
[KARMA] Never pegged you as
the type to play dirty, sir.

384
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,000
If the rules haven't changed,
this little gambit ain't legal.

385
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,208
They're bogarting the infield.

386
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,416
Umpire should've
called 'em on it by now.

387
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,291
Aw, c'mon. Anyone else smell
a rat, or is it just me?

388
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,333
Oh! Nevermind.
You guys are morons.

389
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,125
Baseball's like a foreign
language to you.

390
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,708
[PLAYER F] Quit whining
about every little thing

391
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,250
--and play ball!
--[PLAYER G] What do you care?

392
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,541
[PLAYER G]
This isn't even a real game!

393
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,208
You got a problem,
go cry to momma!

394
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,458
[KARMA] Not sure it's working
like you want, Coach.

395
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's perfectly fine.

396
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,375
The important thing
is to not buckle.

397
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,333
When you see an
injustice, speak out!

398
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,833
[ARAKI] Top of second, and E
Class has given up three outs!

399
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,625
[yelling]

400
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,458
[ARAKI]
A hit! The trajectory is low.

401
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,083
And the ball has smacked
against the fence.

402
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,791
He just missed catching
it off the bounce.

403
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,833
Shindo make it to second
base with time to spare.

404
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,333
We have a double!

405
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,000
[ASANO]
Thank you, Koro-sensei.

406
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,208
E Class sets an example
impossible to ignore.

407
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,083
All the more so for
resorting to cheap tricks.

408
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:24,541
Between that and genuine skill,
genuine strength, on balance,

409
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,250
which do you imagine
is more inspiring?

410
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,791
Strike, three!
The batter is out!

411
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,125
[ARAKI] Bottom of the third.
The end is nigh!

412
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,708
The real baseball team is on
defense, and then it's over!

413
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:36,750
Hashimoto, a word.

414
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,916
[HASHIMOT]
Hm? Yes, sir!

415
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,666
Give E Class a taste
of its own medicine.

416
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,541
[NAGISA, SUGINO gasp]

417
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,875
[ARAKI]
A-ho! Lookie there!

418
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,041
The bunters become the
buntees! Quite the twist!

419
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,125
Sorry, my bad.

420
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,833
It's all good.
Don't worry about it.

421
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,458
[ASANO] Imagine my team
bunting against amateurs.

422
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,000
Normally this would
be distasteful.

423
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,416
But... given that the
upstarts are having

424
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,041
their own questionable tactics
turned against them,

425
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,166
we chosen ones
are perfectly justified.

426
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,666
[ARAKI]
Zero outs, bases loaded,

427
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,041
and next up to bat is the
baseball team's pride and joy.

428
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,500
Shindo!

429
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,958
You're mine, Sugino!
You hear? I will crush you!

430
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,500
[ASANO] I've been
building to this moment

431
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,250
since the first inning.

432
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,291
The dénouement will
be precise, dramatic.

433
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,000
This game will be
decided, not by a bunt,

434
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,458
but by the swing of a powerful
young man under my tutelage.

435
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,250
How shall you answer
my move, Koro-sensei?

436
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Karma.

437
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,833
I think it's time to put
your earlier trash talking

438
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:36,833
to good use.

439
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:37,916
[KARMA]
Mmm.

440
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,333
Ah. I get it now.

441
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,583
The only thing we can
really do is walk Shindo.

442
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,750
[KARMA] Yo. New marching
orders from Coach.

443
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,291
[ARAKI] And so the
game resumes, except.

444
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,000
Again with the tight
defense positions!

445
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,166
[KARMA]
Choking up the infield

446
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,875
isn't helping the
batter's concentration,

447
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,166
but what are you gonna do?

448
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,625
Now, if the ump had
called you on it earlier,

449
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,750
there'd be a precedent for
telling us to back off.

450
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,708
Ha. You're cool with
this. Right, chief?

451
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,125
[ASANO]
Well played.

452
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,416
But still just another
desperate, undisciplined ploy.

453
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,833
Proceed as you will.

454
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,083
A true athlete does not falter
before such trickery.

455
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,833
Wow. Duly noted.

456
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,791
Heh. We'll hold
you to that, sir.

457
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,750
[CROWD gasping]

458
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,250
[ARAKI]
This.

459
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,875
Uh. I mean, for heaven's sake
they're standing so close!

460
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,083
Talk about point blank range!

461
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,625
Hey, Mr. Chosen One.
Don't worry 'bout us.

462
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,166
You might hit us with your
swing, but we'll be fine.

463
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,125
My, an obvious
attempt at a bluff.

464
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,750
Put everything you've
got into the swing.

465
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,291
Crack a skull if need be.

466
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,375
The penalty will go to E Class
for obstructing the batter.

467
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,916
[SHINDO]
Think you're intimidating me?

468
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,625
Well let's see which
of us pisses themselves

469
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,166
when I brain you
psychotic little freaks!

470
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,250
[UMPIRE]
Strike!

471
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,541
[NAGISA]
Uh.

472
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,166
[PRINCIPAL] They dodged
in the last millisecond.

473
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,375
[KORO-SENSEI] When it comes
to guts and visual acuity,

474
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,166
these boys are
top of their class.

475
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,166
Dodging Shindo's swing
is as simple to them

476
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,375
as bunting his fastball.

477
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,458
[KARMA]
Give us a break.

478
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,750
Holding back ain't
gonna cut it, pal.

479
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,333
On the next throw...

480
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,333
...swing like you're
tryin' to kill us.

481
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,083
[NAGISA]
That's got him pretty shaken up.

482
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,791
He wants to do what
the Principal says,

483
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,458
but can't bring himself to.

484
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,458
Things change quickly
in our world.

485
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,458
One second you're
playing baseball.

486
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,541
The next, something where
the stakes are a lot higher.

487
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,625
[KARMA]
Heads up, Nagisa!

488
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,583
Throw it to third base!

489
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,833
[UMPIRE]
Out!

490
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,583
[SUGINO] Kimura! C'mon,
throw it to first base!

491
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,875
Go for it!

492
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,750
[KIMURA]
Done and done!

493
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,750
[UMPIRE]
Out!

494
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,500
[ARAKI]
Uh-- A triple play!

495
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,333
The game is over.
I can't... This is insane.

496
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,458
The winner is, never
thought I'd say this,

497
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,208
but the winner is E Class!

498
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,375
Well damn, that was
totally pointless.

499
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,875
How did they lose to the?
And to those E Class jerkwads?

500
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:58,041
All that superior firepower
wasted. What a joke.

501
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,000
[NAGISA] If only people
could see was going on

502
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,000
behind the scenes.
Too bad, really.

503
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,666
This wasn't just a game.

504
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,875
This was a straight-up
battle of wills.

505
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Not that anyone's keeping score,

506
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,583
but between this and midterms,
I'd saw we're one, one.

507
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:15,000
Until final exams,
my good Principal!

508
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,250
[SUGINO]
Shindo!

509
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,958
[SUGINO]
Sorry, man.

510
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,375
Didn't mean for things
to get so crazy.

511
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,458
For what it's worth, though,
this doesn't change anything.

512
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,833
You're still a better
player than me.

513
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,458
It's one little game.
Don't be so depressed.

514
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,666
One game?

515
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,375
Why'd you go to so much
trouble to win then?

516
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,750
Don't feed me that line;

517
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,416
you wanted to prove you
were stronger and you did.

518
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,375
Take a look at us.

519
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,000
We're not much of a team.

520
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,875
I mean, we all get
along really well,

521
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,333
but collectively we
suck at baseball.

522
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,833
Thing is, though, when
we practiced bunting,

523
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,125
it was awesome.

524
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,833
See, for me, it wasn't
so much about

525
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,791
getting stronger or better.

526
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,541
It was... well...

527
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,916
It was about being proud
of my new friends.

528
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,666
I wanted to show 'em off.
Especially to you guys, y'know?

529
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,625
[SHINDO] This ain't over
between us, Sugino.

530
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,500
The next time we play'll
be in high school.

531
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,666
[SUGINO]
Damn right!

532
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,666
[SUGINPO]
If the Earth hasn't been

533
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,500
blown to smithereens by then.

534
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,625
Somethin' wrong?

535
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,375
[SUGINO]
Uh. Nah.

536
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,583
Just thinkin'.
