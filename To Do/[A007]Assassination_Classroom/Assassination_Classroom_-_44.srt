[NAGISA] "Spear of Heaven."
"Shield of Earth."

2
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,041
In a desperate,
last ditch effort

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,625
to assassinate Koro-sensei,
the government went high tech.

4
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:22,666
We'd been pushed aside.
Given absolutely no say.

5
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,208
Okay then, everybody.

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,500
Moment of truth.
Our final mission!

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:32,916
[NAGISA] We need to see him.
This can't end until we do.

8
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,291
[NAGISA] Countdown to
Koro-sensei's deadline,

9
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,250
approximately... three hours.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,625
[COMMANDER] The Spear of
Heaven will be fully charged

11
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,625
in about three hours.

12
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,166
Shame that magnificent
bastard'll be obliterated

13
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,416
so completely.

14
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,583
Seems a waste of
good test samples.

15

The things we do in the
name of world peace.

16
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,458
Do the kids have a chance?
Can they pull it off?

[COMMANDER]
Report.

21
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,333
There's an intruder
on the mountain, sir.

22
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,541
[SOLDIER A] Someone's gotten
past the police line.

23

It's more than one!

on how many!

Think you can mess with us?

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Way to go. Good
teamwork, you three.

[SOLDIER D]
We've lost comm with B Squad.

What the hell?

34
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,625
[SOLDIER D]
We've got a sniper!

35
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,500
Our position is compromised!
Send reinforcements!

37
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,833
Uh, okay. That didn't really
sound so good for him.

38
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,958
[SUMIRE]
He's fine.

39
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,250
No, honest. All I
did was wrap him up.

40
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,875
This squad's been
neutralized, we're good.

41

Nice.

Hm?

[KARMA] Sorry, soldier. But
hey, look on the bright side,

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,916
this is a testament
to how difficult it is

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,958
to make you scream.

[SOLDIER C screaming]

51
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,750
Come on, man.

52
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,958
I've gotta lure your buddies
here somehow, don't I?

53
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,375
I think I can take
down two or three more.

54
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,041
Hey, Ritsu, what're
the odds on that?

55
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,375
[RITSU]
Good.

56
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,666
At least three more
approaching over the ridge.

57
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,333
They've got a fixed machine
gun on the high ground.

58
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,291
It's stationed over
by the fir trees.

59
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,666
Roger that.

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,750
So if we cut a path through
the crimson-glory vines

61
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,750
out past the stone oaks,
we should be set?

62
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,500
[RITSU]
Yep. That oughta get you there.

63
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,958
Terasaka, you're up next.

64
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,583
Head that direction
and take 'em out.

65
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,541
Advance your team
to the lone pine.

[EMPLOYEE B]
Status report, now!

70
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,791
Damn it, Karasuma. What is this?

71
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,250
Those boys and girls
know the mountain

72
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,208
like the backs of their hands.

73
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,500
It's their turf. Where they've
spent most of the past year.

74
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,750
What do you expect?

75
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,250
You've never set foot
in this place before.

76
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,291
They know their own hunting
ground better than you.

77
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,875
On this patch of
campus backwoods,

78
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,083
they're the most terrifying
assassins imaginable.

79
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,250
Ah! You put them up
to it, didn't you?

80
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,750
[KARASUMA]
I did nothing of the sort.

81
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,208
They make their own decisions.

82
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,833
Believe me when I say
they're more than able

83
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,291
to operate on their own.

84
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,333
I've learned from experience
not to hold them back.

85
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,916
They'll get the best of
you every single time.

86

00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,916

Spoken like a proud papa.

[KARMA]
All right, Okajima, I'm there.

89
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,750
About another 50 meters.

90
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,375
[KARASUMA] Karma Akabane.
Easily the best suited to lead.

91
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,166
He's the brains of this
outfit, you can be sure.

92
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,041
Mind like a steel trap.

93
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,583

How many of them are there?

[HINANO] How much are we loving
all these booby traps right now?

98
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,541
We set 'em for Koro-sensei,

99
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,833
but they work just
as good on people.

100
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,333
[SOLDIER K]
Ah! Hey! Let me down!

101
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,791
[TERASAKA] Tch. Guess there's
a few of you jokers still left.

102
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,000
[CAPTAIN]
Congratulations.

103
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,833
You caught us
with our pants down.

104
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,708
I'd say you've got this
neck of the woods down

105
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,583
better 'n we do if it
weren't so obvious--

106
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,916
Really? Stun darts?

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,375
Thing is, once you know
what you're up against,

108
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,333
turnin' the tables
ain't nothin'.

Little punks.

112
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,166
Listen, if you just
behave, this can be over,

113
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,291
and nobody has to get hurt.

114
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,583
What's the point of rebelling
this late in the game?

115

One way or another,

we're gonna see this thing
through to the end!

118
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,250
[TERASAKA] You don't get to
march in at the last minute

119
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,958
and tell us what to do!

120

[ISOGAI]
You have to trust us!

121
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,791
We know how to
handle Koro-sensei!

let us do this our way!

Hey, dumbasses, what do
you think you're doin'?

Finish what you started

132

instead of high fiving
each other like losers!

Damn it.

135
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
I thought that sounded like you.

136
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,166

Koro-sensei.

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,583

Those students
crossed the barrier

140
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,208
knowing full well the danger
they'd be up against?

141
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,916
What was this stunt
supposed to accomplish?

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,083
We can't just leave a group of
civilians to their own devices.

143
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,666
If the target feels cornered,
things could get desperate.

We don't want the situation
to get any worse.

145

May I suggest you send us in?

dealing with these kids.

Bleh.

The laser's almost charged up.

149
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
So it would seem.

150
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,208
I imagine they'll probably
try firing the killing shot

151
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,375
just shy of midnight.

152
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,333
There's enough concentrated
power in that baby

153
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,541
to shut down even my
Absolute Defense Form.

What do we do?

155
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,375
We have to leave! Let's try
to find a way out of here!

as hostages or something!

There's no stopping this now.

Too many people are
aware of my existence.

You knew it'd come
to this eventually.

162

You knew it all along.

163
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,666

Even if I don't explode,

164

the cat's out of the bag.

165

We'd be fools to think
the world would accept

the existence of
something like me.

167

Sooner or later, they'll
want me out of the picture.

168

It's a perfectly
reasonable reaction.

You can't tell me we wouldn't
have found a way around all that

if we'd acted sooner.

We could've busted up

You'd have met with resistance.

174
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,916
The public would decry
you as dangerous.

Possibly demand you to
be put under surveillance.

176
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,541
And besides, the projectors'
defenses are impregnable.

177
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,708
If I so much as
chuck a rock at them,

178
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:50,083

anti-aircraft artillery.

even given your skill,

No technical
innovation overlooked.

185
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,166
In a very real way,

186
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,166
my assassination represents
the many disparate threads

187
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,583
of mankind's cumulative
wisdom brought together

188
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,500

189
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,125

In truth, I'm honored.

191
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,125
So then, you're saying all the
hard work we put into this...

192
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,666
...has been for nothing?

193
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Come now, Yada.
I hardly think that's fair.

194
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,375
Think about it.

195
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,791
You've journeyed to outer space,
uncovered vital information,

196
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,166
surely we don't call
that "nothing"?

197
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,875
Especially when said information

198
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,625
brought our classroom a
much-needed ray of light.

199

The past month may
have been short,

200

but also uncommonly sweet.

201
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,125
That's what it's all about.

202
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,500
The hard work gave you heart.

203
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,375
And you used every bit
of what you've learned

204
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,208
to come and see me
one last time.

205
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,708
For a teacher, there is
no greater happiness.

206

208
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,833
The risk is still less
than one percent!

00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,541
And I don't care
what other people say!

210

The Octopus isn't dangerous!

He's a pervert, sure,
but he's not dangerous!

216

As far as they're concerned,
we're in over our heads.

217
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,583
Why give delinquents
the time of day, right?

218
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,166
It's much easier
to brush us off.

00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,250
Permit me to give you
a word of advice.

224
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,541
In life, we travel upstream,

225

mighty current of society.

226
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,500
More often than not,

227
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,750
things simply won't
pan out as you wished.

228
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,333
Don't apportion blame.

229
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,041
Society is in a
circumstance of its own.

230
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,375
Resist the temptation
to renounce it.

00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,291
Believe me, your time and energy

232
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,083
are far better
channeled elsewhere.

233
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,750
When hardship prevails,
say, "That's life,"

234
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,708
and marshal your dignity towards
navigating the disappointment

235
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,375
as best you can.

236
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,916
When the water calms,
ask yourself:

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,125
If society tosses me about
like a piece of driftwood,

238
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:14,333
is it wiser to stay the course,
or find another way?

239
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,541
If E-Class has taught
you nothing else,

240
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,250
take this to heart.

241
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,000
In the Assassination

242
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,791
...you don't have to face
hardships head-on.

243

You can run. You can hide.

Launch a sneak attack,
if it's not against the rules.

245

Avail yourself of
unconventional methods.

246

Whatever you choose, above
all else, be determined.

247

Don't give frustration
the last word.

is that there's always hope!

00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,958
Tell me this is
part of the plan.

343
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,708
Well, this does give
us the opportunity

344
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,958
to collect combat data.

345
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,458
Not to mention a body.

346
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:04,041
A single specimen would win
the war on terror overnight.

347
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,125
[EXECUTIVE]
An invincible killing machine.

348
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,166
The list of practical
applications

349
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,000
is virtually endless.

350
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,416
What's that?

351
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,000
No, seriously? Oh crap!

352
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,875
[NAGISA] Reaper 2.0.
The one who attacked us.

353
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,291
[MURAMATSU] Okay, before
it was just his face,

354
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,791
but now his entire body
freaks me the hell out!

355
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,666
[SHIRO] He underwent
the same modifications

356
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,833
as your precious Octopus.

357
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,208
With one difference.

358
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,875
Quite unlike Itona and
my would-be sister-in-law,

359
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,958
he begged for them.

360
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,916
Far be it from me to judge,

361
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,125
but I think that puts
him a cut above.

362
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,250
I know! Wrap your
head around that.

363
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,791
A man able to overwhelm
you in human form

364
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,125
now possesses unlimited power.

365
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,833
Tentacles fueled by pure hatred.

366
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,791
Can you imagine?

367
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,958
[STUDENT screaming]

368
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,125
[yelling]

369
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,875
[SHIRO]
That was a sonic boom.

370
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,375
His tentacles have an
initial velocity of Mach 20.

371
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,583
Their top speed, however...

372
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,833
...is Mach 40.

373
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,791
How-How is that even possible?

374
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,208
[SHIRO] In short, his basic
performance level is doubled.

375
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,166
The tentacles amplify 2.0's

376
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,916
ungodly kinetic vision
and intuition.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,041
He is readily adaptable
to a supersonic world.

378
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,666
Unlike some people, he took
to his tentacles with ease.

379
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,833
He shares that in common
with version 1.0.

380
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,708
[KORO-SENSEI groans]

381
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,708
[NAGISA]
Koro-sensei!

382
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,458
[SHIRO] The most significant
difference, though,

383
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,708
is that his tentacles,

384
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,708
quite unlike yours and
those of the Octopus,

385
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,333
were designed for sustained use.

386
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:47,666
He requires no upkeep, rendering
him effectively disposable.

387
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,250
In exchange for being
given three months to live,

388
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,958
he can tap continuously
into unthinkable reservoirs

389
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,541
of strength.

390
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:58,666
Oh, and his expiration date
does not come with an explosion.

391
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,875
[laughing]

392
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,541
Efficient, deadly,
sustainable, and safe!

393
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,416
[KAEDE] Why do you
always have to do this?

394
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,750
Why do you always
have to hurt people?

395
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,125
Do your own dirty work for once!

396
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,458
You think I'm not willing to?

397
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,291
[MAEHARA, KAEDE gasp]

398
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,291
[SHIRO] You think I'm not
prepared to meet my own demise?

399
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,500
Come now, that's very naive.

400
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,333
What did he just do?

401
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,541
[OKUDA]
Oh no!

402
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:33,125
I'm beyond giving a damn
whether I live or die.

403
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:37,750
Everything I cared for was
stolen from me long ago.

404
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,583
I'm merely a collection of
muscle fibers, joints, nerves;

405
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,625
fertile ground for
tentacle implantation.

406
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:49,625
No, an empty temple where
God-like powers can thrive!

407
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,500
Know this, guinea pig!

408
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,000
[KORO-SENSEI gasps]

409
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,833
Your death will
haunt these children

410
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,500
for the rest of their
earthly existence!

411
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
What the--?

412
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Listen to me, class.

413
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:10,041
There's something I neglected
to mention in my earlier lesson.

414
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:14,625
A clever assassin may avoid
confrontation for a while,

415
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,000
but sooner or later,
the fight will come.

416
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,416
And when it does,

417
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,625
every last ounce of strength
will be put to the test.

418
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:27,291
In my case, that would be now!
