00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:08,750
[NAGISA]
Stop it, Kayano!

2
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,375
This is insane!

3
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,125
If you think I care...

4
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,791
...you're wrong.

5
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,958
[KAEDE] When my mind's fixed on
something, I just keep rolling!

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:22,125
[NAGISA] This is the real
Kayano, not the character.

7
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,083
She's been in boss-battle mode
for maybe 15 seconds

8
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:28,166
and already the tentacles have
gotten a foothold on her brain.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,041
If she's that far gone,
it's too late.

10
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,958
Whether she gets her revenge
on Koro-sensei or not,

11
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,666
another few minutes of this...

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,000
...she's dead.

13
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Kayano...

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,875
Kill you! Murderer!

15
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,625
Kill you! Kill you!

16
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,500
[KAEDE]
Koro-sensei...

17
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,833
Please...

18
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,708
Save me...

19
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,541
[KAEDE]
Die! Die! Die! Die!

20
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,458
You hear me?!
You're going to die!

21
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,416
But if he does,
he won't be the only one...

22
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,583
We have to do something, guys.

23
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,000
What, we just stand
here while her life's

24
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,791
being eaten away like this?!

25
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Children!

26
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,000
Koro-sensei?!

27
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,333
Just a face now?

28
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Sorry. Partial clone.

29
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,541
I'm afraid Kayano's attacks
aren't leaving me

30
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,125
a lot of wiggle room.

31
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,333
Believe me, it's all I can do to
project an afterimage of this.

32
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,041
[SUGAYA]
It's kinda cool, actually.

33
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,458
[KORO-SENSEI] Her tentacles
must be removed ASAP!

34
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,500
They're putting out this
infernal heat at tremendous cost

35
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,875
to her body!

36
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,833
She's so bent on killing me,
she's lost all reason!

37
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,166
If we don't act quickly,
they'll sap her life force

38
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,750
and kill the poor girl!

39
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,708
Trouble is, so long as
her bloodlust equals

40
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,916
that of the tentacles,

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,458
they'll be rooted into
her nervous system,

42
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,041
impossible to extract!

43
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,666
Talking her down isn't
an option as it was with Itona.

44
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,583
We simply don't have the time!

45
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,875
So... what do we do?

46
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
The only thing we can.

47
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,625
I'll have to pull 'em
out as we fight.

48
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,750
I'll have to let her hit
my most vulnerable spot--

49
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,041
the area beneath my tie.

50
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,458
My heart.

51
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:34,125
Should she completely
destroy it, death is certain.

52
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,541
But if she feels as though
she's done me in,

53
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,583
her tentacles will be
satisfied, for a moment.

54
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,291
One of you must exploit that
tiny window of opportunity

55
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,250
to make Kayano forget
her bloodlust.

56
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,875
[KIRARA]
Forget it? How?

57
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
By any means necessary.

58
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,791
Whatever it takes to get
her mind off assassination!

59
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,458
Alas, it's the only
thing I can't do.

60
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,875
If her intended target were
to try anything funny,

61
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,958
her bloodlust would
only intensify.

62
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,000
Quell it, however,
and the tentacles' bond

63
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,416
will temporarily break.

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,625
Their grip on Kayano's nervous
system will be loosened

65
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:09,625
just enough to make extraction
possible without major damage.

66
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,875
Yeah, but she'd--

67
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,291
I mean, the tentacles
would be on your heart

68
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,750
the whole time, right?

69
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,625
Wouldn't you die before we
could get them off of her?

70
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,583
[KORO-SENSEI] I might be able
to postpone the moment of death

71
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,125
long enough to regenerate,

72
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,291
but optimistically
the odds are 50-50.

--Then no!
--[KORO-SENSEI] Don't despair!

The possibility of E Class
not being allowed to graduate

75
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,791
is far worse than
the prospect of my demise.

to do against that?

00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,375
Come, 2.0.

176
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,375
[SHIRO]
March is upon us

177
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,750
and with it, a perfect end
to an accursed life.

178
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,250
[FUWA]
What's with that guy?

179
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,875
[KAEDE groans]

180
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,000
What happened?

181
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah, Kayano. Thank goodness.

182
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,375
Are you, uh... You okay?

183
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,916
[KAEDE]
Mm-hmm...

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,416
So you're back?

185
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,875
At first, I was
driven by bloodlust.

186
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,291
But, the more time
I spent with Koro-sensei,

187
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,750
the less and less
it seemed to matter.

188
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,833
I started to think,
"What's his story?

189
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,791
What about him don't I know?

190
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,625
Should I hold off killing him
till I get the whole picture?"

191
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,208
But about that time,
the tentacles took control.

192
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,666
They refused to let me wait.

193
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,291
I'm so stupid...

194
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,500
Assassination's been about
self-discovery for you,

195
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:01,083
while I've spent the past year
secretly obsessed with revenge.

196
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,791
[NAGISA]
Kayano.

197
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,000
It's 'cause of you I quit
feeling self-conscious

198
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,416
about my hair.

199
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,416
The first time we met,
you pretty much called it out

200
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
and look at me now, right?

201
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,958
And like you said,
Koro-sensei's name...

202
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,458
You're the one who
gave it to him, remember?

203
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,791
Maybe you were just
playing a role. Okay, fine.

204
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,458
Doesn't mean it wasn't
a part of you

205
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,208
or that our friendship
was based on a lie.

206
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,875
We all wear masks
from time to time.

207
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,833
We're all different on the
inside than on the out.

208
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,625
It's still the real you.

209
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,666
[NAGISA]
Here's the deal:

210
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,208
Koro-sensei owes us
an explanation as a class.

211
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,625
None of us expects him
to be a saint.

212
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,625
We know he doesn't
always do the right thing.

213
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,750
But as a class,
let's hear his story.

214
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,333
[KAEDE]
Okay...

215
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,666
And thanks...

216
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,250
It's nice to finally be real...

217
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,916
Don't worry, sir.

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,541
What's done is done.

219
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,666
As long as you tell us
the truth, we'll accept it.

220
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,291
[KORO-SENSEI groans]

221
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Thank you.

222
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:23,458
I'd hoped to never revisit
this chapter of my life.

223
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,916
And yet... I have little choice.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,833
Your trust is vital to me--

225
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,875
I would never do
anything to break it.

226
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,000
Never jeopardize our bond.

227
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Last summer, on the island,

228
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,625
Mr. Karasuma said of
Miss Irina, if you'll recall:

229
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:43,000
"There's a lot more to a good
assassin than meets the eye."

230
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,083
Those words are
especially relevant here.

231
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,458
You see, children,
this class represents

232
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,333
my first go as a teacher.

233
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,541
But, all things considered,
I think it's fair to assert

234
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,125
I've more than risen
to the challenge.

235
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,958
[KORO-SENSEI] After all,
I am a gifted improviser.

236
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,583
[gasps]

237
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,041
[TAKEBAYASHI]
Then... you mean...

238
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes.

239
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:09,125
Until two years ago, I was the
assassin known as the Reaper.

240
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,166
[gasping]

241
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
And that's not all.

242
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:16,166
Whether you kill me or not,
come March, I'm doomed.

243
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,583
Either I go alone--or I take
the Earth with me.

244
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,375
That's the only aspect of your
future assassinating me

245
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,166
can change.

246
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,291
[NAGISA gasps]

247
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,208
[NAGISA]
We wanted his story.

248
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,666
He delivered.

249
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,208
These were his memories
of being human.

250
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Born in darkness,

251
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,708
he grew to disdain the light.

252
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Weaned on soul-crushing poverty,

253
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:59,833
a child of the slums, he knew
only ugliness and degradation.

254
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,458
Life taught him that he could
only rely on three things:

255
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:08,416
Skill, money, and death.

256
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,291
Naturally, the assassin's
path beckoned.

257
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,791
Those stronger than himself,
he killed with knowledge.

258
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,666
Those more knowing,
he killed with strength.

259
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:24,333
Those gifted with both,
he killed with surpassing charm.

260
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,875
When the number of his
victims reached a thousand,

261
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,875
fittingly, rumor
christened him the Reaper.

262
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,625
[SHIRO]
Watch how you handle this one.

263
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,750
Assume he can kill you
regardless of setting

264
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,291
or apparent disadvantage.

265
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,041
Of course, it's hard to
imagine a more disadvantageous

266
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,666
setting for him than this.

267
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,791
They don't come more
clear-headed or hard-boiled.

268
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,166
There's no next-of-kin
to complain if he dies.

269
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,125
The perfect guinea pig
for our experiment

270
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,708
if ever there was one.

271
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,000
How lucky we are
to have found him.

272
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,291
[SHIRO]
Listen closely, guinea pig.

273
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,291
You may have been
the Reaper out there,

274
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,291
in here, you're a specimen.

275
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:12,125
Your daily routine is going
to be very unpleasant.

276
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,041
[door opens]

277
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,875
[AGURI]
Wow! That's a shock!

278
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,125
You don't look like
a ruthless killer.

279
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Someone drew the short straw.

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,208
Look, ma'am.
I won't do anything.

281
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,166
Can't you just get me
out of here please?

282
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,041
Sorry. It's just
that I've developed

283
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,125
an intense allergy
to being murdered.

284
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
I like her. She can be useful.

285
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,583
[KORO-SENSEI] There's only
one thing that bothers me.

286
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,708
What's with the shirt?!

287
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,416
I'm Aguri Yukimura.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

288
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,500
[SHIRO]
ATPase. Rebalance phase.

289
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,333
Give him 40 units
of SOD inhibitor.

290
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,458
[MALE RESEARCHER]
Yes, sir.

291
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
They're wide open.

292
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:30,625
But killing them now
would be... premature.

293
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,666
[SHIRO]
Hmm?

294
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,083
--[door opens]
--Ah!

295
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,500
Excellent work today.

296
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,416
Take a little while to relax.
I'll check your vitals in a few.

297
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Nice shirt.

298
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,416
It's even dorkier
than the last one.

299
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,791
[AGURI]
Huh?! Oh, come on!

300
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,958
I'm just trying to add
a little color to your life!

301
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,166
I thought you'd appreciate it!

302
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,208
To be honest,
it grinds my gears.

303
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,875
Wish I'd known that before
I fell in love with this brand.

304
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,958
Ugh. I guess my students
aren't the only ones

305
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,708
who think it's lame.

306
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,708
Students?

307
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,166
[SHIRO]
Aguri!

308
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,625
Is there any reason a simple
data check takes so long?!

309
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,625
[AGURI] I-I'm sorry,
Kotaro, we were just--

[AGURI groans]

312
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,416
If your dolt of a father weren't
one of my core subcontractors,

313
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,583
it'd be you on the other
side of the glass!

314
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,958
You owe me!

315
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,083
I let you slide on
the connubial duties,

316
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,375
but here, I expect
professionalism!

317
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,750
[SHIRO]
See you tomorrow, guinea pig.

318
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,625
It's going to be a busy day.

319
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,916
[SHIRO chuckles]

320
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,250
[KORO-SENSEI grunts, groans]

321
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,583
[KORO-SENSEI] The chief ambition
of Yanagisawa's research

322
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,916
was to generate
organic antimatter.

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,416
To that end, he would
stop at nothing.

324
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,750
He spliced the particle
acceleration cycle

325
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,958
necessary for antimatter into
the life cycle of a cell,

326
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,791
effectively priming the cell's
engine and infusing it

327
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,291
with astonishing power.

328
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,041
Hey, Yanagisawa?

329
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,541
There's no feeling
in my hands or feet.

330
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,208
And I'm chilled to the bone.

331
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,166
"Mister" Yanagisawa!

332
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,250
Ugh. And peripheral neuropathy
is par for the course.

333
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,708
[MALE RESEARCHER] I recommend we
take him off the alkaloid, sir.

334
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,666
[KORO-SENSEI] If I can subtly
manipulate the process myself,

335
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,500
I'll boost the
likelihood of success.

336
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:27,041
[KORO-SENSEI] Destructive powers
beyond all measure will be mine.

337
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,875
Wow! Lots to get to
on the checklist today!

338
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,833
Best get started if I don't
wanna get smacked around.

339
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,958
I take it that's a
frequent worry for you.

340
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,500
[AGURI]
Oh, yeah.

341
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,375
Can't let the sense
get knocked out of me.

342
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,250
There'd be nothing
to pass on to my class.

343
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Your class?

344
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,125
[SHIRO]
Aguri! Damn it, woman!

345
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,666
Why must you try my patience?!

346
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,166
I-I was just getting
started, dear!

347
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,708
[SHIRO] Put those
clerical skills to use!

348
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,375
Or have I overestimated your
capacity for basic grunt work?

349
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,833
You have one job!
Learn to do it!

350
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,583
Huh?

351
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,208
What did you do?

352
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,083
Mister Reaper, you--

353
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,083
He's just immobilized, ma'am.

354
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,916
Relax. You have a classroom
to think about, right?

355
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,458
[chuckles]

356
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,791
[KORO-SENSEI] After three
months in that dreadful place,

357
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,041
the teacher and the killer
were as open with each other

358
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,541
as old friends.

359
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,083
[AGURI sighs]

360
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Quadratic equations?

361
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,750
Might I suggest you
dress them up a little?

362
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,000
Never go too easy
on college prep school students.

363
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,375
[AGURI]
Huh?

364
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,708
The mercenary giving career
advice to the educator?

365
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,708
You know, I'm starting to think
you're better suited

366
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,416
to my teaching gig than me.

367
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,625
Ah, well, I could
definitely play the part

368
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,875
if the job called for it.

369
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,916
But, uh... I'm not
cut out for the real thing.

370
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,958
Huh...?

371
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Believe it or not,

372
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:59,708
I had a protégé once.
He betrayed me.

373
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,250
How do you think I
wound up in this place?

374
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,125
[REAPER]
Uh-oh.

375
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,666
It looks as though you'll
be passing on more

376
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,500
than just your skill set.

377
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,041
Don't worry, though.

378
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,833
Your name will live in infamy
through a thousand faces.

379
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,416
Goodbye, sir. It's been fun.

380
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,291
A shame you
never really knew me.

381
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,000
Maybe another time.

382
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
How could I be so blind?

383
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,458
I cultivated his abilities.

384
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,208
Gauged his progress
in minute detail.

385
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,500
[AGURI]
He wanted to be seen.

386
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,416
Huh?

387
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,791
[AGURI]
He wanted your approval.

388
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,333
Everything he did was just
to get your attention.

389
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,208
Believe me.

390
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,958
But I watched the boy
like a hawk.

391
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,500
Everyone wants attention.

392
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,791
That's the key
to winning them over.

393
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,500
[KORO-SENSEI groans]

394
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,083
[SHIRO]
Break time's over, guinea pig.

395
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,458
Back to work.

396
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,500
On the table, please.

397
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,958
We have some tests to run.

398
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,583
[MALE RESEARCHER]
The changes our subject's body

399
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,750
is undergoing are unprecedented.

400
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,791
I hate to think of
the havoc he'll cause

401
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,125
when he decides he's had enough.

402
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,750
Oh, if he tries to escape,

403
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,375
taking Aguri hostage will be
the linchpin of his strategy.

404
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,916
Come now. You didn't
suppose I gave her this job

405
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,250
out of the goodness
of my heart?

406
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:25,333
She's a pawn. A sacrificial
lamb to gauge his mileage.

407
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,166
[KORO-SENSEI groans]

408
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,583
[retching]

409
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,041
[AGURI gasps]

410
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,208
[MALE RESEARCHER] This is
the reaction we anticipated.

411
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,375
It's all right. He'll be fine.

412
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:43,375
[KORO-SENSEI coughs]

413
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
She was part of the experiment.

414
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:55,208
The Reaper was turning into
something altogether inhuman.

415
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,166
She suspected as much.

416
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,375
But didn't wish to burden
her superiors with questions.

417
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,458
[AGURI]
Great job again today.

418
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,791
Take a second
to catch your breath

419
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,500
and I'll take your vitals.

420
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,666
[AGURI] I'll stick around so
we can visit for a while.

421
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,958
[KORO-SENSEI] She looked
straight ahead and smiled.

422
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,291
Sweet and lighthearted as ever.

423
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Of course...

424
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,791
Everyone wants
attention, approval.

425
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,833
Sounds lovely.

426
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,166
You bring the exam questions?

427
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
The legendary killer

428
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,875
who'd never shown
himself to anyone,

429
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,791
at last understood
the joy of being seen.

430
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
The seasons changed.

431
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,958
A new school year began.

432
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,333
A fresh batch of students
gathered under the roof

433
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,083
of Kunugigaoka's Class 3-E.

434
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Little did they know,

435
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,625
in only two week's time,

436
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,250
the moon would become
a permanent crescent.
