00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Merry Christmas!

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,291
[STUDENTS]
Merry Christmas!

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
What a magical Christmas Eve!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,083
And in February,
no less! How festive!

5
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,208
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

6
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Happy New Year!

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,791
Out with the old
and in with the new!

8
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,291
That's right, boys and girls!

9
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,208
Throw yourself into study and,
of course, assassination,

10
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,291
with renewed vigor!

11
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,375
Now...

12
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,500
...time to laze the day away.

13
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,791
[STUDENTS]
Where's he going with all this?

14
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,625
Oh, I think I'm starting
to get the picture.

15
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,833
You're trying to cram all the
good times you missed out on

16
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,541
over the Winter Break into
February, is that what this is?

17
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Precisely!

18
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,708
Our only Winter Break together,

19
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,708
and not one of
you came to visit.

20
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,208
'Course, I knew you
were worried about me

21
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,208
and trying your hardest
to find a solution,

22
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,666
which is why it didn't seem
proper to invite anyone over,

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,041
but still.

24
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,125
Seems kinda weird to be all
bummed out about it now,

25
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,708
don't'cha think, sir?

26
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,791
[KORO-SENSEI] Water under the
bridge, as far as I'm concerned!

27
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,541
We'll simply reclaim
the time we lost

28
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,541
by having all the fun at once!

29
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,000
[NAGISA] Koro-sensei's
living life to the fullest,

30
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,000
as frantically as ever.

31
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,583
Still. It's February.

32
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,041
March is just around the corner.

33
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,083
We've got to face the future.

34
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,458
Figure out where we're going
before we say goodbye.

35
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:23,500
Thirty-two days. That's all
the time we have left.

36
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,416
Koro-sensei deadline
is practically here.

37
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,041
[MAEHARA]
Future plans, huh?

38
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,166
Okay, what high
school you goin' to?

39
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,958
I was thinkin'
someplace lower level

40
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,541
so I can have a
little bit of elbowroom.

41
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,500
Well, we've definitely
got fundamentals down

42
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,583
through senior year.

43
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,333
High school can be
about fine-tuning

44
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,958
what Koro-sensei's taught us.

45
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,708
That's one way
to look at it, sure.

46
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,833
I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna push myself.

47
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,541
"It takes a pristine
academic record

48
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,166
to make it in
Communications these days."

49
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,208
So I'm told, at least.

50
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,208
[OKAJIMA, SUGAYA]
Wah-wah!

51
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,291
[FUWA chuckles]

52
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,833
So, Karma, what're
your sights set on?

53
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,000
[KARMA]
Hmm...

54
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,041
I figure I'll just
stay at Kunugigaoka.

55
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,125
You're gonna subject yourself
to the entrance exam

56
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,083
all over again?

57
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,125
Wow, seems kinda low profile.

58
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,000
With your grades you could
get into any school you want.

59
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,166
Put yourself in the shoes
of the kids on Main Campus.

60
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,791
The guy they thought was
exiled is suddenly back,

61
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,208
looming head and
shoulders above 'em all.

62
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,416
What could be sweeter
than sailing by on an ocean

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,750
of humiliated faces for
three whole years, right?

64
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,250
That's a winning
personality you've got.

65
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,000
And besides, there are tons
of decent schools out there

66
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,458
if all you care about
is your transcript.

67
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,583
But do any of 'em boast an
arch nemesis worthy of me?

68
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,375
I'm inclined to say no.

69
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,000
Have fun while you can.

70
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,125
Broader ambitions
can come later.

71
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,541
What I want out
of life right now

72
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,583
is a good academic
battle, or three.

73
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,916
That's so you.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And? What's your high
school of choice, Nagisa?

75
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,083
You picked one?

76
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,833
[NAGISA]
Mh-hm.

77
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:30,375
[NAGISA] Just like Kayano.
Sugino. Everyone.

78
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,708
It's almost time to part ways.

79
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,791
Each of us going
wherever the future leads.

80
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,125
Believe it or not,

81
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,916
my top pick is Keisetsu
University's high school.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,083
It's crazy hard, but hands
down the best shortcut

83
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,833
for getting into the college
Mom hopes I'll go to.

84
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:52,083
After that? I don't know.

85
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,458
I have certain skills.
There's no question of that.

86
00:04:55,541 --> 00:05:00,125
Trouble is... what I'm good at
puts me out of step with others.

87
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,500
Seems like everyone knows
where they're going but me.

88
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,750
[SAKURA]
Hey. Yoo-hoo!

89
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,791
How many times I gotta
tell you? I'm finished!

90
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,041
Ha, ha. Oh, sorry about that.

91
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,541
Come on, snap out of it already!

92
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,791
You're supposed to be
giving me the academic chops

93
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,333
to march back into school!

94
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,333
I thought the idea was
to enroll this term,

95
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,833
not when I'm like old n' crusty!

96
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,833
Hey, don't worry,
we'll get you there.

97
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,416
Just, dial it back a teensy bit.

98
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,750
[SAKURA]
Huh...

99
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,083
You're worried about your
own future, aren't you?

100
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,416
Junior high kids
sure have it rough.

101
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,916
I have no earthly
idea what I wanna be.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,416
[SAKURA]
Uh?

103
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,875
You have options?

104
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,333
Apart from the obvious
choice of profession, I mean.

105
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,291
Your path seems
pretty clear to me.

106
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,291
What've we been doing
this entire time?

107
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,666
You're gonna be
a teacher, silly.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,500
[NAGISA]
A what?

109
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,666
[SAKURA] Of course, if you're
not feelin' it, I understand...

110
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,458
[NAGISA] It took her saying
it for me to realize.

111
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:58,041
A teacher. Someone with
the power to change lives.

112
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,583
Suppose a kid gets
saved by a doctor.

113
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,666
Naturally, he grows up
wanting to be one.

114
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,708
A kid sees an assassin
wielding his blade,

115
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,708
and from then on, it's
all he can think about.

116
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,000
Or maybe,

117
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:15,416
a kid sees a teacher
molding young minds.

118
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,958
Yeah, but...

119
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,708
[EXAMINEE A]
Um, what is that?

120
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,708
[NAGISA]
Uh?

121
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,708
Someone's family, I guess?

122
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,041
[KORO-SENSEIS]
Go! Go! Nagisa!

123
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:36,416
Go, go Nagisa!
Go, go Nagisa! Woo! Yay!

124
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,750
Okay, then. Um, is that
an actual mob of giants?

125
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,875
Ugh. I do not
appreciate those weirdos

126
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,458
hogging the send-off ceremony.

127
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,916
Koro-sensei, what in the heck
do you think you're doing?!

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
[KORO-SENSEIS]
I'm cheering you on, of course!

129
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,750
[KORO-SENSEI] You didn't suppose
I'd let my prize student's

130
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,125
big moment slip by unnoticed!

131
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh dear! Look at the time!

132
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,166
I've got to drop by
and cheer on Kimura!

133
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,625
And Kanzaki! And Chiba!
And Hayami! And Hara!

134
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,125
[NAGISA]
Uh!

135
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,791
[KORO-SENSEIS]
You got this! Up, up and away!

136
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,666
[NAGISA] I'll never be a teacher
like him, that's for sure.

137
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,500
[NAGISA] The last career
counseling session

138
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,625
is at the end of February,
after our entrance exams.

139
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,833
I've got until then to make up
my mind one way or the other.

140
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,500
For now, though, I'll focus on
the target right in front of me.

141
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,833
[OKAJIMA whimpering]

142
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:35,166
[MEG] Okay, I'll just ask.
What's wrong with you, Okajima?

143
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,333
Uh. What, with me? Nothing!

144
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,750
Is it because of the
chocolates? Please.

145
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,000
[OKAJIMA] I-I have absolutely no
idea what you're talking about!

146
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,083
You're sick.

147
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,583
[OKAJIMA]
Uh! It's Valentine's Day!

148
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,833
I'm just excited is all!

149
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,333
And don't worry.

150
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,666
I'm not gonna eat any of that
cheap-o crap you give out!

151
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,750
[MEG] Excuse me? What is
that supposed to mean?

152
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,666
[KARMA]
What do we have here?

153
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,333
[NAKAMURA] And who's the lucky
fella you're giving these to?

154
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,833
What are you talking about?
They're just a formality!

155
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,250
Why do you have to go there?

156
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,708
Everybody likes chocolate.
They could be for anyone!

157
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,250
[KARMA]
Right.

158
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,333
And by "anyone" I assume you
mean this little stud muffin?

159
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,666
[screams]

160
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,166
[KAEDE]
It's true, it's true...

161
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,166
[KARMA] Weird. Her acting chops
are usually more spot on.

162
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,041
[NAKAMURA] Not even
Koro-sensei wised up to her

163
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,125
before it was almost too late.

164
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,541
[KARMA]
It was that kiss.

165
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,166
Ever since Nagisa
laid one on her,

166
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,583
the girl's been a
bona fide hot mess.

167
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,541
[NAKAMURA] Heh. If we bring
the two of 'em together...

168
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,916
[KARMA] ...we can tease two
love birds with one stone!

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,833
[NAKAMURA, KARMA]
We've got a shiny new plaything!

170
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,958
[NAKAMURA] His self-esteem
isn't exactly the highest.

171
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,833
Poor guy can't imagine
the opposite sex

172
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,375
wanting anything to do with him.

173
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,833
It's why he's avoiding you.

174
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,208
See, in his mind,

175
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,291
that smooch is something
you're pissed as hell about.

176
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,541
That's just how he is.

177
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,750
Till you say otherwise,
that's what he'll think.

178
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,083
I know, it's just...

179
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,291
I mean, I've played being
in love dozens of times,

180
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,708
but this is totally different.

181
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,708
I have no real-life experience
crushing on a classmate.

182
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,166
Like, what am I supposed to say

183
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,250
when I give the
chocolates to him?

184
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,458
[KARMA]
Ah. Want us to do some recon?

185
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,833
[gasps]

186
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,500
Maybe a little covert
training would be in order?

187
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,500
Absolutely! Absolutely!

188
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,291
[KANZAKI]
I'm, uh, glad you like them.

189
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,375
[KARMA] See, in this case
the receiver is overjoyed.

190
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,208
But observe how the giver is
rather a bit on the cool side.

191
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,583
Total formality.

192
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,458
His "overjoyed" face
is terrifying.

193
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,916
Impressive.

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,916
Your shots are just as accurate
when using chocolate ammunition.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,708
Here's the rest.
You've more than earned it.

196
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,291
Good call.

197
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,416
I respect you.
Let's keep it that way.

198
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,750
[RYUNOSUKE]
Sure.

199
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,708
See? Now there's a couple
that's always on target.

200
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,791
Gotta love that skill.

201
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,458
[KAEDE]
I can't imitate that.

202
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,750
I can't even tell
if she meant it.

203
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,958
Gentlemen, I await your
answers with baited breath.

204
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,458
To each of you, a love letter.

205
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,416
I put a lot of
myself into these.

206
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,458
[TERASAKA] Yourself?
More like an ancient curse!

207
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,208
She beat me to the punch.

208
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,791
I had Okuda cook me up a batch

209
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,291
I planned on leaving in
Teresaka's shoe locker.

210
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,083
Here's your
Valentine's Day cyanide!

211
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,166
What is wrong with you?!

212
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,333
That's not what
chocolate is for at all!

213
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
[ISOGAI]
Whoa!

214
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,750
All these for me?
Is this for real?

215
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,000
I thought you might
like to share them

216
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,125
with your brother and sister.

217
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,000
Nothing fancy, just bulk stuff
from a wholesale store.

218
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,958
Took me four hours to
ride there and back.

219
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,166
[ISOGAI]
Uh.

220
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,208
But how'd you even--?
When did you study?

221
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,625
[MEG]
It's not a big deal.

222
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,375
After all, I have days
before the entrance exams.

223
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,916
I'm going to state school.

224
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,333
That makes you and
me both, doesn't it?

225
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,833
[ISOGAI]
Guess so. Hope we can get in.

226
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:44,958
[MEG]
Right?

227
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,375
[NAKAMURA]
See?

228
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,958
Everyone has his or her
distinct approach to this stuff.

229
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,041
Best policy is to say
what you have to say

230
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:52,916
in your own words.

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,458
You should just be yourself.

232
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,708
Yeah. I guess so.
Thank you, guys.

233
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,166
Only problem I see?

234
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,208
[KAEDE]
Hm?

235
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,166
[NAKAMURA]
Privacy.

236
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,791
With the Octo-perv on watch,
there basically is none.

237
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,583
Oh, you can just
leave that to me.

238
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,625
Kayano, I do hope you
brought the you-know-what.

239
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,791
Uh... Oh, yeah.

240
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,083
Oughta put Koro-sensei
on lockdown long enough

241
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,041
for you to get the job done.

242
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,291
Don't worry about him.

243
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,583
Concentrate on giving
Nagisa those chocolates.

244
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,041
[KAEDE]
Right.

245
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,458
Where are my
Valentine's chocolates?

246
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,916
I know I got something!
Nagisa, help me look!

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,541
Some joker probably
thought it'd be funny

248
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,208
to hide them on the mountain!

249
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,666
[NAGISA]
Huh?

250
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,083
Kayano?

251
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,083
[NAGISA] What's wrong?
Why're you so quiet?

252
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,708
[KAEDE] Oh, God.
My heart's beating so fast!

253
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,083
How do I do this?

254
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,833
Do I look all right?
What do I say?

255
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,250
[KAEDE]
Uh, hey, Nagisa.

256
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,583
Where're you headed
after graduation?

257
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,166
Honestly, I know the
career path I wanna follow,

258
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,083
I'm just not real sure that
it's something I'm cut out for.

259
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,583
[gasps]

260
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,000
[KAEDE]
He wants to be teacher.

261
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,708
It's obvious he looks
up to Koro-sensei.

262
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,500
Not for the reasons
most of us do,

263
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,416
but because
Koro-sensei has a knack

264
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,833
for bringing out
the best in people.

265
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,625
When Nagisa talks to him
at the end of the month

266
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,958
about a future career,
he'll ask about education.

267
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:46,666
[NAGISA]
Huh?

268
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,875
[KAEDE gasps]

269
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,750
[NAGISA] What's Koro-sensei
doing up there?

270
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,458
He's fixated, whatever it is.

271
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,500
[gasps]

272
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,250
[NAGISA]
Of course he's out of range.

273
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,583
Why would I think he'd leave
himself so open to attack?

274
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,083
[KAEDE]
Oh.

275
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:11,208
That look. I love it when he
stares dead ahead like that.

276
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,458
He's so intense.

277
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,583
Not that long ago,
revenge was my whole life.

278
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,708
I should've been crushed
when my plan failed,

279
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,708
but I wasn't because it was
Nagisa who stopped me.

280
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,166
He's the kindest soul
I've ever known.

281
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,000
Sure, he's an assassin,

282
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,500
but his bloodlust filled
the hole in my heart.

283
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,708
[KAEDE]
What do I say to that face?

284
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,875
What words do I use?

285
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,541
[KAEDE]
Nagisa.

286
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,708
As a thank you.

287
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,041
These chocolates are yours.
For always being by my side.

288
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,083
[gasps]

289
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,208
[KAEDE]
Here.

290
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,291
Are you sure?

291
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,333
Yep!

292
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,416
--Okay, then.
--But I'm the one...

293
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,625
Mission accomplished.
Job well done.

294
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,791
Move along.
See you tomorrow, okay?

295
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,791
Hope you get in the
school you're aiming for!

296
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,333
[NAGISA]
Yeah, thanks.

297
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,750
[KAEDE] There he goes.
Staring dead ahead.

298
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,250
It's not right for me to get
in his way, he needs to focus.

299
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,208
But I can thank him without
complicating things.

300
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,500
I'll use the sharpest
blade in my repertoire.

301
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,291
My acting ability.

302
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,750
[KARMA] Imagine being able
to cast your feelings aside

303
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,875
at the moment of
truth like that.

304
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,541
Wow, there's no question
she's Miss Yukimura's sister.

305
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,208
[NAKAMURA]
No kidding, right? So noble.

306
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,250
Well damn, now I feel
guilty thinking about

307
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,916
trying to steal from her.

308
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,166
Come again?

309
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,041
Uh, never mind. I didn't
say anything. So, yeah.

310
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,500
[KARMA]
Hm?

311
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,333
[NAKAMURA] What exactly has
Koro-sensei so enthralled?

312
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,291
[KARMA]
Ah. I had Kayano leave a note

313
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,500
and some chocolates
somewhere obvious,

314
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,625
with a special photo of course.

315
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,000
[NAKAMURA]
You dog.

316
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,416
[KARMA] If I'd known it was
gonna work this well,

317
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,166
I'd have used as
bait long before now.

318
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,208
[KARASUMA] A four-star
Valentine's Day dinner?

319
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,750
What's in it for you?

320
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,875
[IRINA chuckles]

321
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,166
I'm told you menfolk
tend to give back

322
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,291
three times as
much on White Day.

323
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,500
Seems like an honorable
tradition to me.

324
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,208
Of course, I can't imagine how
you could possibly measure up.

325
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,166
Ah... We'll see, won't we?

326
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,708
I'm out.

327
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,708
[IRINA] Don't be like that!
At least stay through the meal!

328
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,291
That wasn't meant as a jab
at your manhood, I swear!

329
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,458
You don't know what I went
through to get reservations!

330
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,916
I'm surprised a place like this

331
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
would let someone like
you cross the threshold.

332
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,458
[IRINA]
Here, from Hinano.

333
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,625
She asked if I'd
mind passing it on.

334
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,541
You're at school so
seldom these days.

335
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,291
When I see an opening,
that man is mine!

336
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,208
[IRINA]
Poor girl.

337
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,500
She seems to have gotten it in
her head that we're a thing now.

338
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,375
[KARASUMA] Hm. Bet the boys
are brokenhearted.

339
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,083
I got a veritable boatload
of chocolates, even for me.

340
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,625
I'm sure a few kids
thought it might be

341
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,416
their last Valentine's Day.

342
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,583
Can't blame 'em for
going overboard.

343
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,250
So, what's goin' on
in your world lately?

344
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,041
How's the "big plan?"?

345
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,541
[grumbles]

346
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,458
[IRINA] The kids think if
they can keep the Octopus

347
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,166
from blowing up,
everything'll work out.

348
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,833
Of course, we know
better, don't we?

349
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,583
[KARASUMA] That's why
we're in a private room

350
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,125
at a place she trusts.

351
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,708
I should've known.

352
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,250
[KARASUMA]
Maybe.

353
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,208
I have been meaning to
talk to you, actually.

354
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,208
I've been relegated
to providing E-Class

355
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,083
with proprietary guidance,

356
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,500
so I'm kept out of the loop.

357
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,500
They'll likely only brief
me at the 11th hour.

358
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,166
But... something
is in the works.

359
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,416
The government is moving forward

360
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,666
with a secret
assassination project.

361
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,166
There's no doubt.

362
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,708
[EMPLOYEE B gasps]

363
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,166
[EMPLOYEE A] Seeing it again
like this, I'm stunned.

364
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,458
[EMPLOYEE B] But do you
think it can eliminate him?

365
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,000
[EXECUTIVE A] You may take
my word for it, gentlemen.

366
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,250
The question with this weapon
isn't whether it is capable,

367
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:56,083
but rather how efficiently
and smoothly it can do the job.

368
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,666
[chuckling]

369
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,791
[KORO-SENSEI] A first-rate
mind and a first-rate figure!

370
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,875
[chuckling]

371
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,750
--[door opens]
--[KORO-SENSEI yelping]

372
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,625
[ASANO] I must say,
seeing one of my teachers

373
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,708
so enamored with a
questionable photograph

374
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,041
does not strictly
inspire confidence.

375
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,916
[KORO-SENSEI] Mr. Principal,
sir, wherever did you come from?

376
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,208
[ASANO]
I find your work ethic wanting.

377
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,875
There will be a
corresponding pay cut.

378
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,000
[KORO-SENSEI screams]

379
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
I beg your mercy!

380
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,541
[ASANO]
Miss Yukimura, I believe.

381
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,000
It's a pity we lost such talent.

382
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:31,041
Her passion for teaching was
matched only by her vitality.

383
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,875
Given a few more years,

384
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,041
she would've become
an outstanding educator.

385
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Indeed.

386
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,541
Oh, by the way,

387
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,416
I understand there's
an excellent chance

388
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,416
of your life being spared.

389
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,375
If you do survive this,
would you indulge me?

390
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,458
I want you to continue
teaching E-Class next year.

391
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,916
Truthfully, I find your fixed
expression and singular anatomy

392
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,375
to be rather, well,
suited to the position.

393
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'm flattered, sir.

394
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,750
You judge fellow educators
purely on aptitude,

395
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,916
unmoved by sentiment or
the shadow of their past.

396
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,541
To be offered a job
by such a man

397
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,500
is the best mark
one could hope for.

398
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,750
Alas, I decided it's
best for this year

399
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,708
to be my last at the blackboard.

400
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,000
[ASANO]
What will you do?

401
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Anyone's guess, really.

402
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,541
I have a mind to circumnavigate
the globe in a sailboat.

403
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,500
May I just say how
delightful it's been

404
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,875
having you as an archrival
through all this.

405
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,083
Your dedication is
nothing short of inspiring.

406
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,416
The feeling is mutual.

407
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,625
I don't suppose
you're open to bribery?

408
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh?

409
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,625
[ASANO]
In the grand design,

410
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,833
I rule this institution
from on high

411
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,500
while the Miss Yukimuras of
the world support it from below.

412
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:45,541
The perfect expression of
my educational philosphy.

413
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,791
[KORO-SENSEI] What's that boy
of yours up to these days?

414
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,291
[ASANO]
Ah.

415
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,791
Arranging the pecking order
for high school, I suspect.

416
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,750
He'll have the whole
system under his thumb

417
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,208
by the end of freshman year.

418
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,458
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

419
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
A truly remarkable young man.

420
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,625
[ASANO]
Well, we're not quite there yet.

421
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,958
He still has a few
lessons to learn.

422
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,833
[IRINA]
Can I be honest with you?

423
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,500
I'm not so sure it'd
be such a bad thing

424
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,375
if the world were destroyed.

425
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,333
For the kids, anyway.

426
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,708
They'll never get over it
if they can't kill him.

427
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,833
They'll be haunted by that
failure the rest of their lives.

428
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,625
And they'd resent having
their thunder stolen

429
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,416
by some big shot,
government-sponsored mercenary,

430
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,541
or whatever the Powers
That Be are cooking up.

431
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,833
But think about it.

432
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,166
Imagine those kids
watching their teacher die,

433
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,083
the Octopus writhing in agony

434
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,500
at the hands of one
of their classmates.

435
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,250
[IRINA]
They're screwed either way.

436
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,625
The trauma will follow
them to the grave.

437
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:44,208
However this turns out,
we're talking years of therapy.

438
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,666
Being part of
something like this

439
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,791
just twists you in a way
you can never undo. Ever.

440
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:51,958
[KARASUMA]
Irina.

441
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,000
[IRINA]
Uh?

442
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Once this business is said
and done, you should quit.

443
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,208
You're just not built for it.

444
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,041
[IRINA]
Excuse me?

445
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,083
[KARASUMA] Can't you see?
Your feelings run too deep.

446
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,416
Over the past year
they've taken the wheel.

447
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,041
If you're this worried about
your students being affected,

448
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,750
what might another job down
the road put you through?

449
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,416
Sure. You can dismiss the life
I've made for myself. Why not?

450
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,666
It's easy to pass judgment
from the nosebleed section.

451
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,750
But here on the ground,
I'm a killer.

452
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,208
There's no going back from that.

453
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,958
No place in the sun
waiting for me

454
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,208
to shed the past
and reinvent myself.

455
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,916
[KARASUMA] Everything we
experience is a tool

456
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,708
for clearing one's path.

457
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,625
That's the most important thing
I've learned on this job.

458
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,916
What those kids taught me.

459
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,333
I understand your concern,

460
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,083
but they have resilience
down to an art form.

461
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,625
Whatever they face,
however horrible,

462
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,625
they know how to let
it nourish them.

463
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,291
Irina, why don't you
come work for us?

464
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,208
Huh?

465
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,458
You have skill,

466
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,958
an impressive range of
professional experience.

467
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,750
As far as we're concerned,
your past is just that.

468
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,458
With us, you'll save more
people than you've killed.

469
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,208
And if you want, every morning,

470
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,916
you can pray for your
victims at the shrine.

471
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,625
Something to consider.

472
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,041
[IRINA]
What do you mean a shrine?

473
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,666
You are aware that I identify
as Christian, right?

474
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,500
And why stay where
I hardly know anyone?

475
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,625
[KARASUMA]
I don't think you understand.

476
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,625
There's no church anywhere
near my house, sorry.

477
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,541
[IRINA]
Uhhh...

478
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,458
[gasps]

479
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,166
What?!

480
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,375
Wait a minute!

481
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,041
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?!

482
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,166
[KARASUMA]
Probably.

483
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,583
[IRINA]
Wah!

484
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,625
A man and a woman can't
live together out of wedlock!

485
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,083
What will people think?!

486
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,041
[KARASUMA]
Suit yourself, then.

487
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,041
[IRINA]
Ah!

488
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,375
No! It's fine!

489
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,291
It's the 21st century!
It's a different world!

490
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,750
Wait for me!
