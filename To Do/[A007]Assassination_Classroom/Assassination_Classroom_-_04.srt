1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,833
[CLERK A] Oh!
Hey there, Big Teach!

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:11,916
Long time no see!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
I know, right?

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,083
Thank goodness for payday!

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,583
[KORO-SENSEI] Your one-stop shop
for cheap, delicious junk food.

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,208
Well worth the trouble
of going incognito.

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,583
[WOMAN]
Hey, cut it out!

8
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Eh?

9
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,375
[MAN A]
Lighten up, doll face.

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,000
[WOMAN] Please,
I don't have time for this,

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,375
my students are expecting me.

12
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,166
So you're a teacher, are ya?

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,250
What would you say
to a li'l private tutoring

14
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,500
to help get our grades up?

15
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Allow me to tutor you gentlemen

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,250
on how to flirt with a lady.

17
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,500
[MEN gasp, grunt]

18
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Lesson One: First Impressions.

19
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,958
Know what your wheels
say about your game.

20
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,291
[MEN scream]

21
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,125
[MEN]
Why did you use pink?!

22
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
There is no Lesson Two.

23
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,833
Are you all right?

24
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,583
[WOMAN gasps]
Who says chivalry is dead?

25
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,541
You're a prince among men.

26
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,500
Thank you. I'll remember
this kindness always.

27
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,166
By the way...

28
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,708
I'm trying to find
Kunugigaoka Junior High.

29
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,000
Do you know where it is?

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,625
[KARASUMA] Okay.
Look alive, people.

31
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:43,125
Meet our newest addition
to the E Class faculty.

32
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,333
[IRINA] My name is
Ms. Irina Jelavic.

33
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,208
Nice to meet you all!

34
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,083
[SUGINO]
Talk about a knockout!

35
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,416
[OKAJIMA]
Knockers, more like.

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,208
[MEG] Does anybody
else think it's weird

37
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,083
--she's all over Koro-sensei?
--[IRINA] What are the chances?

38
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,875
--[NAKAMURA] Little bit, yeah.
--Who knew we'd be colleagues?

39
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,208
Oh, you're adorable!

40
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,208
We decided to bring on Ms.
Jelavic in the interest

41
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,166
of beefing up
the English curriculum.

42
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,166
No hard feelings, I hope.
She's, uh, very qualified.

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
No harm in that, is there?

44
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,833
She totally has a thing
for Koro-sensei.

45
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:13,291
I mean, she seems nice, so...
I guess it's kinda cute, right?

46
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,958
[NAGISA] Mm-hm. Might be
something we can use

47
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,458
to figure out
how to kill him, too.

48
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,541
--He seems thrown off
--[IRINA giggles]

49
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,166
by the attention
she's giving him.

50
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,083
Is it because she's human,
or because she's a woman?

51
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,333
His face changes color
to reflect his mood.

52
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:31,541
So what's the color for
hot and bothered?

53
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,666
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]

54
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,458
[MAEHARA]
He is all about her.

55
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,500
[KAEDE]
Yeah. No mistaking that face.

56
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,333
[NAGISA]
Note: He blushes like a human.

57
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,458
Ahh... The more
I look at you,

58
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,375
the more I feel myself drawn in.
Those tiny, suppository eyes.

59
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,416
Those gelatinous joints.

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,625
I'm simply captivated
by the whole package!

61
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, my. I, uh--

62
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,458
[OKANO] Don't fall for it,
she's trouble!

63
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,708
[NAKAMURA] No woman in her
right mind would be into you.

64
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,875
[NAGISA] He might be
a sucker for those looks.

65
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,416
But we know there's more going
on here than meets the eye.

66
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,958
If she's here, odds are
it's not just to

67
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,333
"beef up" our English studies.

68
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,458
[KORO-SENSEI] Let's see you
pass the ball! Come on!

69
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,125
And of course I had all
the usual close-range tricks

70
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,500
at the ready.

71
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,500
Apparently the art of
seduction works just as well

72
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,041
on whatever the hell he is.

73
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,500
[KARASUMA growls]

74
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:29,500
[KARASUMA] Irina Jelavic.
First-rate assassin.

75
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,208
Beautiful.
Intelligent. Athletic.

76
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,583
Fluent in a dozen languages.

77
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,791
No target is immune
to her charms,

78
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:41,583
whatever their nationality,
however well-guarded.

79
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,000
She wrote the book on
infiltration and approach.

80
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,625
As good as you are,
we can't just drop you

81
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,333
into this situation and expect
the usual tricks to work.

82
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,250
I know deep cover
is your specialty.

83
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,583
But this time you'll actually
have to actually teach.

84
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,833
Hah. As if I'll
be here long enough.

85
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,208
I'm a professional.

86
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,458
The octopus'll be pushing up
daisies before lunch.

87
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Heads up!

88
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,625
[KARMA]
Pass and kill!

89
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Nope. Pass.

90
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,250
[OKANO grunts]
Pass and kill! Huh?

91
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,833
--[KORO-SENSEI] Try again. Pass!
--[IRINA] Yoo-hoo!

92
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,416
Hope I'm not interrupting
anything, darling!

93
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,125
Mr. Karasuma tells me
you can go Mach 20

94
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,250
and I just had to see it
with my own eyes!

95
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,791
[KORO-SENSEI] Well, he might've
been exaggerating a tad.

96
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,708
I hate to ask this, but...

97
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,750
I would be ever so grateful
if you could fetch

98
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,333
some Vietnamese coffee.

99
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,583
I thought maybe you could
grab it while I run the students

100
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,166
through their English lesson.

101
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
But of course, mon cher!

102
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,250
It just so happens I know a
fabulous cafe in Vietnam.

103
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,458
[IRINA gasps]

104
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,916
[STUDENTS yell]

105
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,250
[school bell chimes]

106
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:49,000
Ah. It's about that
time, Ms. Irina.

107
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,125
I mean, that's the bell.

108
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,458
Shouldn't we head back?

109
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,708
Sure, whatever.
Knock yourselves out.

110
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,291
Teacher needs peace and quiet,
though, so make it a Study Hall.

111
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,750
[MAEHARA gasping]

112
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,625
And another thing.

113
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,166
Let's agree not to call me "Ms."
when the octopus isn't around.

114
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,583
And we're definitely not on a
first name basis. So drop it.

115
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,375
When he is around,
call me Ms. Jelavic.

116
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,291
Heh. So what's your
game, Ms. Jela-bitch?

117
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,541
No nicknames!

118
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,666
We got ourselves
a real pro here.

119
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,083
Just a word of
warning from those

120
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,708
who've been playin' the odds.

121
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,833
You're not gonna kill
the octopus without help.

122
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,333
Please, sweetheart.
You're a bunch of saplings.

123
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,250
Adults have their own way
of doing things, take note.

124
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,458
Speaking of which,
you're Nagisa Shiota, right?

125
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,916
[NAGISA gasps]

126
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:36,625
[NAGISA grunts]

127
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,333
[gasping, screaming]

128
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,333
[NAGISA grunting]

129
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,791
Do me a fav, show me
what you've got on him.

130
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,541
Grab your special
little notebook;

131
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,541
meet me in the faculty
lounge in ten minutes.

132
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,458
That goes for any of you
snot-nosed punks

133
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,375
who feel like you've got
intel worth sharing.

134
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,583
Give Ms. Jelavich
something useful.

135
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,458
and I'll let you go home
while these gentlemen

136
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,208
stand in for you.

137
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,958
This is what separates
the pros from the amateurs,

138
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,041
boys and girls:
connections and a little thing

139
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,250
we like to call "technique."
Now. Piss off. Go play.

140
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:14,041
Oh, and a word of warning from
those of us who know our job.

141
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,625
Get in the way, you die.

142
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,458
[NAGISA] That seductive,
femme fatale kiss.

143
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,583
Her, shady-looking companions.

144
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,916
The weight of her
off-handed threat.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,958
Clearly we're not dealing with
a teacher, but a genuine pro.

146
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:31,041
Which, all things considered,
would be sort of cool

147
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:35,416
if she wasn't,
you know, such a bitch.

148
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,166
[IRINA] This assignment is the
first in which my objective

149
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,833
is to kill
an unidentified creature.

150
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,541
Everything should be
in order, though.

151
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,041
[NAGISA gasps]

152
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,250
[IRINA] The kid's intel has
given me a lot to work with.

153
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,291
[NAGISA whimpers]

154
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,625
A couple of us have actually
gotten as far as destroying

155
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,375
one of his tentacles,
but he just dodges

156
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,250
your next attack while
he lets it grow back.

157
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,375
I dunno. Maybe he
can only be killed

158
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,416
if all his tentacles
are destroyed at once?

159
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,750
Good luck hitting more
than one, though.

160
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,500
Also. If your plan
is to sneak up on him,

161
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,250
you probably don't
wanna smoke.

162
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,333
[IRINA]
Huh...?

163
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hello there, children!

164
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,958
[NAGISA]
For a guy without a nose,

165
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,875
he's a bloodhound.

166
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,625
[IRINA]
This'll be a piece of cake.

167
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,083
My strategy is airtight.

168
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,583
I am the one and only Irina
Jelavic. The Closer.

169
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,750
The Go-to gal. I walk
between the raindrops,

170
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,708
--[MAEHARA] Uh...
--slip between--

171
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,875
--Ms. Jelabitch, ma'am?
--Arrgh!

172
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,291
Are you gonna teach us, or what?

173
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,750
[NAKAMURA] Yeah.
C'mon, Ms. Jelabitch.

174
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,625
[SUGAYA] No disrespect,
but you are a teacher,

175
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,625
aren't you,
Ms. Jelabitch?

176
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,416
[screams]
Ix-nay on the bitching!

177
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,750
The name is
JelaVIC, understand?

178
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,250
JelaBITCH is what I'll be if you
don't get the difference

179
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,291
through your thick,
prepubescent skulls!

180
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,958
Let's review!
My name is Jelavic.

181
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,000
"Jela-V!-vic!" Bite
your lower lip and hum!

182
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,000
[STUDENTS]
Vvv...

183
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,208
"V," excellent!

184
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,583
Now practice that sound
quietly for the next hour

185
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,666
while I ignore you.

186
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,291
[STUDENTS]
Lamest. Lesson. Ever.

187
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,250
[KARASUMA]
I understand you've brought in

188
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,000
a rather questionable trio.

189
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,416
Why wasn't I made aware
of this change of plan?

190
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,166
[IRINA] Ah! Don't judge
the books by their cover,

191
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,041
they're all consummate
professionals.

192
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,458
And so head-over-heels for me
they'll do whatever I ask.

193
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,041
Now, sit back
and enjoy the show.

194
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,458
It's almost go-time.

195
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
I've returned, mademoiselle!

196
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,791
With the Indian chai
you humbly requested.

197
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,625
[IRINA]
Ah! You're amazing!

198
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,833
My afternoon tea is going
to be absolutely fabulous!

199
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,375
One more favor, though.
Could we speak in private?

200
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,458
After fifth period? Like,
maybe out in the shed?

201
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh dear.

202
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,333
Well, how could I
possibly say no?

203
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,125
I'll be there with certain-tea!

204
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,291
Get it? Certain-tea?
Because that's chai, you see.

205
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,875
[MIMURA]
Huh?

206
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,750
What? Oh, come on! You gotta
be kidding me! Seriously?

207
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,833
Wow. He's really falling for it.

208
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,875
I can't look. You'd think
he'd have more sense.

209
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,083
Mr. Karasuma, sir?

210
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,666
[KARASUMA]
Hm?

211
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,000
I get she's a pro, but she's not
exactly easy to get along with.

212
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,166
Yes, I know.

213
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,875
I'm sorry you kids
have to deal with her,

214
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,416
but the higher-ups seem
to think she's all that.

215
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,041
And, well, seeing what she's
been able to put together

216
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:17,541
in such a short time does
tend to make me agree with them.

217
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
So what is it you'd like to

218
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,833
speak in private about,
Ms. Irina, darling?

219
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,041
[IRINA]
Infiltration is an art.

220
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,583
One that requires
flexibility, finesse.

221
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,041
He's mine.

222
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,916
I just have to act quickly,
before he gets suspicious.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,958
Oh, Koro-sensei,
I just can't stand it!

224
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,833
You'll think I'm a harlot,
but I simply can't

225
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,375
control myself around you!

226
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,375
[KORO-SENSEI squeals]

227
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,041
[IRINA] Your body, your
strength,

228
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,250
everything about you
drives me mad with longing!

229
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,125
[KORO-SENSEI] Ah,
well, yes-- I mean, ah--

230
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,958
[IRINA]
Does that make me a bad woman?

231
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,791
Am I bad?

232
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,958
That's right.

233
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,958
Keep those beady,
little eyes on me.

234
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,166
Don't pay attention
to your surroundings.

235
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,208
I spent all night
fixing this place up.

236
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,291
All for you, dirty boy.

237
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,541
All for you.

238
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,791
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]

239
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,333
[IRINA] This is what you want.
You can't fool me.

240
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,250
[KORO-SENSEI] I, uh, really
don't think we oughta

241
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,416
do this here!

242
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,708
[IRINA]
Goodbye, stupid.

243
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,208
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]

244
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,916
[IRINA]
It's been fun.

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,750
Don't be such a prude.
Let me get these clothes off.

246
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
What?!

247
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,541
Relax, darling, I'll be
au natural in a jiff.

248
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Au natural...?

249
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Whee-hee!

250
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,125
[IRINA]
Live ammo. Big guns.

251
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:39,416
M61. M134. M249.

252
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Enough combined speed
and firepower

253
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,208
to take out a small army.

254
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,166
Who needs BB's when
you have the real thing?

255
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,541
I'm a pro.

256
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,708
I'll stick with actual weapons,
thank you very much.

257
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:57,833
And assignment complete in...
three, two, one, zero.

258
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,416
[IRINA gasps]

259
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,166
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]
A noble effort, madam,

260
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,916
but lead bullets have
no effect on me whatsoever.

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,500
In fact, once inside
my body, they melt.

262
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,875
[KORO-SENSEI] Look closely at my
face and tell me what you see.

263
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,708
[gasps] You...
You have four eyes?

264
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,250
[KORO-SENSEI] No. Two of
these holes are nostrils.

265
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,166
[IRINA] How am I
supposed to know that?!

266
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,750
[KORO-SENSEI] I noticed a
distinct metallic odor in here

267
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,541
since yesterday. Along with
the scent of adult man B.O.

268
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,041
The moment it hit me, I knew
something wasn't right.

269
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,791
[IRINA gasps]

270
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,875
For a guy without a nose,
he's a bloodhound.

271
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,416
[KORO-SENSEI] So you see,
I was simply pretending

272
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,333
to be ensnared by
your little ruse.

273
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,666
Fun, but all for nothing.

274
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,916
I've exposed you for
the uncreative hack you are.

275
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,500
[IRINA gasps]

276
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,125
[KORO-SENSEI] You could learn a
thing or two from my students.

277
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,166
Their assassination attempts
are much more imaginative.

278
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,125
Oh, and just out of curiosity.

279
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,375
Did the government dossier on me
mention that my preferred method

280
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,083
of retaliation... is grooming?

281
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,625
--[IRINA shrieks]
--[KORO-SENSEI cackles]

282
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,041
Uh, what was that?

283
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,958
I heard gunfire, a scream
and now slithering noise!

284
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,291
[IRINA]
No! [moans]

285
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,166
[IRINA moaning]
No...

286
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,625
[STUDENTS groan]

287
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,833
I really want to know what
he's doing to her in there.

288
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,291
Let's go!

289
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,583
[NAGISA]
Koro-sensei!

290
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,791
[OKAJIMA]
Did you touch her boobs?!

291
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,833
[KORO-SENSEI sighs]
If only I had the time

292
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,375
to be really thorough.

293
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,375
But class isn't going to
teach itself, is it, children?

294
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,583
Um, what exactly
went on in there, sir?

295
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,833
[IRINA groans]

296
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,666
[NAGISA] Ms. Jelabitch
has been stuffed into

297
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,916
a tastefully retro gym outfit!

298
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,375
It would take longer for
me to describe the things he did

299
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,958
to this body than it
did for him to do them.

300
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,250
My back and shoulders
have never felt looser.

301
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,375
He somehow worked in
a lymphatic oil massage.

302
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,250
A change of clothes,
just because.

303
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,833
And he still had time to do
this thing with his tentacles.

304
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,250
[MIMURA, OKAJIMA]
What thing with his tentacles?!

305
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,625
Koro-sensei, what is
she talking about?

306
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,666
[KORO-SENSEI] Uh. Adults
sometimes need special care.

307
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,250
[NAGISA]
I don't trust that look.

308
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,625
[KORO-SENSEI] Come now. Back to
the classroom, boys and girls.

309
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,625
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir.

310
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,208
[IRINA]
Unbelievable.

311
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,458
I've never been
so humiliated in all my life!

312
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,500
I am a professional, damn it!

313
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,291
The octopus will pay!

314
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,541
[STUDENTS groan]

315
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,166
[IRINA]
If he thinks I'm out of ideas,

316
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,791
that yellow, wiggly monstrosity
has another thing coming!

317
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,833
I just need fresh supplies!

318
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,416
Oh, come on! What's with
the Wi-Fi in this place?!

319
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,708
Are we on Mars?!

320
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,500
Wow. Looks like
Ms. Jelabitch is pissed off.

321
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,083
I know my pride
would be in shambles

322
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,708
if my plan had gone tits up.

323
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,416
[snarls]

324
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,333
Excuse me, Miss?

325
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,708
Ugh. What?

326
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,583
If you're not actually
going to teach us anything,

327
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,708
you mind if we swap
you out for Koro-sensei?

328
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,958
It's just, we've got entrance
exams coming up, and--

329
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,875
[IRINA] Hah!
You wanna swap me out

330
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,750
for that disgusting creature?!

331
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,333
You're worried about
entrance exams

332
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,333
when the planet is on notice?!
Must be paradise not knowing

333
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,083
your ass from
a hole in the ground.

334
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,541
Give it a rest.

335
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,333
Even if the Earth wasn't on
the brink of destruction,

336
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,375
entrance exams are for
students with a future.

337
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,750
[STUDENTS growl]

338
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,375
[IRINA] News flash:
that's not any of you losers.

339
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,708
How 'bout this, kids?

340
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,041
Forget the "studying."

341
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,500
Help me brainstorm on how to
kill the octopus

342
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,083
and I'll give you a nice
percentage of the reward money.

343
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,375
That's the best deal any
of you E Class jerkoffs

344
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,791
are gonna get out of life.

345
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,875
Otherwise, knock it off
with the whining and let--

346
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,250
[MAEHARA]
Get out.

347
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,416
[IRINA]
Ah?

348
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,458
--[STUDENTS growl]
--[IRINA whimpers]

349
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,166
[MAEHARA] Now, you're
just a plain ol' bitch!

350
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,583
[TOKA]
We want Koro-sensei back!

351
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,916
That's it! I will make you
rue the day you were born!

352
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,958
Yeah! Go ahead,
we dare you, bitch!

353
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,000
Your boobs are way
too big to be a teacher!

354
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,708
[NAGISA]
Seriously?!

355
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,166
[KARASUMA growls]

356
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,541
[IRINA] Someone oughta
slap the piss out of them!

357
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,541
I am too fine a woman to be
one-upped by a bunch of punks!

358
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,708
They'd be lucky to lick
the mud off my stilettos!

359
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,250
In case you haven't
noticed, sweetheart,

360
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,750
the children don't exactly
agree with that assessment.

361
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,125
If you're gonna stick around
for another attempt,

362
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,125
I suggest you suck it up,
march in there

363
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,458
and give them an apology.

364
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,666
Do what?!

365
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,958
I am an accomplished assassin,

366
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,500
not a glorified
rugrat wrangler!

367
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,250
Let me focus on
what I'm qualified for!

368
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:17,458
[sighs] Oh, fine. Whatever.
Just come with me, please.

369
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,875
[KORO-SENSEI] Erromango.
One of the islands of Vanuatu,

370
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,500
otherwise known as
the New Hebrides.

371
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,416
Okay. So exactly what
the hell is he doing?

372
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,083
Poring over and
writing out test questions.

373
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,291
He's done this every
Wednesday during sixth period

374
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,416
since I've been here.

375
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,875
Quick as the bastard is,

376
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,416
you wouldn't think
it'd take him so long.

377
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,708
I mean, at Mach 20, I'd
imagine the tests would be

378
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,250
written out and
ready to go by now.

379
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,750
[KARASUMA] They're tailored
to each individual student.

380
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,458
[gasps]

381
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,750
[KARASUMA] He takes into account
which subjects they're good at,

382
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,250
where they need improvement,

383
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,500
and hands out a test
designed specifically for them.

384
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
No denying that Chiba

385
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,791
has spatial relations down pat.
Let's give him a problem

386
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,291
that'll really kick-start
his lateral thinking.

387
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,041
His IQ is off
the charts, literally.

388
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,708
His speed puts every weapon
we have to shame.

389
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:05,208
He's dangerous, contradictory,
and a damn-near perfect teacher.

390
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,000
[TOKA]
Ha-ha!

391
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,333
[RYUNOSUKE grunts]

392
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,291
Look at the kids.
Tell me what you see.

393
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,208
[IRINA] Huh? They're just
screwing around.

394
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,000
They're fine-tuning
the necessary

395
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,875
hand-eye coordination skills
to hit a moving target.

396
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,208
I call it,

397
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,291
--Assassination Badminton,
--[SUGINO] Take that!

398
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,125
--[IRINA] What?
--[KIMURA] Good thrust!

399
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,208
Three points!

400
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,333
Everyone has two roles here.

401
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,500
Assassin and student.
Teacher and target.

402
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a bizarre classroom this
creature's created,

403
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,166
not a place for easy answers
or tidy resolutions.

404
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,958
Or one where we can
afford to fit ourselves

405
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,625
into simple categories.

406
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,750
I understand wanting to take
pride in yourself

407
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,208
as a professional,
but if you can't cut it

408
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,416
as both assassin and
teacher, you're toast.

409
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,166
[IRINA gasps]

410
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,166
[MAEHARA]
Nice return.

411
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,916
[TOKA]
Yeah. Whatever.

412
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,416
You wanna stay here,
keep at it, fine. Be my guest.

413
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,291
Just treat those kids
with respect.

414
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,750
[IRINA sighs]

415
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,125
What word does
"incredible" modify?

416
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,458
You know this one.

417
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,875
Read it aloud.

418
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:23,208
[STUDENTS]
"Y-You are incredible in bed."

419
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,916
[IRINA] I was once
took out an American VIP.

420
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,416
Literally. I had my
feminine grace to thank

421
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,333
for getting me close
to the target.

422
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,000
The poor dupe fell for me
hook, line, and sinker.

423
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,416
"You are incredible in bed,"
he told me.

424
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,916
Incredible, in this case,
modifies the word you.

425
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,625
[NAGISA] That's the example
you use with Junior High kids?!

426
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,583
To learn grammar, you've
got to see how it works

427
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,958
in the real world.

428
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,750
Like a full immersion course
in a foreign language.

429
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,041
Take a lover that speaks it
and you can't miss.

430
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,500
I know grammar seems
boring and technical,

431
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,500
but it's what underpins
how we communicate.

432
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,833
Communication is key in
my line of work, and in life.

433
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,166
Whether speaking English,
French, Portuguese,

434
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,416
what have you, all people
have an underlying need

435
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,041
to express their feelings.
That's why this is important.

436
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,250
The examples may be risqué,
but they come from

437
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,291
real-life scenarios. They will
all have either been said by me,

438
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,791
or to me by someone else.

439
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,041
One day, you might use
or hear them yourselves.

440
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,250
[NAKAMURA, OKAJIMA]
Communication.

441
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,416
Don't expect me
to be like the octopus.

442
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
He can help you with
your entrance exams.

443
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,500
Which isn't without
value, I suppose.

444
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,291
All I can do is help you learn
the art of conversation.

445
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,625
Here's the deal: If after a
while, you think this is stupid,

446
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,541
that I'm not a teacher, fine.

447
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,500
I'll give up
my assignment and leave.

448
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,333
So, this oughta put us
on the level, right?

449
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:42,083
Oh, and... I'm sorry about
being... such a bitch.

450
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,625

451
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,750
[STUDENTS laughing]

452
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,541
Wow. Talk about a one-eighty.

453
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,916
First, you wanna kill us,
now you're acting like a wuss.

454
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,166
[IRINA gasps]

455
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,500
I gotta say, you make a
more convincing teacher

456
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,083
with this attitude.

457
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,750
Guess this means we shouldn't
call you Ms. Jelabitch anymore.

458
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,541
[gasps]
You're giving me a chance?

459
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,000
You're not upset with me?

460
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,375
[MEG] To be totally fair, we
didn't exactly get off

461
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,750
on the right foot
with that nickname.

462
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,791
[OKANO]
Maybe not.

463
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,583
But we've got to
call her something.

464
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,208
[MAEHARA]
How 'bout "Ms. Hellabitch"?

465
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,750
[IRINA grunts]

466
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,125
Uh... Or... We could
just agree to move away

467
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,083
from the whole bitch
motif altogether.

468
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,583
I'm not opposed to going by
Irina if you guys don't mind

469
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,125
--calling a teacher by--
--Yeah, I'm sorry.

470
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,458
I wouldn't plan on the bitch
thing going away any time soon.

471
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,875
[IRINA gasps]

472
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,875
[OKANO] Mm-hm! Not that
Ms. Irina isn't a pretty name,

473
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,000
it's just not as fun
to say as Hellabitch.

474
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,583
[HINANO]
Professor Bitch sounds classy.

475
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,541
How 'bout we do that?

476
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,708
[OKAJIMA]
I vote for that one.

477
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,166
Professor Bitch all the way.

478
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,041

I hate you little turds so much!

[STUDENTS laughs]

480
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,708
[KORO-SENSEI] She seems
to be settling in nicely.

481
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,333
[KARASUMA]
Eh. More or less.

482
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,375
[IRINA] Do you know
who you're messing with?!

483
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,083
I will end you!

484
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,750
[KORO-SENSEI] Thank you
for bringing a new teacher,

485
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,541
Mr. Karasuma. She's a bit
rough around the edges,

486
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,375
perhaps, but a welcome
addition to our little family,

487
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:00,000
I think. Who better to spruce
up the language arts syllabus

488
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,375
than a globe-trotting
assassin-slash-temptress

489
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,666
like her?

490
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,916
[KARASUMA]
Impossible.

491
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,083
There's no way you've
coulda seen this coming.

492
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
If you'll excuse me...

493
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,708
[KARASUMA]
Whenever he's pressed to say why

494
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,791
he started teaching E Class,
he dodges the question.

495
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,333
But whatever his reasons, he's
not only turned it into

496
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,583
the perfect training
ground for assassins.

497
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,416
It may just be the perfect
training ground for life.

498
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,041
[HINANO] You're so
adorable when you're mad.

499
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,625
[IRINA]
No, I am not!

500
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,166
[KARASUMA] Bastard's got us all
wrapped around his tentacles.

501
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,916
He knows what he's doing.
