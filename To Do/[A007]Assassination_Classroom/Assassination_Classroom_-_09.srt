The one Mr. Karasuma
sent out to us last night?

Yep.

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,583
Something about a
transfer student, right?

12
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,708
Hmm... Seems kinda
fishy to me.

13
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,291
They're probably just
trying out another assassin.

16
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,875
Maybe the teacher thing
has gotten too obvious?

17
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:42,000
We all saw how that cover
worked out for Professor Bitch.

what the new girl's all about.

Assassin or not, let's hope
she's ready to be

[SUGAYA] Not making

You and your government might
be extending that arrangement

gonna be a pain in the ass

176
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,916
and shoot up the place
every two seconds.

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,041
Why bother trying to
explain it to a machine?

178
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,041
She can't understand.

179
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,291
It's nothing personal.

180
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,250
We'll free you
after class is over.

181
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,833
You sorta brought
this on yourself.

182
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,958
I mean, we're tryin'
to learn here, too.

183
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,125
Give your core
programming a rest.

[AIFA] Autonomous Intelligence

185
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,791
Execution of Second Day

186
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,208
due to unforeseen problems.

Probability of rectifying

zero percent.

[KORO-SENSEI] Don't go
crying to mommy and daddy.

193
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,375
They're the ones who
got you into this pickle.

194
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,583
Besides, you're a student.
A transfer student at that,

195
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,666
which makes you
my responsibility.

196
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,291
I realize it's no picnic
being the new kid.

197
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,208
But if we can just find a way to
make the other boys and girls

198
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,208
warm up to you...

199
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,750
What do you mean?

200
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,666
[KORO-SENSEI] Can you appreciate
why the other boys and girls

201
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,833
are foiling your
assassination attempts?

202
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,041
For starters,
they're here to learn

203
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,791
and your methods are
enormously disruptive.

204
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,166
For another, if you
happened to succeed,

205
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,500
the reward money will go to
your "parents," not to them.

206
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:09,000
So, letting you kill me has
no upshot for them whatsoever.

207
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,958
I believe I am beginning
to understand, Koro-sensei.

208
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,166
It seems I have not been
adequately factoring in

209
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,541
my classmates' interests.

210
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,375
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]
You are a fast learner.

211
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,166
Not to worry, my dear.

We want that

219
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,041
[AIFA]
Accepted.

220
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,208
[KORO-SENSEI] In general,
working well with others

221
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,000
is an important ingredient
to personal success.

222
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,625
Think of it. Wouldn't you
enjoy having friends?

223
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,125
I do not know how
to make them.

224
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,958
[KORO-SENSEI] Well, as you
can see, I came prepared!

225
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,375
But what is all this, sir?

226
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,708
[KORO-SENSEI] Everything
you need to be a team player.

227
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,458
And then some.

228
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,500
Koro-sensei does not subject
his students to harm.

229
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,875
But what sort of teacher
would I be if I didn't

230
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,666
enhance your
innate capabilities?

231
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,666
Top of the mornin' to ya.

232
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,208
[AIFA] I do not understand
why you are doing this, sir.

233
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,166
Any enhancement you give me
will only shorten your lifespan.

234
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
So be it, then.

235
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,666
I'm a teacher first,
target second.

236
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,791
From the moment you
opened fire on me yesterday,

237
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,875
I knew that unquenchable
thirst for knowledge

238
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,958
was something I simply
had to nurture.

239
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,458
Your parents installed,
uh, instilled, rather,

240
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,208
many a marvelous gift.
As your teacher,

241
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,541
it's my job to develop those
gifts even further.

242
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,791
Once the other children have
taken a liking to you,

243
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,625
your whole worldview
will change.

244
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,708
Count on it.

245
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,000
Question, sir.

246
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,583
What function is served by this
directory of sweets

247
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,166
from around the world?

248
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,833
[KORO-SENSEI squeaLS] Uh, well,
uh, nothing specific, really.

249
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,875
I just thought you could
help me out with something, too!

250
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,750
[SUGINO] Y'think she'll
be here again today?

251
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,708
Sheesh.

252
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,041
Probably.

253
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,250
Whaddya say we go and
complain to Mr. Karasuma?

254
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,666
It's friggin' impossible to
focus with that thing around.

255
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,625
Huh?

256
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:16,000
Is it me, or does
she look, like, bigger?

257
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,500
A-ha! Good morning, everybody!

258
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,875
Hi, there! Heh!

259
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,958
[BOTH scream]

260
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,833
Absolutely beautiful
day today, huh?

261
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,250
[KORO-SENSEI] I felt it
might improve relations

262
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,958
between you kids if I
gave our friend here

263
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,750
a full-body LCD display.

264
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,083
I threw in some uniform
modeling software, too,

265
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,416
and all for cheaper
than you might think.

266
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,458
And I have to say, the
only thing better than this

267
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,833
glorious morning
is sharing it with you!

268
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,500
[KORO-SENSEI] I also gave her
broader range of expression.

269
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,166
The memory to run it wound up
costing me a tad bit over

270
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,875
what I'd budgeted for,
but well worth the expense.

271
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,916
[NAGISA] How does a teacher drop
that kind of coin on a student?

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,291
[KORO-SENSEI] Things are going
to be a little tight

273
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,458

274
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,083

The flowers are in full bloom,

275
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,666
the grass is turning
that special shade of green.

276
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,041
Spring has done its work
and now passes the torch

277
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,708
on to a marvelous Summer.

00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,375
It's like she got
cuter overnight!

279
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,000
How is that even possible?

280
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,500
[MIMURA]
That is the same fixed artillery

281
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,416
that tore up
the place yesterday?

282
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,583
Don't be fooled, guys.

283
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,125
She's still just a computer.

The octopus might've given
her an upgrade, but that's all.

285

Her actin' nice
doesn't mean squat.

00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,583
Nah. Once a box of bolts,
always a box of bolts.

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,916
I see... Well...
Good point. I understand.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,625
We didn't get off on
the right foot yesterday.

290
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,500
My fault. You're
absolutely right.

291
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,125
I am just a box of bolts.

00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,125

--Wow. Way to go, Terasaka.

When you put it like that,
I sound like a total douche!

295
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,416
Maybe I'm only
speaking for myself.

296
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
But, you ask me, a 3-D girl
has nothing on a Double-D!

297
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,000
Your first line in the series
and that's what you go with?!

00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,875
I'll try harder. I promise.

300
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,666
Koro-sensei showed me how to
take your feelings into account,

301
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,125
and work together.

302
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,625
So I won't try to
assassinate him without you.

303
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,375
In fact, I won't do anything
unless I have your full consent.

304
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,958
That way, hopefully
you'll come to think of me

305
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,500
as a teammate and a friend!

306
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hear that?

307
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,750
She's trying very hard,
so be nice.

308
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,333
And don't be deceived.

309
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,208
Beneath that sunny disposition
and that adorable willingness

310

to please, her bloodlust
is perfectly intact.

311
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,125
I made sure of that.

I have no doubt this young lady
will make a formidable ally.

[NAGISA] Is there anything

316

Hey, Chiba? That's check.

341
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,208
Ah! Three moves in
and I'm already licked.

342
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,333
Hey, whaddya gonna do,
she's a fast learner.

343
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,958
[FUWA]
Yeah she is.

344
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,000
Wait! This reminds of a manga
where this super AI program

345
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,875
controls the world through,
I dunno, electronic drugs?

346
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes! I know exactly the one
you're talking about:

347
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,708
the ultra-popular
detective story

348
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,000
published in that magazine
and made into an anime!

349
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,833
You know that and you have to
download stuff about flowers?

350
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,083
Well, she's suddenly
popular, huh?

351
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,625
She can make stuff and
do a million things at once.

352
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,208
I mean, c'mon.
What'd you expect?

353
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, no!

354
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,291
What's wrong, sir?

355
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
We're the same personality type.

356
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,750
[NAGISA]
Yeah, that's a bit of a stretch.

357
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,166
[KORO-SENSEI] I upgrade her
and this is the thanks I get?

358
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,541
She's horning in
on my spotlight!

359
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,916
Look, everyone! I have an LCD
display of sorts myself!

360
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,166
Check it out! Behold my more
accessible, human face! Eh?

361
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,750
Eh?

362
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,250
[MIMURA]
Creepy!

363
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,666
[KORO-SENSEI] You could've
put that a better way, Mimura.

364
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,833
Hey, you guys?

365
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,583
Let's come up with
a better name for her.

366
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,875
Autonomous Intelligence Fixed
Artillery just sounds weird.

367
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,791
--Huh?
--[TOKA] You got that right.

368
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,875
[SUMIRE]
Lemme think.

369
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,375
[FUWA]
What's "Autonomous" in Japanese?

370
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,708
Jiritsu?

371
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,083
Yeah! "Ritsu!"

372
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,458
Worst name ever.

373
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,666
Hey! No, it's adorable!

374
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,166
Ritsu...

375
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,500
You cool with us
calling you that?

376
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:52,958
[RITSU gasps] Yeah! Yeah,
I love it! Thank you!

377
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,750
Call me Ritsu from now on!

378
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,500
She might fit in after all.

379
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:00,625
[KARMA] Hm. Well, maybe,
Terasaka still has a point.

380
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:04,166
This new personality is a
programming quirk, nothing more.

381
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,333
A machine doesn't
have free will.

382
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,958
Where she goes from here...

383
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,041
Well, that's essentially
not up to us,

384
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,875
it's up to whoever made her.

385
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,250
What? What is this nonsense?

386
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,000
Ah. Good evening, master.

387
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,916
I'm having so much fun
with everyone here;

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,750
thank you so much for
letting me be part of this--

389
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,375
[MALE DEVELOPER A]
Inconceivable!

390
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,708
[MALE DEVELOPER B] What kind of
whimsical trash is this?!

391
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,541
These additions have nothing
whatsoever to do

392
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,041
with her intended purpose!

393
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,833
[MALE DEVELOPER A]
We'll overhaul her immediately.

394
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,708
Uninstall everything that
isn't assassination related!

395
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,291
[RITSU sighs]

396
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,375
[MALE DEVELOPER A] This machine
uses the same AI programming

397
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,500
as the Aegis Combat System.

398
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,833
She can analyze her
surroundings and calculate

399
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,333
the most efficient way
to proceed

400
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,541
in a fraction of the time
it would take a human.

401
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,416
In effect, she will
change the face of war.

402
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,625
This mission is the linchpin
of our market strategy.

403
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,000
The reward money is peanuts

404
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,708
compared to the revenues
in store for us

405
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,750
once her talents are
in evidence here.

406
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,250
This classroom is
the ultimate testing ground.

407
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,166
Killing the improbable
monstrosity

408
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,291
is only the beginning.

409
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,416
Regardless of your
"improvements," remember this:

410
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,250
Your master's word is law.

411
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,291
Keep to the business
of assassination.

412
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,750
[RITSU]
Yes, master--

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,750
 Good morning,
classmates. How are you?

414
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,375
[KARASUMA] Word came down from
her inventors just last night.

415
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,500
Upgrades will be considered
a breech of your agreement

416
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,625
not to harm a student.
And as for you.

417
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,625
Tie her up again
and you pay damages.

418
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,625
Because if we break,
then we buy it.

419
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,958
[TERASAKA]
Hmph.

420
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,708
That's the way things are now.
I have no choice.

421
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,000
[KORO-SENSEI] This is the word
from her inventors, is it?

422
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,250
Since when have I been in the
business of appeasing parents?

423
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,916
My students' needs come first.

424
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,833
[SUGINO] So, if she's
been, like, downgraded.

425
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,791
[ISOGAI] She's gonna spray
the place with BB's again.

426
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,083
All day.

427
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,000
[TERASAKA] Machines are
such a pain in the ass.

428
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,041
[NAGISA]
Uh-oh.

429
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Here we go.

430
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,916
[RITSU] You wanted me
to make flowers, didn't you?

431
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,958
[RITSU]
When Koro-sensei upgraded me,

432
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,458
he made a total of
985 improvements

433
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,291
to my functionality.

434
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,958
My master determined
approximately 95 percent

435
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,625
of these improvements
to be irrelevant

436
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,500
to my purpose and deleted them.

437
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,458
But after analyzing the
effectiveness of cooperation,

438
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,166
I calculated that the highest
probability of success

439
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,041
would be achieved by
maintaining these improvements.

440
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,250
Ergo, I hid what I could
in an area of my memory

441
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,041
left untouched by the purge.

442
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,875
[KORO-SENSEI] Outstanding!
Ritsu, does this mean...?

443
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:50,708
Yep! I have free will! And,
boy, does it feel fantastic!

444
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,916
[BOTH giggle]

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,125
Wow. Who'da thunk it?

446
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,083
Koro-sensei. If my
information's right,

447
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,166
I think I'm being what
they call "rebellious."

448
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,041
That doesn't make me a terrible
person or anything, right?

449
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:07,333
[KORO-SENSEI] No, no, no. You're
just a Junior High student.

450
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,333
And an exemplary one!

451
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,541
[STUDENTS chuckle]

452
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,875
[NAGISA] And so E Class
gets another friend.

453
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,291
Another ally in the fight
to assassinate our teacher.

454
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,708
Twenty-seven assassins in all.

455
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,166
Not bad.

456
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,750
[IRINA]
Hey! Karasuma!

457
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,083
[KARASUMA]
Huh...?

458
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,708
I hear adding a face can
boost a girl's popularity!

459
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,833
[KARASUMA] I... I don't
even know where to begin.

460
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,625
[ETHAN]
Joness!

461
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,708
[SONIC NINJA]
Liars should be cut in half.

462
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,791
[RITSU]
Sonic Ninja!

463
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,958
I also have the DVD extras!

464
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,208
[NAGISA]
Ohh...

465
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,458
That's pretty cool.

466
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,166
You come with everything!
