1
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,541
[NAGISA] Our infiltration of the
Fuma Denjo hotel is underway.

2
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,166
We're closing in on
the antidote. Hopefully.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,375
Time is running out. Unless
we make it to the top floor,

4
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,416
and soon, our
classmates might die.

5
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,083
[KARMA] Seem fairly average
for a pro, if you ask me.

6
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,458
And is breaking glass
supposed to be intimidating?

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,166
'Cause I can do that.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,208
But I wouldn't call
in reinforcements

9
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,875
as an opening move. But then,

10
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:38,291
I'm not especially threatened
by "a bunch of amateurs."

11
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,708
[STUDENTS]
Ah...

12
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,166
[GRIP] All right. Put your
money where your mouth is.

13
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,416
[KARMA]
If you insist. [chuckles]

14
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,000
[KARMA grunts]

15
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,333
Nice try, kid. But,
as weapons go, hun,

16
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,833
I'd have gone with harder.

17
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,416
[GRIP grunts]

18
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,291
I guess I'll have to do without.

19
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,375
[GRIP grunts, yells]

20
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,208
[GRIP growls]

21
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,166
[NAGISA]
Uh...

22
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,583
[KARMA] This dude's grip could
crush a grown man's skull

23
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:57,541
like an egg. He gets his
mitts on me, it's game over.

24
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,958
Heh. The odds are definitely
not in my favor.

25
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,083
Nothing unusual about that.

26
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,916
But in the end, this is
just like any other game.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,500
Just like school.

28
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,250
[KIMURA]
Uh.

29
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,500
[SUGAYA]
Whoa...

30
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,166
Oh, wow. He's blocking
like an expert!

31
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Those are your defensive moves,

32
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,166
are they not, Mr. Karasuma?

33
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,375
[KARASUMA]
For assassins,

34
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,625
self-defense doesn't
often come into play.

35
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:27,166
I don't recall having actively
taught him any of this.

36
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,958
There's no denying it, though.

37
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,666
These moves are how I handled
their attacks in class.

38
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,000
Damned impressive. This kid's
a natural-born fighter.

39
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,333
A cut above his peers, even
in a classroom of assassins.

40
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,208
[KARMA]
I can dodge him all day,

41
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,250
but if I move in for a hit,
this prick's gonna grab me.

42
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,875
[GRIP] Hm? What's the problem?
Evasive maneuvers ain't

43
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,458
gonna win this. You have'ta
come in for an attack!

44
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,958
Oh, you don't say?

45
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,791
And what if really
all I'm tryin' to do

46
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,541
is keep you occupied?
I mean, my buddies are kinda

47
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,250
hopin' to sneak by, so,
maybe I'm just bein' clever.

48
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,291
Aw, relax. I'm pretty
underhanded on the best of days.

49
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:10,958
But this is one fight I
wanna win fair and square.

50
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,708
No tricks, no cheating,
no holdin' out.

51
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,541
Just you an' me. Now, like men.

52
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,083
Be my guest, hun.
I like the cut of your jib.

53
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,791
See, this is what
I've been talkin' about!

54
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:26,916
Two equals, mano y mano. A real
battle to the death, hun.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,541
[KARMA grunts]

56
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,541
[GRIP]
Hm?

57
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,458
[KARMA]
There's my in!

58
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,958
[KARMA groaning]

59
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,291
[STUDENTS gasp]

60
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,041
Say goodnight, you little punk.

61
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,708
[NAGISA gasps]
Oh, no!

62
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,833
[GRIP]
Sorry, kid.

63
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,583
You're underhanded
on the best'a days.

64
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,208
I'm underhanded,
like, every day.

65
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,000
You son of a bitch!

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,666
He wanted to fight you like a
man and this is how you respond?

67
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,875
Oh come on. This ain't the place
for that, kid; get over it, hun.

68
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,583
Look, you can't get hung up
on ethics. I'm an assassin.

69
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,583
This biz don't reward folks
who play by the rules.

70
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,791
Hun, if you got a
canister of gas?

71
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,500
Use it. If he was all that,
he'd have done the same--

72
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,666
Uh?!

73
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,416
[GRIP chokes]

74
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,291
[STUDENTS gasp]

75
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:23,916
[GRIP]
Uh... You.... Ah.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,500
Guess great minds think alike.

77
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,625
Now what was it were you saying
about me being "all that?"

78
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:32,791
[GRIP] How di... How did
you not... breathe it in?

79
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:37,041
I-I sprayed you...
at point blank range.

80
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,250
You should be paralyzed, hun.

81
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,916
[GRIP grunting]

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,166
[GRIP groaning]

83
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,708
C'mon, Terasaka! What
are you waiting for?

84
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm gonna need duct tape
and every free hand we got

85
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,541
to hold this crazy bastard down!

86
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,208
--[STUDENTS sigh]
--Yeah, all right. Fine.

87
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,416
You've been yankin' this
creep's chain all along, huh?

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,291
[GRIP groaning, screams]

89
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,750
Fair fight, my ass!

90
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,333
Stay on guard while
you're taping him up.

91
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,916
He's incapacitated,

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,291
but he might be strong enough
to spring back before too long.

93
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,875
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,083
[GRIP growling]

95
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,291
[GRIP]
Huh?

96
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,500
Handy, right?

97
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,875
Lifted it off that Smog
weirdo a while ago.

98
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,458
Still, disappointing it's a
"one-time-use" type-a deal.

99
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,208
How did you see it comin'?

100
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,916
You must've held your
breath when I sprayed you.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,041
How'd you know to do that
when my hands were empty?

102
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:32,291
No way you could've told I
had anything on me! Ugh! Hun.

103
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,791
That's the whole point.

104
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,625
With you, I was on guard against
everything but bare hands.

105
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,666
[GRIP]
Hun.

106
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,125
[KARMA]
As far as I know,

107
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,583
you probably were lookin'
forward to an honest fight.

108
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,916
But you're also on
someone else's payroll,

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,958
so you don't get to choose.

110
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,416
You'd've had to stop us
by any means necessary.

111
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,333
I would've done the exact
same thing in your shoes.

112
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,125
In a way, my mistrust
was a compliment.

113
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,541
He's really good.

114
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,625
[NAGISA] Yes, he is. And he's
changed, for the better.

115
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
The anguish of defeat

116
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,875
had never darkened Karma's
door. Finals provided

117
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,666
our cocky comrade a
much-needed reality check.

118
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,750
Failure humanized the
perspective of his former foes.

119
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,208
He suddenly found himself
among their number.

120
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,791
His picture of the world
altered drastically,

121
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,541
leaving him with a healthy
respect for those around him.

122
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,958
He was able to foresee
his adversary's moves

123
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,625
because he didn't underestimate
his abilities.

124
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,750
Something he only learned
through his previous failure.

125
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:32,250
We must see our opponent, not
as an obstacle, but as a person.

126
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:39,000
Toiling in the shadow of defeat,
we taste true victory.

127
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:43,250
It is a pleasure to see you
take the lesson to heart, Karma.

128
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,708
I'm very excited about what
your future holds in store.

129
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:51,000
[GRIP] Hm. Hun, hats off to ya.
You're nothin' to sneeze at.

130
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,666
I may be beaten, but it was
a pleasure to know that you--

131
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,916
[KARMA]
Oh, we're not done.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,333
No, I'm just
getting started.

133
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,833
[GRIP]
Mm...?

134
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,833
What in the hell are
those s'posed to be?

135
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,375
Mustard and wasabi.

136
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,958
You never know when you're gonna
need 'em to shove up a nose.

137
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,541
--[STUDENTS scream]
--[GRIP] Do what?

138
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,208
[KARMA] Part of keepin' my guard
up meant I had to play nice.

139
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:14,666
But, hey, now what we've got you
all bound up, I can let loose.

140
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,041
You'll wanna hold still

141
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,708
or that special clip's gonna
rip your nostrils off.

142
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,833
Now let's see. You've
got your jalapenos,

143
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,666
your hatch chilies,
your ghost peppers,

144
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,375
those are a kick in
the balls, right?

145
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,083
And a pinch of garlic
for hearth-health.

146
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,333
Well, hun,
what cha think?

147
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:33,000
Show us that
samurai willpower?

148
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,083
--[GRIP screams]
--[KARMA chuckles]

149
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,666
So, uh. I notice
Karma's still a sadist.

150
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'm very concerned

151
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,833
about what his future
holds in store.

152
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,833
Who walks around with this
stuff in their bag? Ugh.

153
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,708
Can we keep movin',
please? Someone'll spot us.

154
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,708
[KARMA] 'cause you stick
out like a sore thumb.

155
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,500
[TERASAKA]
Ha, ha.

156
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,750
[RITSU] Attention. The terrace
is just up these stairs.

157
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,250
Might be tricky.
This is the club floor.

158
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,666
[RITSU]
Correct.

159
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,875
The Executive Floor can be
accessed via the staircase

160
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,291
just off the lounge area.

161
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,041
Unfortunately, the back entrance
has a manual lock on it,

162
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,458
so we'll need to detour around
and through the bar to open it

163
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,791
and let the others in.

164
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,666
[MEG] So we're flying
by the seat of our pants.

165
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,875
A bar's the last
place we belong.

166
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,083
[MEG] Koro-Sensei and
Mr. K, you hide here.

167
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,375
Leave the tricky part
to those best qualified.

168
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,416
We'll unlock the door
to the VIP stairs.

169
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,458
You fellas might be out
of your dept in the club,

170
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,916
but us girls'll do just fine.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,083
Yeah we will!

172
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,083
No way. I'm sorry,
it's too dangerous.

173
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,416
Ah. Well, plan B?

174
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,000
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

175
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:37,666
Ah...

176
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,833
[NAGISA]
Huh?!

177
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,416
[NAGISA]
Uh?! Uh... huh?

178
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,833
--[FEMALE GUEST D] So awesome.
--[FEMALE GUEST C] Yeah!

179
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,500
--You can thank the CEO.
--No kidding.

180
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,166
[YUJI] Thanks for the executive
suite, mom and dad.

181
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,375
And all the douche-yachts
rubbin' shoulders with me

182
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,958
to get at your money.

183
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:10,500
[YUJI] This shit is depressing.
Lamest vacay ever.

184
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,416
[YUJI gasps]

185
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,875
[FUWA]
Oh, be a man already!

186
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,291
You're here to protect us,
not use us as a shield!

187
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,541
Get in front!

188
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,125
[NAGISA] I can't! Don't
make me do this, please!

189
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,250
[HAYAMI]
Stop it.

190
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,708
[FUWA]
You look fabulous!

191
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,333
[NAGISA grunts]

192
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:32,333
That's right. This is my life.

193
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,750
[YUJI sighs]

194
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,500
Quit whining.
You're deep undercover.

195
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,583
We talked about this.

196
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,916
You won't arouse
suspicion this way.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,291
[NAGISA]
Did you have to say "arouse?"

198
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,375
Relax! It's all
part of the plan.

199
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,375
[NAGISA]
It is?

200
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,875
[RITSU]
You look stunning!

201
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,291
[NAGISA]
No, I do not!

202
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,958
Don't be so casual!
Tart it up.

203
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,041
Whoa, wait! Are you my
pimp all of a sudden?

204
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,875
Where'd this outfit
come from anyway?

205
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:51,916
[HAYAMI]
Next to the pool.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,666
Consider it an
anonymous donation.

207
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,250
[NAGISA]
Uh!

208
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,708
[YUJI] Hottie alert. First time
I've seen her on the club scene.

209
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,250
This place is disgusting.

210
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,875
Let's unlock the door before
some tool tries to hit on us.

211
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,166
[NAGISA]
Don't even.

212
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,375
You're milking this moment
for all it's worth.

213
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:05,958
[YUJI]
Yo!

214
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,375
[NAGISA]
Uh!

215
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,541
How you doin', shortie?
Papa wants to buy you a drink.

216
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,125
Anything you want, heh, heh!
My treat. For reals.

217
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,625
[GIRLS groan]

218
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,000
Go on, Nagisa.
Don't be an ice queen.

219
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,666
Wha...? I thought
we had a deal!

220
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,041
[MEG] The deal is we act
natural. Now get in there!

221
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,083
We'll swing back around for you.

222
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,458
[NAGISA] Ah... How did my
life get to this place?!

223
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,958
[YUJI] Nagisa's a really
cute name for a girl.

224
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,625
Anyway, I'm Yuji.

225
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,500
[NAGISA whimpers]

226
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,541
Okay, let's make a break for it.

227
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,041
[MEG] I think we go up the side
stairs. Let me check the map.

228
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,291
Right. Should be just up
ahead a little further.

229
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,416
[PUNK A] Hey, hey.
What's the hurry, doll?

230
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,625
[PUNK B] You girls look like
you could use a little company.

231
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,166
--[PUNK A chuckles]
--[MEG] Ugh.

232
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,333
Is this what I have to look
forward to every time we go out?

233
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,791
Look, bro. I hate
to disappoint you--

234
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,541
--[TOKA laughs]
--Yada?

235
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,833
[TOKA] Hiya boys. Wow,
you two are stacked.

236
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,916
Look, we'd love to chill,
but our daddies keep us

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,250
on a short leash.

238
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,500
Yeah, I know it sucks,
but what're you gonna do?

239
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,708
Helicopter parents.

240
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,625
Huh?! Tha... Th-Th-That's
a yakuza pin!

241
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,291
[PUNK B]
Not just any yakuza pin!

242
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,125
That's the emblem of
the relatively small

243
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,416
but absolutely terrifying
Shuei Syndicate!

244
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,000
[PUNKS]
Sorry we bothered you!

245
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,083
Okay, bye! And that's how you
separate the men from the boys.

246
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,041
Why do you have
a yakuza pin?

247
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:21,625
[TOKA laughs]

248
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,041
[music plays]

249
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,291
[YUJI]
C'mon, drink up! I'm buyin'!

250
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,541
We're livin' large tonight!

251
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,541
Uh! I'm too... Uh, I mean,

252
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,875
I don't like the way
alcohol tastes.

253
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,416
[NAGISA]
Keep it together, Nagisa.

254
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,916
Hold his interest long enough
to give the girls a chance

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,250
to unlock the door.

256
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,166
So what brings you to
this place? Your friends?

257
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,833
Your mom and dad?

258
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,375
Mom and dad?

259
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,125
As if the two of them would
give me the time of day! Hey!

260
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,500
Wanna know a secret? Don't tell
anyone, but my dad's on TV.

261
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,958
Like, uber famous.

262
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,000
You'd know 'im if you
saw 'im, trust me.

263
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,583
He's huge. Paparazzi
hound him all the time.

264
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,875
Dude can't get away with jack.

265
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,000
'Least not in public!
One time, he was tellin' me

266
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,291
about this anchor chick he
kept fondling under the table

267
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,791
when they'd cut to commercial.

268
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:07,083
That sounds skeezy. Does he
brag about stuff like that?

269
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,000
[YUJI]
Damn it. Way to go, dumbass.

270
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,166
Real smooth. Can't you
make an impression

271
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,250
without bringing up the
old man? I'm so lame!

272
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,041
Uh, smoking's
really bad for you,

273
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,166
'specially that stuff.

274
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,916
Heh. What're you,
the surgeon general?

275
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,458
Come on, it's cool.

276
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,708
People just need to loosen
up every once in a while.

277
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,083
[NAGISA] My teacher calls
this a gateway substance.

278
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,208
Says it puts unsuspecting kids
on the road to addiction.

279
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:34,500
Recreational drugs aren't
the answer to life's problems.

280
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,791
[YUJI grunts]
Yeah, well!

281
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,916
What's your teacher know
about my problems?

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,166
Guys have it rough.

283
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,708
We gotta be cool
twenty-four-seven just to score!

284
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,250
You try bein' somebody when
all people do is compare you

285
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,541
to your celebrity dad!

286
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,583
You girls. Y'all don't
have a clue how it is!

287
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,000
All you have to do it put on a
li'l makeup, walk into a club

288
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,541
and take your pick!

289
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,875
[NAGISA]
Uh...

290
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,625
[NAGISA]
I can't speak for most girls,

291
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,541
but the ones I know have
a lot more on their minds.

292
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,291
Oh! That's from Professor
Bitch's pin collection!

293
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,833
That woman is something else.
Yakuza overlord, horse breeder.

294
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,083
Any pin you can think of,

295
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,958
she's got it and knows
how to walk the walk.

296
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,125
Wow that line of work
totally fascinates you,

297
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,583
doesn't it, Yada?

298
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,791
You're always picking her
brain about different stuff.

299
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,916
[TOKA] Yeah. It's like
Koro-Sensei always says

300
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,083
about our "second blade."
And, Professor Bitch has

301
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,833
more than two. I like
an extensive skill set.

302
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,916
See whatever job she's dropped
into, she has a strategy.

303
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,875
That's what you call
serious life-competence.

304
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,916
I bet one day when you grow up,
you'll be exactly like her!

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,541
[KAEDE growls] Never thought I'd
respect a girl with huge melons.

306
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,291
[OKANO] Wow! Kaede's made a
real breakthrough, everyone!

307
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,375
[MEG]
Okay. There's the door.

308
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,125
They have a guard posted,
though. We didn't count on that.

309
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,125
Not to be that girl, but I think
we might need a man for this.

310
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,916
Well, damn. Okay, Kaede.

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,291
Go and rescue Nagisa.

312
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,583
Sure!

313
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,375
Get a load of that face.

314
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,375
Something tells me we'd be
better off not engaging.

315
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,625
Hell, even if we
could take this guy,

316
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,625
he won't go down
without makin noise.

317
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,666
[KAEDE]
Nagisa!

318
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,166
[NAGISA]
Uh. Oh, hey there.

319
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,375
Well, uh, it's been
nice, but, yeah.

320
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,708
Gotta go!

321
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,125
Seriously? We just
started talkin'!

322
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,208
We'll do it
again sometime.

323
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,833
[YUJI] Damn it!
Do somethin', bro!

324
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,083
She's slippin' through
your fingers!

325
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,208
Don't leave me alone
like that again!

326
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,458
[MEG] Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Look, we've have a problem.

327
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,375
Just what we need. At least
tell me I can ditch the dress.

328
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,625
--[YUJI] Not so fast, ladies!
--[NAGISA, GIRLS] Uh?!

329
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,166
[YUJI]
You can't leave! Nah!

330
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,291
Not till you've taken in
my signature dance moves!

331
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,583
[STUDENTS]
Really?

332
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,958
[YUJI]
This is it. I've got 'em!

333
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:38,083
No girl can resist the
charms of my sweet moves!

334
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,750
[YUJI gasps]

335
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,958
Well, what do we have here?
A regular tough-guy, huh?

336
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:45,958
Who me? No.

337
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,125
[YAKUZA]
Shut it!

338
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,875
I'm sorry, man!
It was an accident!

339
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,666
[YAKUZA] This jacket's
worth more 'n your life!

340
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,291
Where do you live?

341
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,500
[YUJI] Look, please!
I don't want any trouble...

342
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,041
This could be our chance.

343
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,208
You're gonna pay to have
it cleaned, understand?

344
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,833
You can cut me a check, or I can
take it out of your ass now.

345
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,125
[YUJI] Wait! My dad's good
for the money, I promise!

346
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,291
Just don't beat me up,
I'm beggin' ya!

347
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,916
'Scuse me, Mr. Yakuza?

348
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,083
Yeah?

349
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,583
[YUJI gasps]

350
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,625
[MEG, HAYAMI]
One, two.

351
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,375
Mr. Bouncer, we have
a situation here.

352
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,291
I think this man's had
one too many tequila shots.

353
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,833
Someone's gonna trip
over the poor guy.

354
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,166
Thanks for pointing it out.

355
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,083
Upsy-daisy, leight
weight. There we go.

356
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,875
All right, girls. Go for it!

357
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,958
You take those "signature moves"
back to the dance floor, okay?

358
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,666
You didn't see anything.

359
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,708
[YUJI gasps]

360
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,833
[NAGISA]
If you're anything like me,

361
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,916
you probably feel humiliated.

362
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It is hard being a guy if
you think it's all about

363
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:52,750
playin' it cool. Don't try
so hard. Just do you.

364
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,291
You really think so?

365
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,583
[NAGISA] Word to the wise for
the whenever we meet again.

366
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,875
The coolest thing anyone
can do is be themselves.

367
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,125
[FUWA]
Mission accomplished!

368
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
That was some rather

369
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,666
questionable territory
you had to navigate.

370
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,083
No one got hands-y
with you, I hope?

371
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,208
[TOKA]
Mm-mm.

372
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,541
We held our own.

373
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,875
[NAGISA sighs]

374
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,541
Oh, you changed out of
your dress. That was fast.

375
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,666
[NAGISA]
Not fast enough.

376
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,291
What's bothering you?

377
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,500
[NAGISA] Nothing. I feel so
stupid. I mean, let's face it.

378
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,958
You girls didn't
need me in there.

379
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,416
I didn't contribute anything.

380
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,458
You were comic relief,
dude! That's big!

381
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,041
Delete that immediately!

382
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,833
[KAEDE laughs]
You did a lot, Nagisa.

383
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,833
I know one person who's better
off 'cause you were there.

384
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,791
[WAITER]
Uh...

385
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,458
Not gonna lie. That
dress looked good on you.

386
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,916
Historically, an assassin who
can pull off either gender

387
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,041
is a huge asset in the field.

388
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,750
I don't like where
this is going.

389
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,750
He's right. 'Cept I'm not
so sure I buy you as a dude.

390
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,708
I'd really appreciate it if
we dropped the subject!

391
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,958
We're trying to be stealthy.
Keep your voice down.

392
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,583
[NAGISA]
Right. Yes, sir.

393
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,500
We're in this operation's
final phase.

394
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,000
Talk to me, Ritsu.

395
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,083
[RITSU] Yes, sir. The VIP floor
is just around the corner.

396
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,291
The guests here don't rely

397
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,125
solely on hotel
security, though.

398
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,208
They make it a point
of bringing their own.

399
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,416
[SUGAYA] Man, these
guys look like they eat

400
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,291
rent-a-cops for breakfast.

401
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,833
[OKANO]
I'm demoralized.

402
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,083
[TOKA] You think they're in
league with our target, or what?

403
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,833
I mean, technically they could
anybody's minions, right?

404
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,416
Like it even matters.

405
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,625
Either way, we're gonna have to
take 'em down to get through.

406
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Excellent point, Terasaka.

407
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,583
And to that end, the weapon
you're hiding in your backpack

408
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,916
will more than suffice.

409
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,916
Tch. Great. You have X-ray
vision in this form, too?

410
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,875
[KARASUMA] You'll have to take
both guards down at once

411
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,666
to keep 'em from
calling for backup.

412
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,291
Kinda figured
as much, thanks.

413
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,666
Kimura, help me out.

414
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,916
I'll wait, you get out there
and lead 'em this way.

415
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,166
Dude, are you crazy?
How'm I s'posed to do that?

416
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,750
[TERASAKA]
You figure it out!

417
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,208
I've got a good idea,
if you're not a wuss.

418
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,125
[foot steps]

419
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,958
[MEN grunt]

420
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,833
[MAN A]
Help you, kid?

421
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,125
Oh, wow!

422
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,791
Not a single active
brain cell in sight! Nope!

423
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,958
Just two big dumb walls
of meat wearing clothes!

424
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:09,875
Somebody really ought to
call animal control. Sheesh.

425
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:10,625
[MAN A]
Come here!

426
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,625
[MAN B]
Why you runnin'?

427
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,875
[KIMURA]
Guess that did the trick!

428
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,625
Who the hell is
the little piss-ant?

429
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,666
And why's he so fast?

430
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,375
--[TERASAKA] Let's do it!
--[YOSHIDA] Right behind ya!

431
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,208
[TERASAKA grunts]

432
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,250
[MEN screaming]

433
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,083
Hey wait, why stun guns?

434
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,291
Well, I bought 'em to see

435
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,125
if they'd be any good
against the octopus.

436
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,000
But I never thought I'd be
usin' them on actual people.

437
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,208
[MEG]
Those cost a fortune!

438
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,750
How'd you afford
equipment like this?

439
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,333
Uh, I came into some money.

440
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,791
Odd jobs, mostly.
Nothin' special.

441
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,208
[KARASUMA] Hang on.
I've seen these guys before.

442
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Expertly done, Terasaka.

443
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,625
I don't believe
it would be remiss

444
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,458
to rifle through
their pockets, do you?

445
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,875
Huh?

446
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,041
[KORO-SENSEI] A bit of due
diligence and one can find

447
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,666
the most useful of items
on such gentlemen.

448
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,208
[STUDENTS]
Real guns?

449
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:59,041
[KORO-SENSEI] That's correct
children. Chiba? Hayami?

450
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,291
I think you two should
be the ones to have them.

451
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,291
[BOTH gasp]

452
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Alas, Mr. Karasuma

453
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,958
hasn't yet sufficiently
recovered from his encounter

454
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,750
with Smog to handle a gun.

455
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,875
The reality of our
situation is this:

456
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,000
you two are our best
sharpshooters.

457
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,916
That's kinda out
of left field, sir.

458
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
That said.

459
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,500
I'll allow no killing.
That I won't.

460
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,791
Do not underestimate your
skill. In the right hands,

461
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,625
a firearm is all
the more impressive

462
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,500
for not causing injury.

463
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,708
[RYUNOSUKE] I can't
believe this... live ammo.

464
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,416
[HAYAMI] But, even when
we had air guns, we froze.

465
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Shall we proceed, children?

466
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,250
If our experience thus
far is anything to go on,

467
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,041
the enemy's presence here
is relatively modest.

468
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,083
By even the most
conservative estimate,

469
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,166
we've thinned their
ranks by half.

470
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,708
Yeah! That's what I'm sayin'!

471
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,458
Who's he got left?

472
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,708
[RITSU] Okay, team.
Proceed with caution.

473
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,958
The next stage of infiltration

474
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,208
is the VIP-only
emergency staircase.

475
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,541
There's an empty concert
hall on the eighth floor

476
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,833
we'll have to sneak
through to access it.

477
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,208
[GASTRO]
This whole affair

478
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,500
is leaving a bad
taste in my mouth.

479
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,500
Thought I was hired to snuff
out some kind of "super being".

480
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,875
How'd I get roped into
playing cat-and-mouse

481
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,500
with a gaggle of
pimply-faced twerps?

482
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,916
Disgusting. Oh, well.

483
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,666
I have just the thing
to wash that taste out.

484
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,916
Huh?!
