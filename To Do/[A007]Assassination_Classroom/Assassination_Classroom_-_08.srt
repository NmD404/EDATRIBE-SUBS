When you've gone
to so much trouble

170
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,250
making this an enjoyable trip?

171
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,208
On the contrary,
I'm here to thank you.

172
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,791
[gasps]

173
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,208
[KORO-SENSEI] My students did
some very impressive research

174
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,541
on this region. Yes,
as a means of pinpointing

175
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,833
an ideal spot for
assassination, but still!

176
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,833
They steeped themselves
in geography, local customs,

177
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,500
tourist highlights,
history, all of it.

178
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,750
[KORO-SENSEI] As a matter of
fact, their efforts brought them

179
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,750
closer to this city's
charms than a teacher

180
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,166
might otherwise dare to hope.

181
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,375
They've really come
to understand another place

182
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,333
and its people; to expand
their minds with travel.

183
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,500
What ultimately brought them to
that milestone? Assassination.

184
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,041
Here you go.

185
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,416
Under the circumstances,
I'm as proud as punch

186
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,875
to be their target.

187
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,250
[RED EYE] I'll be damned.
You're as crazy as you look.

188
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:48,291
Still. I can tell you
care about those kids.

189
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,458
Wish I'd had a teacher
like you back in the day.

190
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,583
[KARASUMA] Wait, what do you
mean you're quitting?

191
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,375
[RED EYE]
Yeah, sorry.

192
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:01,416
I suddenly feel like just
being a tourist for a while.

193
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,416
Life tends to pass you by
in the sniper's nest, ya know?

194
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,083
It's time I expanded
the ol' color palate.

195
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,166
Eye's gettin' tired of red.

196
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,041
Now, let me see.

197
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,875
What hue should I set
my sights on tomorrow?

198
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,000
[SUGINO]
Hot damn!

199
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,666
How the hell are you
dodging all of those?!

200
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,791
[KANZAKI] This is actually
starting to get embarrassing.

201
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,541
Look at the way she
handles that joystick,

202
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,000
smiling like it's no big deal.

203
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,958
Oh, wow! I had no idea.

204
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,625
I mean, who knew you'd turn out
to be such a video game pro?

205
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,333
I've kept it secret.
My family's super strict.

206
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,916
They don't approve of me
wasting time on stuff like this.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,083
Lately, though, I feel like
I'm over caring so much

208
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,375
about what they think.

209
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,916
Well what anybody
thinks, really.

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,041
I used to get so stressed
about how other people saw me.

211
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,041
I always second-guessed myself.

212
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,791
[KANZAKI] But then
Koro-sensei made me realize.

213
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,291
It's all about doing
the best with what you have.

214
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,041
Being true to the person
you are on the inside.

215
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,500
[NAGISA] Not a side of
Kanzaki I expected to see.

216
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,416
I wonder what she and
Kayano talked about

217
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,166
while those creeps
held them against their will.

218
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,458
It's like, I dunno,
like they've bonded.

219
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,791
--They blew you up!
--Yeah, that'll happen.

220
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,041
[MIMURA]
A-ha!

221
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,125
Hey, good save, man.

222
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,958
[KARASUMA] Almost every
sniper who saw the specs

223
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,250
on this mission
turned it down.

224
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,833
The one guy we thought was a
shoe-in quit halfway through

225
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,041
the assignment. Damn.

226
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,333
So much for our
Kyoto gambit, I suppose.

227
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,791
[MIMURA]
Who else wants some?!

228
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,416
Hey, Mr. Karasuma, quick game?

229
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,833
[KARASUMA]
Aw, what the hell.

230
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,250
No more horning in
on their field trip.

231
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,666
This is supposed to be
their time, after all.

232
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,041
You got it,
but I'll warn you.

233
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,875
I'm pretty good.

234
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,333
[OKAJIMA] I'm just gonna say it.
This place is a dump.

235
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,708
Why we gotta sleep in two big
dorm rooms separated by gender?

236
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,458
The kids in all the other
classes get put up

237
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,958
in their own fancy suites.

238
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:05,041
[NAGISA] Personally, I think
it's more fun this... way...

239
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,916
Hey. What are you guys doing?

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
[FUWA]
Shh!

241
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,458
What does it look
like we're doing?

242
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,416
Tryin' to sneak a peek!

243
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,708
[NAGISA]
What?!

244
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,291
Wait, that supposed
to be our job!

245
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,166
It's nobody's job.

246
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,000
[NAKAMURA] Either way,
who can resist?

247
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,958
[NAKAMURA] Look at the way
that outfit is hung.

248
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,958
That can only mean one thing.

249
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,666
You're a clever guy.
You get what I'm saying.

250
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,333
We wanna see what
he looks like naked.

251
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,375
This may be our
only opportunity.

252
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,000
Does he have a proper body or is
it tentacles all the way down?

253
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,083
And it's not creepy
'cause we need all the intel

254
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,666
on Koro-sensei we can get.

255
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,000
[OKAJIMA] Can we all agree that
this isn't the least bit sexy?

256
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,708
[NAKAMURA]
Is he a chick?!

257
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, hello, children.

258
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,875
Are you taking a bubble
bath in a public restroom?

259
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,541
We're not s'posed to add
anything to the water, sir.

260
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,375
[KORO-SENSEI] Worry not.
This is just my mucus.

261
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,458
[NAKAMURA]
Huh...?

262
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
On contact with water,

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,250
it works up a nice lather
and acts as an exfoliate.

264
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,583
[SUGINO]
So is that a pro or a con?

265
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,791
[NAKAMURA giggles]
Yeah. Fascinating.

266
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,416
But you let
your guard down, sir,

267
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,166
and we're blocking your exit.

268
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,541
You'll come slopping
out of that tub eventually.

269
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,208
And when you do,
you'll have to walk by us.

270
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,291
We may not kill you,
but we'll see you naked!

271
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
This simply will not do!

272
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,208
A-ha!

273
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,291
[NAKAMURA]
What the hell is that?!

274
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Jellied broth, my dear!

275
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,666
Now, if you'll excuse me.

276
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,625
[KORO-SENSEI giggles]

277
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,625
All righty, then.

278
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,958
Well, that was lame.

279
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,541
Can we peep on a woman
next time, please?

280
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,000
Travel sure brings out
another side of people.

281
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,833
I know I'm learning a lot.

282
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,875
[OKAJIMA] Sucks we still don't
know what Koro-sensei

283
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,333
looks like under his
clothes, though.

284
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,083
[SUGINO]
Can we go back to the room now?

285
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,583
[MAEHARA]
Kanzaki's in the top spot.

286
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,666
No surprise there.

287
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,125
[MIMURA]
Well, yeah. Everybody likes her.

288
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,541
[MAEHARA]
I know.

289
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,750
Pretty slick of you to pull her
into our group, Sugino.

290
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,625
I was hoping me an' her
would have a chance

291
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,250
to talk a little on this trip?

292
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,625
But with all the crap
that went down, no dice.

293
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,958
[MAEHARA]
Sucks to be you, man.

294
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,583
Better luck next time, I guess.

295
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,875
Dudes, you're killin' me!

296
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,708
Can we just focus on
who has the hots for who?

297
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,791
[OKAJIMA]
Don't ask me to choose!

298
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,083
I can't do it! No! No!

299
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,208
You're exempted.

300
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,500
What about you?

301
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,958
Which of the class shorties
is your top pick?

302
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,041
[NAGISA]
Huh? Uh... I don't really know.

303
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,125
Ah, c'mon, Maehara.
You gonna ask you gotta tell.

304
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,416
Sorry. No can do.

305
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,125
A gentleman keeps
his secrets, fellas.

306
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,375
Bitch move, man!

307
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,541
When I think how popular
dillweeds like you are,

308
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,958
it drives me crazy!

309
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,916
Sounds like a party in here.

310
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,250
[ISOGAI]
Karma! Great timing!

311
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,416
[MAEHARA] Which of the girls
in our class do you like?

312
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,041
[KARMA]
Hmm...

313
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,875
I believe I'll have to
go with Okuda.

314
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,250
Dude, you're kidding. Really?

315
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,583
Huh. Interesting. But why Okuda?

316
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,416
[KARMA]
She's a demon with chemistry.

317
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,250
Think of all the concoctions
she could brew up

318
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:44,125
to enhance my shenanigans.
It'd be a match made in heaven.

319
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,958
[MAEHARA]
Yeah, heaven. Sure.

320
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,500
Hey, guys.

321
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,916
We're agreeing to keep these
ratings just between us, yeah?

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,833
[MAEHARA]
Of course. We're not stupid.

323
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,125
So absolutely none of what
we're saying leaves this room?

324
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,041
If this information got out,
we'd have a real problem.

325
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't mind me. Just passing by.

326
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,958
[SUGAYA]
Oh, no he di'n't!

327
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,625
[MAEHARA]
Kill him!

328
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,541
[KORO-SENSEI cackles]
If I can't get the low-down

329
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,083
on juicy gossip like this,
what's Mach Twenty good for?!

330
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,875
Ew. Who wants
to talk about boys?

331
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,833
Ugh, c'mon. That's what girls
talk about on trips like these.

332
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,166
Don't be a party pooper.

333
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,750
I'll start! I have a
huge crush on Mr. Karasuma!

334
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,916
Honey, there's no one here

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,583
that doesn't have
a thing for that man.

336
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,625
I'm talking about boys in our
class that we think are hotties.

337
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,708
Aww...

338
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,250
Whatever, I'll get
the ball rolling.

339
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,833
Isogai and Maehara are
half decent, I guess.

340
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,458
Gross. You don't
seriously like them?

341
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,791
[NAKAMURA] Why not? Maehara
plays the field, though,

342
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,041
so I'd never actually go out
with him or anything.

343
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,875
Isogai's class monitor, so
he's, like, upwardly mobile.

344
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,625
I don't know. Karma's the cutest
of the bunch if you ask me.

345
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,666
[OKANO sighs]
Too bad he's such a psycho.

346
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,333
[GIRLS]
True...

347
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,791
Come on.

348
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,458
I don't think he's that bad
when you get to know him.

349
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,083
Hey, 'least he's quiet
most of the time.

350
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,541
Yeah, so are wild animals.

351
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,958
[KAEDE]
Who'd you pick, Kanzaki?

352
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,541
Uh... I don't really think
about it. No idea, sorry.

353
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,791
[KAEDE]
Oh, please! Liar!

354
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,375
Don't be a prude! Spill it!

355
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,750
[NAKAMURA]
You know you have your choice!

356
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,625
--They all worship you!
--Who would you go out with?

357
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,833
--Seriously, you guys!
--Tell us!

358
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,083
Knock it off!

359
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,458
[IRINA]
Okay, girls. Settle down.

360
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,833
I'm supposed to tell you
lights out, so, I dunno,

361
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,291
at least pretend to be asleep?

362
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,791
Wow, way to chaperone there.

363
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,791
[IRINA] We all know you're
gonna stay up jibber-jabbing.

364
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,666
Just keep the antics
to a dull roar, okay?

365
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,958
Hang on, how come
you get to drink beer?

366
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,291
Meanie!

367
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,333
I'm an adult, sweetie.
Adults get to drink beer.

368
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,791
[TOKA]
Why don't you stay up with us?

369
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,041
You could tell us
some "adult" stories!

370
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,541
Huh?

371
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,333
We'd probably get more out
of 'em than your usual classes.

372
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,458
--Why, you trashy li'l ginger--
--Now, now.

373
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,333
Don't get bent out of shape.

374
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,500
[GIRLS]
Huhh?!

375
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,625
[NAKAMURA]
No way! You're only twenty?!

376
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,750
[MEG] You look great, it's just,
you're so... "experienced".

377
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,791
[OKANO]
I know, right?

378
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,708
And the whole black widow vibe.

379
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,291
Ladies.

380
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,041
I wouldn't have gotten far in
this line of work if I wasn't--

381
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,875
Who the hell just
called me a black widow?!

382
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,583
[NAKAMURA]
Delayed reaction much?

383
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,250
[IRINA] Whatever. Point is,
if I teach you nothing else.

384
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,958
You should know
sex appeal is skin deep

385
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,000
and by the time
you get it, it fades.

386
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,875
In a place like
the one I was born in,

387
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,666
you learn that all too quickly.

388
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,125
--[GIRLS gasp]
--[OKANO] Professor Bitch

389
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,666
actually said something
profound for a change.

390
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,875
Feels like B.S.

391
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,875
[IRINA]
I heard that, you hussy!

392
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,500
Oh, just ignore her.

393
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,333
Tell us about all the rich men
you seduced and killed!

394
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,750
That's what we're dying to hear!

395
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,041
[HINANO] Yeah!
I totally second that!

396
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,458
[IRINA]
Hmph. Well, if you insist.

397
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,916
Be warned, my life story
might be a bit spicy

398
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,416
for girls like you.

399
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,583
It all began at the tender
age of seventeen.

400
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,291
--I don't think so, pal!
--[screams]

401
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,708
You got a lot of balls helping
yourself to our girl-talk!

402
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Aw! But I
wanna hear your stories, too!

403
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,291
Why can't an impartial observer
get in on this action?

404
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,708
Ha! You never tell us
about your love life!

405
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,375
You wanna sit there and listen,
fine, but give us the goods!

406
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,875
[HINANO] She's right.
It's only fair, you know.

407
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,625
[OKANO] We know you've got a
romance in there somewhere!

408
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,291
[NAKAMURA]
You like giant boobs!

409
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,000
You must at least
have a crush on somebody!

410
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,458
[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]

411
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,041
[NAKAMURA]
Oh no, he didn't!

412
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,041
[IRINA] Catch him, make him
sing, and cut his throat!

413
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,250
--[OKAJIMA] There he is!
--[KORO-SENSEI gasps]

414
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,916
--[MAEHARA] Come on!
--[BOYS yelling]

415
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,333
[GIRLS yelling]

416
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,083
[KORO-SENSEI] Rats!
Caught in a pincer attack!

417
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,750
[STUDENTS yelling]

418
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,333
You guys still
trying to kill him?

419
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,708
Assassination doesn't
have a curfew, huh?

420
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,208
[STUDENTS screaming]

421
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,083
[KARASUMA]
Hm?

422
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,958
[KORO-SENSEI] That was
a little too close for comfort!

423
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,208
[KARASUMA]
Would you mind telling me

424
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,666
what all that racket was about?

425
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Nothing.

426
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,041
The students wanted me to
open up about my love life.

427
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,250
[KARASUMA]
Your what?

428
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, I assure you,

429
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,666
my past is positively riddled
with romantic encounters.

430
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,833
I haven't enough fingers and
toes to keep count of them all.

431
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,500
[KARASUMA]
Fingers and toes, huh?

432
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,291
I assume you're
referring back to a time

433
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,208
when you had hands and feet?

434
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,875
Sorry. I didn't
mean to go there.

435
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,375
I wouldn't want to talk about
the past in your shoes.

436
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,583
[KORO-SENSEI] A wise
observation, Mr. Karasuma.

437
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:04,541
It's bad manners to ask after
the number of one's appendages.

438
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,666
Even while traveling together.

439
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,916
[KAEDE] This has been
such a great trip, right?

440
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,583
It's like we've all really
gotten to know each other.

441
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,875
[NAGISA]
That's true.

442
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,250
[KAEDE]
Hm? Is something the matter?

443
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,250
[NAGISA sighs]
I was just thinking.

444
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,291
You know how our
trip's mostly over?

445
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,625
Even though it feels
like we just got here?

446
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,583
I'm kind of starting to feel
the same way about life.

447
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,083
We're just learning about the
world, and it may be over soon.

448
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,458
[KAEDE]
Yeah...

449
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,041
[NAGISA] And even if the world
isn't over by March,

450
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,708
this class will be.

451
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,875
[KAEDE]
Right...

452
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,916
I wanna live big,
to experience everything,

453
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,833
to be a top-notch assassin.

454
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,250
I just want my life
to have purpose, you know?

455
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,458
[KAEDE]
Hm. I hear you.

456
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,916
For now, I'd settle for just one
more school trip like this one.

457
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,833
[NAGISA]
Me, too.

458
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:01,083
Tonight, the curtain falls
on our adventures in Kyoto.

459
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,333
What a trip.

460
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,083
Tomorrow, it's back to life
at Kunugigaoka Junior High.

461
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,458
Back to our
Assassination Classroom.

462
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,291
[MALE AGENT A] So,
no luck neutralizing him

463
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,791
on the field trip to Kyoto
either, I take it?

464
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,833
This is most unfortunate,
Mr. Karasuma.

465
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,208
[KARASUMA] The fault lies
entirely with me, sir.

466
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,208
I will redouble my efforts.

467
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,208
[MALE AGENT B] Need I remind
you that May is almost over?

468
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,041
Our deadline is
fast approaching.

469
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,625
It will be here
before we know it.

470
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,791
[MALE AGENT C]
Precisely.

471
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,250
Why not just fire
a missile at the school

472
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,750
and flatten the whole
confounded thing?

473
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:05,875
[MALE AGENT D]
We've been through this.

474
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,750
Far too much collateral damage.

475
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,250
And there'd be no guarantee
he wouldn't escape the blast.

476
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,125
You recall what became
of our trying to hit him

477
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,250
over the Pacific, don't you?

478
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,333
He reassembled the missile
fragments and handed them back.

479
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hey, nice try!

480
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,250
[MALE AGENT E]
So what are you saying?

481
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,041
That there's no surefire
way to kill him?

482
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,500
[MALE AGENT F]
Worry not, gentlemen.

483
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,000
Several allied nations have
pooled their resources

484
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,916
to arrive at a solution.

485
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,958
The fruits of their labor
are most interesting.

486
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,833
In fact, we've already
received consent

487
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,875
from the Ministry of Defense.

488
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,375
Joining the so-called
Assassination Classroom

489
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,583
will be two very
special additions.

490
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,583
Cutting-edge science
has vested both

491
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:46,125
with veritably
superhuman abilities.

492
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,166
One still has a few kinks
that need to be worked out.

493
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,500
The other was put on standby
while you were in Kyoto.

494
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,708
Oh, yes, Mr. Karasuma.

495
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,000
There is quite a surprise
waiting for you back at school.

496
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,541
[KARASUMA growls]
