There's something I neglected

A clever assassin may avoid
confrontation for a while,

but sooner or later,
the fight will come.

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,791
And when it does,

6
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:28,458
every last ounce of strength

Clearly, this was not your

We couldn't make
out their moves,

Koro-sensei was losing ground.

A little math theorem.

Square the inverse of your

Factored by the

You're sure about that?

You. You're an artist! I'd give

his eyes shone with
an intelligence

34
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:08,458
and a singular determination.

35
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,416
There was the fork in the road,

steered him differently,

This is a one-sided fight.

All our hard work,

Everything we'd done the
past year... meaningless.

We were barely a distraction,
too stunned even to run away.

throwing handfuls of
soil to block the light.

That closes the gap
between them significantly.

He's analyzing and adjusting for
his own weaknesses mid-battle.

That's our Koro-sensei.

[KAEDE]
Don't worry, Koro-sensei.

176
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,125
I've got this.

177
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:49,041
All I have to do is try.
My sister taught me that.

178
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,625
So did you!

[SHIRO]
Unbelievable!

182
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,833
What're the odds of
having both sisters

183
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,166
die right in front of me?

[SHIRO] Tragic ends must
run in the family, eh?

186
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,666
Ha-ha!

187
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,000
Can you imagine if I'd kept her
around as a back-up wife?

188
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,791
Too bad for me.

189
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,416
It looks like I have a thing for
women destined to be impaled.

There it is!

Oh, but you are a
devastating creature

194
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,166
when your emotions twist
past the point of endurance!

195
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,750
Black indicates well-nigh
unimaginable power.

196
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:24,500
At last, your true colors
are on full, glorious display!

197
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:28,833
Isn't it liberating to shed
that ridiculous façade?

198
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,250
All year long, you've
been a smiling hypocrite!

199
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,416
How wonderful to see
you as you really are!

200
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,583
But alas,

00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,666
considerable though your
power may be in this form...

202
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,125

Are you for real?

C'mon! We're wasting
time! He's distracted!

If we stick around, it'll
only make things worse!

You can't be serious!

210
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,333
Living to fight another day

211
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,916

No. He's gone back to yellow.

Every color.

You've got a keen eye.

241
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,166
Nicely done.

[chuckles] You really
mean that, sir?

243
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,916
I can make a fresh

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,958
I suppose you could...

245
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,125
But I'd rather you
study chemistry.

If I'd only seen that smile,

I might've led the poor boy

251
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,916
[REAPER]
The tentacles spoke to me,

252
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,958
asked me what I wanted.

253
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,750
And I said... to be
acknowledged by you.

254
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,958
To be like you...

255
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,291
To be... like... you.

You are and you

00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,958
More than you understood.

If by chance we meet again...

260
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,750

00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:16,458

Koro-sensei, Kayano's...

[STUDENTS crying]

00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,958
[HINANO]
Oh, Kaede.

266
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,625
Why don't we lay her down?

267
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Not so fast. One moment, please.

268
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,333
Sorry, I'd rather her cells not
come in contact with the soil.

269
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,333
But, sir--

270
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Children,

271
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,000
I've made mistakes,
more than I care to count.

272
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,000
What's done is done.

273
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,208
The past can never be
regained or revised.

274
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,041
If, however,
we attend carefully,

275
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,708
it can teach us how
to move forward.

276
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,541
What is... that?

277
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
You're looking at Kayano's blood

278
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,458
and somatic cells.

279
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,833
I gathered as much as I could

280
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,041
before she fell to the
ground and stored them

281
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,791
in a sterile membrane of
compressed air for safekeeping.

282
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,708
You-You did all of that
in the middle of a battle?

283
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
I set a few tentacles aside

284
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,708
for protecting you.

285
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:14,875
Of the rest, I used some for
fighting and some for this.

286
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,333
Okey dokey, then.

287
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:20,208
Time to string these cells
together one by one.

288
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:24,333
Faster. And more accurately

289
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,708
You see, class,

290
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,500
I've been improving my skills
for some months now.

291
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,041
If what happened to
Aguri repeated itself,

292
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:35,166
I was adamant about
being prepared.

293
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,500
Now, some cells
couldn't be recovered,

294
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,541
so I'll leave strategic gaps.

295
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,166
Those I'll fill in with
tiny bits of mucus.

296
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,125
In a few days, what cells
there are will have regenerated

297
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:49,625
in sufficient quantities
to replace them.

298
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,791
I'm a little low on blood.

That doesn't matter!

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Besides, I can't stop
thinking about it!

00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,708
Thirty-second rule!

[NAGISA] I think the wound's

didn't leave so much as a mark!

[KORO-SENSEI sighs]

312
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,791
[KORO-SENSEI] In a moment,
her heart will start beating

313
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,375
and she'll come back to life.

314
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,750
According to my handy-dandy

315
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,041
"What to Do for a
Gut-Shot Student" manual,

316
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,000
from here on out it
should be smooth sailing.

317
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,541
[ALL] But who thinks
of writing a manual

318
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,250
for something like that?!

319
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
I didn't mention this earlier

320
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,291
for fear of sounding ghoulish,

321
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,416
but if ever your bodies
were torn to shreds,

322
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,875
I was ready and able to put them
back in order piece by piece.

323
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,875
The ultimate student-teacher
relationship, really.

324
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,166
[KORO-SENSEI] Because it
requires, above all else,

325
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,375
that I properly acknowledge you.

What did you--? You saved
me again, didn't you?

330
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
As many times as necessary.

331
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,625
After all, your sister

The important thing

335
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:38,041
is that you not make
the same mistake twice.

336
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,666
Aguri, thank you for
giving me this past year.

337
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Such a beautiful gift.

338
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,666
I hope against hope
I've been worthy of it.
