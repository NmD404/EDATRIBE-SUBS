00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,000
[FUWA]
When you think about it,

175
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,166
Koro-sensei and the principal
are kind of similar

176
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,166
in a lot of ways.

177
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,166
Like how?

178
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,958
Well, for starters
they both have,

179
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,375
like, extraordinary powers...

180
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,000
And yet they settle
for being teachers.

181
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,125
Seriously, as manipulative
as he is,

182
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,416
the principal could've
easily been Prime Minster

183
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,791
or a business tycoon
or something,

184
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,208
you know?

185
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,583
But here he is, totally devoting
himself to this place.

186
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,666
I mean, it's no wonder
he's such a ruthless guy.

187
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,041
[gasps] Uh. It's Asano.

188
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,666
[MAEHARA]
What the hell do you want?

189
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,083
[SUGINO] Your lackeys too
busy to do recon on us?

190
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,458
It pains me that I
have to say this...

191
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,875
But I have a favor
to ask of you.

192
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,333
[KARMA]
Hm?

193
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,791
[GAKUSHU]
Let me just cut to the chase.

194
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,250
The principal... I need
you people to kill him.

195
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,583
Uh?!

196
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,083
So to speak.

197
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,125
I don't mean something like
murdering him, of course...

198
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,958
That would be patently absurd.

199
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,458
I mean you should
kill his philosophy.

200
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,375
Not sure I understand.
How, exactly?

201
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,291
It's easier than you think.

202
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,000
All E-Class has to do is
dominate the top spots

203
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,416
on the end-of-term exams.

204
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,833
It goes without saying
I'll be placing highest.

205
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,208
Of course, whether or not
I perform as expected

206
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,583
makes no difference.

207
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,458
For detritus like you to
show up A-Class, however...

208
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,916
Now that'd be slap in
the face to his policies.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,708
All right look, we all
know the relationship

210
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,000
between the two of you
isn't really the best.

211
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,375
But he's your dad.

212
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,708
You want to rake his life's
work through the mud?

213
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,583
To reject his legacy?

214
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,125
Oh, on the contrary...

215
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,333
Believe it or not,

216
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,375
my father actually wants
me to take him down.

217
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,041
That's what I've
been groomed to do.

218
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,083
This will be the fulfillment
of his legacy.

219
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,250
That's how we are,

220
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,750
that's what our relationship
is built on.

221
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,166
Then again,

222
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,833
if you didn't know the pleasure
of being raised by him,

223
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:42,708
let me assure you, his
methods are hell on earth.

224
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,666
That should just about
do it for today, I think.

225
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,000
[STUDENTS sigh]

226
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,875
[ASANO]
Now then. Remember to review.

227
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,125
[STUDENTS]
Kill E-Class without mercy.

228
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,291
[GAKUSHU] The only thing
supporting A-Class right now

229
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,916
is their hatred of you.

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,291
He's pushing them
past their limits!

231
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,875
If it raises them to victory
my father's methods will

232
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,333
be the only thing they
trust from here on out.

233
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,250
We can't let that happen.

234
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,625
Hatred only gets you so far.
I know this for a fact.

235
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,958
Scorning one's enemies
is childish.

236
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,375
My flunkies need to learn a
healthy respect for their foes.

237
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,583
Otherwise their strength
will be lopsided,

238
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:27,250
and I'll only ever be
second in command.

239
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:31,458
The thing about defeat is that
it gives you new perspective.

240
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,958
So I'm asking you, give
the teacher a lesson.

241
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,875
Let them all know
what it is to lose.

242
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,291
[NAGISA] He may sound
arrogant, but even so,

243
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,416
he's speaking from the
heart... I respect that.

244
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,416
Proud as he is,
he's bowing to us.

245
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,958
Because for once in his life,

246
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,125
he's really worried about
someone other than himself.

247
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,583
Heh.

248
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,416
that's big of you and all,
but lemme tell ya right now,

249
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm actually gonna be the
one to take the top spot.

250
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,708
[STUDENTS groan]

251
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,250
What'd I say?

252
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,875
I said next time we weren't
gonna be taking it easy on you.

253
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,916
Prepare to surrender
your throne, Highness.

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,166
You're goin' down.

255
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,333
Oh, don't worry, though;

256
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,750
you'll look just as
good in tenth place.

257
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,625
Uh oh!

258
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,541
Guess the gloves are off now!

259
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,916
[TAKEBAYASHI] Just don't let it
turn out like last time, please.

260
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,208
Don't oversell it, man.

261
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,708

[ISOGAI]
Asano.

265
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,000
We've been working our
butts off to win all along.

266
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,750
Just like you guys have.

267
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,375
When you get right down to it,
everyone's on the same side.

268
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,166
We're stoked when we win,
frustrated when we lose.

269
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,750
No need for ranks beyond that.

270
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,125
That really should be
enough, don't you think?

271
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,666
E-Class'll strive to
do the best we can.

272
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,458
That way A-Class will
have an opponent

273
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,208
they can be proud to face.

274
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,875
[KARMA] Don't overthink it.
Just bring it on.

you want us dead.

Very well. I'll fight
with my gloves off, too.

00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,708
[ONO]
Wait.

280
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,000
All this just for the math
portion of the exam?!

281
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,041
Well the principal did instruct
us to pore through everything

282
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,791
and come up with the
hardest questions.

283
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,791
Ugh! For god's sake,
this is junior high!

284

What? We're preparing
them for college now?

00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,958
I understand raising the bar,
but he's out of his mind!

[ASANO]
Ah...

287
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,250
How unusual to see
you here, Koro-sensei.

288
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,208
I'm not aware of having
done anything wrong.

289
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Perish the thought, sir.

290
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,750
You're a by-the-book sort of
man if ever I've seen one.

291
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,875
You wouldn't resort to cheap
tricks this late in the game.

As this will be our final
educational battle,

00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,125
in a manner of speaking,

294
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,083
I wanted to offer you a
small thanks for accepting

295
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,500
my presence here when you
certainly didn't have to.

296
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,750
[ASANO]
Koro-sensei.

297
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,125
This is your first teaching
position, am I correct?

298
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
How did you know that?

299
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,291
[ASANO] Let's call it
educator's intuition, shall we?

300
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,833
It's rather bizarre
you won't divulge

301
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,916
why you chose this profession.

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,333
Perhaps you'll do me
the honor after I've won?

303
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,083
[KORO-SENSEI] There's not
much to tell, to be honest.

304
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,458
I can only speak from
experience of course,

305
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,000
but in general there
are only two things

306
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,000
that compel a person to teach,

307
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,541
we wish either to pass
on our successes.

308
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,333
Or, less charitably,
disguise our failures.

309
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:25,041
Which is it for you I
wonder, Principal Asano?

310
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,583
[ASANO]
Indeed.

[NAGISA] The second-term finals
were only one week away.

Of course, we
studied like crazy.

313
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,541
Anything we didn't understand,
we had Koro-sensei go over.

314
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,583
He did his best to keep up
with our questions, but...

were so full,

Eh. I dunno.

I mean, if they're planning
to actually kill me,

326
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,875
that might slow me down a tad.

[NAGISA] We have to show our
true target we're worthy.

344
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,375
Or we can't graduate.

345
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,125
[ENGLISH BEAST groans]

346
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,458
[TEACHER A]
Pencils down.

347
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,166
[panting]

348
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,083
It's no good.

349
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,708
I couldn't get through 'em all.

350
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,541
This is hard!
There's not enough time

351
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,291
to answer every single
little question.

352
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,208
The listening comprehension
part was a beast...

353
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,541
Not even Professor Bitch

354
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,041
would know what all those
vocabulary words meant.

355
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,583
[NAGISA] The first test and
already we're wiped out...

356
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,625
Even worse,

357
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,583
English is my strongest subject.

358
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,000
What the...

359
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,083
Uh-oh...

360
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,666
It's about to get real!

361
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:28,958
[NAGISA]
Whoa...

362
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,541
Look at that!

363
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:34,708
The grade-point average on this
thing must be ridiculously low!

364
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,583
Even if even one of us passes,

365
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,000
it'll be nothing
short of a miracle...

366
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,833
What'd we expect, really?

367
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,750
This test is designed
to take us down a peg.

368
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,833
[MAEHARA]
Take that!

369
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,166
[SCIENCE BEAST roars]

370
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,291
[RYUNOSUKE]
So? How's A-Class doing?

371
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,416
[MIMURA] I sneaked a peak
at 'em during the break...

372
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,875
Dude, you talk about seething!

373

[SCIENCE BEAST groans]

375
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,708
[MIMURA] They were like
blood-crazed animals!

376
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,541
Never underestimate the
power of hatred, I guess.

Forget that! Just look out!

Ritsu?

382
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,541
Don't worry; I know what's up.

383
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,416
We land in the top 50 or we're
done, isn't that right?

384
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,416
Who're you?!

385
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,250
Oh...

386
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,791
That's the fake Ritsu.

387
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,125
Bingo.

388
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,041
And the real Ritsu broke
it down for me like so...

389
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,583
Reaching our goal hinges
on low-performers like me

390
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,000
working as hard as we can

391
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,375
to drive up the average
for everybody else.

392
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,208
[MAEHARA]
Hm.

393
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,000
Right, then.

[TEACHER A]
Begin!

396
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,833
[TAKEBAYASHI] The questions
are all uncommonly difficult.

397
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,416
And as many as there are

398
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,583
one has to plot out a method
of attack immediately.

399
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,166
Hesitate for even a
fraction of a second,

400
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,500
and you're backed into a corner.

401
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,250
[TAKEBAYASHI] But the comrade
we were most worried about

402
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,583
is doing fine.

[YOSHIDA]
Is Terasaka for real with this?

406
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,541
It's a question
about probability.

407
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,916
He's usin' brute force;

408
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,791
essentially blowing through
each potential answer

409
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,333
as quickly as he can.

410
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,875
But, uh, aren't we supposed
to use a combination equation?

411
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,000
Meh...

412
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,750
Best strategy for a
lug-head like him,

413
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,000
if you stop and
think about it.

414

It's easy to take
too long fishing

415
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,125
for the most
efficient approach.

Sometimes it's better to come
out guns blazing before you

417
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,208

especially on this stuff.

[TERASAKA yells]

419

see a question like this,

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,583
Simply use the tactics
I've shown you, like so.

least you can get...

At the end?

was just an urban legend...

Oh, c'mon I showed
you guys last week.

457
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,958
You have to take it to
a particular solution.

458
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,833
[KORO-SENSEI] In addition
to their regular classes,

459
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,666
I had the students
tutor each other

460
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,791
on their strongest subjects.

461
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,333
One of the best ways to deepen
your own understanding

462
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,791
is to teach someone else.

463
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,458
It also fosters a strong
sense of teamwork.

464
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,625
The effect on Karma
was extraordinary.

465
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,583
It patched up the gaps
in his knowledge

466
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,583
and polished him to
a brilliant shine.

467
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,458
Sure, but that Asano kid is a
real overachiever, too, right?

468
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Correct.

469
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,666
And in fact, since grooming
A-Class for the exams

470
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,375
is no longer his concern. The
boy's marshaled all his know-how

471
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,041
and cunning toward
sharpening his own blade.

472
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,583
A perfectly valid use of
one's strength, of course.

473
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,416
Though to be entirely honest,

474
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,583
not even I'm sure which
method is better.

475
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,333
Relax.

476
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,083
Just do your best, okay?

477
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,791
You're guaranteed to get
at least partial credit.

478
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,791
Don't worry.

479
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,416
Leave getting full credit to me.

480
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,750

Now, then...
