1
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:27,416
[NAGISA] You monster. I'll
kill you for what you've done!

2
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,458
[TAKAOKA laughs]
That's the spirit, boy!

3
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,500
Show me your kill face! Come at
me with everything you've got!

4
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,500
[MEG]
It's happened. Nagisa snapped.

5
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,541
All right, let's be honest
here for a second.

6
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:21,291
Sure, we all wanna kill him.
But, Nagisa might do it.

7
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,208
Can't say I saw it comin'.

8
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
No. Someone has to stop this!

9
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,666
[TERASAKA grunts]

10
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,208
[NAGISA groaning]

11
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:33,250
[TERASAKA panting]

12
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,875
[TERASAKA]
Get over yourself, dumbass!

13
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,375
Yeah, don't think I missed
the look you gave me

14
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,833
when he blew up the antidote!

15
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,750
Screw your pity!

16
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,416
Quit wastin' your energy
worryin' about what's goin' on

17
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,375
with other people
and focus on you!

18
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,083
Look, the virus is
a lie! I'll be fine!

19
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,916
He's playin' you for an idiot!

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,500
What are you saying?
Are you sick?

21
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,000
[TERASAKA]
Murder is murder!

22
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,833
Even with a piece of shit like
this evil son of a bitch.

23
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,291
He's not worth it!

24
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,833
Give in to the bloodlust and
you're no better than him!

25
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
He's absolutely right, Nagisa.

26
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,333
Listen to him. Killing this
man won't solve anything.

27
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,833
Blind rage
is not a moral guide!

28
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,750
In any event, he's likely
bluffing about the antidote.

29
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,458
We need only consult
the poisoner downstairs.

30
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:23,000
Do not stoop to Takaoka's level.
Simply render him unconscious.

31
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,333
Shut your damn mouth.

32
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,208
You're takin' all the
fun out of everything!

33
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,791
If we're gonna get
the most out of this,

34
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,000
he's gotta come at me with
intent to kill!

35
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,166
Part of the process
is bloodlust unbound!

36
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,000
He has to feel it or I can't
properly humiliate him!

37
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,958
How the hell else am I gonna
patch-up my self-esteem?

38
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Nagisa, please.

39
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,583
Take up Terasaka's stun gun.

40
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Heed the words of a friend

41
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,291
before you give
credence to an enemy.

42
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,833
Resist the anger.
Weigh your options.

43
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:54,750
Ask what within myself does
this many have claim on?

44
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,833
[YOSHIDA]
Terasaka! What the...?

45
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,625
You're as hot as a
combustion engine!

46
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,125
Dude, how'd you make
it so far like this?

47
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:06,291
[TERASAKA] Who cares? Don't
look at me. Look at them.

48
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,291
The octopus is half
right.

49
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:12,583
You ain't gotta resist the
anger. You control it.

50
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,333
[NAGISA]
Uh!

51
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,750
[TAKAOKA growls]

52
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,750
[TERASAKA grunts]

53
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,791
[TAKAOKA] Ooh! Oh, ho!
Don't we look vicious!

54
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,125
Question, sir?

55
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,375
Why did Nagisa put
the stun gun away?

56
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,958
[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]

57
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,791
[TAKAOKA] So you're opting for
the knife. Good on you, kid!

58
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,250
I knew you'd see the light. Do
you wanna know a little secret?

59
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,750
I didn't blow up every
vial of the antidote.

60
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,958
Now, either you come at me

61
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,291
and your pals keep a
respectful distance,

62
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,541
or what's left of their chance
at survival goes bye-bye.

63
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,416
Everyone infected will die.

64
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,125
Hear that, Karasuma?
It's just me and the boy!

65
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,625
[KARASUMA growls]

66
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,541
This stuff takes a month to cook
up under ideal conditions.

67
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,541
Now sure, there's not
enough for everyone.

68
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,333
But saving some's better
than saving none.

69
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,916
[OKANO gasps]

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,083
[KORO-SENSEI] Mr. Karasuma. I
hate to ask this of you, but...

71
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,166
If at any moment you believe
Nagisa's life to be in jeopardy,

72
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,416
please do not hesitate
to shoot Takaoka.

73
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,875
[KARASUMA]
He usually has a sixth sense

74
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,250
about where things are headed.

75
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,958
So for him to ask me that,
we're in trouble.

76
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,625
Deep trouble.

77
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,875
[KARASUMA]
Of course we are.

78
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,500
Even I can see the
writing on the wall.

79
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,208
We got the better of
three professional

80
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,833
freelance assassins
on our own terms.

81
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:40,416
But this is different. Here,
we're playing by his rules.

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,166
Nagisa has absolutely no idea
the world of hurt he's in for.

83
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,083
[TAKAOKA grunts]

84
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,666
[NAGISA groans]

85
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,583
[TAKAOKA]
Ha! That all you've got?

86
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,708
Where's that homicidal rage
now you're on your ass,

87
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,250
you little snot rag?

88
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,916
[KARASUMA]
Takaoka is a man possessed.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,083
He's in battle mode.

90
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:05,125
Years of elite military training
cut through the insanity.

91
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:09,041
No attack is going to slip
through his defenses.

92
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,666
[NAGISA groaning]

93
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,041
[KAEDE whimpers]

94
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,375
[KARASUMA] His physique.
His skills. His experience.

95
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,291
[TAKAOKA chuckles]

96
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,750
[NAGISA groans]

97
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,250
[KARASUMA] This isn't like
scoring high on the finals.

98
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,291
This is life or death.

99
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,166
Ugh. So not a fair match.

100
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, no kidding, right?
He doesn't have a prayer!

101
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,791
[TAKAOKA]
Aw. Hey now, don't peter out.

102
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,541
We're just getting started.

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,916
[TAKAOKA]
That's right.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,125
We haven't yet incorporated
this old girl into the mix.

105
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:48,250
[TAKAOKA] This knife comes to
me in my dreams every night.

106
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,583
Hand in hand with that smile.

107
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:55,166
The precise moment my peace
of mind flew off the rails.

108
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,708
Well, tonight I won't give

109
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,750
that smug little pipsqueak
the satisfaction!

110
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,291
I'll split you from groin to
grin and savor the screams.

111
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,958
I'll sever your hands and feet

112
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,666
and mount them above my
mantle like trophies!

113
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,333
Shoot him, Mr. K!
Please! Nagisa will die!

114
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,333
That man means every
word of what he says!

115
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,666
[TERASAKA]
Stop. Let Nagisa handle it.

116
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,208
Dude. Do you see
the shape he's in?

117
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,916
At least if I was
in there Takaoka

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,250
wouldn't have it so easy.

119
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,833
You think so?

120
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,291
Shows what you know.

121
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,833
If you didn't ditch training
so much you'd have a clue.

122
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:31,125
This fight ain't over
yet, pal. Just watch.

123
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,458
He's about to pull
out the big guns.

124
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,208
This technique.
It never fails?

125
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,875
Don't be fooled.
It only looks easy.

126
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,333
Therein lies the beauty.

127
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,166
I've used it many
a time in field.

128
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,250
Nothing compares for
getting out of pinch.

129
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,916
The technique only works under
certain conditions, however.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Three criteria must be met.

131
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,333
First, have at least
two weapons ready-hand.

132
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,791
[TAKAOKA gasps]

133
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,875
[LOVRO] Second, you must be
pitted against an expert.

134
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,750
Third, and most important,

135
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:08,208
your opponent must already know
what it means to face death.

136
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,541
[NAGISA] Excellent.
We're three for three.

137
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,875
[TAKAOKA grunts]

138
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,250
What the...?

139
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,958
[NAGISA]
Congratulations, Mr. Takaoka.

140
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,708
You get to be my beta test.

141
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,666
[TAKAOKA]
What is he doing?

142
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,333
[LOVRO] You must understand
the nature of this move.

143
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,916
It's something of
a paradox, you see.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,041
Conditions aren't
often favorable.

145
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,125
And while I call it an
"insta-kill" technique,

146
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,250
in all honesty that
is a misnomer.

147
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,208
Employing it doesn't mean your
opponent will die instantly.

148
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,416
Particularly when their
defenses are impregnable.

149
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,125
That said, if you find yourself
painted into a corner,

150
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,166
and at some point you will,

151
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,291
do this correctly and it sets
the stage for an instant kill.

152
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,541
That sounds pretty
useful. How's it work?

153
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,041
[LOVRO] From a standstill
position, move quickly.

154
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:03,041
As far as you can,
as loudly as you can.

155
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,750
Come on! Do it!

156
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:10,375
[NAGISA] Careful. Time it just
after dropping the knife.

157
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:16,041
The closer I get, the more
focused he'll be on the blade.

158
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,291
Drop my weapon, and his
attention follows it.

159
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,958
Both caught in midair for
just a fraction of a second.

160
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,500
[TAKAOKA groans, screams]

161
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:47,250
[TAKAOKA groaning]
What the hell was that?

162
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,416
[NAGISA]
There it is!

163
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,083
An assassin slips
through the cracks.

164
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:55,583
And in that tiny moment, out
comes the crucial second blade.

165
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,500
[TAKAOKA groaning]

166
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,916
[TAKAOKA]
No! This isn't happening!

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,541
The runt... got me... again!

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Whoa.

169
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,333

[NAGISA panting]

174
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,250
Way to go. That's how it's done.

175
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,166
One good jolt and he'll
be out like a light bulb.

176
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,375
Taze the psychotic rat-bastard.

[TAKAOKA whimpering]

178
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,208
[NAGISA]
This man taught me bloodlust.

179
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:46,083
Taught me that sometimes
anger is good, sometimes not.

180
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,583
He taught me the importance
of having friends

181
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,041
to pull you out
of your own head.

182
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,208
I know what it's
like to be hit.

183
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:57,875
To be in a real fight.
All because of this man.

184
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,041
He's done some awful things.
There's no denying that.

185
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:07,000
But in a weird way,
he does deserve my respect.

186
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,708
[TAKAOKA whimpers]

187
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,750
[NAGISA]
He's a teacher.

188
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,250
[TAKAOKA]
Please. No.

189
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,583
[NAGISA] I've learned something
about myself in all this.

190
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,333
[TAKAOKA]
Whatever you're about to do,

191
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:22,166
don't do it with that look
on your face! Oh, god!

192
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll be haunted by that smile

193
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,416
till the day they put
me in the ground!

194
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Mr. Takaoka. Thank you,
for everything.

195
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,291

We beat the final boss!

203

[KARMA]
Nice work.

00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,458
[NAGISA gasps]

205
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,875
[ISOGAI]
Are you okay, Nagisa?

206
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,208
[NAGISA]
Sure.

207
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,625
[KORO-SENSEI] Well done,
Nagisa. I'm proud of you.

208
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,791
For the first time in a while I
had no idea how this would end.

209
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,333
Thanks. But what are
we going to do now?

210
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,416
Everybody else is still
infected with the virus.

211
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,375
The antidote Takaoka didn't
blow up isn't enough.

212
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,041
[STUDENTS sigh]

213
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,125
We'll figure something
out, but first.

214
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,250
Let's get out off this roof.
Wait here for the chopper.

215
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,375
I'll go collect Smog.

216
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:49,916
[GASTRO] Ha! Please. The
antidote won't do you any good.

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,250
Look at you brats.

218
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,250
You really figured
on getting out

219
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,750
of this situation
with your lives!

220
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,500
[KARASUMA] The man who hired
you has been defeated.

221
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,000
Let it go. You've no longer
have a dog in this fight.

222
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,083
[GASTRO]
Heh.

223
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,333
I'm almost fully
recovered from the gas.

224
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,500
And these kids are
strong. Believe me.

225
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,666
I suggest we be
reasonable and stop this

226
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,458
before anyone else gets hurts.

227
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,791
[GASTRO]
Yeah. All right.

228
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll make you wish
you hadn't... Wait.

229
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,250
Come again?

230
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,125
No worries. You don't
have to bother with us.

231
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,583
Our contracts don't cover
avenging our employer.

232
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,791
Anyway, as I was saying.

233
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,791
The antidote would
only be useful to you

234
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,041
if you'd actually been poisoned.

235
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,291
[TERASAKA, YOSHIDA]
Huh?

236
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,750
Well, technically you
were, but not that bad.

237
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,083
You know that bug you can get

238
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,708
eating oysters on
the half-shell?

239
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,083
I gave you a perfected version
of that ol' warhorse.

240
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,541
It ought to flush out
of your systems

241
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,958
in about 30 hours or so.

242
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,583
Unpleasant, but not fatal.

243
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,666
Now, this sucker is what
our boss wanted us to use.

244
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,208
[STUDENTS sigh]

245
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,208
[SMOG] If I actually had, heh,
different story altogether.

246
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,458
After we got the job, the
three of us talked it over,

247
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,875
hatched a plan.

248
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,375
The boss's idea, you know it,
seemed too harsh.

249
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,458
We figured the handoff
would play out just as well

250
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,041
if you only thought
you were in danger.

251
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,625
[SMOG]
And a bout a food poisoning

252
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,791
certainly makes you feel like
death warmed over, so win-win.

253
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,583
Since when does a hired
killer have scruples?

254
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,208
Isn't going against your client
bad for the bottom line?

255
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,791
[GASTRO]
Sweetheart.

256
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,541
We take pride in what we do, but
money isn't the end-all be-all.

257
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,958
A client's needs are always
considered carefully,

258
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,833
and we do aim to please.

259
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,583
We blow the antidote up.

260
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,583
Right in front of their shocked,
bedraggled little faces!

261
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:23,666
How sweet the moment will
be when all hope is lost!

262
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,625
[GASTRO] But when we
realized he never intended

263
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,750
on giving you the antidote.

264
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,958
It was either we try to live
with ourselves after having

265
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,166
offed a bunch of innocent
junior high school kids.

266
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,583
Or we take out a hit
on our reputation.

267
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,041
Seemed like a fairly
straightforward,

268
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,750
ethical decision to us.

269
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:42,041
And there's always a way to
bounce back if you're clever.

270
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,833
So, guess this job was a wash.

271
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,291
But at least none of
you are going to die

272
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,500
because we don't
having scruples.

273
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,750
Here, give that supplement
to your buddies.

274
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,416
And make sure they
get plenty of rest.

275
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,291
They'll probably wind up
feeling better than they did

276
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,166
before this all started.

277
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,791
[KARASUMA]
Thank you, gentlemen.

278
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,750
But I'll believe it after
I've seen those kids

279
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,791
make a full recovery.
In the meantime,

280
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,125
I'm afraid it's protocol to
detain you for questioning.

281
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,750
Uh. Yeah, okay.

282
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,083
If you wouldn't mind
making it quick

283
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,458
so we can move on the
next job, that'd be great.

284
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,083
--[KARMA] You disappoint me.
--[GRIP] Mm?

285
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,583
I thought you'd at least
want a grudge match

286
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,125
between the two of us.

287
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,416
You're a samurai. Isn't your
honor threatened by hot-sauce?

288
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,083
Part of the samurai code is not
to kill people out of spite.

289
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,500
I'm content to wait for
the day someone puts a price

290
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:30,291
on your head, Hun. Because
it'll happen. Guarantee it.

291
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,041
Let this be a lesson to you.

292
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,000
You wanna rematch?
Make it to the big-time.

293
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,625
Become a worthy target!

294
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,541
[STUDENTS gasp]

295
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,958
Then we'll come back

296
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:43,125
and give you all the
assassination grand tour!

297
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,041
[NAGISA] And just like
that, they're gone.

298
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,875
Not sure if what
they left us with

299
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,958
was a warning or a compliment.

300
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,208
--[buzz]
--[IRINA] Oh!

301
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,166
A single buzz from Karasuma.

302
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,791
That's the signal
they've made it out.

303
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,041
Boys. I have the sudden urge
to walk naked by the ocean.

304
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,833
Would one of you be kind
enough to drive me to a beach?

305
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,291
[MEN chattering]

306
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,375
[NAGISA]
That's it.

307
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,833
Our big infiltration
mission is over.

308
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,791
And no one, not the other
guests, not the staff,

309
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,375
suspects a thing.

310
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,666
Hey, Terasaka?

311
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,791
[TERASAKA]
Hm?

312
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,291
I owe you big time.
I was on the verge

313
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,708
of a bad choice.
So thanks for yelling at me.

314
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,000
[TERASAKA] Heh. It's hard
enough to kill the octopus

315
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,666
without one of us being
taken out of the equation.

316
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,125
[KARMA chuckles]

317
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,125
[NAGISA]
Yeah. Guess so.

318
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,458
So now, we go back
to our hotel.

319
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,875
Tell the others
they're gonna be fine.

320
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,208
Then we put this whole day
behind us and catch up

321
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:52,958
on our sleep because, seriously.
I am friggin' exhausted.

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,166
Oh, man. That was
one crazy day, huh?

323
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,416
I'm just glad we
got through it okay.

324
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,416
And I'm just glad you knew
how to handle yourself!

325
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,250
Uh! Me, too.

326
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,875
You're such a trouble
magnet, Nagisa.

327
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,916
You know we worry about you.

328
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,041
[NAGISA laughs]

329
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,333
Morning! Well, evening really.

330
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,208
So, how're you guys feeling?

331
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,333
Great. Thanks!

332
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,833
School jerseys.
Heh. You too, huh?

333
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,666
We're the only ones
on the resort now.

334
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,375
Might as well be comfy.

335
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,291
Designing a new outfit
for one just one scene

336
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,416
is too much of a pain anyway.

337
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,916
Who are you talking to?

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,958
[FUWA] So is Koro-Sensei
really in there?

339
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,541
[NAGISA]
It won't work,

340
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,208
but at least he's under strict
supervision till he reverts back

341
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,458
to normal. Then back
to the drawing board.

342
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,625
Mr. Karasuma's been
orchestrating the whole thing.

343
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,000
[KIMURA]
I swear, does Mr. K ever sleep?

344
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,791
[SUGINO]
He's awesome! What's his secret?

345
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,750
'Cause if I can be like that ten
years from now, I'll be set.

346
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,708
[SUGAYA]
Somethin' to shoot for.

347
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,750
[MEG] Hey, Professor Bitch
is pretty awesome, too,

348
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,125
if you look hard enough.

349
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,458
[ISOGAI] Same thing with
the assassins at the hotel.

350
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,666
I mean, you've gotta admire
the discipline it takes

351
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,500
to be that highly skilled.

352
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,708
And the philosophy. Not to
mention the work ethic.

353
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,291
[SUGAYA]
True that. Personally,

354
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,458
as long as I don't grow up to
be like Takaoka, I'll be happy.

355
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,958
[ISOGAI] In a way I suppose
that's what growing up is.

356
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,375
Knowing who to look up
to and who to ignore.

357
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,916
Sometimes the difference
is night and day.

358
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,708
Sometimes, not so much.

[MAEHARA]
Koro-Sensei exploded!

362
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,750
[SUGINO]
Did we get him?

363
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,250
[NAGISA]
Right.

364
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,833
As if we don't already know
the answer to that question.

365
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,375
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]
You've suffered in the shadow

366
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,041
of my cowardice, and
I'm sorry. But consider!

367
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,791
Not only have you faced
an array of fearsome foes,

368
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,875
you did so with
unquestionable style!

369
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,166
Oh, there you are, sir.

370
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,791
Good to have you back.
With all due respect

371
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,250
--we like this form better.
--[HINANO] G'morning!

372
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,458
[KORO-SENSEI] Indeed.
And good morning to you.

373
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,666
Now, what do you say we get
this vacation back on track?

374
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,041
Sure!

375
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,250
[SUGINO] Yeah, I think it's
a little late for that.

376
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,541
We go back tomorrow morning.

377
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Are you kidding me?

378
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,250
But... but... there's so much
fun in the sun to be had

379
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,000
now that I'm fully mobile again!

380
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,458
[SUGINO]
Naturally.

381
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,208
[KORO-SENSEI] There's not a
second to waste, children!

382
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,041
Summer Vacation with
your Koro-Sensei

383
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,666
is a once-in-a-lifetime
experience!

384
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,416
We must milk it
for all it's worth!

385
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,666
What are you doing, Karma?

386
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,041
Takin' your advice, Teach.

387
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,500
Gotta strike when
the iron's hot.

Well played, my boy.

Now it's Summer Vacation!

391
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,791
[KARMA] No time like
the preseny, right?

392
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,500
Whaddya say, Nagisa? Feel
like emptyin' a few rounds?

393
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,125
[NAGISA laughs sheepishly]

394
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,500
Well then, girls.

395
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,166
Who would we be if we didn't
make the most of things?

396
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,875
Yay! Let's have fun!

00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,458
Y'know. I'm finally
feeling up to a little dip.

399
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,125
Was that under
your uniform?

400
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,666
No one told me!

401
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,583

You can run, but you can't hide!

[KORO-SENSEI] Yay! Splash
attack! Me, too! Me, too!

405
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,708
[HINANO]
Okay!

406
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Actually, never mind!

407
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,916
Terrible idea! Thank you, no!

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,750
--Aw.
--Well there goes that.

409
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,833
[OKAJIMA] Yes! This is
what I'm talkin' about!

00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,500
This is how it should be!

--[NAKAMURA] Oh, shrinkage.

00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,666
[KORO-SENSEI] Don't forget:
there's a fireworks display

414
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,291
after this! We don't
want to miss it!

415
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,625
We have to keep
to the itinerary!

416
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,000
'Course that didn't work.

00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,416
Is that it, sir?

418
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,000
Should we pack in our demolition
equipment and head out?

419
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,875
Yeah. Might as well.

420
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,833

So, that's how it is, huh?

too good to include me

on your day at the beach?
A girl's got feelings, you know!

423
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,416
I thought we were friends!

424
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,791
Is that a bikini?

425
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:31,958
Or a cry for help?

426
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,500
Ugh! Shut your pie-holes!

427
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,541
Hey let's ditch the
brats, yeah? Just us?

428
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,333
I saw this adorable
little spot up the way

--that's nice and private--
--I'd rather not.

Just when we start thinkin'
you're not a bitch.

Don't even go there! Ah!

Yep, we're assassins.
And our target?

00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,458
Our teacher.

440
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,625
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]
All right, people.

441
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,916
Let's get started, shall we?

442
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,125
If you thought the
first term was a doozy,

in store this time around!
