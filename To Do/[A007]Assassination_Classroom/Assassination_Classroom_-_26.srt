1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,791
[NAGISA] Itona's tried
to kill Koro-sensei

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,541
a total of three times.

3
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:12,791
It took some convincing,

4
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,791
but in the end he finally
joined our class.

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:19,375
And so, about a week later...

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,458
[KORO-SENSEI] Well that just
about does it, boys and girls.

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,916
See you tomorrow.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,750
Payday today, at long last,
so I'll be treating myself

9
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,083
to some mouthwatering
Shanghai crab.

10
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,625
Yi, er, san, GO!

11
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,333
[MEG]
You could treat us to some.

12
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,625
[MAEHARA sighs]

13
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,708
Is it me or has our
workload gotten crazy hard

14
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,083
now that it's second term?

15
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,541
Yeah, well you can't
exactly blame Koro-sensei

16
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:40,958
for trying to get our grades up.

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,458
Guess not.

18
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,916
It's just that it's been forever
since I picked up a chick.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,541
[chuckles]

20
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,208
[NAGISA] Hey, Itona. Are
you stickin' around? Hm?

21
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,833
What'cha working on there?

22
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,625
What's it look like I'm doing?

23
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,750
I'm building a
remote-control tank.

24
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,625
[NAGISA]
How come?

25
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,166
[ITONA] The Octopus. He made
me cram all day yesterday.

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,541
Stressed me out.

27
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:12,166
[KORO-SENSEI] Focus on the
material, please. Next question.

28
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,416
[ITONA] I'm pissed. So I'm
gonna use this to kill him.

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,833
It's like the idiot said.
What's his name? Terasaka.

30
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,916
If I fail a hundred times,
so be it. Who cares?

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,166
Only gotta kill the
task master once.

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,000
Good way of lookin' at it.

33
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,791
Wow, this stuff, it's,
like, stupid high tech.

34
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,458
[MAEHARA]
I mean, is it even for real?

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,250
Kudos.

36
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,791
This puppy's using modified
camera phone parts.

37
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,416
[ISOGAI]
Wow, Itona.

38
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,125
You came up with all
these tweaks yourself?

39
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,875
It's not really a big deal.

40
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,791
I picked up electronics
workin' for my old man.

41
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,666
Anybody could do this
stuff. Except Terasaka.

42
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,791
[TERASAKA grunts]

43
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,250
[NAGISA]
What a change.

44
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,875
Compared to how he was when
he had tentacles, I mean.

45
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,875
Still has a sharp
tongue, though.

46
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,666
[STUDENTS gasping, chuckling]

47
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,666
[STUDENTS]
Wow.

48
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,916
Are you kidding me?

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,666
That thing barely
even makes a sound.

50
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,375
When it moves or when it shoots.

51
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,541
I used electrical parts
instead of gears.

52
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,291
Noise cancellation is paramount.

53
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,708
[MURAMATSU whistles]

54
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,666
[ITONA] The camera feed is
linked to the controller.

55
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,291
I've got it lined up with
the sights on the main gun.

56
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,958
Wow. Cloak and dagger!

57
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, suppose you
could sneak up on him.

58
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,333
Where're you gonna aim?

59
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,666
[ITONA]
Where else? That's right.

60
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,916
I'll let you guys in on
a little secret, you see.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,666
Koro-sensei has a
single weak spot.

62
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,750
[NAGISA]
This is news to me.

63
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,416
[ITONA]
His heart.

64
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,625
It's located directly
behind that necktie.

65
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,250
If we hit it, we can take
him out in one shot.

66
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,666
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

67
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
No doubt he's telling the others

68
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,041
about my heart this very moment.

69
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,625
Clever child that he is.

70
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,375
Assassination promises
to be a good deal more fun

71
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,583
now that Itona's
thrown into the mix.

72
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,083
I'm thinking this could work.

73
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,166
Yeah. All right.

74
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,416
Let's give 'er a test drive.
Get a feel for how she handles.

75
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
It is better to test it now than
watch it break when we need it.

76
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,333
[OKAJIMA]
Let's make it happen!

77
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,291
[NAKAMURA]
See ya later, Professor Bitch.

78
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,916
[TOKA]
Bye! Have a good one!

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
[IRINA] Straight home, ladies.
No detours, understood?

80
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,291
[HINANO]
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,791
Cool. Snack run?

82
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,208
[HINANO]
Um, yeah!

83
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,583
[TOKA]
Wait. Didn't you just say--?

84
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,833
Do ya see anything?

85
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,916
Not a lot. Ugh, this
camera totally sucks.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,916
Its field of vision
is way too narrow!

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,375
So? It's not the
end of the world.

88
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,875
We'll fit it with a bigger one.

89
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,583
But that would increase the
weight, compromise mobility.

90
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,958
Target acquisition
would be more difficult.

91
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,291
[TAKEBAYASHI]
In that case.

92
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,833
We'll just install
a fisheye lens

93
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,625
on the camera we already have.

94
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,333
[OKAJIMA, MAEHARA]
Takebayashi!

95
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,708
[TAKEBAYASHI]
If we write a program

96
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,041
that can correct image
distortion in the data feed,

97
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,166
even a relatively small lens can
give us a wide field of view.

98
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,458
That's good.

99
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,750
Right. Fisheye lens
with a big viewing angle.

100
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,291
I've got it taken care of.

101
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,458
[TAKEBAYASHI]
Ritsu.

102
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,041
Hello!

103
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,041
[TAKEBAYASHI] Can you build an
image correction program for us?

104
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,583
Of course!

105
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,000
I have no idea what you're using
it for, but I'm on the job!

106
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,333
Takebayashi, you're a genius.

107
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,500
[TAKEBAYASHI chuckles]

108
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,291
[MAEHARA]
We need to be able to record.

109
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,791
[OKAJIMA] Absolutely.

110
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,458
We'll wanna analyze the upgrades
as effectively as we can.

111
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,208
[NAGISA] Weren't we all just put
off by an underwear thief?

112
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,583
[MAEHARA]
In the name of assassination,

113
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,791
onward--! Uh, Prototype Zero!

114
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,416
[STUDENTS grunt]

115
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,625
[KIMURA]
I'll flip it over!

116
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,583
Yeah, sure. Thanks, man!

117
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,458
There's not much in the way of
a suspension system, apparently.

118
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,208
[YOSHIDA]
Leave it to me.

119
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,541
I know a thing or two about
drive mechanics and metalwork.

120
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,416
[OKAJIMA] Doesn't the
paint job on the chassis

121
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,958
stand out like a sore thumb?

122
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,625
[TAKEBAYASHI]
That's combat camouflage.

123
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,375
Unless we want our target seeing
the tank from a mile away,

124
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,250
we need it to blend in
with the school.

125
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,291
[SUGAYA]
I got this.

126
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,125
Classroom camouflage.
Consider it done.

127
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,000
[MAEHARA] We should chart out
the territory at RC scale.

128
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,875
In the name of
better maneuvering...

129
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,791
...I'll draw us a detailed map.

130
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,041
[ISOGAI]
They, uh,

131
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,500
really get into it when
smut's on the line, huh?

132
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,541
[NAGISA]
It's kinda creepy.

133
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,041
[YOSHIDA]
S'up?

134
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,583

I finished it last night.

135

[MURAMATSU]
Oh.

136
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,166
And I made us all breakfast.

137
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,375
[SUGAYA]
Hey. Think it'll stand out now?

138

[ALL gasp]

139
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,166
This is great and all,
guys, but, uh,

140
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,875
you do get that this is for an
assassination plan, right?

141
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,666
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say,
President Poverty. Sure.

142
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,291

Funny how nobody's tardy
on a day like today.

146
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,500
[TAKEBAYASHI]
Ritsu won't boot up

147
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,958
until precisely
eight o'clock.

148
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,666
You see, I didn't want her
to see what we were doing.

149
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,416
[NAGISA]
Oh. Yeah.

150
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,791
[BOYS chattering]

151
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,000
Step aside! I wanna take a shot!

152
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,916
[NAGISA] Turns out there
was no reason to worry

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,833
whether Itona would
fit in with us.

154
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,750
He did better than
most, actually.

155
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,208
[NAGISA]
Smut, killing, making stuff.

156
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,291
Talk about hitting all
the right buttons.

157
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,625
All of a sudden, he was
the center of attention.

158
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,833
Itona. This thing should
have a codename.

159
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,208
Seems only fair it
should come from you.

160
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,166
I'll give it some thought.

161
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,583
[ITONA] The tentacles once
asked me what kind of person

162
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,666
I wanted to be.

163
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,416
I told them I wanted
to be strong.

164
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,333
Soon, that was all
I could think about.

165
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:52,500
My mind raced with images
of fighting, winning.

166
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,916
[ITONA'S FATHER]
Over time, you can spin

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,416
even the weakest material
into good, strong thread.

168
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,666
"Itona" means "becoming thread,"
you know. Remember that.

169
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,000
[ITONA]
How did I forget my roots?

170
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,708
It's in my name.

171
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,541
[MAEHARA]
Aw, dammit! It crashed.

172
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,916
Watch what you're
doin', Terasaka.

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,458
[TERASAKA]
Shut up! It's not my fault...

174
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,291
[ITONA]
"Becoming thread."

175
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,875
This is where I'm finally
gonna live up to it.

176
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,041
It's a monster!

177
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,916
--[SUGAYA] Pull out!
--[MAEHARA] No, fire!

178
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,666
[OKAJIMA] Crap! The main
gun's not strong enough!

179
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,708
[MAEHARA] It's okay.
We'll tweak that, too!

180
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,875
[BOYS screaming]

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,291
Well, damn. Outdone by a
squirrelly little weasel.

182
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,583
Next time, we need to
designate who's what.

183
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,708
Which means, first off,
we need a gunner. Chiba?

184
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,541
Yeah. Sure.

185
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,291
It's all right. Screw-ups
are a part of the process.

186
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,375
[ITONA] We all agree
Itona One was a dud.

187
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,333
So, we'll just keep spinning
till it's gets stronger.

188
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,125
I might fail a hundred times.

189
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,375
But I'll be sure to kill him
before it's all said and done.

190
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,541
You've got my back, right, guys?

191
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,291
'Course we do!

192
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,958
[NAGISA]
Nothing binds like bloodlust.

193
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,250
I think this is going to be fun!

194
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,708
Okay! Back to the
drawing board, men!

195
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,916
We put our heads together,

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,750
this baby'll be lookin'
up skirts by March!

197
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,208
[NAGISA]
When did that become the goal?

198
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,333
Uh, what's all this
I hear about skirts?

199
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,791
Kataoka, it's not
what you think!

200
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,541
We were talking about the kind
of skirts you put on cars!

201
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,625
[OKANO]
Yeah, sure.

202
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,000
[TOKA]
Boys suck.

203
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,750
[MEG] Uh-huh. And who's
big idea was this?

204
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,583
Itona, perhaps you'd
care to tell me?

205
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,666
Okajima.

206
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,791
[OKAJIMA]
What?

207
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,833
Ah! Good morning, everybody!

208
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,625
Oh, hey, Okajima, about
that program you wanted

209
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,708
for correcting fisheye
lens distortion,

210
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,291
I finally have it ready.

211
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,916
Hang on. It wasn't me,
all right? Tell 'em!

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,958
Tell 'em what? Don't try to
pull me into this, ya perv.

213
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,708
[OKAJIMA]
You have got to be kidding me!

214
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,208
Guys, we really oughta 'fess up.

215
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,708
Whether you do or don't,

216
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,750
it's clear you're all involved
in this disgusting scheme!

217
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,083
[ALL]
Boys make me wanna puke!

218
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,625
[KARMA]
What's going on in here?

219
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,875
Why don't we just call
it a crime of passion.

220
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,625
[ALL chattering]

221
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:22,000
So it's true. Boys really do
only think about one thing.

222
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,583
Karma, I'm gonna
ditch class today.

223
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,916
Where's a good spot to go?

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,833
Wow, so you can talk. Follow me.

225
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,125
[OKAJIMA, MAEHARA]
Hey! Where you goin'? Hold on!

226
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,416
[NAGISA] Apparently, Itona's a
cooler customer than we thought.

227
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,666
[KAEDE] Huh. So that's what
"Itona" means in kanji.

228
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,500
Well, I think it's awesome!

229
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,416
Yeah!

230
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,750
"Becoming thread." Pretty cool.

231
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,625
It is what it is. Lots of kids
in the class have weird names.

232
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,541
[sighs]

233
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,000
[KAEDE]
Hang on a sec!

234
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:02,333
"Justice"? I thought your
name was "Masayoshi."

235
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,083
Yeah, if you write
it out in kanji,

236
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,541
but my parents insist
on saying "Justice."

237
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,833
Koro-sensei's just nice
enough to say it my way.

238
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,375
When they called you
at opening ceremonies,

239
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,375
I got nervous hearing
them yell "Justice."

240
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,125
[OKAJIMA]
Yeah, no kidding.

241
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,500
I know. And when they do it
again at closing ceremonies,

242
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,833
it'll be even more
public humiliation.

243
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,958
[NAGISA] Kimura's parents
are both in law enforcement.

244
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,375
Apparently they're very
passionate about the fact

245
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,875
that they're cops.

246
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,833
When I was a kid, I'd complain
about having a weird name,

247
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,583
but mom and dad would
just get all upset at me.

248
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,583
They didn't put a whole lotta
thought into the kind of hell

249
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,166
they were setting me up for
once I started going to school.

250
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,208
You can't expect parents to have
your best interests at heart.

251
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,083
Does a cute name like "Kirara"
go with this face? Seriously?

252
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,500
My name makes me sound
like a sparkly princess.

253
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,958
[KIMURA]
I-I... yeah.

254
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,208
[KIRARA] My mom lives in her
own little fantasy world.

255
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,500
When the least little thing
threatens to break the illusion,

256
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,875
she goes into
full-blown hysterics.

257
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,916
You have any idea what it's lik
growing up in a house like that?

258
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,791
Well it doesn't make living up
to a ridiculously adorable name

259
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,000
any easier.

260
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,208
Getting' saddled
with a weird name?

261
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,500
How do you poor
bastards manage to cope?

262
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,583
[KARMA]
What? Oh, c'mon.

263
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,583
What's not to love about
being named Karma?

264
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,416
Both of my parents have
pretty bizarre taste,

265
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,416
and I guess I inherited
that from 'em.

266
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Come to think of it,

267
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,166
I'm far from satisfied
with my name.

268
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,000
Hang on, I thought you liked
being called Koro-sensei.

269
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,833
Kayano gave you that
name, didn't she?

270
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,708
[KORO-SENSEI] It's because I
like it that I'm not satisfied.

271
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,125
There happen to be two
people in this very room

272
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,416
who refuse to address
me accordingly.

273
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,333
At best, Mr. Karasuma talks
to me using nothing but,

274
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,958
"Hey. Hey, you."

275
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,958
What are we, a
middle-aged couple?

276
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,083
[IRINA]
We're adults.

277
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,375
We don't say things
like "Koro-sensei"

278
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,166
because it makes us
sound like idiots.

279
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,666
Here's a thought.

280
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,666
We could call each other by
specially chosen code names,

281
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,375
couldn't we?

282
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,541
Are you serious?

283
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,916
Yeah!

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,333
I mean, codenames are
actually kind of appropriate

285
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,875
for this classroom.

286
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,833
The assassins we met on the
island all had one, remember?

287
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,291
They used them to keep
their real names a secret.

288
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,791
Personally, I think
it made them sound

289
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,291
really polished
and professional.

290
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,250
[KORO-SENSEI] Yes, of course.
That's an excellent idea!

291
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,083
Here's what we'll do, then.

292
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,541
Write down a suggested codename

293
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,875
for each of your classmates
and place them in the box.

294
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,000
We'll call each other by
whatever codenames I draw out.

295
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,958
Sounds like fun, but won't we
have to do separate drawings?

296
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,625
I'm writing down the first
thing that pops in my head.

297
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,083
[KIRARA chuckling]

298
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Also, I should mention this.

299
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,583
For the rest of the day,
real names are forbidden!

300
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,916
[STUDENTS]
What?

301
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,833
[SUGAYA] Baseball Geek.
Come in, Baseball Geek!

302
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,750
Can we confirm that the
target's on the move?

303
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,958
Sorry, Lanky Artist,
that'd be a negative.

304
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,291
Codename Da Densest is still
hiding out there somewhere

305
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,708
in the pine trees.

306
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,833
President Poverty's team
will come up from the rear

307
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,666
and chase him toward the swamp.

308
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,791
When he's out in the open,

309
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,666
Hot-n'-Cold Sniper
will take the shot.

310
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,541
[MAEHARA]
All right. Let's do this!

311
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,875
[KARASUMA]
Congratulations!

312
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,416
You just let your target
slip away from the scene.

313
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,291
Shape up, Womanizing Scumbag!

314
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,041
I told you! Always hold
your gun at firing height!

315
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,750
I'm not letting you get away!

316
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,041
Director Mushroom! Mistress
Kanzaki! Fluffy Stag Beetle!

317
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,416
He's headed your way!

318
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,958
Don't worry, we've got him!

319
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,250
[gasps] He pulled a fast one!

320
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,833
[TERASAKA] Home Plate!
Loofah! Picture-Book Graduate!

321
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,458
I'm on it!

322
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,875
[TERASAKA chuckles]

323
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,458
[TERASAKA] That's right,
keep those eyes on the ground.

324
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,666
[KARASUMA]
Nicely done, Pseudo-Takaoka.

325
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,875
Don't get comfortable!

326
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,041
Scoring a hit on me
doesn't mean anything.

327
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,833
It certainly doesn't mean
you can get him!

328
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,750
Poison Specs! Forever Flat!

329
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,666
If I can see your positions,
I can dodge your shots!

330
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,208
[gasps] He spotted us.
Dignified Didact, take over!

331
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,500
All right!

332
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,041
English Lass, Gender!
You two get a move on!

333
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,291
[BOTH]
Roger, that!

334
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,833
[KARASUMA]
Nice shooting.

335
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,375
They didn't give
away their position.

336
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,041
That has to be thanks to
Dignified Didact's leadership.

337
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,916
Keep your distance back there.
Wait for your chance.

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,041
Terminal Perv and This Manga is
Amazing aren't too bad, either.

339
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,958
[ISOGAI] Semi-Senioritis has
blocked the escape route.

340
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,333
It's all on you now,
Dating Sim Emo Character.

341
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,041
[gunshot]

342
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,666
[gasps]

343
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,125
Dating Sim Emo Character!

344
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,041
I told you, a sniper has
to assume his target

345
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,416
is always on high alert!

346
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,791
[RYUNOSUKE] I know, but
the one taking you down...

347
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,416
[RYUNOSUKE]
...is Justice!

348
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,250
[gunshots]

349
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,541
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

350
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
How'd it go?

351
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,750
Using those codenames
felt pretty great, huh?

352
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,625
[STUDENTS]
Actually, it was kinda painful.

353
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,916
[TOKA]
"Scrunchies and Boobs"? Really?

354
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
[OKANO] Try being called
"Amazing Ape" all day.

355
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah, yes. Well, I see.

356
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,666
Could someone explain
what "Box o' Moe" means?

357
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,708
Uh, isn't it pretty obvious?

358
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,875
Excuse me, sir?

359
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yeah?

360
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,791
My codename was just the
same thing as my real one.

361
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Correct.

362
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,958
Because I knew what
you'd be doing in P.E.

363
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,500
Given your agility,

364
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,291
it was all but certain you'd
have a special role to play.

365
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,458
And considering the moves
you showcased out there

366
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,708
this afternoon, I'd say
"Justice" fits perfectly.

367
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,000
You bet it does!

368
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,583
[KIMURA groans]

369
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,375
[KORO-SENSEI] Now, now.
Rest assured, Kimura my boy.

370
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,541
If you don't like it,

371
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,500
requesting a name change
is simply a matter

372
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,125
of filling out the
right paperwork.

373
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,833
Yeah, I guess you're right.

374
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,125
[KORO-SENSEI] You should
bear in mind, however.

375
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,333
If you wind up being the one
to actually assassinate me,

376
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,500
I'm certain people are
going to be quite gracious

377
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,666
about your name.

378
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,750
"Justice indeed," they'll say.

379
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,416
"Why, what else do
you call the man

380
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,000
who saved the entire world, eh?'

381
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,500
Honestly there's very little
significance to the names

382
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,583
our parents give us.

383
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,958
[BOTH chuckle]

384
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,625
[KORO-SENSEI] We don't choose
what we're called,

385
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,041
but we can choose what people
come to associate with it.

386
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,791
Names don't make us who we are.

387
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,708
They're merely part of
what we leave behind

388
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,125
as we walk through life.

389
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,750
Footprints in the sand.

390
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,583
That said, cherish them.

391
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,125
If nothing else,
for their potential.

392
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:11,583
"Justice," for example.

393
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,166
Why not hold on to that until
after the assassination?

394
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,166
What do you say?

395
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,208
[KIMURA]
Hmm...

396
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah! I think I will.

397
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Now then!

398
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,916
Since everyone got to use
their codename today,

399
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,125
it's only fair that
I divulge my own.

400
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,833
From this point forward,
kindly refer to me as follows:

401
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,583
"Prince of the Fateful
Eternal Wind."

402
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,500
[SUGINO] Why do you get to pick
one that's all fancy-schmancy?

403
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,208
[TOKA] And wipe that
smug look off your face!

404
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,250
[KORO-SENSEI] Aw, c'mon!
Just for one day, then! Please?

405
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,833
[NAGISA]
And for the rest of the day,

406
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,208
Koro-sensei was referred to
by a very different name.

407
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,458
[STUDENTS] "The Octopus of
the Idiotic Perverted Chicken!"

408
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Octopus?!

409
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,875
Well, that was fun.

410
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,916
[NAGISA]
The codename thing was a blast!

411
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,833
Maybe he'll let us
do it again sometime.

412
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,833
Hope so. Right,
Picture-Book Graduate?

413
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,708
Shut your face, Baseball Geek.

414
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,583
[SUGINO chuckles]

415
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,000
Call the burn unit!

416
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,875
My codename doesn't
even make sense.

417
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,833
Yeah! And while we're at it,

418
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,000
who's brilliant idea
was "Forever Flat?"

419
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,083
Like that means anything!

420
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,250
[MURAMATSU whistling]

421
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,458
So it was you.

422
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,750
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

423
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:29,083
Hey, I could go for a bowl of
that disgusting ramen. Let's go.

424
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,458
Not cool, man.

425
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,875
He's fittin' in with
Terasaka's group pretty well.

426
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,916
Sure looks like it.

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,875
[NAGISA]
And so time marched on,

428
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,708
all of us determined to give
Second Term everything we had.

429
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,791
Of course, being E-Class,
it was more or less a given

430
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,125
that the good times
wouldn't last forever.

431
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,541
[ASANO] Dare I ask how
things are coming along?

432
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,875
Of course, I trust you realize
any response short of

433
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,791
"exceptionally well" would be
unacceptable for A-Class.

434
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,125
[GAKUSHU] Things are
going exceptionally well.

435
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,333
Any student who lags behind
gets left behind. Period.

436
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,750
I have no patience
for slackers.

437
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,083
None. I rule with an iron fist.

438
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,916
And when it comes to midterms,
the bar has been raised.

439
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,041
[ASANO]
That is encouraging.

440
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,250
However, it appears you
are still the subject

441
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,333
of much derision
among the student body.

442
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,708
Letting E-Class get the better
of you in the First Term.

443
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,291
It's not a stain
that washes out.

444
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,333
[GAKUSHU gasps]

445
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,458
[GAKUSHU] Let people say what
they like. I'll crush them!

446
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,708
[ASANO]
Will you now?

447
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,208
At its most basic,
this institution

448
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,958
is divided into two groups:
The weak and the strong.

449
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,791
Which group you belong
to is, on principle,

450
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,583
of no consequence to me.

451
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,541
[ASANO]
That being said,

452
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,000
allow me to offer
you a little guidance.

453
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,041
True leadership requires
an aptitude for winning.

454
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,083
And on top of that...

455
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,375
...to triumph, a leader
must first consider

456
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,375
the where and when,
and the how soon will follow.

457
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,958
Should a loophole
present itself,

458
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,666
it is to be exploited
mercilessly.

459
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,583
[ASANO]
Good word, "aptitude."

460
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,166
Something without which you
haven't a prayer in the world

461
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,833
of besting me, Asano.

462
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,375
[GAKUSHU]
Very well.

463
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:29,541
Then my aptitude will be on full
display, Mr. Principal, sir.
