00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,583
Right now we're two to one.

175
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,708
Who got it for Science? Okuda?

176
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,791
[KORO-SENSEI] First in E Class
for Science is... Manami Okuda!

177
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,541
And...

178
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,833
Outstanding! You're also
first for the grade!

[STUDENTS cheering]

180
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,583
Yes! Three to one, guys!

181
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,500
[MIMURA] Do we even need
to hear who won for Math?

182
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,916
E Class killed it! No question!

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,916
[STUDENTS]
Hooray!

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,166
[OKAJIMA]
Nice goin', Okuda! Yeah!

185
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,750
Girl, that tentacle is
yours. You earned it!

186
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,291
Yes! Now A Class has to do
whatever we tell them!

187
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,666
Yeah they do!

188
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,083
Which just leaves Mathematics.

[STUDENTS chattering]

190
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,833
[KOYAMA] We're three and two
across all five subjects.

191
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,791
The Untouchables handed us our
asses. This is it. We're dead.

192
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,000
We still beat 'em on overall
scores. Don't be a wuss.

193
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,083
Could've been a lot worse.
What are they gonna do?

194
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,541
[KOYAMA]
Eh.

195
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,666
Yeah, 'least the jackass who
stole fourth place from me

196

is choking on humble pie.
Ha! Cocky little bastard!

197
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,791
Talk about brining
a knife to a gun fight.

198
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,625
Guy didn't even compete!

199
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Never underestimate your target.

200
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,833
Particularly when
it has a monopoly

201
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,833
on grade point averages.

202
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,875
The best scores in E Class went
to Katakoa and Takebayashi,

203
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,291
both admirably tied
for seventh place.

204
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,583
Not surprising.
They studied hard.

205
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,958
As, of course, did your
opponents in A Class,

206
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,541
which is to be expected.

207
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,583
These finals were
nothing to sneeze at.

208
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,750
One's only chance was to study.

209
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,750
[KARMA] What're you
tryin' to say, Teach?

210
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Someone thought
they could coast by on luck

211
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,583
and a devil-may-care attitude,

212
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,583
and proceeded to
royally screw it up.

213
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:41,125
[ASANO] "My congratulations to
you on retaining the top rank."

214
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,791
Or so I'd like to say.

215
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,250
Would in fact be saying if
not for your idiotic wager.

216
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:50,125
Instead, let me offer
my condolences.

217
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,541
Indeed, it must be
quite devastating

218
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,875
to realize your loss made
you the laughingstock

219
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,583
of the entire school.
What a pickle you're in.

220
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:02,625
Shall I step in
on my son's behalf?

221
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,916
Thanks, but no.

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,583
[ASANO]
Have it your way.

223
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,666
What was that you said
about finding myself

224
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,208
at the end of a leash?

225
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,041
You'd hoped to finagle E Class
into divulging my secrets,

226
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,166
didn't you?

227
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,958
They aren't yours to find, boy.

228
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,625
I won't be ensnared by a whelp

229
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,958

against his peers.

[ASANO grunts]

231
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,583
[KORO-SENSEI] Three of your
classmates each have a claim

232
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,875
to one of my tentacles:
Nakamura, Isogai, and Okuda.

233
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,833
You, on the other
hand, have nothing.

234
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,875
Which is only fair, as that's
exactly what your carefree,

235
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,541
non-committal attitude has
contributed to the cause.

236
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,875
See where I'm going with this?

237
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,583
Those who fail to apply
themselves,

238
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,583
who, at the moment of
truth, decide to sit back

239
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,208
and let the chips
fall where they may,

240
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,625
are destined for disappointment.

241
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,666
Dull is the blade
of the lazy assassin.

242
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,375
In fact, I wouldn't stoop to
call him an assassin at all.

243
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,166
A blowhard and
a braggart, perhaps.

244
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,875
But an assassin? I think not.

245
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,875
[KARASUMA]
Hey.

246
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,541
You think that was a bit harsh?

247
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Of course. It had to be.

248
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,916
I cut him down so
he'll spring back up.

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,708
The boy's enormously talented.

250
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,958
There's no denying that,
but he's a novice.

251
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,083
He has not yet learned how
to be worthy of that talent.

252
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,458
He refuses to meet any challenge
except on his own terms.

253
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,875
He doesn't see the
true value of competition.

254
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,625
To a young person for whom
everything comes easily,

255
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,291
the pang of defeat can be
a much-needed wake up call.

256
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,583
On the surface,

257
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,541
the whole concept of exams
may seem arbitrary,

258
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,750
but deep down,
it's not about grades.

259
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,666
It's about rising
to the occasion.

260
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,666
It's about tasting
the rapture in triumph

261
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,583
and disgrace of failure.

262
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,208
They go hand in hand, you see.

263
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,041
One is meaningless
without the other.

264
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,583
To win, one has to lose.

265
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,666
The difference between
the novice and the master

266
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,833
is that the master
has failed more times

267
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,125
than the novice has tried.

a tad sketchy.

only havin' three spots?

279
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh. I believe all subjects

280
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,458
have been accounted for.

on the finals, it counts.

The idiot pulled his weight.

289

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,875
Wow. That was just plain rude.

00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,375
You ask me,

294
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,166
Home Ec is straight-up one
of the most important classes.

to cheat! C'mon, be a man!

And all four of 'em
got top score!

Oh, Koro-sensei?

302
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,500
We put our heads together
and got this idea.

303
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,083
See, we were all thinkin'.

304
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,125
We could use our wager with A
Class to kinda sweeten the pot.

Nani?

The last day of school

307

is always marked by
a big assembly.

some unfinished business.

Well if ain't Mr. Big Man
on Campus himself!

[GAKUSHU] Pardon me. Some of
us have a ceremony to get to.

Not so fast there, slick.
What's the big rush?

315
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,666
[ISOGAI] We had a bet.
And last I checked, you lost.

316
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,583
We don't wanna rub your faces
in it, that's just how it is.

317
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,458
Our demand was sent
to you via email.

318
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,916
I assume you can
make that happen.

[TERASAKA]
If you even try to play

320
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,708
like none of this was
for real, that's it.

321
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,041
We'll throw in Home Ec.

322

with you in that, too.

Oh, wait a second, never
mind. Yeah they are.

[IRINA] Those kids
got the better of you.

326
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,541
It's gotta string a little.

327
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Let's be honest,

328
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,333
the Home Ec argument was
splitting hairs, but so be it.

329
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm honestly glad.

330
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,833
Sure, no accredited
university devotes space

331
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,916
to Home Ec on their
entrance exams,

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,375
but that means Home Ec
teachers have more freedom

333
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,291
to create an exam based
on personal taste.

334
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,375
Preparing for
something that arbitrary

335
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,500
is a near impossible feat.

336
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,708
The limits those

the tiniest of loopholes
just to make headway.

341
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,166
Seasoned assassins could take
a page from their book.

342
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,750
[IRINA]
Hmm.

343
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,791
You're so sweet.

344
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,166
Why couldn't we go
the assembly again?

345
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mr. Karasuma said our presence

346
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,791
would be a distraction.

347
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,958
[IRINA]
Ugh. Yours maybe, Calamari.

348
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yours more likely... bitch.

349
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,250
[ISOGAI]
Karma!

350
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,625
Surprised to see you here.

351
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,250
Since when do you make
time for stuff like this?

352
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,416
Not big deal, man.

353
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,833
If I didn't put
in an appearance,

354
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,750
everyone'd think
I was running away.

355
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,833
[ISOGAI]
Hm?

356
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,041
Yeah, you should
check it out sometime.

357
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,291
It sounds interesting-- Uh?

358
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,625
Not to be that guy.
But Ritsu's stand-in

359
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,750
is giving me a serious
case of the willies, sir.

360
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,291
Suck it up, soldier.

361
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,791
We can't afford to have the real
thing exposed as a machine.

362
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,416
Her stand-in is my immediate
supervisor's daughter,

363
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,458
so ease up.

364
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,333
Kid knows how to keep a secret.

365
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,500
Her father agreed to this

366
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,708
because Ritsu's tutoring
got her grades up.

367
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,625
No offense, but she's been
hovering 'round me since finals.

368
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,000
I mean she's nice,

369
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,875
but she's definitely the
reason I came in dead last.

370
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,916
[KARASUMA]
Dead last in E Class, he means.

371
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,375
Which is still around
average for the whole grade.

372
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,666
Who would've thought?

373
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,791
He's come a long way
from the bottom.

374
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,666
[DEAN] Vacation is no
excuse for becoming lazy.

375
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,708
Uh... You, uh. Hmm.

376
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,500
A few months of fun in the sun
isn't worth landing in E Class.

377
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,125
[NAGISA]
His usual pot shots are bombing.

378
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:15,583
We're kinda hard to use as
a negative example now, huh?

379
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,875
Too bad Koro-sensei's not here.

380
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,750
He's the whole the reason
we're standing tall.

381
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,625
[ASANO]
The term comes to a close

382
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,416
with E Class more
aware of their potential.

383
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,583
The whole school is more aware.

384
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,833
The winds of change
are stirring,

385
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,625
fanning the flames of rebellion.

386
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,250
And here we stand, the Earth's
very survival in question.

387
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,541
All in all, my teaching methods
function as they always have,

388
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,250
like a well-oiled machine.

389
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,583
And yet, the underdogs threaten
to become an inspiration.

390
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,416
A beacon.

391
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,666
Absolutely unacceptable.

392
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
One guidebook for each of you.

393
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,791
Doesn't really get how
to sum things up, does he?

394
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,750
Feels like I'm
playing an accordion.

395
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,166
[KORO-SENSEI] These barely
begin to scratch the surface.

396
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,416
The irresistible siren-songs
of Summer are beyond count.

397
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,208
Now, then. As we plunge headlong
into the break, remember this.

398
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,375
A certain main event is
just around the corner.

399
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,500
Yeah. Trust us, Teach,
no one's gonna forget that.

400
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Every year, this little event

401
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,166
is a privilege reserved
for the students

402
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,083
with the highest
scores on the finals.

403
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,250
That is to say: A Class.

404
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,833
This time around, however,

405
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,583
A and E Class were neck-and-neck
at the top fiftieth percentile.

406
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:41,333
So, I'm proud to say, you boys
and girls more than qualify.

407
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,958
For the Kunugigaoka Junior
High Summer Special Course

408
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,541
in Okinawa!

409
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,875
Three whole days at one of the
finest resorts on the island!

410
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,208
[STUDENTS cheering]

411
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,750
[SEO]
Who even cares?

412
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,125
So they get to go to Okinawa.
Big deal. It's a local trip.

413
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,416
[STUDENT F] You were supposed
to represent and you choked!

414
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,791
[STUDENT G]
Assholes!

415
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,416
[STUDENT E] Asano's the only
one of you worth a damn!

416
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,375
[GAKUSHU]
Everyone shut up.

417
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,541
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

418
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,375
[GAKUSHU]
We lost. That's the end of it.

419
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,333
At least have the self-respect
to be graceful in defeat.

420
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,583
[GAKUSHU]
Heads will roll for this.

421
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,916
And E Class's necks will the
first on the chopping block.

422
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,250
Followed by my father.

423
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
So, then. What will it be?

424
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,041
Well, we've decided we'd like

425
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,166
to cash-in our tentacle freebie
options during Summer camp.

426
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Very good.

427
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,958
Seven tentacles will
present a major handicap.

428
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,333
But that's not all!

429
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,958
Anything about Okinawa
strike you as advantageous?

430
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:42,000
Perhaps the fact that it's an
island, surround by water.

431
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,666
I'll be honest
with you, children.

432
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,333
Koro-sensei is more
than a wee bit nervous.

433
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,958
As you know, I've already
handed out the report cards

434
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,500
for you to show your parents.

435
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,875
But these are the report cards
specifically for assassins.

436
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,833
[NAGISA] Double circles
for the entire class.

437
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,083
The highest score possible.

438
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,208
Given to us by our target.

439
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,375
[KORO-SENSEI] You've become
a formidable bunch.

440
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,750
You should be proud.

441
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,958
The first term has been
all about the basics,

442
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,333
which you've mastered.

443
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,333
But now, we're gonna
step things up!

444
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,750
First term is over!

445
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,541
Let the Assassination Classroom
Summer Vacation begin!

446
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,500
Time for a little R &amp; R,
a little supplemental study,

447
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,583
and a lotta killing!
