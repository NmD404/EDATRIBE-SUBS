Ah, well. A cross-section of

[HAYAMI] Damn it! I was
aiming for his gun.

[GASTRO] What the hell?
They've got live ammo?

That's the sound of one

These aren't just
junior high kids.

[GASTRO] I never forget
an enemy's position

once they've fired.
Acquired that trick in the army.

Think of it as
battlefield synesthesia.

I can echo-locate the source
of hostile gunfire with

check my own gun by taste.

I think, be quite enough.

but you needn't bear
the pressure on your own.

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,916
If you miss the shot,
there's a fallback strategy.

We'll play hot

has no idea where the
next shot will come from.

108

The reason that
strategy will work

109
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,958
is because everyone here has
tasted the agony of defeat.

00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,625
above is not attuned
to his resources.

170
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,541
In fact, thus far
his hired hands

171
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,375
have been egregiously misused.

172
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,625
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

173
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Lookouts? Glorified bouncers?

174
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,208
This isn't how one
employs assassins.

175
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,125
If our foe had aligned
the men we've encountered

176
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,833
with their skill set, they'd
have been fearsome indeed.

177
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,375
You've got a point.

178
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,250
The last guy wasn't off target
by so much as a centimeter.

179
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
And consider Karma's opponent.

180
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,166
Normally, the man would've
simply snuck up behind him

181
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,291
and crushed his windpipe

182
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,000
before we even knew
of his existence.

183
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,375
[KARMA]
No doubt. Sure.

184
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,583
[KARASUMA] Of course.
Why didn't I see it before?

185
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,541
The mastermind doesn't
think like an assassin

186
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,666
because he isn't one.

187
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,083
[KARASUMA]
All right. New plan.

188
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,291
First off: Isogai, Terasaka,
Yoshida, I want...

189
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,541
[TERASAKA]
What's your deal?

190
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,708
[NAGISA] Dude, you're
seriously burning up.

191
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,708
You feeling okay? Wait...!

192
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,958
[TERASAKA]
Shut up! I'm fine. Look, man.

193
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,416
I've got stamina to spare.
It's just a fever.

194
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,458
My system will kick it out.

195
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,958
But the virus is deadly!

196
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,333
Damn it, Mr. K almost
died 'cause of me!

197
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,875
If I hadn't been an idiot,
he wouldn't have gotten gassed.

198
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,708
And in case you haven't
been keepin' score,

199
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,375
that's not the first
crap I've pulled that

200
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,875
nearly cost every
one their lives.

201
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,250
If I drop out, I'll
bring the mission down.

202
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,041
Who cares if I'm sick?
I'm not gonna do that!

203
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,416
Terasaka, don't!

204
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,125
[TERASAKA]
Watch me.

205
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ooh, namba!

206
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,875
Ninjas are said to have
used this walking style.

207
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,750
I've noticed my students favor
the silent, thoughtful approach

208
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,625
to killing these days over
the more abrupt methods.

209
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,166
Look at them now.

210
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,916
Despite the time crunch, they
stubbornly refuse to panic.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,250
I'm so indescribably proud!

212
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Whoever we're about to face,

213
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,500
my students will certainly
give them more

214
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,250
than they bargained for!

215
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,875
[KARASUMA] Odds are the
antidote's in the case.

216
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,208
And that the case is rigged
with plastic explosives.

217
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,458
[KARASUMA]
We're right on time.

218
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,375
Ideally we'll be able to
take this guy by surprise.

219
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,750
If he spots us, his
first instinct will be

220
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,000
to go for the detonator.

221
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,583
I'll take it upon myself
to shoot him in the arm.

222
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,083
Once that's out of the way,

223
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,958
we'll rush in as a group and
dog-pile the son of a bitch.

224
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:26,833
[KARASUMA]
Now!

225
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,791
[TAKAOKA]
Ugh. This itch.

226
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,625
[NAGISA]
Uh.

227
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,541
[TERASAKA, YOSHIDA]
Uh.

228
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,625
[OKANO, ISOGAI gasp]

229
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,250
It burns no matter what I do.

230
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:37,291
Still, one man's sensitivity is
another man's hyper-vigilance.

231
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:41,291
Makes me feel wired
to my surroundings.

232
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,333
[STUDENTS gasp]

233
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,625
[TAKAOKA] You didn't think
this'd be easy, did you?

234
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,000
I told you I'd find a
way to wipe the octopus

235
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,708
off the face of the earth.
Oh, and as you can see,

236
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,416
when it comes to little details
like detonator switches.

237
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,041
I'm a big believer
in redundancy.

238
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,833
[NAGISA]
We'd heard that voice before.

239
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:04,458
Only now, it sounds even more
sinister than I remember.

240
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,416
[KARASUMA] I reached out to four
professionals before we came

241
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,916
on this trip. Three of
'em freelance killers.

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,500
But, the other was an old
colleague, who, it turns out,

243
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,416
went MIA after embezzling funds
from the Ministry of Defense.

244
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,000
What in the hell do you think
you're doing? Damn it, Takaoka!

245
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:32,125
What naughty children! Trying
to sneak up on dear ol' dad.

246
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:36,625
You disappoint me. I thought
I raised you better than that.

247
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,541
I know some boys and girls

248
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,083
that are going to have
to go to summer school.

249
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,458
[KIMURA, MEG, KAEDE gasp]

250
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:46,500
[NAGISA] Mr. Takaoka.
Buy... how could you?

251
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,375
[TAKAOKA] Let's head
up to the roof, huh?

252
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,000
I've got a little
surprise up there

253
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,958
you're bound to
get a kick out of.

254
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,416
Oh, and before you
get any bright ideas,

255
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,458
bear in mind you're
only alive because

256
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,083
daddy's feeling generous.

257
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,208
[KARASUMA]
Hiring assassins,

258
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,500
infecting students with a
potentially lethal virus.

259
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,833
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you out of your mind?

260
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,791
Strong words, there friend.
I assure you I'm perfectly sane.

261
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,375
Though, I suspect world-saviors
are often thought of as mad.

262
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,125
If you had done as I instructed
and had the runts of the litter

263
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,250
bring the goods on their own,
my assassination plot would've

264
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,500
gone off without a hitch
and we'd all be winners.

265
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,250
I'd wanted to use
what's-her-name.

266
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,791
Kayano? Yeah.

267
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,416
She was integral to the plot.
Oh-ho, and it was a doozy!

268
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,083
The bathtub in my suite
here is overflowing

269
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,416
with anti-Sensei BB's.

270
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,958
I'd've set her up in
there with the target

271
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,083
then entomb the whole
setup in concrete.

272
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,041
The only way for the octopus
to return to his normal form

273
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,000
without touching the
BB's would've been

274
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:57,875
to blow everything sky-high,
including the girl.

275
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,375
We all know he'd never
do such an inhuman thing

276
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,541
to the children in his care!
So, I figured he'd take

277
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,375
the honorable way out
and opt to dissolve

278
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,000
in lieu of killing one
of his students!

279
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,458
[STUDENTS whimper]

280
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,250
[STUDENTS growl]

281
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,791
He's a monster!

282
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,333
[TAKAOKA] I won't lie, it
gave daddy quite a fright

283
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,250
when he saw you'd
all come en masse.

284
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,916
Doesn't change things
much, but still.

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,208
Oh, and my mood will
play a significant role

286
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,625
as to whether you
walk out of this alive.

287
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Intolerable.

288
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,625
You can't really imagine
you'll get away with this.

289
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,833
[TAKAOKA] Actually, I think
there's a pretty decent chance.

290
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,291
Either way, I believe we
can all agree this route's

291
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,583
a hell of a lot more humane

292
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,583
than the treatment I
got from your class!

293
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,166
[COLLEAGUE A]
Did you hear?

294
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,625
Takaoka got his ass handed to
him by a class of junior kids.

295
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,291
[COLLEAGUE B] He blew his
mission after he bragged

296
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,375
about his teaching chops?
Oh, man. That's hilarious.

297
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,791
[COLLEAGUE C]
The higher-ups'll think twice

298
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,541
before they give him
another assignment.

299
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,041
[TAKAOKA]
Now, every time I catch people

300
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,625
lookin' at me sideways.

301
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,541
Every time I think of how you
bluffed me with my own knife,

302
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,250
my skin itches so badly I can't
sleep through the night!

303
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,041
I hope you're proud
boys and girls,

304
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,291
because you've condemned
daddy to hell!

305
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,916
Negative evaluations,
demotions, gossip.

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,666
You have no idea what it's
like! My future is gone.

307
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,333
You specifically,
Nagisa, must answer

308
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,250
for the grave injustice
done to my reputation!

309
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,625
I get it, he asked for the
shortest students to come

310
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,375
because he knew Nagisa
would be one of them.

311
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,291
Nagisa had every right
to do what he did to you!

312
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,875
I see.

313
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,916
So this actually has a lot more
to do with you settling a score

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,875
than anyone saving the
world. Think about it.

315
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,458
Is beating up a kid gonna
repair your self-esteem?

316
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,000
Wouldn't someone my size
be more interesting?

317
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,833
[TERASAKA]
Look, you crazy son of a bitch.

318
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,375
Nagisa kicked your ass
by your own rules,

319
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,666
so you've got no one
to blame but yourself!

320
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,875
And here's the deal.

321
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,583
Even if you'd won,
we'd still despise you!

322
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,375
Nothing you could've done
would've changed our minds!

323
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,791
I don't remember asking
for your opinion!

324
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,541
Love me or hate me, maggots.
I'm the guy that can take

325
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:56,083
half of you out right now
with the push of a button!

326
00:15:56,166 --> 00:16:01,125
Heh. You, Short Round.
Let's go up to heliport.

327
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,791
Just you and me.

328
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:08,333
Don't do it, Nagisa! You
don't have to listen to him!

329
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,416
[NAGISA]
I don't want to. But I'm gonna.

330
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,208
[TAKAOKA] Get a move on!
Pick up the pace!

331
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,750
I'm afraid what'll happen
if I don't do what he says.

332
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,125
I'll play along for now and see

333
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,625
if I can talk some
sense into him.

334
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,291
If he calms down, maybe
he'll give us the antidote.

335
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,750
Please be careful, Nagisa.

336
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,500
[KAEDE] I don't like
where this is going.

[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]

338
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,541
Don't even!

339
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,875
[TAKAOKA] Stay right
where you are, tough guy.

340
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,541
Don't take this
the wrong way,

341
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,791
but I don't trust you not
to throw a monkey wrench

342
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,958
into my alone time Nagisa.

343
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:07,791

[STUDENTS, KARASUMA gasping]

346
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,416
[TAKAOKA] There we go. Now
it's just you and me, kiddo.

347
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,625
You understand where I'm
going with this, right?

348
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,125
[NAGISA]
Uh!

349
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,125
[TAKAOKA] Revenge is an ugly
word, but if the shoe fits.

350
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,166
You've got it wrong,
Mr. Takaoka.

351
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,791
I didn't come here
to relive our fight.

352
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,375
[TAKAOKA]
Course not.

353
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,916
You don't have the element of
surprise on your side this time.

354
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,375
There's not a thing
up your sleeve

355
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,083
to keep me from killing you.

356
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,625
[TAKAOKA]
Thing is, it'd be over too fast

357
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,208
if I went at you full
bore right off the bat.

358
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:53,500
I want to savor this, so
here's what I need from you.

359
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,041
[NAGISA]
Uh...

360
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,541
[STUDENTS gasp]

361
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,625
[TAKAOKA] Get on your hands
and knees... and apologize.

362
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,250
Say you're sorry for
pulling a cheap trick.

363
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,500
Admit you relied on
the ol' bait-and-swith

364
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,000
to cover lack of skill.

365
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,833
I'm, sorry.

366
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,750
I don't believe you!
Kneel down lower,

367
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,333
you little worm!

368
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,416
I wanna see your forehead
touch the ground

369
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,708
like the sole of a boot!

370
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,875
[NAGISA] I'm sorry for pulling
a cheap trick on you.

371
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,583
I just did it to cover up my
lack of skill. I'm very sorry.

372
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,208
[STUDENTS, KARASUMA whimper]

373
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,958
Not bad. Now apologize

374
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,791
for essentially asking me
to hit the road afterwards.

375
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,708
Good gracious, the audacity!

376
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,958
All the trouble I went
through for you kids,

377
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,791
and that's how you talk to me?

378
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,375
I'm entitled to respect
for the sacrifices I made!

379
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,250
I was wrong to treat you that
way. You deserve respect.

380
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,500
I am truly, deeply sorry.

381
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,625
Please find it in your heart
to forgive me. I was wrong.

382
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:10,208
[laughs] I'm starting
to believe you.

383
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,666
Daddy feels much better.
Was that so hard?

384
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,208
You know what this needs,

385
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,541
to help the lesson sink in?
Pictures of people who've died

386
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,791
from the virus I infected
your buddies with.

387
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,500
Smog let me borrow a few
from his collection.

388
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,291
The effects are spectacular!

389
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,208
Boils over every inch
of their bodies,

390
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,708
faces like a bunch of grapes.

391
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,166
You'd get a laugh out of
that, wouldn't you kid?

[NAGISA gasps]

393

Yes! That's the face
I wanted to see!

400
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,083
You know, you should
make a scrapbook

401
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,291
of this vacation including
pictures of your friends dying!

402
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:21,250
You could call it Nagisa's
Book of Boiled Over Faces!

Kill you.

That's right. That's
the way, sonny boy.

Oh, dear.

I'll kill you!
