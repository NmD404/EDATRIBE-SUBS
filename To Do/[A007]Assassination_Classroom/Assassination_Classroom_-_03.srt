--Six! Seven! Eight!
--[KORO-SENSEI] Ahhh...

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,916
The sounds of a
choreographed exercise regimen

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,375
echoing across the fields
on a golden afternoon.

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,625
So peaceful. So militant.

6
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,791
[STUDENTS]
One! Two!

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,125
Make those knives sing.

8
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,083
Treat every move
like a legit kill strike.

9
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,500
[STUDENTS]
Seven! Eight! One!

10
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,666
You're in the way here, pal.
Phys Ed is my department now.

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
But... But I'm lonely.

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,166
Find something else to do
then, like, I don't know.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,208
There's a sandbox.
Have a field day.

14
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,833
[KORO-SENSEI sobs] You don't
have to be so insensitive...

15
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,208
The kids liked it better when
I was their gym coach anyhow.

16
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,333
[sighs]
Yeah, not such much.

17
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,708
No offense or
anything, it's just

18
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,125
when it comes
to exercise, you...

19
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,333
...set the bar kinda high.

20
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,541
[KORO-SENSEI] All right,
let's try a simple jumping

21
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,166
side-to-side maneuver.

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,541
Watch closely and I'll
show you how it's done.

23
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,208
Are you kidding me?!

24
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Once you've got the rhythm,

25
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,041
throw some cat's-cradle
into the mix.

26
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,666
Wow, he is seriously good!

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,416
Like we could keep up with that.

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,666
We're human beings, y'know.

29
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,500
I, for one, think our
coach should be, too.

30
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
[KORO-SENSEI whines, sobs]

31
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,916
[KARASUMA]
Right. Back to work, people.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,708
Can I ask an obvious
question, sir?

33
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,083
If there's an actual point
to this training, should, uh,

34
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,666
should we be practicing
right in front of our target?

35
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,416
Whether killing or studying,
it's the same principle.

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,958
Drill the basics and
they'll serve you well.

37
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,041
[NAGISA]
Okay.

38
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,750
[KARASUMA]
Isogai, Maehara, step up.

39
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,208
I want you to try to
tag me with those knives.

40
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,333
Wait. Like as a team?

41
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,916
Do you think
that's a good idea?

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,166
The blades are harmless.

43
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,583
They weren't designed
to injure human beings.

44
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,916
Tell you what, manage to hit me
and you can go home for the day.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,416
Uh, okay. Well,
here goes nothin'.

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,125
[ISOGAI grunts]

47
00:01:59,208 --> 00:01:59,958
Come on.

[MAEHARA]

51
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,208
[KARASUMA]
See that, kids?

52
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,333
Even with the
bare minimum know-how,

53
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,791
I can practically dodge
their attacks in my sleep.

54
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,083
They've got no technique.

55
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,250
[BOTH growl]

56
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,458

Whoa...

[KARASUMA grunts]

59
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,208
If you can't land a hit
against a guy like me,

60
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,875
you haven't got a prayer
against a target

61
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,625
whose top speed is Mach Twenty.

62
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,875
See?

63
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,541
We've been sparring for
half a minute and look.

64
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,166
He's had time to change
clothes, make tea,

65
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,416
and build a model
of Osaka Castle.

66
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,125
[MAEHARA]
That is so irritating!

67
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,375
[KARASUMA]
That's why we drill.

68
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,291
When the whole class can
hit me, you have a shot.

69
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,708
Do what I tell you as
often as I tell you to do it,

70
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,791
you'll become assassins.

71
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,333
This isn't recess, kids.

72
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,958
From now on, gym class
will be about the basics.

73
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,000
Stabbing correct
use of firearms,

74
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,500
everything
you need to succeed.

75
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,791
Wow. Okay.

76
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,333
[KARASUMA] All right.
That oughta do it for today.

77
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,833
[STUDENTS]
Thank you, sir!

78
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,291
[KARMA sighs]

79
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,458
This is so intense!

80
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,500
He's terrifying but
cool at the same time.

81
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,916
--[KORO-SENSEI growls]
--[HINANO] I know!

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,708
He wants you to hurt him
but he'll pat you on the head

83
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,750
if you do it right.

84
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,166
He's a good coach.

85
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
I know what this is!

86
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,041
You're trying to take my place
as their favorite teacher!

87
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,708
[KARASUMA]
Really?

88
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,083
I'm here by assignment.

89
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,958
Like it or not, as per your
contract, and I quote:

90
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,583
"all new hires regarding
E Class are solely

91
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,625
the prerogative of
Kunugigaoka Academy."

92
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,041
And, either way, this is
not a popularity contest.

93
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,541
It's my job. I'm here
to help them kill you, pal.

94
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,500
[KORO-SENSEI] Could you not
call me that, please?

95
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,083
I prefer the name
my students gave me.

96
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,916
So that's Koro-sensei to you.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,083
[school bell chimes]

98
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,583
Ugh. We've got a quiz
in sixth period.

99
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,166
Right? They should just
let us go home after gym.

100
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,125
[KARMA]
Nagisa. 'Sup?

101
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,791
It's been a while.

102
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,458
[gasps]

103
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:03,208
[NAGISA]
Karma... You're back?

104
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,666
[KARMA]
Hm.

105
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,666
Oh, hey.

106
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,291
That must be the
notorious Koro-sensei.

107
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,416
Wow. He really does
look like an octopus.

108
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah. Mr. Akabane, correct?

109
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,583
I understand your
suspension ends today.

110
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:58,291
Welcome back. That said,
tardiness is a no-no.

111
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,958
[chuckles]

112
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,416
It's kinda tricky gettin'
back into the swing of things.

113
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh. Feel free to call me
by my first name.

114
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,958
Anyway, I've heard some good
things, Teach. Nice to meet'cha.

115
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
The pleasure's all mine.

116
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,458
Should be a fun
and educational year.

117
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,208
[KORO-SENSEI gasps]

118
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,666
[KARMA]
Hah!

119
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,083
[KARMA]
Ah. You are fast, aren't'cha?

120
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,541
[KARMA laughs]

121
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,708
[KARMA] And who'da thought
these knives actually work?

122
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,958
I just cut one up into
strips and tacked 'em on.

123
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,000
Pretty elementary stuff, chief.

124
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,500
I'm disappointed that's all it
took to catch you by surprise.

125
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,875
But good jump.

126
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,541
If you don't mind comin'
off like a 'fraidy cat.

127
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,208
What, are you scared of me?

128
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,125
[NAGISA] He hurt him.
He actually hurt him.

129
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,500
That makes him the first.

130
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,375
I heard they call
you "Koro-sensei"

131
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,708
'cause you're s'posed
to be unkillable.

[KORO-SENSEI mumbles]

133
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,083
Oh, come on.

134
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,500
No way you can be
this big of a pushover!

135
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,708
[KORO-SENSEI growls]

136
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,208
Hey, Nagisa, what kind of
person is this Karma guy?

137
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:05,250
Uh. He and I were in the same
class our first and second year.

138
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,666
He was violent, so violent
they finally expelled him,

139
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,083
shipped him here.

140
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,916
E Class is where they
send you when they don't know

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,125
what else to do with you.

142
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,291
Thing is, under
the circumstances,

143
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,791
he may end up a star student.

144
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,666
[KAEDE]
Huh? What do you mean?

145
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,916
[NAGISA] Weapons and
blood are his passion.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,708
Trust me, if anyone can kill
our teacher, it's Karma.

147
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,583
[KARMA] Stick around
next time, Koro-sensei.

148
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,583
I'll show you what it's
like to be assassinated.

149
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,833
You won't want to miss it.

150
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,583
[rhythymic squishing]

151
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,000
[STUDENTS sigh]

152
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,375
[squishing continues]

153
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,083
[MIMURA]
Um. What is he doing?

154
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,583
I dunno, I think
he's punching the wall.

155
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,083
[ISOGAI]
No, you're right.

156
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,041
Karma's smack-talk seems to
have really touched a nerve.

157
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,625
But what's the point
of punchin' a wall

158
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,708
when his tentacles are
too soft to do any damage?

159
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,666
Okay, that's enough!
Could you maybe stop that?!

160
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,875
We're trying to
take a quiz here!

161
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
S-Sorry! Yes, absolutely.

162
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,250
You sure you know what you're
gettin' yourself into, Karma?

163
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,916
The jellyfish is sincerely
pissed off at you.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,250
You can't pay me enough
to be in your shoes.

165
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,750
If I was you, I'd stay at home
with my head under a pillow.

166
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,250
'Course he's pissed.

167
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,041
Who wouldn't be if someone
made an attempt on their life?

168
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,791
'Less the would-be
assassin screwed up

169
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,583
and pissed himself
in the process.

170
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,750
[growls]
I didn't piss myself!

171
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,166
That attitude's gonna
get your ass kicked--

172
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Quiet, please!

173
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,125
No noise during a quiz!

174
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,458
[MAEHARA]
Tell that to your tentacles.

175
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,916
[KORO-SENSEI] Continue
to talk, and I will assume

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,375
--that you're cheating!
--Sorry, Koro-sensei, my bad.

177
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,250
No worries, though.
I've already finished.

178
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,500
I'm just gonna eat this
gelato if that's okay.

179
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Not so fast! No eating in class!

180
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hey!

181
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,750
That's the gelato I brought
back from Italy yesterday!

182
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,208
[STUDENTS]
Uh-oh.

183
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,666
Huh? Sorry.

184
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,375
My bad, I just saw it chillin'
in the faculty lounge.

185
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
This won't do, young man!

186
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,958
I flew through the coldest
layer of the stratosphere

187
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,750
to keep that delicious
treat from melting!

188
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,750
Yeah? So? Whaddya gonna do?

189
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:05,750
Hit me?

190
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Of course not!

191
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,125
I'll simply have it back
and finish what's left,

192
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,083
thank you very much.

193
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,250
[KORO-SENSEI gasps]

194
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Anti-me BB's?!

195
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:19,041
[laughs] Wow. That's
twice in one day, Teach.

196
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,125
[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]

197
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,625
I'm gonna keep pullin'
the same old tricks.

198
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,458
Class'll get interrupted,
our grades'll slip.

199
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,250
Let's be straight-up, though.
If you want this to stop,

200
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,375
you can just kill me or
anyone else in this class

201
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,958
for that matter.

202
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,375
You just gotta let go of wanting
us to see you as our teacher.

203
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,500
Give us a taste
of your ugly side.

204
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,666
Or you can make
peace with all this.

205
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,958
Accept that I'll be
the one to kill you.

206
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:52,541
Here's my quiz. Easy peesy.

207
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,541
Peace out for now, Teach.

208
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,666
Whaddya say we
play again tomorrow?

209
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,500
[NAGISA]
Karma's not afraid to go there,

210
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,375
he knows exactly
what buttons to push.

211
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,791
Case in point.

212
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,541
He drew a line in the sand
Koro-sensei couldn't cross

213
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,791
without changing the
way we all saw him.

214
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,166
It took nerve.

215
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,083
It also took honing in on
his target's weakness.

216
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,916
[KORO-SENSEI sighs]

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,583
[NAGISA] He's clever. He's
manipulative. He's ice cold.

218
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:22,333
He sees what makes you tick
and how to exploit it.

219
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,208
If anyone can do this, it's him.

220
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
That boy...

221
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,958
He's left me with no choice
but to go buy another gelato.

222
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,958
He's sharp. Deviously clever.
Mustn't let him bait me.

223
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,666
Mustn't give him
the satisfaction

224
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,458
of losing my temper
and killing him.

225
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,750
I am the teacher,
he is the student.

226
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,166
Yes, indeed.

227
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,416
I'll have to be exceptionally
careful with that one.

228
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,416
[SUGINO]
See ya later, Nagisa.

229
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,833
[NAGISA]
Bye! Have a good one!

230
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,583
[TANAKA] Are you kiddin'
me? Is that actually Nagisa?

231
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,666
Look at the guy all cozy
with the E Class dumbasses.

232
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,583
Ew, gross. Gotta hand it to him,
he's adapted to the crowd

233
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,666
he's gonna spend
the rest of his life with.

234
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,250
Hey, did you hear the news?
Now that his suspension's over,

235
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,500
they shoved that Akabane
nut over to E Class.

236
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,458
Ooh! Dude! No kidding?

237
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,666
I'd rather be dead than stuck
in a classroom with that freak!

238
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,916
[TANAKA, TAKADA gasp]

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,958
Seriously? Because I can
help you out with that.

240
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,500
It'd be messy, but real quick.

241
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,416
I'd rather live,
thanks! Run away!

242
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,083
Like I'd actually
do anything, right?

243
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,833
I'm not gonna risk
another suspension

244
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,791
with the once-in-a-lifetime deal
they're giving me in E Class.

245
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,291
Uh, hey.

246
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,125
Yeah, hey, Nagisa.

247
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,541
Is it cool if I pick
your brain for a sec?

248
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,333
[KARMA] Word is that you've been
keepin' notes on the octopus.

249
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,958
[NAGISA]
Um, well. Yeah, I kinda have.

250
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,500
Does he hate
that nickname?

251
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,333
Us callin' him
"octopus," I mean?

252
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,083
[NAGISA]
Now that you mention it.

253
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,333
Whenever he draws himself,
it's always as an octopus,

254
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,250
and that's the skin he
picks for his characters

255
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,625
in every video game.

256
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,875
[KORO-SENSEI]

257
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,916
And there's this thing
he does in the sandbox.

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Octopus trap.

259
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,583
So, no, I don't
think he minds at all.

260
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,958
In fact, I think it's like his
personal avatar

261
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,041
or whatever, y'know?
He loves it.

262
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,916
Does he?

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's good.

264
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,583
Oh, this is gonna be
friggin' epic.

265
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,958
I know that look.

266
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,375
You're cooking up
something really dark.

267
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,541
I might be. It's fun, right?

268
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,458
I was into this when I thought
he was just a monster,

269
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,958
but... now that I know what
his personality is like.

270
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,291
[train horn blares]

271
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,458
[KARMA] I finally get to kill
an honest-to-goodness teacher!

272
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,000
[laughs]

273
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,958
I've been dreaming of this.

274
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,708
Ever since my last
teacher up and died.

275
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,166
[gasps]

276
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,416
[KORO-SENSEI sobs]
My gelato funds...

277
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,625
Gone, pinched right out
from under my nose.

278
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,500
And with payday
an eternity away!

279
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,625
Guess I'll have to
make my own now.

280
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Good morning, boys and girls!

281
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,375
[STUDENTS sigh]

282
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh? Why the long faces?

00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,041
Has something--

284
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,375
[KARMA]
Oops! That's on me.

285
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,125
Yeah, totally thought it
was you, innocent mistake.

286
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,708
I stabbed it, so I s'pose
I should get rid of it?

287
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,541
[KORO-SENSEI sighs]
Yes, you should.

288
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,541
[KARMA]
Bring it on, Koro-sensei.

289
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,916
No worries, I don't plan on
killin' you physically, yet.

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,250
It's more fun to watch
your spirit die first.

291
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,708
[STUDENTS scream]

292
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,208
[KORO-SENSEI] Observe,
if you will, Karma m'boy,

293
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,416
the versatility of
these tentacles,

294
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
and the firepower of
this missile yoinked

295
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,208
from the Self Defense Force!

296
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,625
[gasps]

297
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,125
[KORO-SENSEI] If you think
I'm gonna let the new kid

298
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,083
get away with murder,
think again.

299
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't you know breakfast is

300
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,333
the most important
meal of the day?

301
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,375
Your complexion tells me
you haven't eaten.

302
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,708
So, please, help yourself to
some of this delicious takoyaki,

303
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,166
I insist.

304
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
You see...

305
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,333
I'm a giver...

306
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,750
I take care of things.

307
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,708
Hungry students, would-be
assassins, troubled teens.

308
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,041
Every attempt on my life

309
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,333
is an opportunity for me
to play my part.

310
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,708
So, by all means, keep at it.

311
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,916
[KORO-SENSEI] By the end of
the day, if your body and mind

312
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,041
aren't aglow with
health and knowledge,

313
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,208
I haven't done my job.

314
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
As you can see,

315
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,041
whatever we do,
this number remains.

316
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,375
Now, I know the concept
of indivisibility is a beast.

317
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,125
But, if its fangs frighten you,

318
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,583
I have a surefire method
for taming it.

319
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,416
See if you can get the gist as
I write it out on the board.

320
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,833
Karma.

321
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,208
It takes an anti-me BB
far too long to reach its mark.

322

[gasps]

323
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
I had time on my hands.

324
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,458
Hope you don't mind
if I prettified yours.

325
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,916
[KARMA growls]

326
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Let's see now.

327
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,166
How'd the two of you do, Fuwa?

328
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,250
I'm... not totally sure.

329
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,208
It's got a bizarre tangy flavor
to it for some reason.

330
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Let's give it a taste.

331
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,958
[KARMA] Probably easier if you
just start over from scratch.

332
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,833
Why not toss it out?

333
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,958
[KORO-SENSEI] We wear
an apron in Home Ec, Karma.

334

[KARMA gasps]

335
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,500
[KORO-SENSEI] Oh, and
don't worry: the soup is fine.

336
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,708
I siphoned it out of thin air
and put it back in the pot.

337
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,625
I also added a dash of sugar.

338
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,000
[gasps]
That's exactly what it needed!

339
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,916
[TERASAKA laughs]
Cute outfit.

340
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,458
[KARMA growls]

341
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,875
[NAGISA]
It's no use.

342
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,208
[KORO-SENSEI
"Over that little pool..."

343
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,000
[NAGISA]
Koro-sensei has weaknesses.

344
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,666
We all do.

345
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,500
He screws up
every now and then,

346
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,291
and his speed drops
to human levels

347
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,291
whenever he's flustered, sure.

348
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,708
But...

349
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,125
Karma's been so relentless
with his surprise attacks.

350
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,791
[KORO-SENSEI "Even as I was
thinking this, the red frog,

00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,333
having failed again,
was making its way back.

352
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,166
I was starting
to get bored with it...

353
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,083
[NAGISA] He has
Koro-sensei on high alert.

354
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:07,625
--And that means... No dice...
--[school bell chimes]

355
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,875
[NAGISA] C'mon, man.
I'm tellin ya not to sweat it.

356
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,083
We'll do it
together as a group.

357
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,041
You could have the sneakiest,
most foolproof plan in the world

358
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,875
ready to go,
but if Koro-sensei's

359
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,750
got his eye on you, forget it.
He's not like other teachers.

360
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,750
Other teachers, huh?

361
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,166
No.

362
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,458
[TEACHER ONO] I'm with
you a hundred percent, Akabane.

363
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,875
Yes, you've had problems.

364
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,291
Yes, you have issues
respecting authority.

365
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,166
But you're absolutely
in the right.

366
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,125
Not a question.
And I stand by you.

367
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,666
[KARMA]
Hm.

368
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,708
[KARMA]
You don't understand.

369
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,250
I wanna do it on my own.

370
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,916
Let me ask you,
would it tick you off to die

371
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,250
in some random place?

372
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, Karma?

373
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
I feel like I've taken

374
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,625
exceptionally good
care of you today.

375
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,250
Keep trying to kill me
if that tickles your fancy.

376
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,375
I certainly don't get tired
of spiffing you up.

377
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,875
Just so we're on
the same page here.

378
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,583
You pretty much consider
yourself a teacher

379
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,125
above all else?

380
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's right.

381
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,416
[KARMA]
Cool.

382
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,750
And you wouldn't
think twice about

383
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,041
putting your life on the line
to save a student?

384
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,333
[KORO-SENSEI] What sort of
teacher would I be if I did?

385
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,333
[KARMA]
That's awesome. Good to know.

386
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,291
So I can kill you.

387
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,416
Knew there had to be a way.

388
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,291
[gasps]

389
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,541
[KARMA]
What's it gonna be, Teach?

390
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,125
You gonna swoop down to save me
and get blasted in the process?

391
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,541
Or you gonna be
the sort of teacher

392
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,583
who lets one of your kids die?

393
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,000
Ha, ha! Whoa!
That crap they say

394
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,125
about your life flashing
before your eyes is true!

00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,291
I think he's learned
his lesson.

Three-E? The one
out in the sticks?

397
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,958
Dude, that sucks.

398
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,375
Still, don't let anyone
give you lip over it.

399
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,333
What?

400
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,083
I'm not the bad guy here.

401
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,041
All I did was put
a bully in his place.

402
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,916
Little jerk had it comin'.

403
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,666
No! Damn it, Akabane!

404
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,333
Any way you slice it,
you're clearly in the wrong!

[KARMA gasps]

406
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,791
Are you out of your mind,
or just stupid?!

407
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,125
What possessed you to think

408
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,500
attacking your class's star
pupil like a mad dog

409
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,250
was something I'd let slide?

410
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,250
[KARMA]
But... Sir, he was...

411
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,458
What? Talking badly
about the dregs?!

412
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,791
Good for you, injuring
someone on principle!

413
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,875
This young man
happens to have a future!

414
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,666
If this interferes with
his exams, it's on my head!

415
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,666
[KARMA]
He said he'd stand by me.

416
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,708
So much for that, I guess...

417
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,875
Damn.

418
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,708
I'm totally gonna die.

419
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,333
I've been willing
to turn a blind eye

420
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,750
on account of your grades.

421
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,208
But you've tried my
patience once too often.

422
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,000
Throw a monkey wrench into
my career and all bets are off.

423
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,500
I'm not saving you anymore.

424
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,208
[KARMA] This is it.
This is how it's gonna go down.

425
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,875
[TEACHER ONO] The good news is
I filed the paperwork

426
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,000
for your transfer
just this afternoon.

427
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,916
Best thing for all
involved, really.

428
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,125
But the bad news is,

429
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,791
you'll be commencing
Third Year in E Class.

Son of a bitch screwed me over.

00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:11,083
So that's it.
He's dead to me now.

waitin' for, Koro-sensei?

434
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,666
Let's do this!

435
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,833
You either die for real,
or I kill your reputation.

[KARMA grunts]

437
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Well done!

438
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,416
A splendidly premeditated
assassination attempt!

439
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,541
Full marks! Neat, huh?

440
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,041
I knew your body couldn't take
being plucked out of freefall

441
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,583
at the speed of sound,
and had I moved any slower,

442
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,166
you would've shot me.

443
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,250
What a tangled and
sticky web we weave, eh?

444
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,666
What the hell?!

445
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,041
Is there anything these
tentacles aren't capable of?!

446
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Can't shoot me now, can you?

447
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,541
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]

448
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, and for future reference:

449
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,625
Students do not
die on my watch.

00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,166
--Ever.
--[KARMA gasps]

451
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,083
[KORO-SENSEI] Take that to heart
for the next time you jump.

452
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,541
[KARMA] I got nothin'.
Un-friggin'-believable.

453
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:11,333
He won't die. The teacher
in him especially.

454
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,166
I don't get it. How were you
so calm the whole time?

455
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,708
[KARMA]
Meh. No big.

456
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,958
What really sucks is
that was my best bet.

457
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,750
Nothing else I can come up
with even touches it.

458
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,458
[KORO-SENSEI] Aw!
Run out of ideas already?

459
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,666
But I have an entire beauty
regimen lined up just for you!

460
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,000
"C'mon. No way you can be
this big of a pushover!"

461
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,625
[KARMA] I still feel
like killing something.

462
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:39,458
Except... it's different
this time, somehow.

463
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,125
No worries, Teach.
You're still dead meat.

464
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,041
[KORO-SENSEI] That's
the spirit! Never give up!

465
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,250
Seems my tender loving
care has paid off.

466
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,875
[NAGISA]
Hm.

467
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,458
[KARMA] Welp.
Let's head back, Nagisa.

468
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,541
We can grab some
food on the way.

469
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,541
[KORO-SENSEI yells]
Excuse me! That's my purse!

470
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,708
Come on, teach.

471
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,375
You've gotta stop
leaving stuff unattended

472
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,583
in the faculty lounge.

473
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Give it back!

474
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,708
Here you go.

475
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Gimme-gimme-gimme!

476
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,208
Uh, hey, uh, this is, uh, empty!

477
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,000
There wasn't much
there to begin with.

478
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,041
Call it a donation.

479
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:16,333
[KORO-SENSEI screams]

480
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
A donation? A donation?!

481
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,666
[NAGISA] Every time one of us
goes in for the kill,

482
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,791
we miss the mark,
but somehow end up better off.

483
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,791
That's the way it goes in
our Assassination Classroom.

484
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,291
I can't wait to see how we try
to kill our teacher tomorrow.
