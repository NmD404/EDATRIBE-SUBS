1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,541
[KORO-SENSEI] A mere one tenth
of a gram of antimatter

2
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,916
puts out as much energy
as an atomic blast.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,166
By splicing the
particle acceleration cycle

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,791
of antimatter into
the lifecycle of a cell,

5
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,625
Yanagisawa's research enabled

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,708
rapid regeneration
of organic compounds.

7
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,166
His subject, the legendary
assassin known as

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,875
the Reaper, underwent
a daily battery of tests.

9
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,791
Coursing through
the subject's body,

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,958
antimatter energy appropriated
the tissues to create tough,

11
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:39,291
flexible limbs, possessed
of an astonishing dexterity.

12
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,583
Yanagisawa dubbed
these "tentacles,"

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,291
and reinforced the restraining
table as a precaution,

14
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,333
leaving Aguri alone
to monitor his creation.

15
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:51,750
She, in turn, was not
unaware of the danger.

16
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,625
She understood that
the Reaper knew neither

17
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,125
his real name nor
the day he was born.

18
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,375
That his easy smile
and gift for small talk

19
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:02,125
were simply part of his
wheelhouse as a killer.

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,833
And he understood her.

21
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,875
He could see there was no love
between her and her fiancé,

22
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,333
the brutal Yanagisawa.

23
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:13,958
He knew that her little sister
was an acclaimed actress.

24
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,083
A year had passed since
this unlikely pair's meeting

25
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,750
and somewhere along the way,

26
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,166
they'd become something
not unlike old friends.

27
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,958
Oh! I almost forgot!

28
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,708
You haven't seen the fancy
new top I'm wearing today yet!

29
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,583
You never learn, huh?

30
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,666
Your taste in clothes sets
women back by ten years.

31
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,833
Ta-dah!

32
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,916
It's a tube top with
a cute oni pattern!

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,916
A little tight, sure.
But crazy stylish!

34
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,916
[chuckles]

35
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:58,500
[AGURI] Uh... Um... It's
too out there, isn't it?

36
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,583
--Sorry.
--No, no!

37
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,666
--It looked super cute
--I just, uh!

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,083
on the mannequin.

39
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,291
[KORO-SENSEI] Are the
experiments doing this to me?

40
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,833
[giggles] Those tentacles do a
good job of keeping you honest.

41
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,375
I don't think they
choose their shape at random.

42
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,583
It's just possible they
reflect how you'd prefer

43
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,000
to see yourself.

44
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
What do you mean?

45
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,625
Imagine what you'd be now
if you hadn't been born

46
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,208
where you were.

47
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,625
You'd still be smart, slightly
perverted, a little bit goofy,

48
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,916
not to mention
remarkably stubborn.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,250
But your smile would
be open and honest,

50
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,333
not just a means to an end.

51
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,291
[AGURI]
Hey, Akari.

52
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,791
Turns out my schedule's open
tonight. Wanna grab dinner?

53
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,333
[KAEDE]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

54
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,208
Why do you sound like you're
on cloud nine all of a sudden?

55
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,958
Who's the new man in your life?

56
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,291
[gasps] U-Um!
What're you talking about?!

57
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,375
You know I'm engaged!

58
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, don't give me that line.

59
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,750
Drop the jerkface
and find someone

60
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,041
who treats you like a person.

61
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,041
--[AGURI] Don't go there.
--Anyway, I'm down.

62
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,375
If you tell me all about this
guy who's caught your fancy.

63
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,375
[AGURI]
So is that a yes?

64
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,958
[KAEDE]
You bet. Your treat.

65
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,000
[AGURI]
Ugh...

66
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,583
A present for me?

67
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:09,208
Yeah. You keep saying
your neck is cold, so...

68
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,250
This ought to keep you warm,
and more importantly,

69
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,791
it's fashionable!

70
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,875
Thanks...?

71
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,333
[AGURI]
Oh. You're not a fan.

72
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
No, no, I...

73
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,958
I just-- I mean, why a
present out of the blue?

74
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,708
Because as of today,
it's been a year since we met.

75
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,750
And since you don't know
when you were born,

76
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,416
why not treat our "anniversary"
like your birthday?

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,875
You listen to me babble
on about my personal life

78
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,500
all the time, and give
me great advice.

79
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,541
So please, as a friend,

80
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,000
let me give you
a proper birthday.

81
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,791
Well, all right, then.

82
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay, it's settled.

83
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,958
'Cept, of course, I'm not really
sure how to give you this.

84
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,375
Guess I forgot to
factor in the glass.

85
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,291
Awkward.

86
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,125
Yanagisawa's hounding me
to quit my teaching job

87
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,208
and work here full-time.

88
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,250
[AGURI]
Maybe I should...

89
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,416
I mean, the latest
crop of students...

90
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,083
They're so, I dunno, unique.

91
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not sure I can reach 'em.

92
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,583
I just... I'm too green.

93
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,541
Too... whatever.

94
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,333
Still, though.

95
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,666
This may sound cheesy, but,
they're a good group of kids.

96
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,083
It's students like them that
make we want to teach

97
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,166
in the first place!

98
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,666
I can't quit.

99
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,208
I can't give up on other people.

100
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,083
They need a teacher,
someone who believes in them.

101
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,416
This hurts so much.

102
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,583
I wish I could hold you...

103
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,833
You've been my rock
through all this.

104
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,083
If I had your strength,
I could...

105
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,208
I could get through
one more year.

106
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Before he realized it,

107
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,000
his smile was no longer
just a means to an end.

108
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,958
Hang in there, okay?
You've got what it takes.

109
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,333
Thanks...

110
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,750
[KORO-SENSEI] The first time
they knew one another's touch,

111
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,916
was three hours before
the moon exploded.

112
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,333
[SHIRO]
The moon?!

113
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,625
[MALE RESEARCHER A] Yes, sir!
Seventy percent destroyed!

114
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:00,375
An anti-matter discharge from
a lab rat on the lunar surface!

115
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:04,250
So, then... cell division,
exceeded natural limits?

116
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,083
Right! Calculate how
long we have until

117
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,208
our human subject reaches
the same breaking point!

118
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,166
Yes, sir!

119
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,875
[alarm sounding]

120
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,708
[MALE RESEARCHER A] Okay.
The algorithm projects

121
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,708
March 13th of next year.

122
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,208
The day the Reaper will die and
take the entire world with him.

123
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,541
[AGURI gasps]

124
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,250
[MALE RESEARCHER]
What should we do, sir?!

125
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,708
[SHIRO]
Isn't it obvious?

126
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,166
We put him down like a dog.

127
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,125
It's really only a matter
of stopping his heart.

128
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,208
You! Notify the
Americans immediately!

129
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,291
[MALE RESEARCHER B]
Done!

130
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,250
So I'm doomed to die
a horrible death. So what?

131
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,041
It's not like
I don't have it coming?

132
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,916
You can't give up
without trying!

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,416
--There has to be a way--
--[KORO-SENSEI] That said,

134
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,958
it'd be a shame to waste
this power in the meantime.

135
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,791
It's been fun, Aguri.

136
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,708
Goodbye.

137
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,250
[gasps]

138
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,583
I think it's about time to go.
Sooner than expected, maybe.

139
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,583
But I know I'm more than
equal to the challenge.

140
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,083
I've been here long enough.

141
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:02,125
No, wait! This isn't you!
You're not the person you were!

142
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
You gonna stop me?

143
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,791
Yes!

144
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,833
Oh, really? With what?
Those little arms?

145
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,666
That stunning intellect?

146
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,000
[AGURI gasps]

147
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,166
Unless your abilities
surpass mine, sweetheart,

148
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,333
you don't have a prayer
of stopping me anymore

149
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,208
than you do saving me.

150
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,791
Frankly, you're not
even worth the trouble

151
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,708
of taking as a hostage.

152
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:25,416
So unless you want a
pointless death, leave. Now.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,041
[AGURI]
It's Yukimura. Unlock door One.

154
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,375
I need out.

155
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,916
[KORO-SENSEI] All right.
Time for a test drive.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,083
Let's reap the fruits of torture
and see what I'm capable of!

157
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,833
What's wrong with
the security system?!

158
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,125
I don't know!

159
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,541
It's not responding!

160
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,791
The artillery panels are stuck
in the closed position!

161
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Much obliged, Yanagisawa.

162
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,625
This new body--it's
affectively invincible.

163
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,583
Then, of course, I did give you
quite a bit to work with.

playing us from the beginning!

Is this the thanks I get
for taking you in?!

stand there like idiots!

173
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,666
Go on! Arrest him!

174
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,541
[SHIRO] Don't push
your luck, guinea pig.

175
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,125
And don't assume we're strictly
in this for the science.

176
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,416
Fire!

177
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,583
[KORO-SENSEI] If you're trying
to hit a major artery...

178
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,666
[yelling]

179
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,000
...a grain of sand
will do the trick.

180
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,083
I could have slaughtered the
likes of you whenever I pleased.

181
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,166
[SHIRO giggles]
Tentacle mines!

182
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,000
A byproduct of
antimatter organisms.

183
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,166
All one need do
is attach sensors.

184
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,208
And presto!
A supersonic projectile!

185
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,625
Grafted onto human beings,

186
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,250
they become the ultimate
killing machine!

187
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,625
[KORO-SENSEI] You're gonna
need more than this.

188
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,541
I don't die that easily!
[laughs]

189
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,166
K-Kill him!

190
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,250
Block him in and fire at will!

191
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,625
[laughs]

192
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,916
[grunting]

193
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,250
Drop the acrylic shield!

194
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,375
[screams]

195
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,583
[KORO-SENSEI snarling]

196
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:05,875
[cackles]

197
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,208
[AGURI groans]

198
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,833
It doesn't matter...

199
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,333
I'll die in a year either way.

200
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,125
Whether it's here
or somewhere else.

201
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,083
Heh. If I take the Earth
with me, so much the better.

202
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,375
[grunting]

203
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,125
No, stop!

204
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,291
[AGURI]
Don't leave!

205
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,666
If you do,
there's no turning back!

206
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,708
You're... You're
better than this!

207
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
She had seen everything.

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,083
And despite it all,
she was hopeful.

209
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:05,166
I... I hadn't expected
her to react as she did.

210
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,458
This was something
completely new.

211
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Aguri!

212
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,083
[AGURI] Okay...
That was really stupid...

213
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,041
Sh-Should've paid closer
attention to where I was going.

214
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,250
[KORO-SENSEI whimpers]
Why? Why did you...?

215
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,416
[AGURI]
I-I had a sneaking suspicion

216
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,375
yelling wouldn't be
enough to stop you.

217
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,000
[KORO-SENSEI] If I'd been there
a fraction of second quicker,

218
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,666
I could've saved her.

219
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,333
If I'd thought about using these
tentacles for something

220
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,875
other than killing...

221
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,083
Why? There was more
than enough time...

222
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,625
Why didn't I...?
Why couldn't I just...?

223
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,250
Why must it always be death
and destruction?!

224
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,333
Why? Why...?

225
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, God, Aguri.

226
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,625
I've killed you...

227
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:11,666
[giggles] Don't be so dramatic.
This wasn't your fault.

228
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,750
It's on me.

229
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,416
No one made me come after you.

230
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,083
I knew the risk, accepted it,
and chose my priorities.

231
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,500
That's just how important
to me you are, silly.

232
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,416
I bet one of these days,

233
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,833
you'll meet someone
just as important to you.

234
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,583
[KORO-SENSEI] There is no one
as important as you.

235
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,750
Sorry...

236
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,708
You should've been
the one to kill me.

237
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,416
[AGURI rasps]

238
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,666
[AGURI] Listen...
You have a year left...

239
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,875
If you could sacrifice a
little bit of your time,

240
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,166
give the children
the tools to succeed...

241
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,083
In a way, they're like you.
Wandering in the dark,

242
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,041
waiting for someone
to turn on the light.

243
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,000
Someone who can
take them as they are.

244
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,875
Warts and all.

245
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,041
[AGURI]
Such wonderful tentacles...

246
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:15,541
With hands like these...
you could reach them...

247
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,208
I know it... in my heart...

248
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'm sorry...

249
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Then he really understood.

250
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,500
Her many faults had been
part of her charm.

251
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,750
[KORO-SENSEI] In the time I have
left, I will be a teacher.

252
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,875
I will take up
the torch in your honor.

253
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,291
Take the children as they are.

254
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
No matter what...

255
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,708
I will never turn
my back on them.

256
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
The tentacles spoke to me.

257
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,416
Asked what I wanted to be.

258
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,083
"To be weak," I said.
"To be flawed. Vulnerable.

259
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:47,791
To perceive weakness in others.
Not to exploit, but protect.

260
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,541
To be a guide.
To be a teacher."

261
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Sometimes I'll be wrong.

262
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,833
Sometimes my old self will
bubble up to the surface.

263
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:03,541
But... I'll give it my all.
I'll honor Aguri's memory.

264
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,375
Carry on her work
the best way I know how.

265
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's my story, boys and girls.

266
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,166
The person who taught me
how to be a teacher

267
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,208
was none other
than Aguri Yukimura.

268
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,958
She taught me to
truly look at people.

269
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,250
To respect everyone as an equal,

270
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,291
not define human beings
by their weakness.

271
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:42,875
She was wonderful. Through her,
I found my purpose in life.

272
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,208
I evaluated my experience,
collected all the knowledge

273
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,666
I could, and prepared to
pick up where she left off.

274
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,500
I vowed to use
my abilities to the fullest.

275
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,875
To pass the gift of
personal growth on to you.

276
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,916
The question was: how?

277
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,625
How best to reach
her cherished E Class?

278
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,708
I racked my brain,
day and night.

279
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,333
And suddenly it came to me.

280
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,250
An entirely new kind
of learning environment.

281
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,333
The Assassination Classroom.

282
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,750
[NAGISA] It'd been nine months
since Koro-sensei appeared.

283
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,416
We'd all grown
by leaps and bounds.

284
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,250
Whatever his past,
he was the best teacher

285
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,875
we could've asked for.

286
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,916
Hearing his story,
we understood the reasons

287
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,458
he'd decided to
become our teacher.

288
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:33,208
Vividly, in living color, our
minds flooded with memories

289
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,666
of the past year.

290
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,791
The scary times.

291
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,958
The infuriating times.

292
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,000
The happy times.

293
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,583
The fun times.

294
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,500
Yeah, especially those.

295
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,041
[NAGISA] Gradually, the nature
of what we'd been asked to do

296
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:56,375
dawned on us. Our mission
became all too real.

297
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,291
[NAGISA] Before it's all over,
we have to kill our teacher.

298
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,958
[IRINA]
Hey. Karasuma.

299
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,750
Do you know what it
means to kill?

300
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,208
To actually end someone's life?

301
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,958
[NAGISA]
The end was nigh.

302
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,500
Slated for March 13th.

303
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,708
Ironically enough,
the same day as our graduation

304
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,625
from Kunugigaoka.

305
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:35,083
We've rung in the New Year.
Today is January sixth.

306
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,500
And the number of us
hatching assassination plots

307
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:41,583
over the Winter Break?
Was precisely zero.

308
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,750
[NAGISA] So, how's it goin',
Kaya-- Sorry, Miss Yukimura.

309
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,250
You can call Kayano.

310
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,750
After all this time,
the name's grown on me.

311
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,541
Sorry about your Winter Break.

312
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,791
I don't imagine the holidays
were all that much fun.

313
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,875
Well, hey, at least I'll
make it back for the new term.

314
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,875
What about you?
D'you make use of the time off?

315
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,250
Not so much.

316
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,458
Assassination plans were just
hard to think about.

317
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,791
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It's all my fault, really.

318
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,291
Now that I've been
told the truth,

319
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,500
there's at least some sense
of closure about Aguri.

320
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,583
But knowing where
Koro-sensei comes from

321
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,208
doesn't make this any easier.

322
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,416
[NAGISA]
You can't blame yourself.

323
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,666
The truth was gonna
come out one way or another.

324
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,416
We've all been in denial.

325
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,250
None of us wanted to face
what this was about.

326
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,041
I mean it's been blast, right?

327
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,625
And who's had time to think
about were it was leading us?

328
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,625
Everyone spent the
break wondering how

329
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,541
we're gonna face
what's left of the year.

330
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,916
You're right: It's all fun and
games until things get real.

331
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,625
Oh! I almost forgot.
I owe you an apology.

332
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,208
Sorry about the kiss. Honest!

333
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,416
It was... the only thing
I could think to do

334
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,875
in the heat of the moment.

335
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,916
You mad at me?

336
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,250
Are you kidding? That kiss
happened to save my life!

337
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,125
I'm totally in your debt now!

338
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,125
Ugh, what a relief! I was sure
you were through with me!

339
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,000
[KAEDE]
You worry too much.

340
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,958
BFFs for life!

341
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,791
We should probably head out.
I'm certain she needs her rest.

342
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,083
Right, right. Let's go.

343
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,083
Bye, Kayano.

344
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,416
[OKUDA]
See you in a couple days.

345
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,375
[SUGINO]
Later.

346
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,583
[KAEDE]
For sure.

347
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,791
[giggles]

348
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,708
What's the matter? You good?

349
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:24,791
Just think about it.

350
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,875
She's been on
the outside looking in.

351
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,166
But now it genuinely feels
like she's part of the team.

352
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,125
[KAEDE groans]

353
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,666
[screams]

354
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,416
[KAEDE]
I can't do this!

355
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,166
It was... It's like I was being
brainwashed or something!

356
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,291
This is my life from now on!

357
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,208
What the hell
am I supposed to do?!

358
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,750
I was the top assassin
in our class, hands down.

359
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:53,958
Those tentacles gave me an edge.
Speed, firepower, the works.

360
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:58,583
Nobody had a better chance
of killing Koro-sensei!

361
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,041
And yet...

362
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,041
I was shot through the heart.

363
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,125
Taken down by a kiss.

364
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,875
I'm defeated, bumped out
of the top spot.

365
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,583
Nagisa flung me
back down to Earth.

366
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,791
[KAEDE] So now I play
the part of his friend?

367
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,333
I guess so...

368
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Okey-dokey, class!

369
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,416
Third term is upon us!

370
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,166
I want everyone to
play hard and kill hard!

371
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,375
[KARASUMA]
You can't be surprised.

372
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,291
You knew the kids'd
be like this.

373
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,791
The atmosphere's changed.

374
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,125
They feel the gravity of
what needs to be done.

375
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,791
Question is: What does
that do to your sense

376
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,333
of being their teacher?

377
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Very little, actually.

378
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,000
If I wasn't prepared
to adapt as needs demanded,

379
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,916
I wouldn't have become
a teacher in the first place.

380
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,541
[IRINA] An assassin
can't afford to be reckless.

381
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,291
We don't kill out of greed, we
don't kill out of desperation.

382
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,083
We don't let ourselves
become animals.

383
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,458
[HINANO]
Professor Bitch...

384
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,833
Our feelings are always
the first target.

385
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,416
Only when they're cold and
buried do we train our sights

386
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,083
on the second.

387
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,541
That's the cost of doing
business, and it's high.

388
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,875
Take my word for it.

389
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,416
Whatever you kids decide,
think it through first.

390
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,958
Feelings are difficult to kill,

391
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,583
but they're a lot
harder to resurrect.

392
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,500
[TERASAKA]
Okay.

393
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,458
Ain't really like you to call us
all together like this, Nagisa.

394
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,500
What's the deal?

395
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,000
There's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

396
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,416
[SUMIRE]
We're listening.

397
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,958
I'm not even sure
it's possible...

398
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,083
...but instead of
killing Koro-sensei,

399
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,625
I think we should
try to save him.
