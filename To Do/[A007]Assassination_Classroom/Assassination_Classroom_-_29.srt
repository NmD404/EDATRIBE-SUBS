1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,041
[HINANO] What cha think,
Professor Bitch?

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,750
Is the gear we got
yesterday awesome or what?

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,000
[OKANO]
Right?

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,208
Mr. K sure knows how to
kick things up a notch!

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,666
[IRINA chuckles]

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,375
FYI, I had a teeny bit of
input in the overall design.

7
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,916
For which, you're welcome.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,166
That oaf wanted the same
style for the whole class.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,833
[OKANO]
Glad he vetoed the "Irina."

10
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,791
[TOKA] It's cute,
just not super functional.

11
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,083
Yeah, well.

12
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,416
'Least one of your teachers
understands women.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,791
Blockhead couldn't even be
bothered to get me a present.

14
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:36,958
[ALL]
Huh?

15
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,291
[TOKA gasps]

16
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,916
Oh, no! Of course! October
tenth was four days ago!

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,666
[OKANO, HINANO]
Huh? Professor Bitch's birthday!

18
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,375
[IRINA]
Before I came here,

19
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,291
I had legions of sugar daddies
falling all over themselves

20
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,250
to buy me expensive things.

21
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,125
Now?

22
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,125
If it doesn't come from
him, I'm not interested.

23
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:37,375
What the hell is wrong with me?

24
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:42,125
And why haven't I been able
to get ahold of Lovro?

25
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,541
Being alone sucks.

26
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,666
Professor Bitch, do you
have a little time to go over

27
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,250
some more
conversational francais?

28
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,625
[IRINA]
Do what?

29
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,833
Oh, that's right.

30
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,791
You had your heart set
on working overseas.

31
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,916
Yeah. Oh, excuse me,
I meant to say oui.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,166
Well, all right then, take
a seat and we'll drill--

33
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,625
[MEG]
Actually, the weather's so nice,

34
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,833
I was thinking we
could do this outside.

35
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:02,875
[IRINA]
But why?

36
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,750
[MEG]
C'mon! It'll be fun!

37
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,000
[OKAJIMA] Man, those two
are lucky to have us around

38
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,291
to push things along.

39
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,500
We're a go.

40
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,291
The Fox and the Hound
have been separated.

41
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:16,416
We'll keep our fingers crossed
for the Birthday Present Squad.

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,708
Right, let's do this.

43
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,541
Now what exactly are you
supposed to get someone

44
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,500
who already has
two of everything?

45
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,041
[KAEDE]
It's not gonna be easy.

46
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,750
Everybody pitched in.

47
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,041
Not a whole lot, but
it's better than nothing.

48
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,250
Question is, will it be enough
to by a proper grown-up gift?

49
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,916
[FLORIST]
Hey, over here!

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,250
Everything thing end up
okay with that man?

51
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,916
You know, the old-timer
on the bicycle?

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,333
[NAGISA]
Uh...

53
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,041
You're the flower guy who
called the ambulance!

54
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,958
He managed to forgive us after
a couple of weeks, yeah.

55
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,875
Uh, thanks for helping us out.

56
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:49,333
No sweat. I'm glad it
wasn't as bad as it looked.

57
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,375
Beg pardon, I couldn't
help but overhear

58
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,041
you're in the market
for a grown-up gift?

59
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,708
Yes! Yes we are!

60
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,958
[FLORIST] Well, what about
something like this?

61
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,250
Oh, I get it! A bouquet!

62
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,000
[FLORIST] In this day and age,
we can have whatever we want.

63
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,458
But flowers are still
the go-to gift of choice.

64
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,416
Why do you suppose that is?

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,750
[STUDENTS]
Hm?

66
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,666
[FLORIST]
It's not just about romance.

67
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,125
Their color, their
shape, and scent.

68
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,791
The fact that they don't last.

69
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,666
Flowers are an ideal metaphor
for the human condition.

70
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,541
Oh my. You're a
persuasive salesman, sir.

71
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,625
Quite the, poetic little speech.

72
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,500
That calculator part
of the symbolism?

73
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,625
Hey, I'm just trying
to make a living.

74
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,666
So, uh, you in?

75
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,666
I'll cut you a deal.
It's flowery fate.

76
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,458
[TOKA]
Wow! Then what?

77
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,666
Is there some magic word that
brings a Frenchman to his knees?

78
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,250
What's with you today, Toka?

79
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,750
You've never been so enthralled;
you're hanging on every word.

80
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,291
Well, yeah,
I wanna learn French.

81
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,708
Hey, Miss?

82
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,666
Can you play piano for us
like you did at the hotel?

83
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,000
C'mon, Professor Bitch!

84
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,208
Let me draw you in one
of your killer poses!

85
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,583
Hold on! I asked
her first, y'know!

86
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,083
[IRINA]
Uhh...

87
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,458
[IRINA] What's the deal with
these brats all of a sudden?

88
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,250
I'm so popular!

89
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,000
Ha! Don't fret my
little darlings!

90
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,250
There's enough Professor
Bitch to go around!

91
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,916
Just don't get turned on.
That would be crossing the line.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,541
It's a very nice bouquet of
flowers, don't get me wrong.

93
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,125
[KARASUMA]
But why me?

94
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,500
They'd mean so much
more coming from you.

95
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:23,791
[NAGISA] Ugh. Can somebody
actually be this clueless?

96
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,208
Mr. K, please.
Look at it this way:

97
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,583
Professor Bitch is a vital
asset to the mission.

98
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,083
All in a day's work, sir.

99
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,666
Winning over your colleague
can only help things, right?

100
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,791
Hah. Just let her think
they're from you. Cool?

101
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,833
I see your point.

102
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:43,375
Very well. I'll do it.
Thanks for your dedication.

103
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,291
--[IRINA chuckling]
--[phone buzzing]

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,833
[STUDENTS murmuring]

105
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,333
Wait, I...

106
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,583
Come on, you don't all have
to leave at the same time.

107
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,208
Well damn. How do you like that?

108
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,500
Urgh. Nice. Absolutely perfect.

109
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,750
I'm right back to being
Miss Lonely Hearts.

110
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,791
Hey, Karasuma! You won't
believe what just happened!

111
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,625
Those self-centered brats--

112
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,916
Oh, Irina. Good timing.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,750
[IRINA]
Uh... What is this?

114
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,875
I know I'm late,
but... Happy Birthday.

115
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,666
Wait, these're for me?

116
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,041
And they're from you?

117
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,333
[KARASUMA] Sorry I let
the actual day slip by.

118
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,583
Things got busy.

119
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,250
[IRINA]
No, it's fine. I'm delighted.

120
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,958
Thank you so much.

121
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,916
You old dog!
I thought you forgot it!

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,666
Is this real, or is there
something up your sleeve?

123
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,250
I do want to mark the occasion.

124
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,250
This is the first and
last of your birthdays

125
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,750
we'll celebrate together.

126
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,333
Oh, don't be silly. What
is that supposed to mean?

127
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,416
Just what it sounds like.
Stands to reason, yes?

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,791
Either the mission's going
to end or the world will.

129
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,250
One way or the other, in half
a year, this'll be over.

130
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,583
[KARASUMA]
Hm?

131
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,291
Oh. Hey there.

132
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,625
Well, we're screwed.

133
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,041
[IRINA] I figured you
had to be behind this.

134
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,666
A bouquet of flowers, huh?

135
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,083
Like the square would think of
doing something like that for me

136
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,541
of his own will.

137
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,208
[KORO-SENSEI yelps]

138
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,208
[IRINA]
You enjoy yourselves?

139
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,583
Stringing me along so you
can watch a pro assassin

140
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,541
get her pathetic
little hopes up.

141
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,000
[KORO-SENSEI] That's not
the case at all, Miss Irina!

142
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,458
The children's intentions
were utterly pure--

143
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,083
[IRINA]
Save it, Octorazzi!

144
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,166
[IRINA]
Who gives a damn?

145
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,375
This is a business
relationship, nothing more.

146
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,041
I've been so caught
up in my role,

147
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,125
I've forgotten who I really am.

148
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,916
[IRINA]
You've opened my eyes.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,333
Best birthday present
ever. Thank you.

150
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,083
[SUGINO]
Hold on!

151
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,791
Professor Bitch, please!

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,041
[MAEHARA] Not to point
fingers or anything, Mr. K,

153
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,166
but that was kind of cold
of you, don't you think?

154
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,375
[OKANO] Don't tell us you still
haven't noticed how she feels?

155
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:09,458
You kids don't really believe
I'm that oblivious, do you?

156
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,666
I'm a heartless bastard
for good reason.

157
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,375
Emotions can't be allowed
to get in the way

158
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,083
of what needs to be done.

159
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,416
We're professionals.

160
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,041
If her feelings for me
can dull her blade,

161
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,791
then she's not qualified
to be an assassin.

162
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,833
That's all there is to it.

163
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,083
But, Mr. Karasuma...

164
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,000
[IRINA yells]

165
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,791
I am so pissed off right now!

166
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,791
Karasu-- To hell with
that! More like Crapsuma!

167
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,375
Damn! It's hard to say!

168
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,125
[IRINA] Maybe...
Maybe it's time to leave.

169
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,125
What's left for me here anyway?

170
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,708
Nothing. Not with
what I'm capable of.

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,875
[NAGISA] After that, Professor
Bitch essentially disappeared.

172
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,833
She hasn't been
here in three days.

173
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,291
We really crossed the
line this time, guys.

174
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Well, I'm off.

175
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,916
You can call me if there's
any news on Miss Irina.

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,125
Meanwhile, there's a fútbol
tournament in Brazil

177
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,166
I must attend.

178
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,125
So... ciao!

179
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,416
Okay then, guess
he's outta here.

180
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,041
What's the deal with him
and soccer all of a sudden?

181
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,375
[MAEHARA] Typical
"once-every-four-years" fan.

182
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,750
What happened to baseball?

183
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm starting to get worried.
I just hope she's okay.

184
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,875
Yeah, no. Not much
luck getting through.

185
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,083
My GPS scan is
coming up negative.

186
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,541
No matches on the
closed-circuit feeds either.

187
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,041
Seriously.

188
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,083
You don't think she would leave
over something like this?

189
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,875
[FLORIST]
I'm sure that can't be the case.

190
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,500
After all, there's still
something important

191
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,958
you need her to do.

192
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,666
Yes, exactly. Plus she knows
we like having her around.

193
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,916
[FLORIST]
Right.

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,583
You children have bonded
rather nicely with her,

195
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,875
there's no denying that.

196
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,208
You see,

197
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,875
my preliminary reconnaissance
confirmed as much.

198
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,708
Your connection gives me
something very handy to exploit.

199
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,708
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

200
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,375
[ALL gasping]

201
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,791
[NAGISA]
It was so... so casual.

202
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,000
He walked in like
he owned the place.

203
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,708
[FLORIST]
Hello.

204
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,333
I'm the assassin commonly
known as The Reaper.

205
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:14,250
And today, boys and girls,
class it going to be fun.

206
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,708
[KIMURA]
What the--?

207
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,916
[RYUNOSUKE]
It's him.

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,208
A flower tends to throw
people off guard.

209
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,666
There's hardly a soul alive
immune to their charm.

210
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,333
Remember my sales pitch?

211
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,541
Nagisa, you were taken in.

212
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,125
[REAPER] But you see, there's
a reason flowers evolved

213
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,250
into such lovely,
fragrant varieties.

214
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,541
Ritsu, would you bring
up the image I sent?

215
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,625
[gasps]

216
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,958
[REAPER] Their purpose
is to draw insects.

217
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,708
Is that Professor Bitch?

218
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,791
[REAPER]
I'll cut to the chase.

219
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,000
It's simple. If you
want her to live,

220
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,166
show up when and
where I tell you to.

221
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,291
And yes, I mean
the entire class.

222
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,333
Not a word of this
to your teachers.

223
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,125
'Course, I can understand
if you're not comfortable

224
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,541
with those terms.

225
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,958
If you'd rather not come,
there's always the option

226
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,583
of sending her to you.

227
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:17,291
In tiny, individual wrapped
pieces. One per student.

228
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,833
If that's the preference, fine.

229
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,625
Though, one of you will
likely be my next flower.

230
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,916
[KARMA]
We didn't see him coming.

231
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,833
[KARMA]
That's when it dawned on me.

232
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,291
What scared me most of
all was not being afraid.

233
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,250
'Kay, first off,

234
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,125
we got no obligation to
save that pushy bitch,

235
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,625
so thanks for playin',
but no dice.

236
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,583
Second, what's to stop us from
beatin' the piss out of you

237
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,250
right here and now,
ya kidnappin' bastard?

238
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,625
A bold assessment,
but entirely wrong.

239
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,333
The woman means more
to you than you know.

240
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,458
In fact, I suspect that
if you were to let her die,

241
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,708
you'd be beside yourselves.

242
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,250
As to your second point,

243
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,375
no human being is capable
of taking down the Reaper.

244
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,333
[REAPER]
Conversely,

245
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,625
human beings are the
Reaper's preferred prey.

246
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,125
"Come to the location
shown on the map.

247
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,291
Arrive as a group at
six P.M. and tell no one."

248
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,375
Huh.

249
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,125
Exactly like with
Takaoka and Shiro.

250
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,666
They wanna take us hostage.

251
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,708
Draw out Koro-sensei
with us as the bait.

252
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,541
Damn!

253
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,208
[TERASAKA]
We usin' these?

254
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,125
We're doing this to
protect someone. So, yes.

255
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't care if he's
the greatest assassin

256
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,833
who's ever lived,
we're not about to let

257
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,875
that oily SOB's plan
go off without a hitch.

258
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,958
[MAEHARA]
That's gotta be the way in.

259
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,041
Bird's eye
loop-around's negative.

260
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,291
There's no sign of
anybody close by.

261
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,875
Makes it more ominous.

262
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,125
'Kay, Ritsu.

263
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,000
If we don't all make it
back here by midnight,

264
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,333
tell Koro-sensei
what's going on.

265
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,875
Got it. Good luck.
Be stay safe, everyone.

266
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:08,916
[ISOGAI]
Let's go!

267
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,958
[MAEHARA]
Lotta space he's got.

268
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,333
[crackling]

269
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,666
[REAPER] Is that all of you?
Good. Watch the doors.

270
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:35,416
Ah. You like to keep an eye
on us, huh? Kinda kinky.

271
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,291
Reaper, Peeper. All right.
Sure, why not?

272
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,208
Look, we've held up
our end of the bargain!

273
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,541
So give back Professor Bitch,

274
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,625
and let us get on
with our lives, okay?

275
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,208
[ALL gasp]

276
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,208
What the hell?

277
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,875
Whoa! The whole
room's going down!

278
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,125
Trap is complete.

279
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,125
Ensnaring you as a group
is the best way.

280
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,708
Saves me a lot of time.

281
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,000
[STUDENTS gasp]

282
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,541
[STUDENTS]
Professor Bitch!

283
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,916
Ugh! Crap!

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,083
[REAPER]
No worries.

285
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,666
If he comes quietly,
no one gets killed.

286
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,666
[OKAJIMA] What about if we,
like, resist or something?

287
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,541
Would you be mad
enough to kill us then?

288
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,416
Oh, relax. It's pitiful
how scared you are.

289
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,375
Uh, sorry, I can't
really do much about it.

290
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,666
Here! This section
sounds hollow!

291
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,333
[TAKEBAYASHI]
A fitted charge.

292
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,166
[OKUDA]
A few smokescreen capsules.

293
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,458

294
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:35,916

[REAPER chuckles]

296
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,541
Yes, good! Make it fun!

297
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,791
[ISOGAI]
Okay. Moment of truth's upon us.

298
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,875
[static]

299
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,541
[REAPER]
Hello, E-Class? Can you hear me?

300
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:55,000
Nice work. Honestly,
I'm happy you escaped.

301
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,666
It'll be a good warm-up
for the real game.

302
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,000
I expect great things.

303
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,041
I knew it. It's a game to him.

304
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,833
[NAGISA]
This isn't some vindictive act,

305
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,000
like with Takaoka.

306
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,750
It's different.
He's an unknown quantity.

307
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Seven to one.

308
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,333
[BRAZILIANS]
Huh?

309
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mmm-hmmm. Indeed.

310
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,208
Letting XY stand
for seven to one

311
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,833
gives us a lovely
math problem...

312
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:31,875
[BRAZILIANS yelling]

313
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh, dear me,

314
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,583
I seem to have angered
the locals somehow.

315
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,583
Did I insult a sacred custom?

316
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:42,041
I ought to pick Maehara's brain
on this. He knows soccer.

317
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,750
[OPERATOR] We're sorry,
the number you've dialed

318
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,458
is out of range.

319
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:50,708
[KORO-SENSEI] Uh. Isogai, then?
Perhaps Hinata. Or Terasaka.

320
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,625
I have a bad feeling about this.

321
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,250
We'll intercept him here.

322
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,833
Whichever way he
decides to come from,

323
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,291
we'll still have him
outnumbered, so stay alert.

324
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,416
Ritsu, we need
some backup, 'kay?

325
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,250
Yeah, not feelin' it.

326
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,666
Be realistic, like I'm gonna
go up against the Reaper.

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,666
[RITSU] I'd rather power
down than, like, do stuff.

328
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,291
[STUDENTS]
Ritsu's been hacked!

329
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,416
[NAGISA]
He's coming.

330
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,666
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh?

331
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,541
[NAGISA]
I can't make him out.

332
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,666
What the--?
How is he doing that?

333
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,666
Take him down!

334
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,583
Dumbass is walking
right into us!

335
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,333
[REAPER] Hand-to-hand
combat was the first skill

336
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,333
I honed as an assassin.

337
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,541
So as you might imagine,
I'm rather good at it.

338
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,458
A talent 99% unnecessary
in this profession,

339
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,916
but without it, 1% of
my quarry would survive.

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,125
If you want to be a killer,
it's an indispensable tool.

341
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,666
Take my word for it.

342
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,583
[REAPER]
Ah, females are so fragile.

343
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,916
Don't expect me to handle the
rest of you this delicately.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,166
Everyone. Stay back.

345
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,333
Leave this guy to me.

346
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,458
Are you outta your mind?

347
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,708
[NAGISA]
She's all right.

348
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,833
That crunching noise was
the sound of her gear

349
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,583
absorbing the impact.

350
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,750
Still, though.

351
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,083
The Reaper thinks
her ribs are cracked,

352
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,333
which really pisses me off.

353
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,000
[NAGISA]
When I'm like this,

354
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:33,083
my bloodlust demands
satisfaction for all of us.

355
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
[NAGISA]
With these hands...

356
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,333
[gasps]

357
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,125
Whoa!

358
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,291
[KARMA] Well, damn.
This isn't gonna work.

359
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,208
[STUDENTS grunting]

360
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,291
The classic stunner clap.

361
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,375
Yours and Lovro's might
conceivably startle a cat.

362
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,833
But in sufficiently
skilled hands,

363
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,166
the move can accomplish
quite a bit more.

364
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,666
Human consciousness has
a frequency, you see.

365
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,166
The higher the peaks, the more
sensitive one is to stimulus.

366
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,916
When your prey's
in a particularly

367
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,666
agitated state of mind,

368
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,875
a powerful enough sound
wave can work wonders.

369
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,041
[REAPER] Of course, they'll be
startled, but that's hardly all.

370
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,583
Oh, oh no,

371
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,666
the voluntary nervous system
will be temporarily paralyzed.

372
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:32,458
[NAGISA] This is...
This is top-level stuff.

373
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,958
[REAPER]
Huh. So that's it?

374
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,708
Well, okay then. Except I seem
to be short a few of you.

375
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,333
[MEG gasps]

376
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,625
[MEG]
Professor Bitch!

377
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,083
[OKUDA]
She's still breathing!

378
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,791
You're in charge of
taking care of her.

379
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,041
[TERASAKA] Man, I always get
stuck with the grunt-work.

380
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,625
'Kay.

381
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,041
Let's rendezvous with the others
and get the hell out of here.

382
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,958
Yay! What a relief.

383
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,666
I thought for sure
she was a goner!

384
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,333
Yeah, right?

385
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,375
[thud]

386
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,291
[TOKA]
Um, Professor Bitch?

387
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,000
Ah.

388
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,041
How lovely to finally be myself.

389
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,416
Six whole months asleep before
my prince came to wake me.

390
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,916
Now, then, to put you
brats out of commission.

391
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,750
What're you talking about?

392
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,333
This can't be real.

393
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,833
Time for your final lesson, boys
and girls. I hope you're ready.

394
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Son of a--!

395
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,583
Oh! I stepped on
a rock barefoot.

396
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,500
Jeez. C'mon, miss. Let's--

397
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,625
[OKAJIMA]
Not cool.

398
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,750
[TOKA]
That was a dirty trick.

399
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,875
We were actually worried
about you there for...

400
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,708
Yeah, well,
whad'ya gonna do?

401
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,625
Blame it on the experience gap.

402
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,250
I've seen a little bit more
carnage than you punks.

403
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,875
[REAPER] Already? You took
them out all by yourself.

404
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,916
[IRINA] I was only
following your advice.

405
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,083
There's no point throwing in

406
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,583
with a bunch of
snot-nosed know-nothings.

407
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,333
[REAPER] Glad you've
finally seen the light.

408
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,958
They're only children after all.

409
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,291
For all the good they are to us

410
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,333
they might as well be
from another world.

411
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,250
They breathe clean air,
we breathe blood mist.

412
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,500
[REAPER]
You there. What'll it be then?

413
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:22,000
Will you come quietly, or stand
your ground in a losing battle.

414
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,125
[TERASAKA groans]

415
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,916
Blah, blah, blah.
Dude, bring it on.

416
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,375
Itona and I'll kick
your crazy ass.

417
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,416
[ITONA]
I surrender.

418
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,416
Huh?

419
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,958
[ITONA]
If we fight, we're toast.

420
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,000
This guy's on a
whole other level.

421
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,666
[TERASAKA]
You're kidding me.

422
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,166
[ITONA] It's like you said.
If we lose today, so what?

423
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,333
All we gotta do is
win once. Be patient.

424
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,666
[KAEDE]
So now what?

425
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,208
[KARMA]
Listen, buddy.

426
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,166
I don't know what your big plan
is for killing Koro-sensei,

427
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,625
but I wouldn't count
on it goin' smoothly.

428
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,958
Oh, don't worry.
I'm a gifted improviser.

429
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,583
That's my job.

430
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,208
I can work with bad
intel as well as good.

431
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,208
Hm?

432
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,583
[IRINA]
Huh?

433
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,708
Karasuma?

00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,750

Why is he here?

00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,208
Pro'ly the Octopus.

437
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,958
He told us once if
there was ever a wall

438
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,208
we couldn't get over...

439
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,958
...he'd take over from there.

440
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,125
We're gonna be okay.

441
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
I've got their scent!

442
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,333
Ha-ha! Didn't I tell you?

443
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,166
In this clever canine
disguise, I'm a natural!

444
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,000
There is absolutely
nothing natural

doing right now.
