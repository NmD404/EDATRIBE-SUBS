1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,416
[SHIRO]
Now then, Koro-sensei.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,666
Let your final
death match begin.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,625
[ITONA]
So strong, but compared to me...

4
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,083
...so weak.

5
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,250
[ALL]
It's Itona!

6
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,958
[SHIRO] I'm afraid drastic
changes to the playing field

7
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,375
were in order.

8
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,708
You understand, I'm sure.

9
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:09,291
Ensnare first, strike
second. Very effective.

10
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,666
As you can see, we've taken
a page from their tactics.

11
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,041
You dirty--!

12
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,166
I should've known it was
you behind all this!

13
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,583
[SHIRO]
Indeed.

14
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,791
When the trust of his
students is on the line,

15
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,208
this creature panics.

16
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,250
If something seems a
bit fishy, no matter,

17
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,666
the fool plunges in headfirst.

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,375
Ugh! Dammit! The bastard's
stealing our kill!

19
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,875
This totally counts as fighting
dirty, in case you didn't know!

20
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,458
[SHIRO] Also commonly
referred to as being an adult.

21
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,208
Note the gloves on
Itona's tentacles.

22
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,375
The edges are sharp

23
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,125
and constructed of
anti-Sensei material.

24
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,000
Each defensive stroke
by your teacher

25
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:50,250
results in ever increasing
damage to his limbs.

26
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,375
Though that won't be quite
enough to finish him off.

27
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,541
[ITONA] I've won, big brother.
Give up already.

28
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,625
This is just how it is.

29
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,583
I have one problem
to solve. You.

30
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:08,333
At last, I will
prove my strength!

31
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,541
[KORO-SENSEI yelps]

32
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,958
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

33
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,000
[gasps]

34
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Bravo! Well done, Itona!

35
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,250
If we were in the
First Term right now,

36
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,208
this might've actually
cooked my goose!

37
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,541
One criticism, though.

38
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,875
Your attack pattern
is rather transparent.

39
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,166
However fast you are,
however strong,

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,583
however many schemes
your guardian thinks up,

41
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,708
however prone I am to panic,
by our third bout,

42
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,500
I can adapt to
the idiosyncrasies

43
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,708
of your fighting
style with ease.

44
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,083
[growls] No way.
It's not possible!

45
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
Dear boy.

46
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,541
I study too, you realize.

47
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,458
How could I mold young
minds if I didn't?

48
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:54,583
A true teacher misses
no opportunity to learn.

49
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:58,583
Now then, let's get rid of
this dangerous cage, shall we?

50
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,458
Incidentally, trying out my
Absolute Defense Form

51
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,333
over the summer break taught
me a very valuable skill.

52
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,458
How to release a burst of energy
by compressing not my body,

53
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,916
but only the tips
of my tentacles.

54
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,750
[SHIRO]
What?

55
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:13,875
[ITONA growls]

56
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Remember this, Itona.

57
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,500
Assassination is
education, I say.

58
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,500
And in an
Assassination Classroom,

59
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,000
the teacher grows stronger
with every lesson!

60
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,875
[yelling]

61
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:33,791
[ITONA]
Why? Why can't I ever win?

62
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,791
I'm supposed to be
stronger than this.

63
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,958
[KORO-SENSEI]
Well there you have it, Shiro.

64
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,708
I suggest you go quietly
and leave him to E-Class.

65
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,250
Also...

66
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,291
I'd appreciate it if you'd
spread the word that I'm not,

67
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,041
in fact, an underwear thief!

68
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:59,083
And tell people I'm a
B-cup! Got it? B-cup!

69
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,416
[screaming]

70
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,333
[ITONA]
It hurts.

71
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Itona!

72
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,375
[ITONA]
It hurts!

73
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,833
Feels like my head's
gonna burst!

74
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,083
[SHIRO] That would be
the agony of defeat.

75
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,416
His tentacles are
gnawing away at his brain.

76
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hang in there, Itona!

77
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,625
[SHIRO] Seems losing to you a
third time was quite the blow.

78
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,750
Failing to carry out this
little scheme of mine

79
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,041
is clearly more
than he can bear.

80
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,250
[NAGISA]
Huh? What does that mean?

81
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,625
[SHIRO]
Itona.

82
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,125
If this is the best
you're capable of,

83
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,750
the Organization
will stop paying.

84
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,000
I feel for you, I really do.

85
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,125
But I have to cut my
losses at some point,

86
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,375
focus my attention
on your successor.

87
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,833
This is goodbye,
Itona. I'm sorry.

88
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,166
You're own your own from here.

89
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh. Hey! Where're you going?

90
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,958
How can you call
yourself his guardian?

91
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,208
[SHIRO] Asks the monster
playing classroom.

92
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:01,625
Why feign concern when all
you can really do is destroy?

93
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,291
Mark my words.

94
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,750
I will not tolerate
your existence.

95
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,083
In the end, I'll kill you.

96
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,541
No cost is too high,
no sacrifice too great.

97
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,875
[KORO-SENSEI growls]

98
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,416
[SHIRO]
Come to think of it, actually.

99
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,333
How do you suppose your dear
students feel about that?

100
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,041
[screams]

101
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Look out!

102
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,208
What was wrong with him?

103
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,125
[KORO-SENSEI groaning]

104
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,208
[ALL gasp]

105
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,625
[STUDENTS]
Koro-sensei!

106
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,333
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles nervously]

107
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't worry. I'm just pooped.

108
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,291
Nothing a little rest won't fix.

109
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,250
[SHIRO] Your immune system
sees the tentacle grafts

110
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,083
as foreign objects.

111
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,916
An intensive adaptive regimen
must be adhered to daily.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,625
Otherwise the body takes
nightmarish defensive measures.

113
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,000
Once maintenance
is discontinued,

114
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:04,083
the tentacles begin to painfully
corrode the nervous system.

115
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,500
The average person dies
of madness in three days.

116
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,166
[REPORTER]
The first incident was here.

117
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,958
Officials don't yet
have any suspects

118
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,083
in this bizarre string of
cellphone shop attacks,

119
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,125
but aren't ruling out terrorism.

120
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,375
Businesses in the area have
been told to be on high alert.

121
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,750
[RITSU]
This has to be him.

122
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,416
No kidding.
Who else would it be?

123
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,625
Yeah, but why cellphone
shops, though?

124
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,416
We can't just let
him run loose.

125
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,875
[KORO-SENSEI] The burden
of reining the boy in

126
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,250
now falls on me.

127
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,375
I have to find Itona
and protect him.

128
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,625
[KARMA] I've seen guys
like Shiro before.

129
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:44,000
This is a game to him. People
are pawns to be sacrificed.

130
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,625
You can never really know what
someone like that'll do next.

131
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,708
Yeah, I vote it'd be better
if we just leave the kid alone.

132
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,791
[STUDENTS]
Uh?

133
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
No. I am his teacher.

134
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,708
[KORO-SENSEI] A teacher never
turns his back on a student,

135
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,958
no matter what.

136
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,833
When I took this job,
that was my solemn vow.

137
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,666
To never let go.

138
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,166
[ITONA'S FATHER] There are no
shortcuts, son. Believe me.

139
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,916
So if you want to get stronger,

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,083
it takes work, heart,
and integrity.

141
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,625
That's the only way.

142
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,500
Yeah right.

143
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:32,541
[PEOPLE whispering]

144
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:45,625
[ITONA] No more lip service.
No more beating around the bush.

145
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,625
The only thing you learn from
losing is how to be a loser.

146
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,958
I wanna win.

147
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,166
I wanna be strong.

148
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,125
[KORO-SENSEI] Your human side
is finally starting to show.

149
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,708
That's a positive sign.

150
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,083
[ITONA]
Big brother.

151
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,625
[KORO-SENSEI] I prefer
Koro-sensei, if you please.

152
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,083
A much more appropriate
name, I think.

153
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,208
Promise not to go all
nuclear on us, okay?

154
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,458
We've been through a lotta
crap tonight because of you.

155
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,625
But if you come quietly we're
and willing to let it slide,

156
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,041
so just, you know...

157
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,625
Shut your face.

158
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:19,083
We fight. Come at me. Right now!

159
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,208
[KORO-SENSEI] We can battle
if that's what you really want.

160
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,250
There must be a
vacant lot nearby.

161
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,791
State Secret
versus State Secret.

162
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,666
When the smoke clears, we
can study ways to kill me.

163
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,500
I've got all the fixin's
for a study-buddy-barbeque!

164
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,500
He's a very persistent Octopus.

165
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,333
Take my word for it.
Once you're in his class,

166
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,583
he'll go to Hell and back to
make sure a lesson sticks.

167
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,250
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

168
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
You bet I will!

169
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,916
Put a student in front of
me and I'm in my element.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,458
The instinct to teach them is
so powerful, I can't help it.

171
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,291
[KORO-SENSEI chuckling]

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,041
[NAGISA]
What is this stuff?

173
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,625
[KAEDE]
I can't see!

174
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Oh dear. This is anti-me powder!

175
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,916
[SHIRO]
Casting my ward adrift

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,041
was all part of the
plan, Koro-sensei.

177
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
I was so preoccupied

178
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,250
with the boy's bloodlust,
I didn't even notice!

179
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:13,041
[SHIRO] Come along, Itona.
You've one last duty to fulfill.

180
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Don't you dare!

181
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,833
[SHIRO]
Rescue him. You are his teacher.

182
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,541
[KORO-SENSEI growls]

183
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,208
[STUDENTS coughing]

184
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,250
[NAGISA] Koro-sensei.

185
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,125
[KORO-SENSEI] No one's hurt,
are they? Everyone okay?

186
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,750
Uh, sure, more or less.

187
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Good.

188
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll go after your
classmate. Away!

189
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,708
You noticed that, right?

190
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,000
Protecting us slowed
his response time.

191
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,208
Oh no.

192
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,041
Damn that Shiro.

193
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,541
He sure as hell made
us his pawns, all right.

194
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Itona!

195
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Blast!

196
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,458
They're using pressure
rays to slow me down!

197
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,250
[SHIRO] Not that I'm
the least bit surprised,

198
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,000
but you really are a fool.

199
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,708
Itona is mine.

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,291
[SHIRO]
Remarkable.

201
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,708
You grow exponentially weaker

202
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,375
when the target is
anyone but yourself.

203
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,791
Are you certain you won't go?

204
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
I am his teacher!

205
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,000
[ITONA]
I... I'm weak.

206
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,625
Why else would my
partner abandon me?

207
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,833
[SHIRO]
Good eyes.

208
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,416
They radiate an insatiable
hunger for victory.

209
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,916
Crucial for anyone
hoping to fully utilize

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,833
the cells I've created.

211
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,958
[SHIRO] I can help you
carve a path to dominance.

212
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,333
Let us review some simple
arithmetic, you and I.

213
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:01,000
Your tenacity plus
my cutting-edge tech

214
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,916
equals the power
to seize victory.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,458
Indeed, you can become the
most powerful creature on Earth.

216
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,875
[ITONA]
I wanted it so badly.

217
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,041
I could endure the
agony of those cells.

218
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,625
I was so dead-set on winning,

219
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,791
I could throw myself
into whatever it took.

220
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,541
Except... I lost.

221
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,666
I lost and now I'm being
protected by the thing

222
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,333
I was supposed to kill.

223
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:28,375
How? How did I lose
to a bunch of nobodies?

224
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,125
[UNDERLING A]
What the--?

225
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,416
You guys really shoulda
seen this comin'.

226
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,458
That crap might be anti-Octopus,
but it sure ain't anti-us.

227
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,916
[ISOGAI]
Hey, Terasaka,

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,708
can you grab those lights
up in the in tree?

229
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,833
All over it.

230
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,708
[UNDERLING D]
Damn kids! Huh?

231
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,125
You're doing this for me?

232
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,416
[HAYAMI]
Don't read too much into it.

233
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,208
This isn't about you, we're
just pissed at your boss.

234
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,125
And if Koro-sensei
hadn't bolted,

235
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,125
we'd have left you
behind in a heartbeat.

236
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,083
You hear that, dude? I love
how she pretends not to care.

237
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,166
[TAKEBAYASHI]
The girl runs hot n' cold.

238
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,000
Wouldn't look this way
if I were you, Shiro.

239
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,166
[KARMA]
You need to pay attention.

240
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,958
Stop shootin' and the net'll
come right off at the base.

241
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,000
[KORO-SENSEI] Excellent
timing. Nicely done, children.

242
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,916
[ISOGAI] That stuff's
melting his tentacles.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,625
[MAEHARA] It's okay,
we'll get you out of there!

244
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Step down, Shiro.

245
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,625
We're taking Itona with us.

246
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,583
You're a meticulous man,
that much is apparent,

247
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,458
but once you involve
my students,

248
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,166
there's no telling
what lengths I'll go to.

249
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,291
The sooner you home
in on the obvious, the better.

250
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,166
[chuckles]

251
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,000
[SHIRO] A class taught by a
monster swarmed with gnats.

252
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,333
How infinitely irritating.

253
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,166
Though, I begrudgingly grant
you my approach is in need

254
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,583
of a radical overhaul.

255
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,625
[SHIRO]
Keep the boy if you like.

256
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,541
He'll only live another
two days or so.

257
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,875
You kids play nice, now, hmm?

258
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,916
[ITONA]
Hard work, heart, integrity.

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
What a joke.

260
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,666
At the end of the day, it all
comes down to who's stronger.

261
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,916
[KORO-SENSEI] As long as
the poor boy is gripped

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,291
by this pathological
need to win,

263
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,458
the tentacle cells will cling
too tightly to be extracted.

264
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,666
So, can't we just cut
'em off, or whatever?

265
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,958
[KORO-SENSEI] Not until
he can break the fixation.

266
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,416
Some dreadful thing
brought him to this pass.

267
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,958
We must find out what.

268
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,291
Okay.

269
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,625
Easier said than done.

270
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,958
I mean, he's not just
gonna spill his guts.

271
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,375
[FUWA]
I was thinking, actually.

272
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,333
His little rampage.

273
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,875
Aren't cellphone shops a
weirdly specific target?

274
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,541
I had Ritsu do
some digging to see

275
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,291
if she could come up with
a possible connection,

276
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,041
and guess what,

277
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:54,500
one company's president
had a son named Itona.

278
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,750
A parts supplier.

279
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,375
Pretty modest, but they
used to have business

280
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,916
all over the world.

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,416
They declared bankruptcy
a couple of years ago.

282
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,291
The president and
his wife skipped town

283
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,500
and left the son behind
with relatives.

284
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,000
[NAGISA] Suddenly, we had
a clearer picture of Itona.

285
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,333
Why he was so bent
on power at any cost.

286
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,083
[TERASAKA]
Heh. Lame.

287
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,958
That's all it took to make
this punk a delinquent?

288
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,500
Like we don't all have
a bag o' rocks to carry.

289
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,500
Kid needs some perspective.

290
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,083
We'll handle things from here.

291
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,375
Take him in, care
for him, yadda yadda.

292
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,708
If he dies, he dies. We tried.

293
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,583
[ITONA'S FATHER]
Look around you, son.

294
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,000
We don't look like much
next to the big boys,

295
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,791
but if we work hard,
stay strong,

296
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,166
and let integrity be our guide,

297
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,291
we can give 'em a run
for their money.

298
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,083
[ITONA]
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.

299
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,458
[ITONA'S FATHER]
Don't leave!

300
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,041
You're this company's
nerve center.

301
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,583
We can't function without you!

302
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,833
[ITONA]
Integrity is meaningless.

303
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,500
Against superior force,
it isn't worth a damn.

304
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,708
[ITONA'S FATHER]
I'm sorry, Itona.

305
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,083
I'm sending you to
live with your uncle.

306
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,833
Welcome back, Sleeping Beauty.

307
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,958
We used the anti-Sensei
netting to make a bandana.

308
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,541
For our own protection.

309
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,750
We need to keep those
tentacles in check.

310
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,625
How come we're lettin'
this jerk eat ramen?

311
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,291
'Cause he's bound to be hungry.

312
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:34,041
If we expect him to feel better,
he's gotta eat properly.

313
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,250
[MURAMATSU] What do you think?
Totally disgusting, right?

314
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,416
I keep tellin' my old man, but
he won't change the recipe.

315
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,958
I agree. It is disgusting.

316
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,541
Ugh, MSG doesn't hid the fact
the bones are stale.

317
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,166
And somebody needs
to tell your old man

318
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,083
this fishcake topping
is out of style.

319
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,875
This recipe you've got is
four generations too old.

320
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,208
[MURAMATSU]
Crap! He really knows his stuff.

321
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,750
[ITONA]
What a joke.

322
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,708
This dive'll go belly up the
second a competitor moves in.

323
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,416
Just like what happened to dad.

324
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,291
That's what integrity gets you.

325
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,125
Hey, c'mon, let's hit
up my place next!

326
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,083
What I got's the bomb!
It's totally modern.

327
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,291
This fossil ain't even
remotely in the same league.

328
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,333
[MURAMATSU]
Dude!

329
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,916
[YOSHIDA]
Pretty badass, huh?

330
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,125
Really takes your
mind off things.

331
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,458
[KIRARA] You know he doesn't
have a license, right?

332
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,666
[TERASAKA]
Relax. His folks own the track.

333
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,125
[YOSHIDA] Tell me this isn't
the most awesome thing ever.

334
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,291
[ITONA]
It's all right.

335
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,916
[YOSHIDA] Oh yeah?
Check out my brake turn!

336
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,875
Idiot! The hell you doing?

337
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,333
Help him! The shock's
gonna set him off again!

338
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,041
Relax, man! That wasn't
enough to hurt him.

339
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,625
[NAKAMURA] Way to fly by
the seat of your pants, guys.

340
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,125
[YOSHIDA]
See? He's fine.

341
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,000
Well, they're a
couple of morons.

342
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,375
What did we really expect?

343
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,625
Hey, no worries.

344
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,875
At least Hazama's got
a brain in her head.

345
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,833
[KIRARA] You wanna get
back at Shiro, am I right?

346
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,791
This novel oughta inspire you.

347
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,500
Seven volumes, 25 hundred pages
full of delicious revenge.

348
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,000
Read and let your
soul be nourished

349
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,666
by the darkness within.

350
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,375
Toward the end the hero
learns to forgive,

351
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,166
so you don't have to
bother reading that far.

352
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,791
[TERASAKA]
Seriously?

353
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,125
No! Way too dark!

354
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,958
And no one has the time
to read a damn book!

355
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,208
Oh, come on.

356
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,375
Evil has to be nurtured
properly, too, you know.

357
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,000
We're supposed to be
cheering him up!

358
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,750
You gotta think
of your audience!

359
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,541
He's probably not the sharpest
tool in the shed. Uh...

360
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,791
Uh, he's gettin'
all twitchy again.

361
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,625
Hell, I'd be twitchy too if
Terasaka called me stupid.

362
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,291
Oh no. It's the tentacles!
He's about to flip out!

363
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,583
I am not one of you losers!

364
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,833
I'm strong!
I'm strong and I win!

365
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,583
[YOSHIDA]
What're you doing?

366
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,208
[TERASAKA] Take it easy.
We all wanna kill the Octopus.

367
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,500
Matter of fact, I was just
thinking about it earlier today.

368
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,916
Look, you're not gonna get
him right outta the gate,

369
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,916
so get over yourself.

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,541
You need this too bad, man.

371
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,125
Just let it go. You gotta
chill the hell out.

372
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,416
Ugh! Shut up!

373
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,666
Hah. Second time today.

374
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,125
And you're weaker now,
so it's way easier.

375
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,750
Don't get me wrong, it still
hurts bad enough I wanna puke.

376
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,250
And speaking of puke, this
reminds me of Muramatsu's ramen.

377
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,791
Hey!

378
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,625
[TERASAKA] You see, the Octopus
told him it'd be a good idea

379
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,416
for him to study business.

380
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,458
Sure, his dad's ramen is crap,

381
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,041
but one of these days,
he'll take over.

382
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,125
And with what he's learned
he can push new flavors.

383
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,000
The joint'll be hoppin'.

384
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,708
The Octopus said the
same thing to Yoshida.

385
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,708
It's about bein' patient,
pickin' your moment.

386
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,958
So snap out of it.

387
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,041
You can't let a couple
losses blow you off course!

388
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,541
You don't have to win
now, just someday!

389
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,750
Slow and steady wins
the race, right?

390
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,250
Well, it kills the Octopus, too.

391
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,083
Doesn't matter if we screw
up a hundred times either.

392
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,125
As long as we kill him once
before March rolls around,

393
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,666
we win.

394
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,125
Use the reward money to get your
dad's factory runnin' again

395
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,166
so him and your
mom can come back.

396
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,833
That's somethin' to
shoot for. Why not?

397
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,333
I can't handle this.

398
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,958
The hell am I supposed to do
while I'm waiting to win?

399
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,291
How... How do I pass the time?

400
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,500
[TERASAKA]
Huh?

401
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,083
You act like an idiot,
like we did tonight.

402
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,083
Don't worry, we got you
covered in that department.

403
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,041
Isn't that heartwarming.

404
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,375
And who but an idiot could've
said it with a straight face?

405
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,250
I gotta say, sometimes
the word of an idiot

406
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,541
is exactly what
you need to hear.

407
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,416
[ITONA]
So I was... being impatient?

408
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,583
[TERASAKA]
Hah.

409
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,083
A little bit, yeah.

410
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,541
[KORO-SENSEI] I do believe
the fire in your eyes is out.

411
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,083
In a good way.

412
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,416
Those painful tentacle cells
can finally be excised now.

413
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,875
But don't fret too much.

414
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,208
What you'll lose in power,

415
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,833
you'll more than
make up for in friends.

416
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,458
You will come and kill me,
won't you? Starting tomorrow?

417
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,583
Whatever you say.

418
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,833
I'm sick of this power anyway.

419
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,875
And this whole brother thing.

420
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,583
Hey, look who's here.

421
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,083
Bet it's nice not to have to
bust through a wall, huh?

422
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,291
Good morning! That bandana's
lookin' pretty sharp!

423
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Well, hello there! Welcome!

424
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,666
How are we feeling today?

425
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,166
Not so hot.

426
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,625
Sucks not having
my power anymore.

427
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,666
Still, guess I don't
feel any weaker.

428
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,750
I will kill you before it's
all over, Koro-sensei.

429
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,083
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

430
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,916
[NAGISA] And that's how
the textbook problem child

431
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,625
Itona Horibe finally
joined E-Class.

432
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,875
Muramatsu, hey. I'm broke.

433
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,291
Give me some of your ramen
and I'll try not to puke.

434
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,500
Huh?

435
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,375
[NAGISA] By being part
of Terasaka's group.
