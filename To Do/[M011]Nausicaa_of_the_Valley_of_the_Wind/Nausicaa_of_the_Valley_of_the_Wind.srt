1
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,445
[wind whistling]

2
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,982
[squealing]

3
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,931
[man's voice]
Yet another village is dead.

4
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,474
- [growling]
- [buzzing]

5
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,774
Let's go.
Soon this place, too,

6
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,068
will be consumed
by the toxic jungle.

7
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,163
[narrator] A thousand years have passed

8
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,458
since the collapse
of industrialized civilization.

9
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,627
A toxic jungle now spreads,

10
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,213
threatening the survival
of the last of the human race.

11
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,761
[creatures whistling]

12
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,054
[gasps]

13
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,100
Ohmu tracks.

14
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,485
Looks like they're still fresh.

15
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,290
[gasps]

16
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,920
A perfect ohmu shell.

17
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,183
Amazing.

18
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,478
I've never seen
a whole shell before.

19
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,069
[dings]

20
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,197
[gasps] A perfect sound.

21
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,324
[grunts, shudders]

22
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,454
Ah!

23
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,791
[gasps] It even chipped
a Xerconian ceramic sword.

24
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,085
This should make the people
of the valley happy.

25
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,170
They won't have to worry
about finding materials

26
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,756
for making tools for a long time.

27
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,803
What an amazing eye.

28
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,222
I wonder if I could
fly back home with this.

29
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,581
[grunts]

30
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,836
[gasps] It came off.

31
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,881
It's so light.

32
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,051
[laughing]

33
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:21,232
Oh! The Mushigo palms
are sending out their afternoon spores.

34
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,417
It's so beautiful.

35
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,337
It's hard to believe
these spores could kill me.

36
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,090
Five minutes without a mask,
and I'd be dead.

37
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,111
[gasps] What's that?

38
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,497
My heart's pounding.

39
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,416
What's going on?

40
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,835
[distant boom]

41
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,670
[gasps] Gunshots.

42
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,464
Someone's in trouble.
The insects must be attacking.

43
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,806
- [growling]
- Oops, sorry.

44
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,187
[gunshots continue]

45
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,657
There they are.

46
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,118
Look at that cloud of spores.

47
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,748
An ohmu! It must be the one
that shed that shell.

48
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,171
Whoever it's chasing
will never escape that way.

49
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,804
I hope they see the signal.

50
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,809
Good. They're coming this way.

51
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,010
There they are.

52
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,405
What an amazing ohm...

53
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,867
[ohmu bellows]

54
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,497
- Get upwind of it!
- Right!

55
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,295
Ohmu, go back to the jungle.
This is not your world.

56
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,215
Come on, now. Be good.

57
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,177
Look at those red eyes.

58
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,721
It's blind with rage.
I've got to calm it.

59
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,962
Look at that.
She's stunned it with flash grenades.

60
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,673
- [pulsating hum]
- An insect charm.

61
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,349
Ohmu, wake up.

62
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,393
You need to go back to your jungle.

63
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,612
[rumbling]

64
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,113
It's coming to.

65
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,045
Unbelievable.

66
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,343
It's going back to the jungle.

67
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,764
She turned it back with nothing
but an insect charm and flash grenades.

68
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,309
- Lord Yupa!
- [laughing]

69
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,937
Nausicaa. I didn't recognize you.

70
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,940
It's been over a year now.
It's great to see you.

71
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,067
Thank you for helping me
with that ohm...

72
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,944
You've mastered
that glider of yours.

73
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,990
You think so? Father says
I have a long way to... Hm?

74
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,744
Oh, yes.
I forgot all about this little fellow.

75
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,706
He's the reason I got
in trouble with the ohm...

76
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,709
Wow, is that a fox-squirrel?
I've never seen one.

77
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,295
I hadn't, either.
I saw an insect carrying him off,

78
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,046
and I mistook him
for a human baby.

79
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,840
I had no choice
but to use my gun.

80
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,217
So, that's why the ohmu
was so angry with you.

81
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,635
He's quite spirited.

82
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,263
Apparently, he didn't inhale
too much of the jungle's poison.

83
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,016
Better not touch him.
Even the babies are vicious.

84
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,142
Come on.

85
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,019
- It's OK.
- [squeaks]

86
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,979
Careful.

87
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,982
There's nothing to fear.

88
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,985
- [growling]
- Nothing to fear.

89
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,278
- [crunches]
- [stifled grunt]

90
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,115
See? Nothing to fear.

91
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,036
- [light growl]
- Right?

92
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,713
You were just
a little scared, weren't you?

93
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,507
[laughs]

94
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,262
He's perfect. Will you
let me keep him, Lord Yupa?

95
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,264
Of course. Certainly.

96
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,600
[giggles] Thank you!

97
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,270
Kai, Kui!
Do you remember me?

98
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,481
What a mysterious power she has.

99
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,732
[laughing]

100
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,860
You must be tired after
running from that ohm...

101
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,449
So, how's your family, Nausicaa?

102
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,328
What's wrong?

103
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,538
It's...

104
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,209
Father can't fly anymore.

105
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,710
King Jihl?

106
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,214
So the jungle's poisons
are taking their toll.

107
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:46,928
Yes. Father says it's the fate
of all of us who live near the jungle.

108
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,514
I'm sorry.
I should have come sooner.

109
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,893
No, I'm just glad
you could come at all.

110
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,772
Lord Yupa, there's something
I want to show you

111
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,899
when we get back to the valley.

112
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,443
- I've created my own secret room.
- Oh.

113
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,363
I haven't shown it to anyone yet
because it'll frighten them.

114
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,073
You get to be the first!

115
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,450
I'll go on ahead and announce you.
See you there!

116
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,870
- [Nausicaa] Lord Yupa?
- Hmm?

117
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,289
Do you think you could
carry this back for me?

118
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,959
I'm afraid it's not
the easiest thing to fly with.

119
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:31,347
[chuckles] She certainly
knows how to read the wind.

120
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,349
Come, you two!
We're almost there.

121
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,845
[Gol] Oh! Lord Yupa!

122
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,805
Gol, Muzu, how have you been?

123
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,560
[Gol laughs] Good, good! The wind is
strong and the water is clear.

124
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,812
- [girl] Hi!
- [girl 2] Hi, Lord Yupa!

125
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,856
Hello, girls. You're looking well.

126
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,915
[woman] Welcome home, Lord Yupa!

127
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,043
[man] We've waited so long
for your return!

128
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,256
Princess, Lord Yupa has arrived.

129
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,425
I'm almost finished.

130
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,677
Welcome back, Lord Yupa!

131
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,930
[Lord Yupa] Why, Mito,
you're looking fit!

132
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,390
Thank you. I'm looking forward
to hearing all the news

133
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,142
from the other kingdoms tonight.

134
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,020
OK, start her up!

135
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,407
Nice work, princess.

136
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,492
Thanks.

137
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,747
This is high-grade material, Lord Yupa.

138
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,543
I'll send out a party to retrieve the
rest of the shell first thing tomorrow.

139
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,045
- Come on. It's OK.
- Yes, ma'am.

140
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,382
Lord Yupa, we had a baby
born in the valley this year.

141
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,551
Wonderful. Let's have a look.

142
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,844
Oh, she's a fine baby.

143
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,348
Strong and healthy.
She reminds me of Nausicaa as a child.

144
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,560
We would be very honored if you
would choose a name for her.

145
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,396
With your blessing,
fair winds are sure to favor her.

146
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,189
Very well.

147
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,650
I'll see that she's given a good name.

148
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,235
Thank you, Lord Yupa.

149
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,905
May she grow up to be strong
just like Princess Nausicaa.

150
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,909
Hmph! It's good to hope for a daughter
who's strong like the princess,

151
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,745
but not for one who likes
to play in the toxic jungle.

152
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,707
But, Mito, the jungle
is where I found the ohmu shell.

153
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,835
All 1 do is worry when
she's running around out there.

154
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,921
I'd trade a thousand ohmu shells
for a good night's sleep.

155
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,550
[laughs] Sorry, Mito.
We'd rather have the ohmu shells.

156
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,385
The princess should explore
all she wants.

157
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,930
I agree. Who else would
rescue me when I'm in trouble?

158
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,765
[all laughing]

159
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,892
[children cheering, laughing]

160
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,438
[woman] Welcome home, Lord Yupa,
you've been missed!

161
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,106
[woman 2] Our blessings, Lord Yupa!

162
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,192
- [man] We're so happy you've returned.
- [woman 3] Lord Yupa!

163
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,129
[Lord Yupa, Jihl laughing]

164
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:54,216
[Jihl] So Nausicaa rescued
the great Lord Yupa?

165
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,721
This is such a wonderful valley, Jihl.
It soothes my heart.

166
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,724
How are the other kingdoms
you visited faring?

167
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,684
Mm, things are grim.

168
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,730
I found two more kingdoms to the south
that have been consumed by the jungle.

169
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,192
It seems as if it
spreads faster every day.

170
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:15,112
And the kingdoms that still survive
are torn by war and starvation.

171
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,781
The cities are plagued with fear.

172
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,242
Why can't the other kingdoms
live happily as you do here?

173
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,703
It's because we have
the wind from the sea

174
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,498
to protect us from the jungle's poisons.

175
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,501
We know the poison
cannot reach us here.

176
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,755
Lord Yupa, isn't it about time
you settled down here?

177
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,177
With my present condition,
it would bring peace of mind to us all.

178
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,682
<i>Ha-ha-ha!
That's impossible.</i>

179
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,394
Lord Yupa must continue his search.
It's his destiny.

180
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,522
It's my destiny, is it?

181
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,441
Obaba, what is it that
Lord Yupa searches for?

182
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,485
What? Nausicaa.

183
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,696
How could you not know this, child?

184
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,074
The answer is on the tapestry
which hangs before you.

185
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,870
Although I can no longer see it,
I remember it well.

186
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,541
There is a figure
in the upper left corner.

187
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,210
After a thousand years of darkness,

188
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:15,381
he will come, clad in blue
and surrounded by fields of gold

189
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,885
to restore mankind's connection
with the Earth that was destroyed.

190
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:24,974
And he will guide the people of
this planet at last to a land of purity.

191
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,727
Lord Yupa, are you searching
for the man in blue?

192
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,812
I thought that was just a myth.

193
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,190
It is a myth.
Obaba is just teasing me.

194
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,900
Not true.
That is the goal you seek.

195
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:40,489
The only goal I seek is to understand
the mysteries of the toxic jungle.

196
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,785
I want to know if mankind
is truly fated to be swallowed up by it.

197
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,122
Or if there is still some hope
that we may survive.

198
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,999
I want to know the truth.

199
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,348
I wish there was something
I could do to help Lord Yupa.

200
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,521
[wind howling]

201
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,660
[Mito] Princess?
Princess?

202
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,621
Mito? What is it?

203
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,207
Gol has detected
something in the wind.

204
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,210
All right, I'll be right there.

205
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,927
What's going on?

206
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,387
There's a good storm brewing, princess,

207
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,890
and I'm afraid
something's not right.

208
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,322
[gasps]

209
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,618
There it is. Up there!

210
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,000
It's an airship.

211
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,753
What in the world is an airship
doing way out here?

212
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,172
What's going on?

213
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,674
Lord Yupa, there's an airship.

214
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,717
- Are you sure?
- Here he comes.

215
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,809
It's enormous.

216
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,353
[rumbling grows louder]

217
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,646
[all gasps]

218
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,152
It's a Tolmekian ship.

219
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,404
It's in trouble!

220
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,781
They're trying to make
an emergency landing.

221
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,950
- Help me launch, Gol.
- What?

222
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,702
Princess, it's too dangerous.

223
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,620
I'll just guide them to the shore.

224
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,208
Here they come.

225
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,295
All right, princess.
Ready to launch!

226
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,796
Teto, hold on.

227
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,479
[gasps]

228
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,453
Oh, no, they must have landed
in the jungle and angered the insects!

229
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,207
Turn your ship!
You're gonna crash!

230
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,168
Turn the ship!

231
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,924
Turn!

232
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,773
- It's down.
- The princess.

233
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,900
They crashed, by the sea cliffs!

234
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,984
Let's go!

235
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,736
- Everyone, to the cliffs!
- [all clamoring]

236
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,488
Let's go! Let's go!

237
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,554
[groans]

238
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,974
There she is. She's alive.

239
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,435
[straining]

240
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,703
[gasps] Where am I?

241
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,038
Don't talk. You're in
the Valley of the Wind.

242
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,540
[gasps]

243
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,514
I am Lastel... [groans]

244
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,183
<i>Lastel of Petite.</i>

245
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,436
You must... burn the cargo.

246
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,021
The cargo?

247
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,939
I beg of you, burn everything.

248
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,858
Yes, Lastel, I understand.

249
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,943
Everything is burning.
Don't you worry.

250
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,070
- [man] Look over there!
- [man 2] Where?

251
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,947
Thank God.

252
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,032
Princess!

253
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,534
- [man] Get that fire out!
- [man 2] Yes, follow me!

254
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,994
[man] Every direction!

255
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,371
- [man 2] We need more men!
- [man 3] Hurry!

256
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,541
[men continue shouting]

257
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,879
A princess of Pejite?
What's she doing on a Tolmekian ship?

258
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,726
Everybody, get out now!
There's an insect in there.

259
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,936
No, oh, no!

260
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,229
[chirping]

261
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,148
[man] Oh, no! It's calling for help!

262
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,232
[man 2] Maybe it can't fly?

263
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,193
[man 3] Get your guns! Don't shoot!

264
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,236
You'll enrage every insect
in the jungle.

265
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,988
I can kill it in one shot.

266
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,325
- You can't kill that with just a gun.
- Then what do you suggest?

267
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,409
Wait.

268
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,496
- Mito, will you get my glider, please?
- Right away.

269
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,415
[man] Princess!

270
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,708
Easy, princess.

271
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,677
[chirping stops]

272
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,388
[whistling]

273
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,391
You need to return to your jungle.
Understand?

274
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,686
- [chittering]
- You're strong. You can fly.

275
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,942
[man] Look! It's working!

276
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,902
There. That's a good boy.

277
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,529
[man] Give them room.

278
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,156
- Here you go, princess.
- Thanks, Mito.

279
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,670
- [man] Look, it's worked!
- [men cheering]

280
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,051
[man] Yes!

281
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,595
- Unbelievable!
- She did it!

282
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,099
Thank goodness. I'd hate to think
what would have happened

283
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,601
if the insects in the jungle
would've come to its aid.

284
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,773
[gasps]

285
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,243
An ohm...

286
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,254
[soft rumbling]

287
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,505
- [man] This row is clear!
- [man 2] Don't touch this area!

288
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,591
- [man] It's all clear.
- The west grove is open.

289
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,135
[man] Do you see any?

290
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,263
Over here! I found one!

291
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,389
They found one?

292
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,848
Down here.

293
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,102
That ship was infested
with spores, all right.

294
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,980
Good thing you found this
before it released its poisons.

295
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,943
Keep up the good work, son.

296
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,362
I'll keep searching
till I find every last one.

297
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,447
[indistinct chattering]

298
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,455
Ah! What in the world
do you think that thing is?

299
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,333
I don't know.
The fire didn't seem to harm it at all.

300
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,044
OK, everyone.
We'll examine this thing later.

301
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,630
Go help look
for spores in the fields.

302
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,050
Make sure you get
every last one of 'em!

303
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,804
What a mess those Tolmekians
dumped on us.

304
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,056
Mito, take a look at this.

305
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,141
What?

306
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,976
[pulsing rumble]

307
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,896
It's beating like a heart.

308
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,399
Looks like this thing is alive.

309
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,152
Lord Yupa, what is this?

310
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,739
While I was traveling,
I heard a frightening rumor.

311
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,158
It was said that a monster
from the old world

312
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,910
was unearthed from deep
beneath the city of Pejite.

313
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,413
A monster from the old world?

314
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,123
A giant warrior.

315
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,416
A giant warrior?

316
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,419
From the Seven Days of Fire?
That was a thousand years ago.

317
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,464
It can't be.

318
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,513
[Lord Yupal]
After they incinerated the Earth,

319
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,975
all the giant warriors were
said to have turned to stone.

320
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,855
Apparently, one has
lain dormant deep underground

321
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,440
for the past 1,000 years.

322
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,527
[Mito] If they unearthed it in Pejite,
what was it doing on a Tolmekian ship?

323
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,697
Tolmekia is far to the west,

324
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,824
and its rulers are very warlike.

325
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:11,536
That they had a Pejite hostage
on board worries me.

326
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,497
[men grunting]

327
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,000
- Take care of the rest, will you?
- Right.

328
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,970
- [squeaking]
- What can that be?

329
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,893
[rumbling]

330
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,895
- [gasps] What's that?
- What's that?

331
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,106
[people murmuring]

332
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,651
[panicked chatter, shrieking]

333
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,746
Tolmekian airships!
Get everyone to the castle!

334
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,706
[Nausicaa] Out of the way!

335
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,504
[panting]

336
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,798
Everyone, to the castle!

337
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,008
Everyone, to the castle!

338
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,635
Hurry! [gasps]

339
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,596
They're after Father!

340
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,015
Move out! Move!

341
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,142
Go!

342
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,026
Obaba, quickly, hide yourself.

343
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,695
[Obaba] I think I'll stay right here.

344
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,243
[man] Go, go! Go!

345
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,746
Up there.

346
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,337
- [gunshots]
- [gasps]

347
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,214
[girl] Princess!

348
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,555
[gasps]

349
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,690
- I'll kill you!
- [all grunting]

350
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,862
- [screaming]
- [grunts]

351
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,573
[growling]

352
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,923
- Nausicaa!
- [screaming]

353
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,303
Don't move.

354
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,264
This ohmu shell knife
can slice right through

355
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,309
that Xerconian ceramic armor of yours.

356
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,728
[man] That's Lord Yupa,
the sword master.

357
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,147
Soldiers of Tolmekia, hear me now.

358
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,691
Last night, the people of this valley
risked their lives

359
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,236
attempting to prevent
your airship from crashing.

360
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:53,031
And just this morning, they finished
giving your dead a proper burial.

361
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,533
This may be a small kingdom,

362
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,410
but it clearly deserves
your courtesy and respect.

363
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,955
If you are here to make war,
there must be a reason,

364
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,541
and it's only right
to first send a messenger

365
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,292
to announce your grievances.

366
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,212
[shuddering]

367
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,465
[Lord Yupal]
Nausicaa, be calm.

368
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,387
If you fight now, the people
of the valley will be massacred.

369
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,890
We must stay alive and wait
for the right opportunity.

370
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,434
[groaning]

371
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,727
I'm going to...

372
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,689
- [woman] Put it down, Kurotowa.
- But she...

373
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,737
Oh, fine. But look at this mess.
Now I must acquire all new men.

374
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,740
So, you're Lord Yupa,
the greatest swordsman in the land.

375
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,702
I'm offended that you think
we need reprimanding.

376
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,621
We're not savages who've
come to massacre your people.

377
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,708
We're here to talk. So would you put
your knife away? Please?

378
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,132
[man] Ah, beat it.

379
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,849
[man] Secure the room.

380
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,950
[low murmurs]

381
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,625
- It's the princess.
- The princess.

382
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,668
- [woman] She's OK.
- [excited murmurs]

383
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,632
[man] Listen now.

384
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,134
You will be addressed
by Her Highness Kushana,

385
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,345
commander of the Tolmekian army.

386
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,096
Villagers,

387
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,891
we have come to your land
in the name of peace.

388
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,311
Our goal is to unify the kingdoms
surrounding Tolmekia,

389
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,521
and build a world of prosperity.

390
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,316
You now live at the edge of the jungle,

391
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,776
on the verge of extinction.

392
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,320
Follow us, and join our enterprise.

393
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,489
We shall put the toxic jungle
to the torch

394
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,242
- and resurrect this land together.
- Burn the toxic jungle?

395
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,327
Is that possible?

396
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,246
I have in my possession
mankind's greatest tool,

397
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,166
the awesome force which
once allowed human beings

398
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,334
to rule the Earth.

399
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,629
I guarantee that those who join me

400
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:18,259
will live without fear of the insects
or the jungle's poisons ever again.

401
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,139
[Obaba) Stop! Stop, I say!

402
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,144
You must not touch
the toxic jungle.

403
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,063
What are you babbling about, woman?

404
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,523
Guards, take her away.

405
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,400
No, let her speak.

406
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:38,863
Since the origin of the toxic jungle,
1,000 years ago,

407
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:42,200
people tried time and again
to burn it.

408
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:46,746
But time and again, their attempts
did nothing but enrage the ohmu,

409
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,083
and swarms of them
spilled from the jungle

410
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,294
and stampeded across the lands.

411
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,680
[Obaba] They toppled cities,
destroyed kingdoms

412
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,765
and killed thousands.

413
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,184
The ohmu could not be stopped.

414
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,562
Such rage did they feel,

415
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,065
the ohmu fought till
they died of starvation.

416
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:17,360
Then spores took root
in their corpses,

417
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:21,656
and the land soon
became part of the toxic jungle.

418
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,576
That's why you do not
interfere with it.

419
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,244
Silence, you old hag.

420
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,746
We will have none of your raving.

421
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,749
[Obaba] You won't?
How will you shut me up?

422
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:31,958
Will you kill me, too?

423
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,543
Ah, silence, I said!

424
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,086
Go ahead and kill me!

425
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,256
It'll be easier for you
to kill an old, blind woman

426
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,259
than it was for you
to murder our King Jihl!

427
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,677
- King Jihl?
- [all gasping]

428
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,220
What? He was bedridden!

429
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,598
[man] You murderers!
You'll pay for this!

430
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,850
We won't let you
get away with this!

431
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,228
Silence them!
No mercy for the insolent.

432
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,607
Quiet, everyone, please.
I need everybody to listen to me.

433
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,193
[clamoring stops]

434
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:02,572
I can't bear to have
anyone else die.

435
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,616
I beg of you...

436
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,744
Princess.

437
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,456
Obaba, please understand.

438
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,375
We need to do
as the Tolmekians say.

439
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,879
[sad murmurs, sobbing]

440
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,936
[man] Move! Move!

441
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,482
[man] Heave! Heave! Heave!

442
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,403
[man] Set it down over there.

443
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,573
Let's go. Come on!

444
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,162
Nice valley.
I think we should keep it.

445
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,914
I must object, Your Highness.

446
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:57,043
Our orders are to transport the giant
warrior back to Tolmekia immediately.

447
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,254
Those orders cannot be carried out.

448
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,964
The giant warrior is so heavy,

449
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,341
even our largest ship
couldn't transport it.

450
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,095
Your Highness, you can't
want to stay and start a new kingdom?

451
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,180
Then what should I do?

452
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,015
You really think I should
deliver that monster

453
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,601
as a plaything
for those fools back home?

454
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,062
Ah, yes, I do see your point.

455
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,022
But I am just
a soldier of Tolmekia.

456
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,358
I am not in a position
to make that decision.

457
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,402
Hmm. Weasel.

458
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,157
I'm reporting back to Pejite.

459
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,368
While I'm gone,
begin to awaken the warrior.

460
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,452
Right.

461
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,246
[Kushana] They have a gunship?

462
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,374
[Kurotowa] Yes, an unexpected find
for such a quaint valley.

463
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,210
[Kushana] Those are my orders.

464
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,921
I'll leave for Pejite
first thing in the morning.

465
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,299
But, Kushana, why must
the princess go with you?

466
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,552
Aren't five hostages,
food and the gunship enough?

467
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,305
Select your five hostages
and load up the cargo barge

468
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,140
before tomorrow's departure.

469
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:55,894
[man] Take it all.

470
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,188
- [men grunting]
- We leave nothing here.

471
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,695
Mito, thank you
for accompanying the princess.

472
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,740
I'm glad to go.
But look at those greedy Tolmekians.

473
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,450
They're stripping us of everything.

474
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,618
Don't worry about that.

475
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,537
Our only concern is that
the warrior stay dormant.

476
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:17,874
I'm going to leave the valley, then I'll
slip back and wait for my chance.

477
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,958
Good luck.

478
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,503
[knocking continues]

479
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,671
[Yupa] Nausicaa?

480
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:43,191
- Teto, where has Nausicaa gone?
- [chittering]

481
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,606
[gasps]

482
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:34,993
[gasps]

483
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,539
Nausicaa, what are you doing here?

484
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,750
This chamber is filled
with toxic plants.

485
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,129
I collected the spores and
grew them down here myself.

486
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,297
Don't worry.
The plants aren't poisonous.

487
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,466
They're not poisonous?

488
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,929
[sniffs] It's true.
The air is pure in here.

489
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,849
But I know these plants
from the jungle.

490
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,059
These are some of the most lethal.

491
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,270
I irrigated this chamber using water

492
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,231
drawn from deep underground
by the castle windmill.

493
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,985
I used soil drawn from there as well.

494
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,821
I found that, with clean water and soil,

495
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:15,158
the plants from the toxic jungle
aren't poisonous.

496
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,285
All the poison is in the soil.

497
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,079
Even the topsoil in our valley
is polluted.

498
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:26,419
But I don't understand who
could've polluted the entire Earth.

499
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,464
You discovered this
all on your own?

500
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,843
Yes. I was hoping to find
a cure for Father's illness.

501
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,928
But... [sobs]

502
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,099
It's too late now.
I'm shutting down.

503
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,311
I've already cut off the water.

504
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,355
Soon, these plants
will wither and die.

505
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,693
[sobbing]

506
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,203
Nausicaa.

507
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,247
[Nausicaa] I'm afraid of myself,
Lord Yupa.

508
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:07,460
I had no idea that my rage
could drive me to kill.

509
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:11,339
[sobbing]
No more killing. It has to stop.

510
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,367
[murmuring]

511
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,371
[children] Princess Nausicaa!

512
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,125
We gathered these for you.

513
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,627
- Chiko nuts.
- You can take them on your trip.

514
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,880
Oh, my.

515
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,258
There are so many.

516
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,468
You must have worked
very hard.

517
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,387
[children sobbing]

518
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,930
Thank you.

519
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,515
I'll think of you
when I eat them.

520
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,350
[child] We don't want you to go.

521
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,810
Hurry up! Get in the ship.

522
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,398
- [sobbing]
- All right, I must go now.

523
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,026
There's no need to cry.
I'll be back very soon, OK?

524
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,319
You mean it?

525
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,781
Of course! Have I ever
broken a promise to you?

526
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,241
No.

527
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,660
- See?
- Mm-hm.

528
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,663
- You'll come back, huh?
- Mm-hm.

529
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,582
Now, be good while I'm gone.

530
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,708
We will. OK.

531
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:29,792
Bye!

532
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,756
[all] Bye, princess!

533
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,810
- Good luck!
- Take care of the princess!

534
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:48,895
Protect her!

535
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,989
Hey, Niga, aren't we in Pejite yet?

536
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,450
Yeah, hurry it up.
My back is killing me.

537
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,912
Good Lord, no wonder they
sent you two off to be hostages.

538
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,790
- All you do is complain.
- [laughing]

539
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,960
Hey, doesn't this
formation seem strange?

540
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,878
Why are we flying
so close together?

541
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:56,963
[man] Yeah.

542
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,173
It's as if they fear an attack.

543
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:18,192
The air beneath the clouds must
be charged with poisonous gas.

544
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,866
[gasps]

545
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,203
- What?
- [man] Hey, sit down.

546
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,792
It's a gunship!

547
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,296
[man] Enemy ship!
We're under fire!

548
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,423
Your Highness,
they're attacking us!

549
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,717
- [Nausicaa gasps]
- [all shouting]

550
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,804
- [alarm blaring]
- [man] Our number two ship is down!

551
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,104
[man] What did I tell you?

552
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:59,108
- [man 2] This is terrible!
- [all scream]

553
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,696
[man] He's coming in from below!

554
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,240
- [man 2] That's a Pejite gunship!
- Pejite?

555
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,129
[man] Three's been hit!
Signal from three!

556
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,839
They can't steer!

557
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,092
- [man] Where's our fighter plane?
- These are some flimsy ships.

558
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,436
He's hit the rear guard!

559
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,063
[gasps]

560
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,776
The barge detached.

561
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,034
Teto, come on.

562
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,054
We're going down.
We got to get out of here.

563
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,138
Princess!

564
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:20,064
Stop it!
All this killing must stop!

565
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,658
You must stop!

566
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,493
[gasps]

567
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,679
Princess!

568
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,347
- [explosion]
- [yells]

569
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,188
This way, Mito.

570
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,400
[Mito groaning] Princess,
where are you going?

571
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,074
- Let's try the gunship.
- What?

572
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,453
Mito, hurry up!

573
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,246
Uh, right.

574
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,249
Start the engine.
Then we'll shoot the door open.

575
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,333
Got it!

576
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,838
[gasps]

577
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,676
Come on!

578
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,136
[Nausicaa] Hurry!

579
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:35,890
Here, get in!

580
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,434
- Can we launch?
- I hope so.

581
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,397
- Open the throttle to full, then fire.
- [Mito] Roger.

582
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,774
[Nausicaa] Ready? Now!

583
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,371
[Nausicaa] Put on your masks.
I'm going below the clouds

584
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,373
to rescue the cargo barge.

585
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,261
Hold on, Teto. Don't die.

586
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:32,238
[Mito] Look at this. I've never seen
the poison this dense before.

587
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,615
Mito, watch the starboard
side of the ship.

588
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,742
We should come across
the barge any minute.

589
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:37,826
Roger.

590
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,453
[Nausicaa] It should be gliding.

591
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,455
[Mito] There it is!

592
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,332
Down to the right.

593
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,806
[all] Princess! Nausicaa!

594
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,517
Hold on.
I'll throw you a tow rope.

595
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,021
The towing hook broke.
We can't be towed.

596
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,065
I don't want to land in the jungle.

597
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,858
The insects will eat us alive!

598
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,569
We'd rather jump to our deaths.

599
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:15,072
Calm down. Dump the cargo,
and we'll help you land.

600
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,074
- [men] Goodbye.
- [man] Nice knowing you!

601
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,035
[Mito] Listen to me.
Just dump the cargo.

602
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,413
Mito, cut the rear engine.

603
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,915
- What?
- Just do as I say. Hurry!

604
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,334
- All right.
- [all gasp]

605
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,674
Princess, what are you doing?

606
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,179
- [man] Put on your mask!
- [man 2] You'll die!

607
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,514
[man] Put it back on!

608
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,726
Listen, please.
Dump your cargo and glide down with us.

609
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,019
You'll be just fine.

610
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,938
[man] Whatever you say!
Just put your mask on!

611
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:50,024
Do it now, please!

612
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,072
Look at her smiling.

613
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,158
She actually thinks
we're going to be OK.

614
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,409
Hurry! Dump the cargo!

615
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,580
Start the engine.
We'll look for a place to land.

616
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,499
Ah, I inhaled some of that poison.

617
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,795
- [man] Hurry up!
- [man 2] This is wasteful!

618
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,255
[man] Don't think about it. Hurry.

619
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,037
- [men clamoring]
- [man] What do we do? Princess!

620
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,123
- Is everyone OK?
- [all] Yeah.

621
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,375
- [woman] Don't move.
- You.

622
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,506
Thank you for rescuing me,
Nausicaa.

623
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,342
Princess, you brought her
with you on purpose?

624
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,719
You're too naive.

625
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,972
You shouldn't think we're best friends
now, just because you saved me.

626
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,642
Listen, you don't understand the jungle.

627
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,105
This is no place for guns.
If you fire that here,

628
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,150
the insects will descend upon us
in seconds.

629
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,361
They're already enraged
from all your ships

630
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,655
crashing into their jungle.

631
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:05,242
- Look at them swarming.
- [insects buzzing]

632
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,919
The giant dragonflies
are the sentries of the jungle.

633
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,380
Soon, they'll summon hordes
of insects to this site.

634
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,425
We must get out of here now.
Bring me your extra rope. Quickly.

635
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,385
- [men agreeing]
- Mito, repair their towing hook.

636
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,470
- Right.
- Oh.

637
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,640
Don't move.
I'm the one who gives the orders.

638
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,976
What are you so afraid of?

639
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,604
You act like a scared
little fox-squirrel.

640
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,439
What did you call me?

641
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,816
Don't be afraid.
There's nothing to fear.

642
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,110
I just want you to go back
to your own country.

643
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:43,614
How dare you
talk to me that way? [shrieks]

644
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,365
[grunting]

645
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,791
They're here.

646
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,639
- [gasps]
- Stay calm.

647
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,891
Whatever you do,
don't startle them.

648
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,018
We're in the middle
of an ohmu nest!

649
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,896
- [whimpering]
- We're surrounded!

650
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,628
They're examining us.

651
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:44,007
Ohmu, please forgive us
for disturbing your nest.

652
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,592
We're very sorry.

653
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,596
We are not your enemies.
We mean you no harm.

654
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,700
[whimpering]

655
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,661
- Princess?
- [gasps]

656
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,472
[child singing]

657
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,267
[singing fades]

658
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,980
[gasps] The pilot from Pejite.

659
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,483
He's still alive? Ohmu, wait!

660
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:40,666
What's going on?

661
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,669
- Their eyes are red with rage!
- [all yell]

662
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,805
Princess, what in the world
do you think you're doing?

663
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,392
Take off as soon as the waters are calm,
wait for me above the cloud line.

664
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,061
If I'm not back in one hour,
return to the valley.

665
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,145
Are you crazy?

666
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,523
[Mito] Princess, no!

667
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,666
[man] The princess is gone.

668
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,502
[Mito] Why don't I take that for you?

669
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:32,676
All right, let's do
as the princess said.

670
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,223
She better be OK.

671
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,227
[squealing]

672
00:58:58,452 --> 00:58:59,453
<i>Whoa!</i>

673
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,498
I'm trapped.

674
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,336
- [gun clicks]
- It's jammed.

675
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,714
Ah!

676
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,385
[screaming]

677
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,271
No... Ah!

678
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:42,037
- Who are you?
- You've done far too much killing.

679
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,248
My insect charm and flash grenade
won't do any good now.

680
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:55,801
[screams]

681
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,925
[groans]

682
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:43,974
[gasps]

683
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,769
Quicksand.

684
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:53,900
No!

685
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,617
Oh! [panting]

686
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,751
[buzzing]

687
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,261
[man] It's already been two hours.

688
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,555
[Mito] More insects keep coming
by the minute.

689
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,390
[man] Princess, where are you?

690
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,101
Princess!

691
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,033
[man, echoing] Nausicaa.

692
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,993
Nausicaa.

693
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,539
Come here.

694
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:54,419
- [child singing]
- Come here, child.

695
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,589
[young Nausicaa] Father!

696
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,100
[young Nausicaa] Mother's here, too?

697
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,612
[young Nausicaa] Wait.
Don't go this way.

698
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:24,407
Stay away! Ah!

699
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,873
Get back. There's nothing here.
Stay away from me. Please go.

700
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:33,875
[crackling sound]

701
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,381
Get back inside.

702
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,925
She's got a baby ohm...

703
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,469
The insects have bewitched her.

704
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,806
Hand it over, child.

705
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,767
[young Nausicaa] No.
It hasn't done anything wrong.

706
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:54,104
[man] Insects and humans
cannot live in the same world.

707
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,355
You know that.

708
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,276
[shrieks]

709
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,822
You knew that.

710
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:09,035
Don't kill it!
Please, don't kill it!

711
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,579
Please. [sobbing]

712
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:21,548
[child singing returns]

713
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,386
- [squeaks]
- [singing stops]

714
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,266
Teto.

715
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:36,122
- What a strange place.
- [footsteps approaching]

716
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,168
[panting] Hey!

717
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,253
I found your glider.

718
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:43,797
How are you feeling?

719
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,424
Where are we?

720
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:49,594
I should introduce myself first.

721
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,471
I'm Asbel from
the land of Pejite.

722
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,765
I'd like to thank you for saving me.

723
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,477
I'm Nausicaa.
I'm from the Valley of the Wind.

724
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,230
What is this place?

725
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,942
[laughing] You're not
going to believe this.

726
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,027
We're actually beneath
the toxic jungle.

727
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,654
Beneath the jungle?

728
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,740
Yeah. See that? We fell
through that hole there.

729
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,117
Along with a bunch of sand.

730
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,663
[gasps] How can we be breathing
without our masks?

731
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,791
I don't know. Somehow the air
down here is clean.

732
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,085
I couldn't believe it, either.

733
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,879
I never dreamed the toxic jungle
could be like this.

734
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,179
What's wrong?

735
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,235
Nausicaa,
don't wander off too far.

736
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,593
What a magnificent tree.

737
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,226
[water trickling]

738
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:29,027
It's dead, but water's
still flowing through it.

739
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,356
This is like the sand
from the bottom of our well.

740
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,533
It looks like these trees
must die and fossilize,

741
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,117
and then crumble into sand.

742
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:37,804
Nausicaa?

743
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,310
Are you crying?

744
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,524
It's OK, though.

745
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,360
I'm just happy.

746
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,422
I can't believe she's dead.
Lastel was my twin sister.

747
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,841
I wish I could have
been there for her.

748
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:18,136
I'm sorry.
I was too late to save her.

749
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,220
No.

750
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,180
I apologize.

751
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,433
You took care of my sister
while she was dying,

752
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,268
and I just shot down your ship.

753
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,061
It's OK.

754
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:30,565
So, the giant warrior's
in the Valley of the Wind now.

755
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,026
[crunching]

756
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,403
[groans]

757
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,116
Ugh, these nuts taste awful.
What are they?

758
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,786
They're called Chiko nuts.
They're supposed to be good for you.

759
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:59,177
[mouth full] Why is it everything that's
good for you tastes so bad?

760
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,553
[laughing]

761
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,024
What's the origin of the jungle?

762
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:16,069
You sure spend a lot of time
thinking about strange things.

763
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,530
The trees of the toxic jungle
must have evolved

764
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:23,326
to purify the Earth of all the pollution
that we humans have made.

765
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:27,330
The trees absorb the pollution
so it becomes inert.

766
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:31,584
Then they die and petrify
and crumble into purified sand.

767
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,587
That's how these underground
caverns must've been formed.

768
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,925
And the insects, they evolved
to guard this place.

769
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,762
If that's true, then mankind
is destined to go extinct.

770
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,348
It'll take centuries
for these trees to cleanse the Earth.

771
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,975
We can't survive
with insects that long.

772
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,688
Somehow, we are going to
have to find a way

773
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,856
to stop this toxic jungle
from spreading.

774
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,859
You Pejites sound
just like the Tolmekians.

775
01:09:56,943 --> 01:10:00,905
What? We are nothing like
those bloodthirsty Tolmekians.

776
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:03,032
We'd never use the warrior
as a weapon.

777
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,868
Let's get some sleep, Asbel.

778
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:08,996
We'll need our strength
to make it to Pejite tomorrow.

779
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,437
[pulsing]

780
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,772
- [man] All is well, sir.
- [Kurotowa] Fine, fine.

781
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,235
- [Kurotowa)] Everything going smoothly?
- Yes, sir.

782
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,571
The warrior's torso
is almost developed.

783
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:08,598
[Kurotowa] I swear, the more I gaze at
you, the more attractive you get.

784
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,851
You're awakening
long-forgotten ambitions,

785
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,103
even in a lazy
old soldier like me.

786
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,984
Oh, is that a smile?

787
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:24,030
Perhaps you should remain buried
deep beneath the Earth after all.

788
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,324
- Sir!

789
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:29,285
Her Highness's fleet was attacked
by a survivor from Pejite.

790
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,412
All but one of her ships
were destroyed.

791
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:33,456
[Kurotowa] What happened
to Her Highness?

792
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,877
According to our reports,
her ship exploded in midair.

793
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,838
[man] How shall we proceed, sir?

794
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:44,133
Do the villagers know that
their princess's ship went down?

795
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:45,843
- No, sir.
- Good. Keep it that way.

796
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:48,429
Continue working as if
nothing has changed.

797
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:49,514
[all] Yes, sir.

798
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:58,356
So, is this lowly soldier
finally on the path

799
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,149
to fame and fortune,

800
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,860
or on the path to destruction?

801
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,204
Lord Yupa,
Mito and the others are back.

802
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,706
They're all waiting for you
at the Acid Lake.

803
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,800
Down there.

804
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:39,480
[Mito] We shouldn't have returned
without the princess.

805
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:42,233
[Yupa] No, I'm glad that
all of you are safe.

806
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,864
You're letting me go?

807
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:51,742
[Yupa] Yes, granted that you drown
the giant warrior in the Acid Lake

808
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:53,619
and then return to your kingdom.

809
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,289
You have very few soldiers
left in the valley.

810
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,374
We could easily defeat
your forces now,

811
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,877
but I see no point in further killing.

812
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,254
The warrior can't be
drowned or destroyed,

813
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:06,507
and until it walks on its own,
it can't be moved.

814
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:07,925
Don't you understand?

815
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,720
It's too late.
There's no turning back now.

816
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,180
I was ordered to attack Pejite
because we feared

817
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:16,058
another kingdom would get
a hold of the warrior's power.

818
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,896
Once its existence is known,
all the remaining kingdoms

819
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,481
will send their armies
here to claim it.

820
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:27,069
You really only have
one choice, Lord Yupa.

821
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,280
Revive the giant warrior.

822
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,365
Use it to repel
the invading kingdoms

823
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,784
and learn to live
with the monster.

824
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:34,869
Look.

825
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,789
[gasping]

826
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:41,751
Hmm, an insect did that?

827
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,961
That's right, and whatever
lucky man becomes my husband

828
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,755
will see worse than that.

829
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,590
The insects must be stopped.

830
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,801
Revive the warrior and use it
to destroy them and their jungle.

831
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,639
<i>Steal it from us
as we stole it from Petite.</i>

832
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:56,349
That's what I'd do if I were you.

833
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,979
No, we will keep the warrior
dormant as it was meant to be.

834
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,231
[gasping] Lord Yupa!

835
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:05,316
Emergency!

836
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,109
You gotta give us the password.

837
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:09,070
- I'm in a hurry!
- Wind?

838
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,404
- Valley!
- OK.

839
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,783
- Some of the spores survived!
- What? In the valley?

840
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:17,244
They're spreading poison everywhere.
The whole valley's in a panic.

841
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:19,664
[panicked murmuring]

842
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,167
[woman] It's poison! See them?

843
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,004
- [clamoring]
- [man] We need to do something.

844
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,298
- Hurry!
- [man 2] Before it's too late!

845
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:34,220
If we don't do something fast,
the whole valley will be destroyed.

846
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:38,975
If we give them tools to burn the
spores, they could use them against us.

847
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:41,811
We have no choice.
Hand over everything but their guns.

848
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:42,895
Yes, sir.

849
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,898
- Sir, the ship is ready.
- Try not to fail this time.

850
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,359
Assemble all the Tolmekian soldiers
left in Pejite

851
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,444
- and bring them to the valley.
- Yes, sir.

852
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:53,823
What a mess.
This is starting to look bad already.

853
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,992
[all shouting] Come on! Hurry!

854
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,368
Let's go! Let's go!

855
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,247
Good luck finding the princess.

856
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,291
Take care of the valley,
and don't do anything rash.

857
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,418
[all] Yes, sir.

858
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,341
Come on.
Let's get back to the valley.

859
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,761
[all shouting]

860
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,851
[grunting]

861
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:24,228
Check it!

862
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,022
[man] Oh, no!

863
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:27,773
We're too late.

864
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,859
The spores have infested
the entire tree.

865
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:31,861
This one's infected, too!

866
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,321
[woman] This way! Get out of the way!

867
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:36,032
[man] Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

868
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,116
[grunting]

869
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,452
Oh, no. It's everywhere.

870
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,580
[man] Obaba.

871
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:47,376
[Obaba] This forest is doomed.
We must burn it down.

872
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:52,423
If we hesitate, the toxic jungle
will engulf the entire valley.

873
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,009
Isn't there some other way?

874
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:59,263
This forest has protected the valley
from the jungle's poisons for 300 years.

875
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:02,516
If only the Tolmekians
had never come.

876
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,485
It looks like things
are getting out of control.

877
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,653
We better get back there fast.

878
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:31,045
[Asbel] You think so?
Everything looks the same to me.

879
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,800
[Nausicaa] The insects
have left the jungle.

880
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:42,223
What's going on?
My heart's pounding like crazy.

881
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,685
[Asbel] Hey, we're almost there!
Pejite's just over that mountain.

882
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:10,209
Something strange is going on.
What's that haze over there?

883
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,340
Asbel, put your mask on!

884
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:21,804
[Asbel] The insects.
They're all dead.

885
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,306
- We've got to get to Pejite.
- Be careful.

886
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,851
The Tolmekian army
could still be there.

887
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,899
[fire crackling]

888
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,267
[gasps]

889
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:20,362
[Nausicaa] A dead ohm...

890
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,781
[Asbel] And the capital's
been destroyed.

891
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,544
<i>[Asbel] Petite is finished.</i>

892
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:39,131
It was far too much to pay, even if it
did get the Tolmekians out of our city.

893
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,218
"Too much to pay"?
Asbel, what are you talking about?

894
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,056
An airship.

895
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,391
It's one of ours!
They're landing. Let's go.

896
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:04,448
[man] Asbel, you're still alive.

897
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:07,493
What have you done to our city?
It's completely destroyed.

898
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,870
Don't worry. We can rebuild it.

899
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:12,414
And if the jungle starts to spread here,
we'll burn it off.

900
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:15,084
With what?
The giant warrior isn't here.

901
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,044
We know.
It's in the Valley of the Wind.

902
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:18,420
How do you know that?

903
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:21,882
[chuckles] We've already
made plans to get it back.

904
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,301
Our plan is being
executed as we speak.

905
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:27,554
All Tolmekians in the valley
will be dead...

906
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:31,433
- [Asbel] What?
- What are you planning to do?

907
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,227
Asbel, who is this?

908
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,022
She's the princess
of the Valley of the Wind,

909
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,066
and she saved my life.

910
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,526
- [men gasp]
- The Valley of the Wind?

911
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,486
Tell me. What is gonna happen?

912
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:49,368
Asbel, you know what the plan is.
You have to tell me.

913
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,205
We're going to bait insects
into the valley.

914
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:57,209
So you lured the insects
here into Pejite?

915
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:04,091
[sobbing]
What a monstrous thing to do.

916
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:08,053
We have to get the warrior
out of the hands of the Tolmekians,

917
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,805
no matter what it takes.

918
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:12,641
We're doing this for the good
of the planet. Understand.

919
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:15,644
Ah! The good of the planet?
You're killing my people!

920
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:18,814
Don't do this. I beg you!
Please, please, stop this now!

921
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,274
It's too late.

922
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:23,152
Once the insects start stampeding,
they can't be stopped.

923
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,532
The Tolmekians nearly
killed off all our people.

924
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:29,825
They must be stopped.

925
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,661
We have no other choice.

926
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:35,789
Stop her!

927
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:38,083
- [man] Stop her!
- [man 2] Grab her!

928
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,211
Let me go!

929
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:43,547
Ah, let me go!

930
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,428
Things may seem
bad to you now, princess,

931
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,306
but once we have the warrior, we'll burn
the jungle, and take back the Earth.

932
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:55,351
You savages.
You're just as bad as the Tolmekians.

933
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,854
You're wrong. The Tolmekians
want to take over the world.

934
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:01,523
Every one of us relies on water
from the wells,

935
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:04,526
because mankind has polluted
all the lakes and rivers.

936
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,445
But do you know why
the well water is pure?

937
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,781
The trees of the wasteland purify it.

938
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,532
And you plan to burn the trees down?

939
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,910
You must not burn down
the toxic jungle.

940
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:16,080
You should have left the warrior
beneath the Earth.

941
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:17,706
So what should we do?

942
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,792
Surrender and become
the slaves of the Tolmekians?

943
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,420
Don't you understand?
Asbel, tell them how the jungle evolved,

944
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:27,424
and how the insects are guarding it
so we won't pollute the world again.

945
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,968
Asbel, please?

946
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,889
- [grunts] What are you doing?
- Stay right there.

947
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,557
Let go of the princess, now!

948
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:38,394
- Calm down, Asbel.
- [gunshot]

949
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:39,895
[Asbel] Let her go!

950
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,021
I mean it!

951
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,315
Nausicaa, go back
and warn your people.

952
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:45,192
- [Asbel grunts]
- [Nausicaa gasps]

953
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,989
Asbel! Let me go!

954
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,517
[distant shouting]

955
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,274
What a bunch of fools.

956
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,613
I can't wait to beat the tar
out of those Tolmekians.

957
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,532
We said we wouldn't do
anything rash.

958
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,535
Don't panic.
Rescue the soldiers with the tanks.

959
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:37,619
Yes, sir.

960
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,538
The villagers just killed
our last field soldier.

961
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,499
- Are they heading for the castle?
- Not yet.

962
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,543
But more of them keep gathering.

963
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:48,630
All this over a little forest.
They're as annoying as the Pejites.

964
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,090
If they just calmed down...

965
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:55,554
- Look out!
- Huh?

966
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,432
[screaming]

967
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:02,352
They hijacked our tank.

968
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,607
- Get this thing moving!
- I'm going. Don't rush me.

969
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,610
- [man] Fire!
- Here they come!

970
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,361
Forward!

971
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:14,781
Come on, come on. Let's go.

972
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:16,533
Maybe it's this one.

973
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:19,620
Hey, it's doing something.

974
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,164
Niga, where are you going?

975
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,041
[all gasping, shouting]

976
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,837
What do you think you're doing?

977
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:31,173
- Go forward!
- I know. I know.

978
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,679
[man] The tank!

979
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,936
They're getting away!
Send out all the tanks! [gasps]

980
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,605
- [man] Your Highness.
- [man 2] Attention!

981
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:51,818
She's alive.
That dream didn't last long.

982
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,112
Your Highness!

983
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,910
We'll hold off the troops.

984
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:03,121
You round up the villagers
and seek shelter by the Acid Lake.

985
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,582
- Right. Let's go!
- Come on!

986
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:09,628
We just have to lie low until
the princess returns in the gunship.

987
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,050
- [man] Don't slow down!
- [man 2] You can make it!

988
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:16,134
[man] Keep moving!

989
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,220
Don't just stand there.
Give me a hand.

990
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:19,596
But I have a bad back.

991
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,684
[Niga] Oh, get us out of here!
The tanks are coming!

992
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,397
[Niga] You're turning in circles.

993
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,940
- [man] I know, I know.
- [Niga] Go forward!

994
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:34,194
[man] We're hit!

995
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,705
- [alarm blaring]
- [grunting]

996
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,458
- What do you got, soldier?
- It's a ship from Pejite.

997
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,836
- I caught a glimpse beyond the clouds.
- Good work.

998
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:07,519
[man] Be careful. She's a wild one.

999
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,069
Quickly now.

1000
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:20,699
Nausicaa, we're going
to get you out of here

1001
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,951
SO you can warn
the people of the valley.

1002
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,621
There may still be enough time
if you take your glider.

1003
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:27,873
It's ready and waiting for you.

1004
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:31,001
Asbel told me everything
that has happened.

1005
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,253
I'm going to be taking
your place, princess.

1006
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:34,880
- Put this on.
- But who are you?

1007
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,424
I'm Asbel and Lastel's mother.

1008
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:41,219
[gasps] You're their mother.

1009
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,431
[sighs] Please, forgive us.

1010
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:46,892
What our people did
was horribly wrong.

1011
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:48,894
Hurry.

1012
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,985
[Nausicaa] What will happen to her?

1013
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,112
[woman] Don't worry. She'll be fine.

1014
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:03,200
- [woman] There she is.
- [woman 2] Yes, the princess.

1015
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,161
Please be careful.

1016
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,497
And forgive us for the way
you've been treated.

1017
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,749
- [Asbel] Nausicaa, this way.
- Here.

1018
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,793
- Hurry.
- [woman] Be careful.

1019
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:15,879
- [woman 2] Good luck.
- Thank you, everyone.

1020
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,798
Take care.

1021
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,883
I'm sorry it took me so long.

1022
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,136
Can you launch from here?

1023
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:24,971
I'll try.

1024
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:33,897
The Tolmekians!

1025
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,028
Get us out of here.
Head for the clouds!

1026
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:46,618
[man] Cease fire!

1027
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:54,292
They'll never survive. It's a pilot's
worst nightmare in those clouds.

1028
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:02,718
[man] This is suicide! I can't steer!

1029
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:05,512
[all screaming]

1030
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,227
The storm is tearing
the ship apart!

1031
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:15,772
It's no use! Our only hope is to get
out of these clouds and fight back!

1032
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,405
- Oh!
- They expected this.

1033
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:34,332
Look. What are they doing?

1034
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:38,003
Oh, no. They're trying to pin us against
the clouds so they can board our ship.

1035
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:48,805
[grunting]

1036
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,683
Open it up!

1037
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:55,729
They're coming in.
You got to get out of here now!

1038
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,439
I can't just leave you like this.

1039
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:00,275
Or your mother, or the girl
who took my place in the cell.

1040
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,068
You need all the help you can get!

1041
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,780
You have to save the people
of the valley. Please.

1042
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:07,115
Go, or my people
will never forgive themselves.

1043
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,366
- [gunshot]
- [both gasp]

1044
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:12,621
[man] Go, go, go!

1045
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:21,797
Take the ship.
I want every Pejite dead. Now.

1046
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,882
- [growls]
- [gasps]

1047
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,221
Go, Nausicaa, go!

1048
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:30,722
Asbel!

1049
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:30,532
There's the princess!

1050
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:32,826
Mito!

1051
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:36,580
[shrieks]

1052
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,835
Ha-ha!

1053
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:50,260
[Nausicaa] Mito, Lord Yupa,
the valley's in danger.

1054
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:54,264
- [Mito] Princess!
- Hurry! Hurry! Please!

1055
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,558
I'll send out
the docking hook now.

1056
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:59,477
Lord Yupa, pull the red lever
on your right.

1057
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:07,694
Why is this taking so long?
Knock it down.

1058
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:10,155
- [panicked murmurs]
- [baby crying]

1059
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:14,701
This door's gonna bust
any second now.

1060
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,786
Fine. Let them break it down.

1061
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,997
We must fight them
with honor and with dignity.

1062
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,709
What's behind us?

1063
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,002
A bird?

1064
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,505
- A gunship from the Valley of the Wind!
- What?

1065
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,303
- [groans]
- [all grunt]

1066
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:38,266
Get him! [grunts]

1067
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,395
[men scream]

1068
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:48,735
It's Lord Yupa.
Kill him, and you'll be famous.

1069
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:59,579
I suggest you surrender.
There's no ship coming to rescue you.

1070
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:00,664
This guy's tough.

1071
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:09,005
This is way too fast!
The engine's gonna burn out!

1072
01:31:09,089 --> 01:31:12,842
I don't care, as long as it holds out
until we get to the valley.

1073
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:14,010
Increase speed!

1074
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,554
Please, dear God,
please hear this prayer.

1075
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:19,057
You must protect
the people of the valley.

1076
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:29,609
- [coughing]
- [whispering]

1077
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:38,076
- [man] I don't like waiting.
- [man 2] Check your weapons.

1078
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:41,413
Well, this is dull.
Are they ever going to budge?

1079
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,999
- They're waiting for their princess.
- The princess?

1080
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,752
They expect her to come back here
and rescue them with their gunship.

1081
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,629
That gunship could be
a real pain in the neck.

1082
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:51,589
Should we start a fight now?

1083
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:54,259
Know anything about that old ship
they're hiding in?

1084
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:58,179
I've heard it was built
before the Seven Days of Fire.

1085
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:01,182
It's supposed to have traveled
everywhere, even to the stars.

1086
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:03,518
They say guns can't
penetrate its armor,

1087
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:07,105
- but I bet if you hit it just right...
- No, we'll wait for the princess.

1088
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,189
What?

1089
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:12,444
I want to see if she can make it back
alive from the middle of the jungle.

1090
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:16,823
If she's not dead, I'd like a chance
to get to know her.

1091
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:22,579
So, men, have you
made up your minds yet?

1092
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:26,124
If you advise the villagers
to surrender, I'll let you go.

1093
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:28,877
Or would you rather
end up like Pejite?

1094
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,714
It's strange that you're
a princess, too.

1095
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:35,675
You're not anything at all
like our princess.

1096
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,386
Ah, take a look at my hands.

1097
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:40,555
I have the same illness as King Jihl.

1098
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:44,559
Six months from now,
my hands will be as hard as rocks.

1099
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:49,856
But our princess told me that she truly
loves these beat-up old hands of mine.

1100
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,484
When she looks at these hands,

1101
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:55,236
she knows these
are the hands of a hard worker.

1102
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,073
How can you be so foolish?
The jungle is killing you,

1103
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,616
yet you want to live
in harmony with it?

1104
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,243
You plan to burn down the jungle,

1105
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:05,246
but we've learned to use fire
only in small amounts.

1106
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:08,583
That's right. Too much fire
gives birth to nothing.

1107
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:11,878
Fire can reduce a forest
to ashes in a day,

1108
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:15,924
while it takes the water and the wind
100 years to grow one anew.

1109
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,593
We prefer the ways
of the water and the wind.

1110
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:23,181
The princess will be devastated
when she sees that our forest is gone.

1111
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,935
Sir. Do we have any orders yet, sir?

1112
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:29,187
- Just shut up.
- Yes, sir.

1113
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:36,611
Something must have happened,
she's starting to look cute to me.

1114
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:39,614
Kurotowa, prepare the troops to attack.

1115
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:42,117
What? We're not going to wait?

1116
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,452
We'll begin the attack in one hour,

1117
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:46,704
so get the troops fed and ready to go.

1118
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:52,627
Ah, yes, food.
Plenty of time for a leisurely meal.

1119
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:54,712
Someone's coming.

1120
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:00,135
[gasps]

1121
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:03,388
Gol, what's wrong?

1122
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:07,058
- The wind has died.
- There's no wind?

1123
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:10,979
I don't believe it.
It's never stopped before.

1124
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:14,190
- Ahhh!
- Obaba, what's the matter?

1125
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:15,483
[woman] Are you OK?

1126
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:18,403
Someone...
Someone, take me outside.

1127
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,071
Something is very wrong.

1128
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:28,538
- [all gasp]
- The wind has stopped blowing.

1129
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:37,505
[ringing]

1130
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:47,182
- Obaba, what's making my ears hurt?
- It's in the air.

1131
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:50,226
The atmosphere is saturated with anger.

1132
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:06,951
We're close.

1133
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:10,163
We've cleared the jungle.
Three minutes to the Acid Lake.

1134
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:13,499
Idle the engines.
Drop beneath the clouds.

1135
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:25,053
Princess, what's that red glow?

1136
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:27,222
Ohmul!

1137
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:38,775
- [rumbling]
- [ohmu squeaking]

1138
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:45,949
Look at them all.

1139
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:48,701
Every ohmu in the jungle
is headed straight for the valley.

1140
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:52,121
What's making them
stampede like that? [gasps]

1141
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:57,543
[distant squealing]

1142
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:59,712
Something out there
is calling to the herd.

1143
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:03,716
- Mito, pull the ship up to the left.
- [Mito] Roger.

1144
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:34,205
What's that?
Mito, send out a flare.

1145
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:36,249
[Nausicaa] Ready?

1146
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:38,376
Fire!

1147
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,171
[explosion]

1148
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:46,092
What the heck is that?

1149
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:49,554
[gasps]

1150
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,688
No, they've got a baby ohm...

1151
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:01,774
They're using the baby
to lure the herd into the valley.

1152
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,111
- I'll blast them out of the sky.
- No!

1153
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:09,282
[Nausicaa] Don't shoot, Mito!
Don't shoot!

1154
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:15,663
[Mito] What do you mean?

1155
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:19,000
[Nausicaa] If we kill the baby ohmu,
there'll be no way to stop the stampede.

1156
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:22,670
What are we supposed to do?
I can't watch our valley be destroyed.

1157
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:24,172
Don't worry, Mito.

1158
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:26,549
I'll get the baby ohmu back to the herd.
Just trust me.

1159
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:35,892
Hey, what are you doing?

1160
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:38,102
Go warn the valley!

1161
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:42,273
But, princess,
you don't even have a weapon.

1162
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:55,953
That flare is not one of ours,
Your Highness.

1163
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:58,331
- What's the range?
- Approximately 20 leagues.

1164
01:37:58,414 --> 01:37:59,582
Just the other side of the lake.

1165
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:02,835
- Is it the princess's gunship?
- Most likely.

1166
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,337
[whistling]

1167
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:07,590
- [explosion]
- [man] It's a flare.

1168
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:14,597
Yes, that's their distress signal.
It's the gunship, all right.

1169
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,349
Hour's up, Kurotowa. Let's go.

1170
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:20,311
- Sure you don't want to wait?
- No, I have chosen the bloody path.

1171
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:29,320
[man] Infantry, move out!

1172
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:36,661
- Won't you go in?
- I'm staying right here.

1173
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:45,753
Gunship!

1174
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:49,590
Fire!

1175
01:38:57,974 --> 01:39:02,270
[gasps] Hold your fire!
You idiot, stop it!

1176
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:07,275
- It's the princess's gunship!
- Princess!

1177
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:10,736
Wait for my orders.
Hold your fire!

1178
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,029
Your Highness!

1179
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:13,739
[gunshots continue]

1180
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,119
- What happened to the princess?
- Where is she?

1181
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:19,912
Shouldn't she be in the back seat?

1182
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:22,373
Listen up. A herd of ohmu
was coming this way.

1183
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,459
- They're what?
- [all] The ohmu?

1184
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:28,671
The princess stayed to try to stop
the stampede from reaching the valley.

1185
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:30,548
This is no time for a battle.

1186
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:33,759
Everybody, get to high ground.
Hurry!

1187
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:35,761
- The ohmul!
- Come on!

1188
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:41,142
Obaba, I see a red glow
in the distance.

1189
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:46,481
- It keeps getting bigger.
- It's coming this way.

1190
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:50,151
Just hold on tight
to Obaba, children.

1191
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:53,988
The ohmu will come.
There's nothing we can do about it.

1192
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:56,324
- [man] Quickly!
- [all clamoring]

1193
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,284
Don't panic.
Just keep moving forward.

1194
01:39:58,367 --> 01:39:59,452
Hurry!

1195
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:02,622
But, Mito,
we're going to die anyway.

1196
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:04,916
- We should die in the valley.
- No.

1197
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,543
As long as the princess
hasn't given up, we can't, either.

1198
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:10,755
Hold the ohmu off
for as long as possible.

1199
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,340
I'll be back with help.

1200
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:14,550
Your Highness, don't do it!

1201
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,260
It's not ready yet.

1202
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:19,680
If not now, Kurotowa,
then when? Move out!

1203
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:27,396
Don't shoot!
Listen to me, please!

1204
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,287
She flies like the wind!

1205
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:46,207
She's trying to tell us something.
We shouldn't shoot her.

1206
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:49,043
Anyone who interferes
with the plan is an enemy.

1207
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:52,046
Besides, if we don't release
this baby ohmu in the valley soon,

1208
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:53,965
we'll be the ones in trouble.

1209
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:59,095
Here she comes.
Wait till she gets close, and then fire.

1210
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:05,184
[gasps]

1211
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:14,443
- She's in range. Shoot her!
- I can't.

1212
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:16,487
- It's Lastel.
- [grunts]

1213
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:23,327
[all grunt]

1214
01:41:51,689 --> 01:41:52,690
[squeaks]

1215
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,860
[gasping]

1216
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:06,203
Ohmu... [groans]

1217
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:20,092
[grunting]

1218
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:35,650
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Don't be frightened.

1219
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:37,401
I'm not your enemy.

1220
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:43,240
[sobbing] I'm so sorry.

1221
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:45,618
Is there any way
you can forgive us?

1222
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:48,245
We've treated you so badly.

1223
01:42:56,545 --> 01:43:00,007
No, don't move.
You'll bleed to death.

1224
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:03,761
Come on. Be a good boy.
Hold still.

1225
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:07,723
- [rumbling]
- [gasps]

1226
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:15,022
Oh, no! They've found us!

1227
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:16,774
They're coming this way!

1228
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:20,736
No, you can't go in this lake
with wounds like that!

1229
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,447
This water's bad!
It's filled with acid!

1230
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:26,283
[screams]

1231
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:38,921
[grunts, cries in pain]

1232
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:47,054
[buzzing]

1233
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,399
Ohmu?

1234
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:07,742
[sobbing]

1235
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:30,014
You're so kind.
It's gonna be all right.

1236
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,975
Soon they'll be here
to take you home.

1237
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,484
Where are they going?
How can they be turning away?

1238
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:46,489
Ohmu, not that way!
You're headed straight for the valley!

1239
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:51,994
They must be blind with rage.

1240
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:54,413
- If I can't find a way to calm them...
- [crashing]

1241
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:09,136
[laughing] Those idiots!

1242
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,263
They're drawing the ohmu
with their fire.

1243
01:45:11,347 --> 01:45:13,808
- We're gonna live.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

1244
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:15,476
Help me tip this over.

1245
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:17,853
Wait!

1246
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:20,606
No, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

1247
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:22,650
You're gonna fly me
back to the herd,

1248
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:24,568
and we're gonna give
their baby back to them.

1249
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:27,154
There's no reason
to pull a stunt like that.

1250
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:30,115
- It's too late. The herd won't stop.
- [shrieking]

1251
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:34,620
You'll take us there and set us
down in front of the herd.

1252
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:38,082
- Now, let's get going.
- But there's no way you'll survive.

1253
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:41,418
[man] Fire! Fire! Fire!

1254
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:43,921
[murmuring]

1255
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:49,844
Obaba, are we all going to die?

1256
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:53,639
If that is to be our fate,
we can only wait and see.

1257
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:56,559
- They don't even flinch.
- I think we should retreat, sir.

1258
01:45:56,642 --> 01:45:59,645
Don't be stupid, soldier.
There's nowhere to retreat to.

1259
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,025
Hey, hold your position!

1260
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:06,318
Wait! Hold it!

1261
01:46:06,402 --> 01:46:08,821
Stand your ground
until Her Highness returns.

1262
01:46:08,904 --> 01:46:11,657
Where is she? [gasps]
Your Highness!

1263
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:23,627
[deep roaring growl]

1264
01:46:33,262 --> 01:46:35,931
- [all murmuring]
- [man] The giant warrior!

1265
01:46:36,015 --> 01:46:38,058
[man 2] It's him!

1266
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:39,643
[man 3] It's the warrior!

1267
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:44,189
- [all cheering]
- Now we got 'em!

1268
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:46,191
[woman] It's the giant warrior!

1269
01:46:58,495 --> 01:47:01,165
It's falling apart.
I knew it was too soon.

1270
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:11,759
Incinerate them!
What are you waiting for?

1271
01:47:11,842 --> 01:47:16,180
Were you not designed to be the most
evil creature on the face of the Earth?

1272
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:24,605
- [whimpering]
- [screaming]

1273
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:35,699
Amazing. No wonder
the world was incinerated.

1274
01:47:36,575 --> 01:47:38,369
[man] Hail to Kushana!

1275
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,382
Hit them again!

1276
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,635
Listen to me, warrior.
Fire on my command!

1277
01:47:54,718 --> 01:47:56,720
[growls]

1278
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:16,740
[shouting]

1279
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:18,659
Run!

1280
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:25,207
- [man] It's dead!
- [man 2] No!

1281
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:27,167
[man 3] We're doomed!

1282
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:29,753
- [man 2] Oh, no!
- [man 3] Run!

1283
01:48:32,965 --> 01:48:35,009
The giant warrior died.

1284
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:37,261
That's the way it should be.

1285
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:41,223
The anger of the ohmu
reflects the anger of the Earth.

1286
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:45,519
The Earth knows it's wrong
for us to survive

1287
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:48,689
if we have to depend
on a monster like that.

1288
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:51,775
- It's the princess!
- The princess is back!

1289
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:03,495
- [woman] Princess!
- [woman 2] What is she doing?

1290
01:49:03,579 --> 01:49:04,997
[man] She'll be killed!

1291
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,041
[chittering, squealing]

1292
01:49:22,056 --> 01:49:24,016
- [all gasp]
- [screaming]

1293
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:40,491
[people screaming]

1294
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:19,321
Look, the color's changing.
Their rage is subsiding.

1295
01:50:40,717 --> 01:50:43,512
The rage.
It's left the atmosphere.

1296
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:47,516
We're OK.
The ohmu have stopped running.

1297
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:07,536
- There's the princess!
- [crowd gasping]

1298
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:17,588
She's dead, Obaba. She's dead.

1299
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:22,426
The princess has quieted
the rage of the ohm...

1300
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:25,804
She gave her life
to save the valley.

1301
01:51:25,888 --> 01:51:28,849
[crowd sobbing]

1302
01:52:25,864 --> 01:52:27,950
[man] Look! Over there!

1303
01:52:32,496 --> 01:52:35,374
What is this?
What are these lights?

1304
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:41,338
[child singing]

1305
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:02,734
Teto.

1306
01:53:18,417 --> 01:53:19,876
I'm glad you're OK.

1307
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,963
Ohmu, thank you.

1308
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:24,214
Thank you!

1309
01:53:44,776 --> 01:53:45,777
It's a miracle!

1310
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:48,655
What beautiful creatures!

1311
01:53:48,739 --> 01:53:53,452
Who knew how wonderful
and caring the ohmu could be?

1312
01:53:54,536 --> 01:53:55,954
Children!

1313
01:53:56,038 --> 01:54:00,125
Look carefully and tell me
what these blind eyes cannot see.

1314
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:03,920
The princess is wearing a blue dress
I've never seen before.

1315
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:08,425
[child] It looks like she's walking
through a golden field.

1316
01:54:08,508 --> 01:54:10,469
[gasps]

1317
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,603
After a thousand years
of darkness,

1318
01:54:19,686 --> 01:54:24,399
he will come, clad in blue and
surrounded by fields of gold!

1319
01:54:24,483 --> 01:54:27,486
- [sobbing]
- What's the matter?

1320
01:54:27,569 --> 01:54:30,489
The legend has come true!

1321
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:33,784
Look there!

1322
01:54:34,534 --> 01:54:36,328
- [gasps]
- The glider!

1323
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:39,498
- [man] There's wind!
- [woman] The wind has come back!

1324
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:46,797
[all cheering]

1325
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:08,402
[laughing]

1326
01:56:58,595 --> 01:57:03,934
THE END
