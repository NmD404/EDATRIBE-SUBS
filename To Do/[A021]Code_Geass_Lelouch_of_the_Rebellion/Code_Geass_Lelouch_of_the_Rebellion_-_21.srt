1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,541
[C.C.]
Situations evolve.

2
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,916
Our desires have
no bearing on that.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,291
Time flows on,
unaffected by our struggles.

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,000
On this point,
Lelouch should be pleased,

5
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,458
for he possesses true
self-determination.

6
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:40,708
He can change destiny itself
by applying the absolute power

7
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,791
to compel anyone to obey him...

8
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,041
The power of Geass.

9
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,958
[TEACHER] Yes, it is true
that the invasion

10
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,250
by the Chinese Federation
and the terrorism

11
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,250
of the Black Knights
have disrupted our society.

12
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,458
But that is a completely
separate issue!

13
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,125
The fact remains you've both
been absent from class

14
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,291
far too often!

15
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,125
I don't care how
good your grades are

16
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,416
or that you're
Princess Euphemia's knight!

17
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,166
If you don't improve,
you will repeat this year!

18
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,125
Sounds like she's
still going strong.

19
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,208
She may carry on all night.

20
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,000
[LELOUCH sighs]

21
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,666
[YOUNG MAN] I'm telling you,
Zero's our savior!

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,916
Even Elevens can
move up in the world!

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,958
Just look at Suzaku Kururugi!

24
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,333
If it hadn't been for Zero,

25
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,708
the Chinese Federation
would have conquered Kyushu!

26
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,916
That isn't what
it said on the news.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,291
Cause the Britannians
control the media.

28
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,458
I don't care,
as long as there's peace.

29
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,791
The peace of slavery?

30
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,833
That's what Kururugi wants!

31
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,791
[OHGI] So opinions
in the ghettos are split?

32
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,375
[MINAMI] Some are submissive,
some are defiant.

33
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,500
[SUGIYAMA]
But they'll all be shocked

34
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,791
when they find out
Zero's goal

35
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,000
is to start an
independent nation.

36
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,833
[YOSHIDA] Yeah, right,
that's totally crazy.

37
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,916
[MINAMI]
We need to be realistic.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,666
[TAMAKI]
I agree with Zero.

39
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,375
[ALL]
Huh?

40
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,875
Well, isn't it true?

41
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,208
If we stick with him, we might
catch a huge lucky break.

42
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,541
Maybe I'll even get my dream
of being a bureaucrat.

43
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,375
A bureaucrat? Seriously?

44
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,333
Hey, even I had a dream once!

45
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,416
If I hadn't thrown in
with the Black Knights,

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,333
I'd probably be hooked
on Refrain by now!

47
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,958
[OHGI] Refrain might
bring back her memory

48
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,000
so I could find out
who Zero is.

49
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,125
But what would I do if I knew?

50
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,500
[KALLEN]
Ohgi?

51
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,000
On that other issue,

52
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,500
we wanted to ask
for instructions,

53
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,458
but we haven't
been able to reach Zero.

54
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,125
[OHGI] Then I'll just
go ahead as planned.

55
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,083
[TAMAKI] I'm telling you, don't.
It's a trap.

56
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,916
[KALLEN]
But we need inside sources.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,166
They also said
there's someone there

58
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,791
who wants to join us.

59
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,500
Anyway, tomorrow
is the only time

60
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,041
we'll be able to use
the escape route

61
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,083
that Diethard set up for us.

62
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,916
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for waiting!

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,916
The Ashford Academy
school festival,

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,416
which is the most open event
in the Tokyo settlement,

65
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,958
is about to start!

66
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,458
It will begin at
the sound of this voice!

67
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,625
Are you sure it's
all right to do this, Milly?

68
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,583
Very sure!

69
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,875
Okay.
[inhales]

70
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,291
[NUNNALLY]
Meow!

71
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,666
[CROWD cheering]

72
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,000
The school is
really noisy today.

73
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,500
Welcome! Step right up!

74
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,208
[GIRL]
Get your Britannian rolls!

75
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,833
[BOY] See the shocking
exposé: "The Zero Report!"

76
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,583
[GIRL] Photos!
Photos of Prince Clovis!

77
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,625
[LELOUCH]
That's what I thought.

78
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,958
So even Sawasaki and the others
turned out to be useful.

79
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,250
We've covered all
the tasks at hand.

80
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,125
[DIETHARD]
Yes.

81
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,625
We gathered all the sector data

82
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,416
on the emergency countermeasures
that they've left behind.

83
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,625
[LELOUCH]
The press?!

84
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,166
[DIETHARD] We've identified
the solar panels

85
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,916
used in each settlement as well
as the energy storage sites.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,125
Oh, and what about
that collaborator issue?

87
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,291
[LELOUCH] I've handled
most of it myself.

88
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,708
About 72 percent is complete.

89
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,208
And Tohdoh?

90
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,458
[DIETHARD] He's drawing up
a list of occupation targets:

91
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,500
broadcasting stations and such.

92
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,666
I need you to check them
including the dummy plans

93
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,375
we're sending to Kyoto.

94
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,666
[LELOUCH] I understand.
I'll confirm tomorrow.

95
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,958
Oh, and I know we're late
in reporting this to you,

96
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,500
but regarding the operation
of the Zero Squad, Ohgi has...

97
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,916
[MILLY] There's trouble!
There's huge, huge trouble!

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,458
I'll have to contact you later.

99
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,666
Hmm? Trouble?

100
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,458
[MILLY] What are you doing
goofing off like that?

101
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,833
You're the festival chairman!

102
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,333
But everything
is running fine.

103
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,708
There's no problem!

104
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,041
Besides, you're taking
charge of that part, right?

105
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,958
It was two meters
wide up through last year,

106
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,916
then suddenly you declared
we had to have a 12-meter pizza!

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,416
[MILLY]
Uh huh! Isn't it great?

108
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,916
It's going to be the largest one
of its kind in the world!

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,333
[LELOUCH] Just the oven
and the ingredients

110
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,666
are causing an uproar.

111
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,041
And now there's a TV crew
running around campus?

112
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,916
You know we can't
show our faces!

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,333
[MILLY] But we have to
document making the pizza!

114
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,041
You can run things from
the control booth, okay?

115
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,333
President's orders.

116
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,041
[RIVALZ]
All right, stop right there!

117
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,541
[NINA] Rivalz!
We're all set on this end!

118
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,916
Wow, you're in a sunny mood.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,750
Something good happen?

120
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,916
Yeah, you could say that!

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,625
[OHGI] Sorry, but an
Eleven from the ghetto

122
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,916
walking around alone would be--

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,291
[VILLETTA]
It's all right.

124
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,208
[OHGI] If you're afraid
that some Britannians, uh...

125
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,291
You needn't worry
about me so much.

126
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,791
I'm okay, really.

127
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,458
Anyway, is this going
to help you with your work?

128
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:31,541
[OHGI] Yes. I can gather data
for our development project.

129
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,333
I understand.
That's good, then.

130
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,041
[OHGI]
What the hell am I doing?

131
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,375
If I get the chance,

132
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,833
I should hand her over
to the cops or a hospital.

133
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,166
No, I can't.

134
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,416
If they connect me
to the Black Knights,

135
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,666
it would implicate everyone.

136
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,625
Even so, I can't just kill her!

137
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,083
I can't!

138
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,583
Here we are.

139
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,708
Is something wrong?

140
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,458
No, I used to be
a school teacher,

141
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,875
so I was feeling
a little nostalgic.

142
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,583
[VILLETTA]
Why did you stop teaching?

143
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,250
My best friend since
we were little kids...

144
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,291
Well, he's since passed on.

145
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,541
You could say that I'm living
out his dream in his place.

146
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,500
[OHGI] It's kind of a heavy
thing for me to carry around.

147
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,375
Let's go in.

148
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,541
[OHGI gasps]

149
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,250
No, I can't go into
a Britannian school!

150
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,291
I'm an Eleven!

151
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,916
[GIRL laughs]
That doesn't matter!

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,541
The campus is
open today! Come on!

153
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,791
Yeah, in you go, you two!

154
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,416
Wha--?
Hey, I found them first!

155
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,375
[SUZAKU]
That's a relief.

156
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,083
I thought you were never
going to come back to school.

157
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,791
It's on purpose?

158
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,500
Why didn't you tell anyone?

159
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,208
About who I really am?

160
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,958
[SUZAKU] You're Kallen Stadtfeld
right now, aren't you?

161
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,291
Not Kallen Kouzuki, right?

162
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,958
Are you trying to draw
me in by acting friendly?

163
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,541
On the battlefield,
I won't show any mercy.

164
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,583
But I want to try
to persuade you here.

165
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,958
I know this is
against the rules,

166
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,375
but while we're at school,

167
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,125
I'd rather try to
change your mind here

168
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,000
than defeat you in combat later.

169
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,125
[KALLEN gasps]

170
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,250
Something's different about you.

171
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,166
Suzaku, the truck's here.
The cheese--

172
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,583
You came back.

173
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,958
Uh, yeah.

174
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,750
I'm not as sick now, so...

175
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,291
Kallen, what we
were talking about

176
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,583
has nothing to do
with school, okay?

177
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,166
Yeah, I get it.

178
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,958
Kallen, if you don't mind,

179
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,833
could you go and
check in with your class?

180
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,416
They seem to be
a bit short-handed.

181
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,833
[KALLEN]
Sure, I don't mind.

182
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,791
[KALLEN]
I do mind!

183
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,000
[STUDENTS screaming]

184
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,541
Aw, this thing
actually scares them?

185
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,125
Ugh, I'm gonna
get Lelouch for this!

186
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,166
He should have told me

187
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,375
I had to be part
of the Horror House.

188
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,625
Hmph!

189
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,875
The only person I let
order me around is Zero!

190
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,500
[KALLEN] Oh great,
here comes another couple.

191
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,708
Why couldn't they make
this whole thing mechanical?

192
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,750
They've got this dumb screen...

193
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,000
It's sweltering inside of here!

194
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,041
It's like those early Glasgows.

195
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,666
Come on, move your ass!

196
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,291
Hurry! Move your ass!

197
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,000
[OHGI whimpering]

198
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,291
[KALLEN]
Ohgi?!

199
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,875
You're back safe?

200
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,375
Fortunately, yes.

201
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,625
[CECILE laughing]

202
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,625
School festivals are such fun!
I feel so free!

203
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,333
[CECILE laughing]

204
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,458
The one she keeps whacking--
doesn't he look like Lloyd?

205
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,708
No great wonder.

206
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,125
Working under that guy
must really drive her

207
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,125
out of her mind.

208
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,208
Right, the pizza
is starting later.

209
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,833
I definitely don't
have time to be doing this.

210
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,583
Yes. Oh, the drama club?

211
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,875
I've spoken to the
film club about it.

212
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,166
[LELOUCH] How can I
prepare my coup d'etat?

213
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,083
I'm sorry!
The handle just broke in two!

214
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,666
[LELOUCH] Soldiers?
How peaceful the world is...

215
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,166
Say, aren't you Suzaku's friend?

216
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,791
[C.C.]
Hey! You! Boy!

217
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,041
Where am I supposed
to go to eat the biggest pizza

218
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,041
in the world?

219
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,583
Oh, so you're here.

220
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,791
[SCHNEIZEL]
Good work getting them here

221
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,791
from Area 18 in one night.

222
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,000
Your forces are
impressive, Cornelia.

223
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,875
You flatter me.

224
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,750
I'm honored that you
deployed your regular

225
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,250
troops to fill in
for them, Schneizel.

226
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,541
[SCHNEIZEL]
It was the least I could do.

227
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,625
[CORNELIA]
The Glaston Knights,

228
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,250
who were standing by
in the homeland,

229
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,583
have joined us here,
and that means...

230
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,500
We even have Sattel
Waffe for the Gloucesters.

231
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,541
I understand.

232
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,833
And I'm going to play this card

233
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,750
in my negotiations
with the Chinese Federation.

234
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,708
[CORNELIA]
Please do.

235
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,791
What a great honor...

236
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,500
Being asked for assistance
by Princess Cornelia,

237
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,625
who is unmatched
on the battlefield.

238
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,333
Please, don't
tease me about this.

239
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,666
But I'm sincere.

240
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,750
On the field of combat,
you shine more beautifully

241
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,208
and brightly than any flower
or butterfly at a soirée.

242
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,375
Yes, like the Flash herself.

243
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,708
Please, stop saying that.

244
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,166
You know I'm only--

245
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,541
Now where could Euphy
have disappeared to?

246
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,666
I told her I was
coming to see you off.

247
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,333
I had a long talk
with Euphy last night.

248
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,291
[CORNELIA]
Last night?

249
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,416
Yes.

250
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,208
Ah, and about
the other matter?

251
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,333
Bartley's project?

252
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,375
Oh yes,
I really don't mind,

253
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,041
but will he actually
be of any use to us?

254
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,416
[C.C.] I'm asking about the
biggest pizza in the world.

255
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,791
[LELOUCH] I'll bring you some,
now wait in your room!

256
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,666
[C.C.] I don't believe you,
because you're a liar.

257
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,083
[LELOUCH] I'm not going
to deceive you over a pizza.

258
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,875
The military and
the press are here!

259
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,125
What if they see you?!

260
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,875
I'll wear a disguise.
I don't like cold pizza.

261
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,583
Right now,
I have a school festival

262
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,958
and a coup d'etat to run!

263
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,791
[KALLEN] Why did you
come into the school?

264
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,291
[VILLETTA]
Oh, that's my fault.

265
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,208
[KALLEN]
Who are you anyway?

266
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,958
You're definitely not an Eleven.

267
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,458
What's your name?

268
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,541
This is, uh... She's my...

269
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,166
[LELOUCH] Kallen?
Authorized personnel only.

270
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,291
Could you get them
out of here now?

271
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,416
[LELOUCH]
Ohgi?!

272
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,750
I'm really sorry,

273
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,083
but there's something I want
to talk to Suzaku about.

274
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,333
It's all right,
Your Highness.

275
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,500
Euphy, I think this
is a wonderful idea

276
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,541
you've come up with!

277
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,750
Really?! Then...?

278
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,583
You should follow
the path you believe in

279
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,125
with all your heart.

280
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,333
I'll discuss it with Cornelia
so that she understands.

281
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,708
[EUPHEMIA] Suzaku,
my brother approved my idea.

282
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,250
Now we can...
[gasps]

283
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,458
I'm so sorry!
Are you all right?

284
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,125
I'm fine. Are you okay?

285
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,250
Nunnally?!

286
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,166
Huh? That voice...
Is it you?

287
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,333
[KALLEN]
He's seen Ohgi now.

288
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,500
[LELOUCH]
This is bad.

289
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,083
If they see me here
with C.C., then...

290
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,666
[SHIRLEY] A propane tank
for the burner?

291
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,958
I'm sure the spare ones
are here, maybe in back.

292
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,375
[SHIRLEY]
Kallen?

293
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,041
Oh, hello. What's up?

294
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,166
Are there any spare
fuel tanks in the back there?

295
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,708
Rivalz needs one for the pizza.

296
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,125
[KALLEN] Uh, maybe
they're on the other side?

297
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,416
[SUZAKU]
Oh, okay.

298
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,125
Can this get
any more annoying?!

299
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,958
You can use
your Geass, can't you?

300
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,708
[LELOUCH] It'd be dangerous
to use it on Ohgi

301
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
and whoever that is with him.

302
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,541
And I've already used it
on everyone else here!

303
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,000
Well it's your own fault then.

304
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,333
You shouldn't use it so freely.

305
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,291
Your comments are not helping!

306
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,666
[SHIRLEY]
Is that Lelouch?

307
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,041
Are you here?

308
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,958
There's something important
I want to ask you about!

309
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,583
Find a way to
get out of here, fast!

310
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,041
Shirley. Can it wait?

311
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,666
I'm going to
create a diversion.

312
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,791
Use it to get away!

313
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,958
[SHIRLEY]
What are you talking about?

314
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,291
You're never around
in the first place.

315
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,916
[KALLEN shrieks]

316
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,416
[KALLEN] The panels
are falling! Run away!

317
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,416
[SHIRLEY screams]

318
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,625
Don't just stand there!
Watch out!

319
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,625
Uh, I... thank you.

320
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,208
I'm just glad you're okay.

321
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,833
But where'd all
the smoke come from?

322
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,875
It must be for
detecting gas leaks.

323
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,958
It looks like the main valve
was knocked loose.

324
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,416
Never mind that.

325
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,208
Can someone help me, please?
I'm in a little pain here.

326
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,000
What's the matter?

327
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,041
[SUZAKU]
My ankle.

328
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,166
It's a very familiar feeling.

329
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,416
[OHGI] Sorry you got caught
in that weirdness back there.

330
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,750
[VILLETTA] No.
It was actually sort of fun.

331
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,458
I haven't felt this excited
in a long time.

332
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,833
I think it's better
you move out of Area 11 now.

333
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,708
Whoever shot you
wouldn't come after you.

334
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,166
You should be safe.

335
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,500
Y'know, Ohgi,

336
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,208
I wonder if the person
I used to be

337
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,875
was as happy as I am now.

338
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,333
So, uh...

339
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,333
Can you tell me what
you were going to say

340
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,291
when we were back there
at the school?

341
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,791
[OHGI]
Uh...

342
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,500
You started with "She's my..."

343
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,083
She's my what?

344
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,833
Well you see...

345
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:33,041
[VILLETTA] I really don't think
I'd mind becoming an Eleven.

346
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,875
[NUNNALLY]
Will you keep our secret?

347
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,000
I mean about Lelouch
and I being here?

348
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,916
But if you just
stay here like this...

349
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,791
All I want is
to be with my brother.

350
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,541
That's all that matters.

351
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,041
Do you remember
that time when you and I

352
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,958
got into a great big argument?

353
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,958
On which of us was
going to marry Lelouch

354
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,500
when we grew up?

355
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,833
Yes, I do!

356
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,208
We put Lelouch on the spot

357
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,500
by making him decide
right then and there!

358
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,083
[BOTH laugh]

359
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,625
So how 'bout now?

360
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,541
[EUPHEMIA]
Huh?

361
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,791
Do you still love him?

362
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,666
Even to this day?

363
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,458
All right! Any moment!

364
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,625
We are about to
begin the historic task

365
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,291
of the making of the
world's largest pizza!

366
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,000
Please note that this
contraption at my feet

367
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,333
is an oven specially
built for this occasion!

368
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,875
A fabulous waste of money!

369
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,500
Yes, I understand, Shirley.

370
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,166
I promise I'll
make time for you.

371
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,541
Right now, just send group B
to the stage to help.

372
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,583
Right.

373
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,208
[LELOUCH]
This feels so easy!

374
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,625
If I make a mistake here,
no one's life is on the line.

375
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,000
Not bad.

376
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,875
Got everything on schedule, huh?

377
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,458
[LELOUCH] I've learned
to manage people lately.

378
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,083
Still, they seem
so optimistic, don't they?

379
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,583
The Chinese Federation
attacked just the other day,

380
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,041
yet look at everyone.

381
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,333
That's why we need this.

382
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,041
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

383
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,833
Festivals are necessary.

384
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,541
For everyone, all the time.

385
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,166
You still need
to learn a bit more.

386
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,625
[laughs]
Okay, lesson learned!

387
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,625
[NUNNALLY]
Lelouch!

388
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,708
Nunnally, how's the pizza--

389
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,166
Sorry! I need a second!

390
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,166
Call me if something happens!

391
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,500
Huh?

392
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,458
It looks like the
ingredients are all prepared!

393
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,541
Now!

394
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,375
Introducing our
special dough tosser,

395
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,666
the Ashford family Ganymede!

396
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,750
[CROWD cheering]

397
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,291
[RIVALZ]
Yes, it's a bit of an antique.

398
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,000
However, at the controls is the

399
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,666
student council's
special member

400
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,583
and Princess Euphemia's personal
knight, Suzaku Kururugi!

401
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,541
[CROWD cheering]

402
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,708
Listen. Is that because of...?

403
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes.

404
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,541
There are lots of
Elevens who came here today.

405
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,958
It's an open festival after all,
and this is Suzaku's school.

406
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,541
[KALLEN]
So they came to see him?

407
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,875
[SAYOKO] Yes. Suzaku's like
a ray of hope for many Elevens.

408
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,125
They revere him.

409
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,333
I see...

410
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,708
Ganymede, a third-generation
Knightmare...

411
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,083
The type used by
Lady Marianne the Flash,

412
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,250
isn't that correct?

413
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,125
It's just a fundamental frame.

414
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,958
A big puppet
for events like this.

415
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,333
An unorthodox design,

416
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,458
dropped for the next
generation of Knightmares

417
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,500
due to Lady Marianne's death.

418
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,916
I'm guessing
that's the real reason

419
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,250
you want to marry me.

420
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,625
So now you get it.

421
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,458
He has no attraction
whatsoever to the opposite sex.

422
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,250
[LLOYD] Well, I get
the general idea, anyway.

423
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,750
[RIVALZ]
And again!

424
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,708
Can he get it
any larger, folks?!

425
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,916
C'mon, Sir Suzaku!
We've got high hopes for you!

426
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,166
Last year,
it was my turn to do it,

427
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,083
but I can't compare
to a real pro.

428
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,333
This is a day
of sweet surprises.

429
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,166
To think you and Nunnally
were so close all this time...

430
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,333
And that you and Suzaku
are friends as well!

431
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,666
[SHIRLEY]
What is that guy doing?!

432
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,333
This is no time to be
hitting on some flirty girl!

433
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,875
I never want to see
people unhappy ever again.

434
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,833
Remember, we can't
meet after this.

435
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:47,916
That's not true.

436
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,583
I've found a solution
for everything.

437
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,208
Lelouch!

438
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,916
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

439
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,458
Is that Princess Euphemia?!

440
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,583
[CROWD gasping]

441
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,708
[GIRL]
Princess Euphemia?!

442
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:02,833
[RIVALZ]
What's up?

443
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,125
[CROWD chattering]

444
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,541
Princess Euphemia?!

445
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,000
Lelouch! Take Nunnally away!

446
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,750
[LELOUCH] Sorry to leave
you alone at a time like this.

447
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,916
That's right!

448
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,416
The sub-viceroy is
near the main entrance!

449
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,291
[BODYGUARD]
I copy!

450
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,625
I'll send in the back-up team!

451
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,916
Camera! Get a link
to the studio, quick!

452
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,708
All right!

453
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,791
Princess Euphemia's here!

454
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,041
No way! Why?

455
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,333
Where? Where is she?

456
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,208
Everyone stop! Don't run!

457
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,875
Please don't panic!

458
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,916
[C.C.]
Pizza...

459
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,333
Guess we should
have left this to the pros.

460
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,583
What do you think?

461
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,958
I'm afraid I'm just
going to have to give up

462
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,166
on this one.

463
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,083
And some other things.

464
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,166
[gunshots]

465
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,000
Everyone stop this at once!

466
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,541
Do you realize who this is?!

467
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,916
This is the Sub-Viceroy!
The Third Imperial Princess!

468
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,583
Thanks for your help.
We'll take over from here.

469
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,833
Stand back every-- 

470
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,625
HiTV! A comment!

471
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,875
Just one word, please!

472
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,916
Princess Euphemia,
it's me! Nina!

473
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,375
I'll get you out of here-- 

474
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,500
Ugh this is getting tight!

475
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,875
Please, excuse me!
No, don't!

476
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,833
You don't say?

477
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,541
Already? If you've
escaped on your own,

478
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,041
I'd say that's excellent,
Deputy Commander.

479
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,791
We'll stay right here.

480
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,250
Right.

481
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,958
Looks like we wasted
the equipment space

482
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,458
inside the news van.

483
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,416
There's no need for
the captain of the Zero squad

484
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,250
to escape now either.

485
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,958
I'd like you to continue
to stay undercover

486
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,458
here in the settlement.

487
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,583
I'll introduce you
to Zero later on.

488
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,875
I understand.

489
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,458
Oh, wow!

490
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,541
[CROWD exclaiming]

491
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,708
Princess Euphemia,
you're not hurt, are you?

492
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,583
I'm fine! Thank you, Suzaku!

493
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,416
Are you okay, Nunnally?

494
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,625
Yes. How about Euphemia?

495
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,958
She's all right.
Suzaku's taking care of her.

496
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,583
I see...

497
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,958
Lelouch, guess what?

498
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,000
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

499
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,375
Euphy said that
she and Suzaku

500
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,333
are becoming very close now.

501
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,750
[LELOUCH gasps]

502
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,291
They make a nice couple.

503
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,875
Don't you agree?

504
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,875
[LELOUCH]
Nunnally, you...

505
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,708
[EUPHEMIA] Thank heavens.
They're all right.

506
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,291
Princess Euphemia, down here,
can I get a statement, please?

507
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,458
[EUPHEMIA] Could you please
network this broadcast

508
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,583
nationwide?

509
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,166
Huh? You mean go live now?

510
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,250
Euphy?

511
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,166
I have a very
important announcement!

512
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,500
[DIETHARD]
Hm?

513
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,458
[GUILFORD] Your Highness!
It's Princess Euphemia!

514
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,291
[CORNELIA]
What's she doing now?

515
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,458
And we go to our
special live coverage!

516
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,916
I am Euphemia,

517
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,875
Sub-Viceroy of Area 11 of
the Holy Britannian Empire.

518
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,875
There is something
of great consequence

519
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,583
that I wish to
tell you all today!

520
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,000
Now what?

521
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,583
This little girl
makes such a fuss.

522
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,250
[EUPHEMIA]
I, Euphemia li Britannia,

523
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,791
hereby declare the formation

524
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,375
of the Specially
Administrated Zone of Japan

525
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,625
in the area
surrounding Mount Fuji!

526
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,666
What?! Britannia has...?!

527
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,083
They're recognizing Japan?!

528
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,041
[DIETHARD]
Dammit!

529
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,916
I never thought of this scheme.

530
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,125
Even though it's only
in a limited area...

531
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,041
Within the Specially
Administrated Zone of Japan,

532
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,458
Elevens will be permitted
to call themselves Japanese.

533
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,958
[EUPHEMIA]
Restrictions against Elevens

534
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,750
and special rights
for Britannians

535
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,250
will no longer
exist within this zone.

536
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,500
It will be a place where
Elevens and Britannians

537
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,916
live side by side as equals!

538
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,416
[LELOUCH]
Stop this, Euphy!

539
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,708
I already thought through
every detail of that scenario!

540
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,500
It's nothing but an empty dream!

541
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,416
[EUPHEMIA]
Do you hear me, Zero?!

542
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,708
[LELOUCH gasps]

543
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,250
I don't care about your past,

544
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,666
nor who you are
underneath that mask!

545
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,916
I beg you!

546
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,416
Join us in creating this
special zone of freedom!

547
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Join Zero?

548
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,791
No way!
Just think about Prince Clovis!

549
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,916
[CORNELIA]
What is she doing?!

550
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,208
[EUPHEMIA] Zero, help me build
a new future within Britannia!

551
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,875
A place for everyone!

552
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:49,500
[CROWD cheering]

553
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,541
A Japanese zone?

554
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,958
Why's she doing that now?

555
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,791
That's pretty obvious.
She's in love with an Eleven.

556
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,041
[LELOUCH]
I'm finished.

557
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,333
Either way I go,

558
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,250
the Black Knights
will break apart over this!

559
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,375
The reason we exist
has vanished!

560
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,791
How could this
have happened so easily?!

561
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,625
You think you can just take it
all from me like this?!

562
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,375
Even if it is a place
where we can be ourselves...

563
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,000
You know nothing!

564
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,291
You understand nothing!

565
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,333
I am the terrorist
who hides his face.

566
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,041
And you...

567
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,333
[EUPHEMIA]
Lelouch!

568
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,625
Now it can be like before!

569
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:30,208
[LELOUCH] No, the past
is dead and gone!

570
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,291
Euphemia!

571
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,416
[LELOUCH] The Specially
Administrated Zone of Japan.

572
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,500
If I cooperate, I give up
the right to use force.

573
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,958
Oppose it, and the
people become my enemies,

574
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,791
and the Black Knights collapse.

575
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:15,916
Euphemia!

576
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,791
The third princess
who innocently holds

577
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,541
good intentions like a sword!

578
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,083
For Nunnally and me, your very
existence has become a crime!
