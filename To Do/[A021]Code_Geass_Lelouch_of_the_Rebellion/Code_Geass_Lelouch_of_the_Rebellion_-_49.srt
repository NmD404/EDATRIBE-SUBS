1
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,208
Ohgi, are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,375
[OHGI]
Yeah.

3
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,375
I have a duty to get
everyone to safety.

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,416
[MINAMI]
But...!

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,416
[OHGI]
No.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,041
I'm just sorry
I did this to you.

7
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,250
Everyone...

8
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,833
In a battlefield
controlled by F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

9
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,541
Another F.L.E.I.J.A. strike...

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,250
Twammi fleet is
totally obliterated!

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,208
The operation--

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,833
I'm not going to stop it!

13
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,958
Stay just out of
the Damocles' range!

14
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,791
The Avalon falls
back as ordered!

15
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,375
All units! Attack in waves
and force the Damocles

16
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,375
to continue launching
F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

17
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,375
[NUNNALLY]
How easily... It's so easy...

18
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,875
...for me to--

19
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,250
[SCHNEIZEL] Nunnally, we're
ready to fire the next one.

20
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,958
[sobs] Right.

21
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,750
It renders tactics useless.

22
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,291
[JEREMIAH] However... If I
can get within a tight range,

23
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,083
they won't be able to use it!

24
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,333
A blaze luminous!

25
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,666
But it's so immense!

26
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,875
The Damocles was specially
designed and built

27
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,666
to achieve absolute
air superiority.

28
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,958
[CECILE] If it reaches
a certain altitude,

29
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,916
we'll lose our only
chance against it!

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,333
[LELOUCH]
Tch! Suzaku!

31
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,916
Can you break through
those defenses?!

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,458
[SUZAKU]
I'm trying!

33
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,833
But their power output is in
a different league than mine!

34
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,500
But I don't think they can
fire a F.L.E.I.J.A. now.

35
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,083
[C.C.]
And, in turn, our attacks can't

36
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,041
break through their shield.
We may as well be spectators.

37
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,375
Is there nothing
left for the world

38
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,083
except to cower before
the crushing might

39
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,416
of the F.L.E.I.J.A.s?

40
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,125
[LLOYD] Well, that offers
a sort of peace, too.

41
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,416
Mass our remaining
forces around the Avalon!

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,666
We're going to launch a direct
assault on the Damocles

43
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,458
with our hostages on board!

44
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,875
Sure about that?

45
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:33,958
[LELOUCH]
Your return here means

46
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,166
it's nearly figured
out, I presume.

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,291
The rest depends
on you and Suzaku,

48
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,375
Your Majesty.

49
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,583
Schneizel!

50
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,500
Are you trying to kill
the captives, too?!

51
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,083
[SCHNEIZEL] Now that the Black
Knights have been beaten--

52
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,166
[XING-KE]
We aren't beaten yet!

53
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,833
[SCHNEIZEL] Very well then,
I'll wait ten minutes.

54
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,333
Ten minutes?!

55
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,791
[SCHNEIZEL]
Aren't you talking to me because

56
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,583
you're already in
position to counterattack?

57
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,333
All right, fine. Ten minutes.

58
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,416
[KANON] That's a hefty loan,
sir, considering we need

59
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,333
ten minutes to
prep the next shot.

60
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,916
[SCHNEIZEL] It saves me
from dealing with them

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,541
after the battle.

62
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,958
[DIETHARD]
Are you saying you don't need

63
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,458
the Black Knights anymore?

64
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,041
What purpose would a collective

65
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,541
military strength
possibly serve?

66
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,375
[MILLY]
Hey, Rivalz.

67
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,000
[RIVALZ]
What's up, Prez?

68
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,458
It's amazing. I mean,
when you think about it,

69
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,041
our student council
members are out

70
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,375
fighting the whole world.

71
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,166
What, is that sarcasm?

72
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,625
'Cause I wasn't able to
protect Nina, correct?

73
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,250
Don't beat yourself up.
You did your very best.

74
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,916
I tried, but I...

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,666
No. You really did.

76
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,083
From behind?!

77
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:38,708
[yelps]

78
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,291
[HOSTAGES gasp]

79
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,291
[SUZAKU]
The Black Knights!

80
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,583
I'll defeat you myself, I swear!

81
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,500
[LELOUCH]
Sneaking from behind, Xing-ke?

82
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,000
[SUZAKU] I won't let
the Avalon be shot down!

83
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,958
Xing-ke, you'll fail!

84
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,000
Justice weighs on my side!

85
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,250
[grunts, coughs]

86
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,000
[SUZAKU]
It's over!

87
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:12,708
What the--?!

88
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,916
[TOHDOH]
Kururugi!

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,666
[SUZAKU] You dare fight
in your condition?!

90
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,250
You turned your
back on your country

91
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,416
in order to climb in rank, so
here is the ugly way it ends!

92
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,166
What is this you fight for?!

93
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,000
The one thing I want that
I'll fight for is a future!

94
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,958
[TOHDOH]
Your future is worthless!

95
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,750
I failed!

96
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,000
[CHIBA]
General!

97
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,041
[SUZAKU yells]

98
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:42,791
Dammit!

99
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,833
Oh?

100
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,583
They've done better
than I expected.

101
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,166
[OPERATOR]
Primary float, damaged.

102
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,916
Damage level, 75%.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,875
It's failed. The
Avalon is falling!

104
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,333
[SUZAKU]
I can't let them board it!

105
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,916
[TAMAKI]
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,958
Okay!

107
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,625
Now to settle things
once and for a--

108
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:06,375
Huh? I'm not giving in!
I've got pride, too, ya know!

109
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,041
I wasn't in time.
Did they get in?

110
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,958
[XING-KE] If we engage
them in close combat,

111
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,375
we've a chance
to take over their

112
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,166
power and communications,
then rescue the hostages!

113
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,875
We hear and obey!

114
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,083
Holding out this long
was good enough.

115
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,625
Land the ship in the Pacific.

116
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,750
You will now follow
mission Apate Aletheia.

117
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,291
[SAYOKO]
Master Lelouch...

118
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,625
[LELOUCH]
You have served me well.

119
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:35,416
I'm grateful for the
resolve you've all shown.

120
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,541
[SAYOKO, LLOYD, CECILE]
Yes, Your Majesty.

121
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,958
[meows]

122
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,041
[SCHNEIZEL] Should we fire
another F.L.E.I.J.A. now?

123
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,625
[KANON]
We still have our blaze luminous

124
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,375
and should wait for criticality.

125
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,625
[SCHNEIZEL]
Good point.

126
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,416
But it's an excellent
opportunity to eliminate

127
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,791
the Black Knights.

128
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,291
No, I suppose we shouldn't.
That's too ambitious.

129
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,791
[LELOUCH]
Yes, I understand.

130
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,166
This is a personal request
from me. However...

131
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,583
[NINA] It was Princess
Euphemia's wish, too, wasn't it?

132
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,750
Yes, which is why
I have to do it.

133
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,250
But for the device
to be complete,

134
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,458
the environmental data
needs to be entered into

135
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,958
the final program.

136
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,083
You should let me go with you--

137
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,041
No, you've done
enough for me, Nina.

138
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,250
What you just said reveals
your true feelings about this.

139
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:20,250
Yes, you've done enough for me.
For Zero, Euphy's murderer.

140
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,416
I won't find it in my
heart to forgive Zero.

141
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,708
Maybe not for the
rest of my life. But...

142
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,375
This is separate from that.

143
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,041
I simply had to
find my own answer

144
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,750
to everything that's happened.

145
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,083
That's all there is to it.

146
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,041
[LELOUCH]
You're truly amazing.

147
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,625
[LELOUCH]
C.C.! Are you all right?

148
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,958
[C.C.]
Well, that's a switch.

149
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,833
Were you really
worried about me?

150
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,708
You're a valued combatant.

151
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,500
[C.C.] Hmph. That's why
I came to pick that up.

152
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,833
Then... will you
be escorting me?

153
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,333
You're going out there?

154
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,208
Though taking such
action could mean you'll

155
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,791
have to kill Nunnally yourself.

156
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,833
I have no choice if
she stands in the way

157
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,125
of the Zero Requiem.

158
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,083
Lelouch, don't you
hate me for cheating you

159
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,291
out of your own life?

160
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,958
By giving you your Geass,

161
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,875
I affected your life and
drastically changed your fate.

162
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,666
That doesn't sound like you,
the immortal witch.

163
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,916
C.C... the Geass
power you gave me...

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,791
It only put me on the
path that would lead

165
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,958
to my destiny, and nothing more.

166
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,541
Everything that followed
was my choice.

167
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,291
[C.C.] In all my life,
I've never met a man like you.

168
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,500
[LELOUCH]
C.C...

169
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,333
[rumbling]

170
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,791
Kallen!

171
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,708
[KALLEN]
I'm going to stop you!

172
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,958
Goodbye, Lelouch.

173
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,333

[C.C.] Leave this to me!
Get to the Damocles!

You stubborn--!

176
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,083
Stop! You're no
match for the Guren!

177
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,750
[C.C.] I'm sincerely glad
that you care, Lelouch.

179
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,541
[C.C.]
Now go on, hurry!

180
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,250
Just make sure you come back!
That'll make me smile, okay?

181
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,583
Yes! I promise you!

182
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,375
I have to succeed,
no matter what!

183
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,291
This move must work!

Enemy Knightmares approaching.

185
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,541
The Shinkirou is leading them.

186
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,958
Lower the blaze luminous

187
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,125
away from the F.L.E.I.J.A.
launch tube, immediately.

188
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,916
We're going to redirect
our aim at the Shinkirou.

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,666
Lelouch, discarding
your life at the end?

190
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,000
How unsightly.

191
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,833
[OPERATOR]
Realignment complete.

192
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,791

Can you do this?

00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,875
[NUNNALLY]
Yes,

00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,708

195
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,708
[OPERATOR]
Blaze luminous, lowered.

00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,416
[SCHNEIZEL]

[NUNNALLY whimpers]

198
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,708
Right. Entering data.

199
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,333
[NINA] The F.L.E.I.J.A.
changes composition

200
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,583
from moment to moment.

201
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,583
If we collide it with
a reaction corresponding

202
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,541
to that composition,
we can prevent it

203
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,875
from reaching criticality.

204
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,416
[LLOYD]
However, you need to input

205
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,291
the local environment data
just prior to detonation,

206
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,708
within a 19 second time frame.

207

[CECILE] And, even if you
complete the program,

208
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,458
you'll only have 0.04
seconds to execute.

209
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,375
With this, peace will come.

It should work in theory, but...

A F.L.E.I.J.A.!

218
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,000
It disappeared!

219
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,416
It worked? They did it?

220
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,958
In 19 seconds and then
in 0.04 seconds?

221
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,166
[SCHNEIZEL] I didn't
expect them to have made

222
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,833
a toy like that.

223
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,666
Ready... Fly in!

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,791
They have indeed.

My kudos, Lelouch. I salute you.

233
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,208
For forcing me to
implement my final plan.

234
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,875
Huh?! You're really
going to do that?!

235

--[DIETHARD] Hm?
--[SCHNEIZEL] Yes.

236
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,041
Turn the Damocles into a prison
for Lelouch and the others.

237
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,125
[SCHNEIZEL]
After we've abandoned ship,

238
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,791
we'll obliterate the Damocles
entirely with a F.L.E.I.J.A.

239
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,625
What a fine coffin for him.

240
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,583
I'm certain you'll be
pleased with it, Lelouch.

241
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,458
[SUZAKU] If Damocles
reaches satellite orbit,

242
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,791
even the Lancelot will
be useless against it.

243
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,916
To win, we need
to stop Schneizel.

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,750
[LELOUCH] I'm analyzing
the internal structure.

245
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,416
I have to break the password.

Yes.

I will do whatever it takes
to protect something I love!

00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,916
And I'm fighting for
the same reason!

[GINO]
To protect what?!

264
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,750
[LELOUCH] Is Schneizel on the
control and command floor?

265
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,125
Or else, could he be...?

268
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,166
Damocles and the F.L.E.I.J.A.s
are simply machines in the end.

269
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,000
We can always rebuild them.

270
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,791
But, sir, you know
the Toromo Agency

271
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,791
doesn't have the resources.
Nor does Rosenberg.

272

Yes...

273
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,291
But Lelouch is now
the enemy of the world.

274
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,791
If it turns out that our system

275
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,458

be plenty of organizations

F.L.E.I.J.A.s for us.

277
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,583
Isn't that basically terrorism?

00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,791
Besides, there's
Princess Nunnally's opinion

279
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,125
to consider, also.

280
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,875
Why care for what she says?
Bait has no opinion.

281
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,000
What do you mean--
you're abandoning her?!

282
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,875
World peace or a single life?

283
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,583
It's sad to say, but one cannot
be compared with the other.

You also don't have

Someone who has
no reason to fight

295
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,625
should just leave!

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,458
Yes! We were saved by
those people over there!

347
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,708
That's correct.

348
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,000
Master Xing-ke, we are
now on your side.

349
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,250
You all betrayed Lelouch then?

350
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,416
Huh?

351
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,125
And for a valid reason.
He threatened us!

352
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,958
However, now that Lelouch
is no longer here...

353
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,958
[KAGUYA] At the very least,
we believe that the others

354
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,791
think dictatorship is wrong
and will never support it.

355
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,166
Very well then.

356
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,666
[VILLETTA] Yes. The final
battle will most likely

357
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,541
take place within the Damocles.

358
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,375
Ohgi--I mean the
Secretary General--

359
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,541
Either way.

360
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,125
You're saying he's okay, right?

361
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,625
Y-Yes...

362
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,458
[CORNELIA]
My brother didn't kill me.

363
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,500
I'm still here after
all is said and done.

364
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,916
In a more normal world,
he'd be an excellent ruler.

365
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,250
He isn't driven by the
ambition that egotists have.

366
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,166
I was a fool not
to have seen that.

367
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,125
Wouldn't you agree?

368
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,333
[gasps]

369
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,875
Princess, I...

370
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:39,916
[sobs]

371
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,333
Guilford.

372
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,000
You're never going to stop
calling me that, are you?

373
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,458
[GUILFORD sobs]

374
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,041
I have a question.

375
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,333
We're you intending to
use the Damocles as a tool

376
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,500
to dominate the world?

377
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,833
I wasn't.

378
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,250
I only wanted to give
everyone what they wanted.

379
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,208
To bring peace to civilization.

380
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,500
[LELOUCH] Disregarding
humanity's true nature?

381
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,750
That's a matter of opinion.

382
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,916
Then you actually imagined
you could maintain

383
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,125
the world in a
perpetual state of "now."

384
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,666
But...

385
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,000
...life without change might be
called anything except life.

386
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,250
It's nothing more
than experience.

387
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,791
But...

388
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,041
...link those together, and
they become knowledge, right?

389
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,875
Schneizel, you truly
are superior.

390
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,958
So superior, you
can't even see it!

391
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,083
Yes. Emperor Charles
sought the past.

392
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:31,333
You seek the present.
But I seek the future.

393
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,833
[SCHNEIZEL]
But the future may be prove

394
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,458
to be worse than the present.

395
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,708
[LELOUCH]
No... It will be better.

396
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,000
Because, no matter
how long it takes,

397
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,916
people will continue
to seek out happiness.

398
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,625
Even though that will end up
making people greedy.

399
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,041
[laughs]

400
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,208
Your folly also knows no limit.

401
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,500
You're really too
emotional about this.

402
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,583
Hope and dreams are merely
names for aimless fiction.

403
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,500
You're restricted,
since you belong

404
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,458
to the symbol known
as a royal family,

405
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,541
which looks down on the world.

406
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,166
I've seen it over and over.

407
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,208
The people who
struggle against sadness.

408
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,750
Those who seek the future.

409
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,416
How they all carry on,
wishing for happiness.

410
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,583
Human nature is
why I chose Geass

411
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,958
and to wear a mask.

412
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,333
Lelouch, you're
contradicting yourself.

413
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,750
You, who continually
deny the will of others,

414
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,791
are standing here before us,
affirming the will of humanity.

415
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,708
That's enough. Kill me
now and be done with it.

416
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,583
But... a F.L.E.I.J.A.
will still decimate you.

417
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,708
We will gladly give
our lives to bring peace

418
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,541
to the world--

419
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,625
Hm?

420
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,750
And that's how I
came to my decision...

421
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,833
...that I'd give you
the gift of the words.

422
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,583
"You shall serve Zero."

423
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,750
Then you never intended
to kill me at all.

424
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,125
You wanted to...!

425
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,875
H-Highness!

426
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,250
Dammit! Why didn't
I see it coming?

427
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,416
He anticipated
Schneizel's thoughts

428
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,000
and recorded that
conversation...!

429
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,958
Order me to do whatever
you wish, Master Zero.

430
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,375
[DIETHARD grunts]

431
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,083
[SCHNEIZEL]
Schneizel... your willingness

432
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,958
to let yourself be killed

433
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,333
is exactly what has
led you to be defeated.

434
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,708
[DIETHARD grunts]

435
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,625
Don't move!

436
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,583
[GUARD 2 gasps]

437
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,625
Zero! This story's finished!

438
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,458
You never should
have come this far!

439
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,041
You shouldn't even
be alive, you bastard!

440
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,041
[gun fires]

441
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,958
[DIETHARD groans]

442
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,666
What right have you
to deny my existence?

443
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,958
You have none.

444
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,375
[thud]

445
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,000
[KANON]
Prince Schneizel...

446
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,625
A man would sacrifice his own
life without any hesitation...!

447
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,583
Such is the power of Geass!

448
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,958
Z-Zero... At least...

449
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,625
...finish me with
your Geass, too.

450
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,125
Sorry, Diethard,
you're just not worth

451
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,083
wasting my Geass on.

452
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,125
[gasps]

453
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,541
[LELOUCH] Now, Schneizel,
you can begin by canceling

454
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,416
the self-destruct
for the Damocles.

455
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,083
[SCHNEIZEL] Understood.
However, Nunnally is the one

456
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,083
who has the F.L.E.I.J.A.
control switch.

457
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,458
[LELOUCH gasps]

458
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,541
[SUZAKU]
It doesn't matter how strong

459
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,083
you made your machine!
You won't beat me!

460
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,500
We'll see about that!

461
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,208
[gasps]

462
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,166
And this is the result... Gino.

463
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,083
No, I've done what
I came to do here.

464
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,125
He damaged the
blaze luminous system?

465
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,500
[GINO]
Now, Kallen!

466
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,708
[KALLEN]
Thanks, Gino!

467
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,416
[KALLEN]
Suzaku! I've come to end it!

468
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,166
Our continually crossing paths!

469
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,291
[SUZAKU gasps]

470
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,500
[NUNNALLY]
It's you, isn't it, big brother?

471
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,458
It is.

472
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,125
The reason you're
here must be this.

473
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,541
Did you come for
the Damocles key?

474
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,916
[LELOUCH] Yes. It's dangerous.
Dangerous to you.

475
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,041
[NUNNALLY]
Then that's why.

476
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,333
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

477
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,583
Why...

478
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,208
I won't close my eyes
to things any longer.

479
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,375
[gasps]

480
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,333
[LELOUCH]
She's broken father's Geass?!

481
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,750
With her own will?!

482
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,166
[NUNNALLY]
Now, Lelouch...

483
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,666
Will you use your Geass
on me, as well?

484
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,916
[LELOUCH]
Perhaps I've only been wandering

485
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,208
since that day we first met.

486
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:01,375
I was so sick of a world
that never changed.

487
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,375
But...

488
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,916
I couldn't give in
to the despair

489
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,500
by telling lies to myself.

490
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,541
Yes... My name...

491
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,458
My personal history...
The power I've gained...

492
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,375
Maybe... it's all
been a path for me,

493
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,291
at the end of which
I'll find the truth.

494
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:20,083
Perhaps that's what
I've sought all along.

495
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,500
Well, then...
