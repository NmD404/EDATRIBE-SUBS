1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,166
[SWIM CLUB A]
So? Tell us!

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,875
How are things with
you and Lelouch?

3
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,416
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,541
[SWIM CLUB B] You two are the
official school couple now,

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,583
aren't you?

6
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,625
[SWIM CLUB C]
Have you kissed yet?

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,333
Um, th-that was
just for the event.

8
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,750
We're not fooling around.

9
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,166
[VILLETTA]
Don't be embarrassed.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,500
It's no secret that
you've always

11
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,083
had a big crush on Lelouch.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,500
Oh! Not you too,
Coach Villetta!

13
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,083
[VILLETTA]
But you love him, don't you?

14
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,250
Enough to shoot me?

15
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,541
Huh?

16
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,500
[VILLETTA] It's been very
difficult, you know?

17
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,583
Having to come here and spend
each day cheerfully smiling

18
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,125
at the young woman who shot me.

19
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,000
My true feelings
have to be hidden

20
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,666
behind the mask of a teacher.

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,750
[gasps]

22
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,833
[VILLETTA] Shirley Fenette...
How dare you!

23
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,458
How dare you shoot me!

24
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,791
[whimpering]

25
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,666
[footsteps]

26
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:20,791
Lulu!

27
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,333
Uh?

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,875
[SHIRLEY screams]

29
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,583
[SHIRLEY gasps]

30
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,000
[SHIRLEY] That's right.
While Lelouch was Zero,

31
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,541
he killed my father.

32
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,083
[LELOUCH]
So, Jianmen pass has fallen?

33
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,625
We've also taken over the air
force facility in Macau.

34
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,416
We should send
Asahina and Hong Gu

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,625
to defend Jianmenguan.

36
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,750
And why don't we assign
Minase and Sugiyama

37
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,916
to take charge of
municipal affairs there?

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,791
[ROLO] Well, looks like
things are going smoothly.

39
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,625
[LELOUCH] Our so-called foes
are just local military factions

40
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,125
that won't join us,

41
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,958
but they'll deploy forces
without talking to each other.

42
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,958
Not to mention that you've
already got a hold of

43
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,375
the empress. The one leader who
could unify all those factions.

44
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,083
[LELOUCH]
Exactly.

45
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:14,875
You're off?

46
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,750
I'm going to Ikebukuro.

47
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,625
But I'll help you with the
rest of your homework

48
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,166
when I return.

49
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,625
I'll catch you later, then.

50
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,500
[bell tolls]

51
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,083
[ARTHUR yawns]

52
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:33,541
[SHIRLEY] Lulu was Zero. And
coach Villetta was a soldier.

53
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,875
And Kallen was one of
the Black Knights.

54
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,833
Then what about Nina?
And the Prez? And Rivalz?

55
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,250
Is our school the weirdest
place on Earth?

56
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,625
Oh, why is Nunnally
now the viceroy?

57
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,958
What are the lies,
and what is the truth?

58
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,375
[ANNOUNCER] Attention: The local
express is running 10 minutes

59
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,625
behind schedule and will be
arriving at platform three.

60
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,625
For those passengers who
do not wish to wait...

61
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,000
[LELOUCH]
Very well.

62
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,875
For the first stage,
this will be fine.

63
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,041
[MAN A]
All right then,

64
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,041
we'll continue with
the same procedure.

65
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,208
[MALL ANNOUNCER] And now, here's
an announcement to all our

66
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,625
patrons about a special deal.
For a limited time only,

67
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,000
we're running a campaign...

68
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:12,666
[SUZAKU]
Shirley!

69
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,666
[gasps]

70
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,750
[SUZAKU]
Wait! It's just me.

71
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,083
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

72
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,083
So what's wrong? Why'd you
want to me to come here?

73
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,333
[SHIRLEY]
Um...

74
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,208
Uh...

75
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,083
[LELOUCH]
Shirley!

76
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,166
[gasps]

77
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,583
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch.

78
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,083
[VILLETTA]
Where's Lelouch? On a date?

79
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,250
At the moment, he's out
testing the G cars.

80
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,250
[VILLETTA]
Hmpf. How convenient.

81
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,250
[ROLO]
Huh?

82
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,958
Rolo, why have you
turned your back

83
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,500
on your country? Unlike me,

84
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,000
you were dispatched here by
the Order, so why would you--

85
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,750
Just why are you
asking me that?

86
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,500
What's between my
brother and me is--

87
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,416
--[alarm sounds]
--[BOTH] Uh!

88
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,541
[FEMALE COMM]
B7 to control.

89
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,791
Suspicious male sighted
near the chapel.

90
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,458
B5 and B9 have moved
in to apprehend him.

91
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,416
[TEACHERS gasps]

92
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,625
[JEREMIAH]
Hmpf.

93
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,625
Look what happened simply
by asking where Lelouch was.

94
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,958
Lord Jeremiah! But how?!

95
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,958
[FEMALE COMM] Target is
moving toward the clubhouse.

96
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,791
B2 and B8 have been
eliminated, as well.

97
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,166
Sound a school-wide alarm!

98
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,166
Get students out of the
vicinity of the target!

99
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,541
[TEACHER gasping]

100
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,333
[FEMALE COMM] Attention all
students and personnel.

101
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,583
This is an emergency
announcement.

102
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,708
Do not go near
the clubhouse area.

103
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,875
A suspicious person
has been sighted there.

104
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,541
[JEREMIAH]
Out of my way.

105
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,500
I have no desire to kill
a woman if I don't need to.

106
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,000
[SAYOKO]
We at least share that.

107
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,625
I, too, would like to avoid
any unnecessary killing.

108
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,416
Oh?

109
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,000
[SAYOKO]
En garde!

110
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,666
[SAYOKO]
Cyborg?!

111
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,750
And I have Zero to thank.

112
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,041
[BARTLEY] They say
they're going to kill God.

113
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,500
[CORNELIA]
God?

114
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,208
I thought they were speaking
metaphorically, but now...

115
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,875
At the very least these people
believe what they're saying!

116
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,291
Ridiculous. To believe in God.
There's no such being!

117
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,125
[V.V.]
That's right.

118
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,458
[BARTLEY, CORNELIA gasp]

119
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,458
[V.V.] No winged goddesses
or long-bearded old men

120
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,875
in white gowns with
kingdoms in the clouds.

121
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,583
No. Not that sort of God. Uh!

122
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,250
[BARTLEY]
Uh!

123
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,125
[CORNELIA]
Hmpf.

124
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,500
[gasps] Princess Cornelia!

125
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,125
Who knows what type
of Geass he controls!

126
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,791
You must never let your
guard down, even for a child.

127
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,083
[V.V.]
Yes, that's correct.

128
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:27,541
Cornelia, you do live up to
your reputation, don't you?

129
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,750
As your uncle, I'm
very proud of you.

130
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,083
My what?!

131
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,250
[V.V.]
We made a solemn vow.

132
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,125
If there was ever a god that
made men fight each other...

133
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,708
...we'd kill him
and his divine rule.

134
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,458
[SAYOKO]
Even if you are a cyborg,

135
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,250
your exposed human parts
make you vulnerable!

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,250
[JEREMIAH]
You have good aim!

137
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,041
[SAYOKO] I'll stop you!
For Master Lelouch's sake!

138
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,083
[JEREMIAH]
Uh?!

139
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,541
[JEREMIAH] Your skill in
martial arts is impressive.

140
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,458
But, it won't impede
Jeremiah Gottwald.

141
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,333
[SAYOKO grunts]

142
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,041
[ROLO]
Sayoko!

143
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,083
[SAYOKO]
Uh!

144
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,125
[JEREMIAH]
Dammit.

145
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,375
Steal time!

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,458
[ROLO] Okay! Now get him while
I'm holding him still! Go on!

147
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,208
With great pleasure!

148
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,375
[gasps, screams]

149
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,708
But that's not possible!
My Geass...

150
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,208
It should stop time
with absolutely anyone!

151
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,166
[JEREMIAH]
Rolo Lamperouge!

152
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,541
[ROLO grunts]

153
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,333
[JEREMIAH] Just as I thought!
You've been fooled!

154
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,083
[ROLO] But how could
you break my Geass?

155
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,541
[JEREMIAH] How? Because I
was chosen, that's how!

156
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,083
Picked by the Order
to be an assassin!

157
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,625
[ROLO] Then you've come to
kill Lelouch, is that it?!

158
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,583
[VILLETTA]
Lord Jeremiah!

159
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,416
--[JEREMIAH] Huh?
--[ROLO] Uh?

160
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,708
[JEREMIAH] Villetta! You mean
Lelouch has snared you, too?!

161
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,458
Lelouch is at the Ikebukuro
station right now!

162
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,333
[JEREMIAH gasps]

163
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,041
Lord Jeremiah, I'm begging you!

164
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,208
What ever you do,
please let me go!

165
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,458
[ROLO grunts]

166
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,875
[JEREMIAH]
All right, then.

167
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,708
[SHIRLEY] What do I do?
I called Suzaku out here,

168
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:08,541
but what should I say to him?
Especially with Lulu here.

169
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,833
[LELOUCH] Shirley, what kind
of game are you playing?

170
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,375
Or was it Suzaku who
called her out here?

171
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,791
[SUZAKU]
Rivalz told me

172
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,083
that Lelouch has been here
in Japan the entire time.

173
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,250
Intelligence from the O.S.I.
backs that up, also.

174
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,958
But... Why don't I believe it?

175
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,833
Villetta. What are you doing?

176
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,875
Are you betraying
Lelouch, or... are you--

177
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,166
We should contact
Lelouch right away.

178
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,166
I will stay here and
protect the place.

179
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,250
The rest of you go
on to Ikebukuro.

180
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,541
If Lelouch is ready for him,

181
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,875
we may be able to pin
Jeremiah from two sides.

182
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,000
[SHIRLEY] I have to tell
Suzaku. He needs to know

183
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,000
that Lelouch is Zero and
the he killed my father!

184
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,208
This is the boundary
line, right here.

185
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,666
[SUZAKU] The demarcation between
the settlement and the ghettos.

186
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,250
We have to erase it.

187
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,791
[SHIRLEY gasps] Hold it. What
if these two are accomplices?

188
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,708
To turn Area 11
back into Japan?

189
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,500
That's it! They've been
friends since way back!

190
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,250
[SHIRLEY gasps]

191
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,375
[LELOUCH, SUZAKU]
Uh?

192
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,458
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

193
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,833
[SHIRLEY]
No!

194
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,208
Shirley!

195
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,000
[SHIRLEY]
Stay away from me!

196
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,541
[LELOUCH]
Shirley!

197
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,291
You're both liars! You two are
nothing but a pair of fakes!

198
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,541
I won't... Aaggh...!

199
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,791
[LELOUCH grunts]

200
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,041
[gasps]

201
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,708
[LELOUCH grunting]

202
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,041
[SHIRLEY gasps]
No! Let me go! Let me go!

203
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,958
Stop it! I can't lose you!

204
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,041
[SHIRLEY gasps]

205
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,333
I don't want to lose you
or anyone else in my life!

206
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,291
Not one more person!

207
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,958
Please...

208
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,708
Shirley!

209
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,083
Uh-huh.

210
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,833
Uh! Suzaku!

211
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,833
[SHIRLEY] Hey... You've done
this once before, haven't you?

212
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,083
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

213
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,625
[SHIRLEY] You know,
that time back at school

214
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,166
when you tried to catch Arthur.

215
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,583
Yeah, you're right.

216
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,625
[LELOUCH]
Uh?

217
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,625
I guess you're right Shirley.
We have done this before.

218
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,500
And Suzaku is always the
one who pulls you back up.

219
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,125
If Lelouch had been
the one on top,

220
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,250
both of us would have fallen.

221
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,666
[LELOUCH]
You exercise nut!

222
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,791
If you're gonna brag,

223
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,541
you should've saved
us before we fell.

224
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,666
That's ridiculous.

225
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,750
[SUZAKU]
Why am I laughing?

226
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,208
After what Lelouch
did to Euphy!

227
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,791
[SHIRLEY] I'm wrong.
He's alone. Lulu is...

228
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,208
[ringing]

229
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,083
[LELOUCH]
Oh.

230
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,166
'Scuse me. Uh?!

231
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,000
[ROLO]
Lelouch, be careful!

232
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,166
Jeremiah's heading
toward you right now!

233
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,875
He's an assassin
sent by the Order.

234
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,750
My Geass didn't work on him!

235
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,666
Wait, Jeremiah is alive?!

236
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,791
And what do you mean
an assassin, Rolo?

237
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,125
[ROLO]
I'm not sure.

238
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,375
Anyway, don't do anything
rash until we get there.

239
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,291
What's up?
Is something wrong?

240
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,666
[LELOUCH] This is bad.
With Suzaku here...

241
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,916
By your expression,

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,708
I'm guessing that wasn't
a friendly phone call.

243
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,166
Ah, ow!

244
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,083
Suzaku, stop that!

245
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,125
My problem comes
first, doesn't it?

246
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,125
Right.

247
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,541
[LELOUCH]
Oh, yeah, that's right,

248
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,666
you two were waiting for
each other here, weren't you?

249
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,333
What's the matter,
are you jealous?

250
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,666
[LELOUCH]
Hmpf.

251
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,333
Thanks so much, Lulu.

252
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,208
Can't we wait for just
a while? We should--

253
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,291
[SHIRLEY]
Come on. Let's go, Suzaku.

254
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,416
[SUZAKU]
Wait! Hold on!

255
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,333
[LELOUCH] This area is about to
become a battlefield. And I

256
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:10,250
can think of no safer place for
Shirley, than to be with Suzaku.

257
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,708
[POLICEMAN A]
Jeremiah Gottwald?

258
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,291
Yes, I am.

259
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:25,583
[BOTH]
What?

260
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,166
The guy's bulletproof!

261
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,083
I understand. Lelouch has
used his Geass on you.

262
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:32,833
Huh?

263
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:33,500
Huh?!

264
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,333
[POLICEMEN grunting]

265
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,416
[LELOUCH] Not only does
Geass have no effect on him,

266
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,125
he has the power to
cancel it, as well.

267
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,166
[MAN A]
Fire?!

268
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,833
[MAN B]
Terrorists?!

269
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,041
[JEREMIAH]
Hmph.

270
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,666
[LELOUCH] Right! Come up
and get me, Orange!

271
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,458
[SUZAKU] So, what's
this important thing

272
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,333
you need to talk to me about?

273
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,541
Uh, well I'm...

274
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,458
Well, I'm in love with Lulu.

275
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,750
[SHIRLEY]
But you hate him, don't you?

276
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,708
[SUZAKU]
I liked him...

277
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,458
...at one time.

278
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,666
[SHIRLEY]
And now?

279
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,041
[SUZAKU sighs]

280
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,083
[SHIRLEY] I thought
something was wrong.

281
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,625
The two of you used to
be so close together.

282
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,166
What happened,
did you have a fight?

283
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,625
I can't forgive him.

284
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,958
Nothing is unforgivable,
you know.

285
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,416
In other words,

286
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,791
it only means that you're
not willing to forgive him.

287
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,375
You don't want
to forgive him.

288
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,583
[gasps]

289
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,625
I forgave him. I chose
to a long time ago.

290
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,708
Shirley... What are you...

291
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,791
--[explosion]
--[SHOPPERS scream]

292
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,291
[POLICEMAN C] Did you call
the fire department?

293
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,833
In situations like
this, doesn't the

294
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,125
Army respond first?

295
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,333
[POLICEMEN gasp]

296
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,375
Sir Suzaku Kururugi!
I'm the Knight of Seven.

297
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,916
Uh! M-My lord!

298
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,583
This might be an act of
terrorism, so from here on,

299
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,958
I'm taking command

300
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,875
of all the perimeter police
and fire fighting units.

301
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,208
[BOTH]
Right, understood, my lord!

302
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,166
And I want you to protect
that young woman

303
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,583
right over there.

304
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,125
[OHGI] What is it? We're in
the middle of a meeting.

305
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:19,416
[TAMAKI] Like I care? Ain't
no meeting I was invited to!

306
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,208
Emergency call from Zero.

307
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,750
Somethin' weird's
going on there.

308
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:23,708
[OHGI]
Uh?

309
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,416
[OHGI]
Zero! It's Ohgi.

[gasps]

311
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,291
[OHGI] What's happened?
What's the emergency?

312
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,250
If it's about the guys from
Taiwan, right now we're--

313
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,166
Ohgi!

314
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,750
[OHGI]
Mm! That voice! It's--

[sirens]

316
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,791
Lelouch, just hang in there!

317
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,708
All units in position.
Support teams en route.

318
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,041
[SHIRLEY]
Lulu...

319
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,333
[POLICEMAN F] Please get
into the vehicle, Miss.

320
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,625
It's the Knight of
Seven's orders.

321
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,750
Wha...?! Miss, come back here!

322
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,083
Hold on, Lulu!

323
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,708
Don't worry, I won't
leave you alone!

324

[JEREMIAH]
You won't escape me!

325
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,125
Lulu, where can you be? Uh!

326
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,958
[SHIRLEY]
He must be fighting.

327
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,083
Lulu's fighting...

328
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,625
...on his own.

329
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,500
A mechanical body...

330
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,041
And you've got a
Geass canceller.

331
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,916
Your vengefulness is truly
top-notch, Orange boy!

332
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,125
There's no vengefulness.
It's sheer loyalty.

333
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,625
How I hate to hear that.

334
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,541
What could the emperor
have possibly done

335
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,625
to deserve such loyalty?

336
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,375
Wha...?!

337
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,875
From your performance,

338
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,208
I figured that you must
be using sakuradite.

339
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,083
[JEREMIAH]
A Gefijun Disturber...!

340
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,875
[LELOUCH] Well, well, I see
you've done your homework.

341
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,875
You're aware, that when
this sakuradite disruption

342
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,083
system is complete,

343
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,916
we can paralyze all
urban functions

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,583
with the railway's
circular route.

00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:14,041
In other words, bring
Tokyo to a standstill.

346
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,750
I'm grateful. You've been
an exemplary test subject.

347
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,708
[ROLO panting]

348
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,375
Rolo!

349
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,375
Shirley, you're here?!

350
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,041
[SHIRLEY]
Answer me, Rolo.

351
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,291
Um.

352
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,166
Do you truly... love Lulu?

353
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,875
[LELOUCH]
Now then,

354
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,458
are you going to tell me
what I want to know?

355
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,833
Where is the Order located?
And where is V.V.?

356
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,875
You're the one...
who will talk here!

357
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,875
What?!

358
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,625
Because I have...
my reasons...

359
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,333
I'm resolved to see
my loyalty through!

360
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,000
I must know the truth for
certain... once and for all!

361
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,041
But how...?!
He shouldn't be able to move!

362
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,791
Why, Lelouch? Why did you
adopt the role of Zero?

363
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,041
Why did you turn
against your homeland?

364
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,291
Becoming an enemy of
the emperor as a result?!

365
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,083
I did it because I am
Lelouch vi Britannia!

366
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,375
[gasps]

367
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,125
[LELOUCH] My father,
the Britannian emperor,

368
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,375
allowed my mother to be killed!

369
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,916
In so doing, he stole
Nunnally's sight...

370
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,208
her legs... and our
futures from us!

371
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,375
[LELOUCH yells]

372
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,958
[JEREMIAH] I know. I remember,
because I was there, too.

373
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,375
Uh?! You were?!

374
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:34,250
My first assignment.
To guard her. Lady Marianne,

375
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,416
whom I loved and respected.

376
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,375
But I failed to carry
through with that loyalty.

377
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,916
I just wasn't able
to protect her!

378
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,666
So you founded the
Purebloods, then?

379
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,166
Master Lelouch.

380
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,208
Everything is
becoming clear now.

381
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,000
You became Zero for the
sake of Lady Marianne,

382
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,166
didn't you?

383
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,000
But if you didn't
come here to kill me,

384
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,583
then what are you trying to do?

385
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,333
I don't serve V.V...

386
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,333
I follow only one.

387
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,916
It's Lady Marianne...

388
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:05,125
Now... I'll die without regret.

389
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,958
Lord Jeremiah!

390
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,833
[JEREMIAH gasping]

391
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,791
[JEREMIAH]
Ugh! My prince...!

392
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,041
Jeremiah Gottwald, listen.
Your steadfast loyalty

393
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,958
is still desperately needed
here. Isn't that right?

394
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,000
[JEREMIAH gasping]

395
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,875
Indeed. Yes, Your Majesty.

396
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,666
[SHIRLEY] Rolo, I love Lulu.
But what about you?

397
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,958
What a question.

398
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,208
He's my only brother,
so of course I love him.

399
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,125
Then you're on Lulu's
side, right? Right?!

400
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:34,833
Uh?

401
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,750
Please. Let me join you!

402
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,625
I want Lulu to be safe, too!
I can help you protect him!

403
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,041
[ROLO exhales]

404
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,291
I want to bring all the
happiness back into Lulu's life!

405
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,750
Then maybe he can be together
with his sister Nunna!

406
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,875
[ROLO gasps]

407
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,958
[LELOUCH] Right. I've sent
Jeremiah on ahead.

408
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,291
He'll take care of any
obstacles in the way.

409
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,666
Don't try to fight him!
He just came over to our side!

410
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:00,916
Uh?

411
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,333
[gasps]

412
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,208
[gasps]

413
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,833
Shirley!

414
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,041
Shirley, who did this to you?!

415
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,333
Lulu...?

416
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,208
I'm glad... we can talk
at the very end...

417
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,791
[LELOUCH] Don't say that!
It's not the end!

418
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,291
I'll call a doctor, so just--

419
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,333
Ever since my memories
have come back,

420
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,041
I've been feeling
so very afraid...

421
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,208
[LELOUCH gasps]

422
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,041
[SHIRLEY]
A teacher who wasn't a teacher.

423
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,041
Friends who don't...
have memories to share.

424
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,458
Everyone... was just... lying...

425
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,958
It felt as though... the whole
world was spying on me.

426
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,375
That's the world...
you've been fighting...

427
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,333
all by yourself, isn't it?

428
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,166
All alone...

429
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,833
So that's why I...
why I wanted

430
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,958
to be someone who would at
least be truthful to you.

431
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,083
Shirley...

432
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,083
Lulu... I love you.

433
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,916
Even knowing how you caught
my father in all this...

434
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,208
I simply couldn't hate you.

435
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,666
[LELOUCH whimpers]

436
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,416
[SHIRLEY] Even though you
made me forget everything...

437
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
I still fell in love with you...

438
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,458
Even though my memories
were tampered with...

439
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,583
I kept falling in love...

440
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,208
...with you all over again...

441
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,625
No, Shirley! You can't die...!

442
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,708
[SHIRLEY] No matter how
many times I'm reborn...

443
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:40,875
I'll keep falling in love...
with you, Lulu...

444
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,125
I suppose... that
it's simply fate...

445
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,625
No, don't die!
I order you not to die...!

446
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,041
[SHIRLEY] So, is that
okay then... Lulu...?

447
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,916
And as I'm reborn...

448
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,125
I'll fall in love with
you over and over...

449
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,625
I'll keep...

450
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,916
...falling...

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,875
...in love... with...

452
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,916
[LELOUCH gasps]

453
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,750
Shirley! Shirley...!

454
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,791
[LELOUCH yells]

455
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,333
[LELOUCH]
C.C. once told me something.

456
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,041
She said that Geass was
the power of the king.

457
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,250
And a life of solitude.

458
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,083
Then this must be
what she meant.

459
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,416
Shirley... I wanted...

460
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,333
I had to apologize for
involving you with Geass.

461
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,583
For making you the sacrifice.

462
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,000
How can I make up for that?

463
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,666
Tell me, please. Tell me...
