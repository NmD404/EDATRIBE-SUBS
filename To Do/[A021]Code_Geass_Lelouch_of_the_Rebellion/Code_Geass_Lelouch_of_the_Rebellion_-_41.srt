1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,291
[LELOUCH]
The world continues moving on,

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,333
thanks to miracles
which Zero has performed.

3
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,208
The world is being reborn,

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,458
thanks to actions
which Zero has taken.

5
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:32,875
Yes. The world is moving to
the next stage, as it should.

6
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:36,458
Against conflicting emotions,
Zero must carry on.

7
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,375
For the hands which mark time
cannot be stopped.

8
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,125
The Emperor's gone?

9
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,041
He's disappeared?

10
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,458
He has.

11
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,708
I've just received word
from Prime Minister Schneizel

12
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,041
about it.

13
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,000
It's important that we
restrict this information

14
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,166
to only those present here.

15
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,708
He also said that
this situation is only known

16
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,375
to a handful of people
in the homeland.

17
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,583
[GUILFORD]
What on earth happened to him?

18
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,625
[NUNNALLY] There is no news
on the investigation.

19
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,250
Hold on a minute.

20
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,083
Won't this affect our plans to
attack the Chinese Federation?

21
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,333
If His Majesty isn't present

22
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,750
to issue a
declaration of war,

23
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,166
then we can't do anything!

24
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,125
And there's domestic security.

25
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,291
If the Numbers were
to learn of this situation,

26
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,750
you had better have
new policies in place.

27
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,166
Well I'd...

28
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,333
[LOHMEYER] People expect
action from authority figures!

29
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,666
Uh, Miss Lohmeyer?

30
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,041
Do you think you'd like
to handle it alone?

31
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,791
[LOHMEYER]
Sorry. I meant no disrespect.

32
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,541
[SUZAKU]
Is this for the best?

33
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,750
With the Emperor gone,

34
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,791
Nunnally should
be safe for now, but...

35
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,416
[LELOUCH]
I've done it!

36
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,083
The actions which
Britannia has taken

37
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,833
prove the Emperor is absent.

38
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,250
It's seems he is truly
trapped in the other realm.

39
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,208
Though I am concerned
about what he said before,

40
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,833
I am content simply knowing
that Nunnally is safe.

41
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,708
[C.C.]
Um, what should I be doing now?

42
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,875
Let's see now...

43
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,541
Sing me a song
while hopping on one foot

44
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,500
and wearing your
clothes inside out.

45
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,500
[C.C.]
Yes. Right away, master.

46
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,625
Wha--?

47
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,500
No, wait! I was kidding!

48
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,708
[C.C. gasps]

49
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,791
I'm sorry!

50
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,916
Please don't beat me hard again!

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,708
[LELOUCH] Her mind has
completely reverted.

52
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,875
She's now only the slave girl
before the power of Geass came.

53
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,333
Don't you worry.

54
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,916
I would never do anything
to harm you at all.

55
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,958
It's the truth.
I promise you.

56
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,916
--[beeping noise]
--[JEREMIAH] Master Lelouch.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,958
[LELOUCH]
Yes, Jeremiah. What is it?

58
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,541
[LELOUCH]
I see. You got her out of there,

59
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,333
inside of the
Sutherland's cockpit.

60
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,958
[JEREMIAH]
Please forgive me.

61
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,916
You ordered me
to destroy them all,

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,916
but killing a member of
the Britannian royal family

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,666
was just...

64
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,666
[LELOUCH]
Forget it.

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,916
Or rather,
I should say, well done.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,375
Tell me, Lelouch,

67
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,083
what is it you are seeking
within that accursed power?

68
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,708
[LELOUCH]
What am I seeking?

69
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,750
I'm seeking to save
a sister that I adore.

70
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,666
[CORNELIA]
How dare you!

71
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,000
[ASAHINA]
Kinoshita.

72
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,625
[KINOSHITA]
Captain Asahina!

73
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,583
[ASAHINA]
I see. Bloodstains.

74
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,500
I'd sure like to know...
What was Zero doing?

75
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,416
Well I...

76
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
[ROLO]
...won't say a thing.

77
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,125
Those are Zero's orders.

78
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,791
The details are top secret.

79
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,000
Even General Tohdoh
isn't allowed to know.

80
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,666
[ASAHINA] You toss real
confident weight around

81
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,875
for a newbie.

82
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,250
Value in this team
is gained by confidence.

83
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,666
And confidence is earned by a
Black Knight from Zero himself.

84
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,541
That's some
trusting value system.

85
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,666
[SUZAKU]
I'm so sorry!

86
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,458
What the hell's that mean?!

87
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,208
There's no need to apologize!

88
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,250
It's either right or wrong!

89
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,958
You think you can flip
on the good guy routine

90
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:05,958
whenever you like?!

91
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,708
Not when I'm this pissed off!

92
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,875
Kallen Kouzuki's a soldier,
not a sideshow!

93
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,291
[KALLEN]
Hmph!

94
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,416
I'm mostly pissed off
because you're not resisting.

95
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,458
[SUZAKU groans]

96
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,416
[KALLEN]
There. Put me to death.

97
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,416
An inmate assaulting
a Knight of the Round

98
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,833
should be a good reason
enough for anyone.

99
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,125
[SUZAKU]
No, I won't.

100
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,250
Because I'm the one
who did wrong.

101
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,625
"No, I won't."

102
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,083
I hate you!

103
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,541
[ZERO]
And so,

104
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,625
by ratifying this charter, it
will give birth to an alliance

105
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,166
that will rival the
Holy Britannian Empire.

106
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,416
And its name shall be...

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,000
...The United
Federation Of Nations!

108
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,125
[ALL gasp]

109
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,208
It's wonderful, Master Zero!

110
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,458
There are exiled regimes

111
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,458
throughout the
Britannian colonies.

112
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,375
Some have agreed to participate.

113
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,083
With this move,
we've finally earned

114
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,791
a just cause to launch
a war of liberation!

115
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,208
A just cause
to launch war...

116
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,708
If the forthcoming
operation to recapture Japan

117
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,958
is indeed successful,
then other undecided nations

118
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,125
will join us
in a chain reaction.

119
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,000
[EMPRESS]
Mm-hmm.

120
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,458
[ZERO]
And it will succeed,

121
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,291
but we must form the U.F.N.
before Britannia can act!

122
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,791
Time decides our
victory or defeat.

123
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,791
I ask only that you cooperate
on the focus of our plan.

124
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,291
I know representatives
here must discuss the needs

125
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,291
of their individual countries.

126
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,791
But remember...

127
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,833
What you decide will change
the course of world history!

132
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,625
I'm so sorry!

[MILLY] It's an up-and-coming
one-woman festival

134
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,000
with Milly Ashford here!

not exactly alone, you know.

[MILLY]
Guess what, audience?

137
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,875
We're going to the jungle,
right here in the city!

We are?

00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,916
[MILLY]
Animal time!

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,916
And that means hot topics
with Trend Watch!

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,541
[LELOUCH]
I brought you some food to eat.

[TV continues in background]

143
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,625
[LELOUCH]
It's only me.

144
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,750
[C.C.]
Huh?

145
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,250
[LELOUCH]
It's called pizza.

146
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,208
I'd think you be hungry by now.

147
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,500
I really wanted
you to have some,

148
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,208
so I asked Sugiyama
to help me out.

149
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,083
You don't remember, do you?

150
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,333
Go ahead. Try it.

151
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,500
[LELOUCH]
It's all right. You can eat.

152
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,791
[C.C.]
Okay!

00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,291
It's good, isn't it?

00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,291
[C.C.] Oh, yes,
yes! It's really, really good!

155
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,708
Thought so.

156
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,291
I'm glad you like it.

[LELOUCH] Prez,
I'm not sure that's the way

158

00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,000
I see. That's right.

161
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,125
You don't even know
what this is, do you?

162
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,958
[ANYA]
Troubled mind?

163
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,500
Nothing but trouble.

164
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,166
Even though I chose it myself.

165
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,083
Decisions I made
eight years back.

166
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,000
[ANYA] Do you still
place trust in him?

167
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,625
The you from eight years ago?

168
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,875
[SUZAKU] Are you asking if
the choices I made were foolish?

169
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,375
Memories that people
have are always vague.

170
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,958
No point in believing in them.

171
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,833
I'd have to disagree with that.

172
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,416
[ANYA]
But I know it.

173
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,750
In my case...

174
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,416
I kept a diary
from nine years ago.

175
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,041
I don't remember
anything from it at all.

Huh?

177
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,000
[ANYA]
And there's more I don't trust.

178
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,541
The data I stored doesn't
match any memories I have.

179
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,708
[SUZAKU]
Could that be it?

180
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,416
The Emperor's Geass?

181
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,041
But why use it on Anya?

182
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,708
Even recent things.

183
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,458
My memories don't match
the recordings at all.

184
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,791
Like when fighting with
the Chinese Federation,

185
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,500
they don't...

186
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,625
[hisses]

187
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,583
[LUCIANO] What do people value
most, Sir Kururugi the traitor?

188
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,375
Their own life, of course.

189
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,583
So I see that
you've returned

190
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,958
from the Belarusian Front,
Sir Bradley.

191
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:04,708
[hisses]

192
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,625
It's the Knight of Ten.

193
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,708
[LUCIANO] I see your skill
at courting with the new ladies

194
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,958
is still intact.

195
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,166
Princess Massacre
wasn't enough for you?

196
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,041
Speak another
untrue word of her name

197
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,125
and you will have to
face me in a duel, sir.

198
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,916
[LUCIANO] Oh.
It's seems you've forgotten.

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,041
I'm very well known as
the "Genius of Homicide."

200
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,833
Perhaps being only a Number
without any true bloodline

201
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,250
has dulled your...

202
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,083
They sent the Galahad?!

203
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,875
[BISMARCK] Both of you!
Cease your squabbling!

204
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,208
The Knight of One.

205
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,166
But why would they send
Bismarck Waldstein here?

206
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,041
Anya, a foolish question.

207
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:41,125
Obviously The Black Knights
will invade Area 11 first.

208
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,625
Luciano.

209
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,625
I've brought the Valkyrie
Squadron for that here as well.

210
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,166
I have also readied
Gareths for this event.

211
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,333
Now is the time for us
to join our forces

212
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,458
under the command
of Prince Schneizel.

213
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,416
So save your solo flaunting
for the battlefield!

214
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,708
Hah! I understand it well.

215
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,375
Whatever you say, my lord.

216
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,875
[NUNNALLY, KALLEN laughing]

217
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,125
[KALLEN] So Lelouch
always acted like that, huh?

218
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,833
[NUNNALLY] My big brother
can be so stubborn at times,

219
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,958
but actually,
he's really very kind.

220
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,833
My brother Naoto
was like that as well.

221
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,041
[LUCIANO] Oh! I'd heard we had
captured the Black Knight Ace,

222
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,041
but I didn't expect to
find such a lovely young girl.

223
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,625
[NUNNALLY] I don't believe
I gave you permission

224
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,833
to enter this area,
Sir Bradley.

225
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,041
[KALLEN gasps]

226
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,375
[LUCIANO]
My apologies, Your Highness.

227
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,458
[KALLEN]
Well...

228
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,208
So you're the
Vampire of Britannia?

229
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,333
[LUCIANO]
Yes.

230
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,000
It's a shame we're
not on a battlefield

231
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,333
or I could savor
your blood as well.

232
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,541
Pity.

233
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,500
So, are you here to
finish off the hostage?

234
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,666
Not so.

235
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,583
Hostages have only
one value I care for.

236
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,125
It seems to
hold dear its own life.

237
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,500
And while alive,

238
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,458
one can do anything he
has a whim for to its body.

239
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:51,083
Have you no sense
of pride, Dear Sir Bradley?

240
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,333
Threatening an unarmed,
imprisoned woman.

241
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,541
[LUCIANO]
The naïve child.

242
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,208
Still getting by
on family laurels?

243
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,250
[GINO]
Hmm...

244
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,333
Tell me.

245
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,708
Are you implying
that it's easy to become

246
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,916
a Knight Of The Round
on family recognition alone?

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,083
[CECILE]
Huh?!

248
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,000
Mount the F.L.E.I.J.A
onto the Lancelot?

249
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,708
[LLOYD] Well the intention
was for Suzaku

250
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,375
to pilot the Guren, but...

251
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,958
The Guren?

252
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,041
Sorry, he's right.

253
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,208
I got so carried away I forgot.

254
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,291
It's just Lloyd and I
got so wrapped up

255
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,791
in our little hobby, we...

256
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,375
[SUZAKU]
Hobby?

257
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,208
[LLOYD] Rakshata's mechanisms
are quite easy to tinker with.

258
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,958
Now it's so souped-up
it can't be flown!

259
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,750
End result, you're our
little devicer again!

260
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,416
[NINA]
Excuse me, Professor Lloyd,

261
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,041
now that you mention
the Lancelot...

262
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,000
[LLOYD] You wouldn't
mix up a strategic weapon

263
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,166
with a tactical one, would you?

264
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,000
[NINA]
I have thought it through.

265
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,208
Any matter caught within
the primary area of effect field

266
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,791
will be annihilated
by the F.L.E.I.J.A.'s

267
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,333
rapid sphere collapse.

268
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,625
Hold on!

269
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,041
You want Suzaku to
fire a weapon like that?!

270
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,458
He'd kill his own people.
A massacre.

271
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,791
Suzaku, you don't
consider yourself an Eleven

272
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,166
anymore, right?

273
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,291
That's why I want to entrust
the F.L.E.I.J.A. to you.

274
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,041
You'd give me that burden?

275
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,166
[NINA] You were
Princess Euphemia's knight,

276
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,500
so naturally...

277
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,583
[LLOYD]
Mm-mmm, Nina, darling.

278
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,708
A fine quandary
might just kill Suzaku,

279
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,791
and take you along as well!

280
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,666
[DIETHARD] Yes.
We've finished preparations

281
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,500
for our worldwide broadcast.

282
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,541
Lin Xing-ke and General Tohdoh
are in the waiting area.

283
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,041
Right.

284
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,375
Very good.

285
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,666
After I meet with the Indian
and Guinean members,

286
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,833
expect me at the assembly.

287
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,583
[LELOUCH]
Do not leave this room.

288
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,958
[C.C.]
Uh, okay.

289
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,583
And so, later...

290
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,375
[LELOUCH]
Later?

291
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,333
I mean, see you later.

292
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,625
Huh?

293
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,625
[laughs]

294
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,291
[LELOUCH]
I'll be off, then.

295
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,958
[EMPRESS] R-Regarding the union
of the nations charter,

296
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,458
I will leave
explanation of it

297
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:04,708
to Representative of the Supreme
Council, Kaguya Sumeragi.

298
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:05,541
[EMPRESS sighs]

299
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,916
Are you all right?

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,666
We could always--

301
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,291
No! I already got the--

302
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,708
You're the Empress.
We know you can.

303
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,000
[TAMAKI laughs]

304
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,250
Good thing we followed
old Zero, isn't it, buddy?!

305
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,250
Sure is.

306
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,583
[MINAMI]
By the way, where's C.C.?

307
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,541
[SUGIYAMA] I heard that
she was still feeling ill.

308
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,041
[TAMAKI]
Morning sickness, huh?

309
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,083
Congrats to Papa Zero!

310
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,041
[MINASE] Tamaki-san, maybe
you've had a little too much.

311
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,750
[TAMAKI]
Bring on the good stuff!

312
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,333
A soldier wearing
makeup is disgraceful.

313
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,500
I have to make you look good.

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,041
Um, sir...

315
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,958
After this current
situation is over...

316
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:43,916
I'd like to propose a request
to Kyoshiro Tohdoh that...

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,708
[MINAMI]
Great! You're finally here!

318
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,166
[SUGIYAMA] Is this any time
to be running late again?

319
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,541
[OHGI]
I know. Sorry, guys.

320
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,666
[TOHDOH]
Ohgi. Did you oversleep again?

321
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,750
Too slow.

322
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,708
Sorry I'm late,
but the truth is, uh...

323
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,416
[DIETHARD]
We're all here, let's go.

324
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,333
It's our day to change all
of the history books, right?

325
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,583
[REPORTER]
We are coming live to you

326
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,125
right over Horai Island.

327
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,666
Where the ratification ceremony

328
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,708
for the United States Charter
is about to begin!

329
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,208
[MILLY] To help viewers
understand this development,

330
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,750
the ceremony and ratification
of this new charter

331
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,458
will create a
federation of nations

332
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,250
that will rival our own empire.

333
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,125
As parts of the
now dissipating E.U.

334
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,000
are joining as well, it will
have a great unified power.

335
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,791
Included from the E.U.are:

336
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,166
Poland, Italy...

337
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,208
Can't reach
soldiers like Suzaku...

338
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,291
No brainer, but why can't
I contact Rolo or Lelouch?

339
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,583
The Black Knights have convinced

340
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,208
all of these these
representative nations

341
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,500
to participate.

342
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,791
Therefore the leader
behind this must be Zero.

343
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,041
In short, the U.F.N. will most
likely be an enemy to Britannia.

344
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,041
Military forces are deployed in
Kyushu, Chugoku, and Hokuriku.

345
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,083
[CROWD applauds]

346
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,916
[REPORTER] As everyone watching
this broadcast has witnessed,

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,291
all 47 nations
have just ratified

348
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:54,291
the United States Charter.
Please stay tuned...

349
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,250
[EDGAR] Lord Guilford,
we've finished preparations

350
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,625
for your troops review.

351
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,750
[GUILFORD]
Very good. On my way.

352
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,500
[phone rings]

353
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,833
[GUILFORD]
Yes?

354
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,500
Don't worry, if it's
about the troop review I...

355
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,083
[JEREMIAH]
Lord Guilford.

356
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,250
Orange boy?

357
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,583
[KANNON] They're forming a union
of nations, just as you said.

358
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,250
[BISMARCK] But the
militaries of each country

359
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,208
will never be able
to work together.

360
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,458
[LOHMEYER]
They'll just be an unruly mob.

361
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,625
No. There is an option.

362
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,666
[REPORTER] ...and those of
international accords,

363
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,416
this article takes precedence.

364
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,458
[KAGUYA] Finally, article 17
of the United States Charter.

365
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,625
All ratifying
nations do now declare

366
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,458
to abandon native
military power forever.

367
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,375
[NUNNALLY gasps]

368
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,833
[SUZAKU]
Abandon military power?

369
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:35,791
[LOHMEYER]
Are they mad?

370
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,208
To guarantee security,

371
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,750
member nations have agreed
to employ a fighting force

372
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,250
not affiliated
with any one country.

373
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,083
They have contracted
The Black Knights.

374
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,791
[ZERO]
We hereby accept.

375
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,708
Our acceptance also allows for

376
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,416
U.F.N. funding and
personnel involvement.

377
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,791
In return,
we will become the shield

378
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,958
to defend every member nation,

379
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,291
and its sword to oppose
any external foe!

380
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,291
The option, right?

381
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,375
[EMPRESS]
Disturbances in this world

382
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,541
are caused by military powers
of disparate nations.

383
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,750
The U.F.N. shall
only use military force

384
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,500
in accordance
with a full resolution

385
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,250
by the supreme council.

386
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,333
And with that,

387
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,416
I shall put forth
the first motion.

388
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,000
[KAGUYA] Japan is being held
by an unjust foreign power,

389
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,625
and the U.S.J.
have asked for our help

390
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,750
to free them
from this occupation.

391
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,208
I request that the Black Knights
be dispatched at once.

392
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,625
All those in favor
please stand up.

393
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,750
[KAGUYA] And so with
overwhelming majority,

394
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,333
under U.F.N.
resolution number 1,

395
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,541
the Black Knights shall now
go forth to liberate Japan.

396
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,791
[ZERO]
So be it!

397
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,208
Under U.F.N.
resolution number 1,

398
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,000
our first operational
objective shall be...

399
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:49,750
...Japan!

400
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,166
[CROWD cheers]

401
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,333
Our Japan.

402
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,041
And now we shall take it back!

403
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,875
Might rescue Kallen, also.

404
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,833
Huh? Yeah, we'll do that.

405
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,916
Hear me, Zero!

406
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,250
[ZERO]
What?!

407
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,583
[KNIGHT 1]
The system's hacked?!

408
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,625
[KNIGHT 2] It's coming in
from 14 external paths!

409
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,625
[SUZAKU]
The emperor!

410
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,666
[LUCIANO]
Well. Look who's back.

411
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,250
Was this fake disappearance
your doing, father? A charade?

412
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,708
Switch to the auxiliary lines!

413
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,041
Cut the link, dammit!

414
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:19,833
[KNIGHT 3]
We can't!

415
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,416
They've got those as well!

416
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,041
[EMPEROR] Zero. You thought this
foolishness would surprise me?

417
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,000
[LELOUCH]
Impossible! He's still alive?!

418
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,500
[EMPEROR]
However, it matters not.

419
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,208
This charter you've made
is a child's note.

420
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,541
The E.U., once a third
of the world, is now dead.

421
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,375
You've only helped
distinguish Britannia on a map

422
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,625
from the rest
of the pitiful dirt.

423
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,458
The situation is
very simple and clear.

424
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,541
For in the end whoever
succeeds in this battle

425
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,291
shall gain control
of the entire world.

426
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,791
Very well. Have at me, Zero.

427
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,583
I'm ready.

428
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,666
So will you win
it all now, Zero,

429
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,000
or will you lose everything?

430
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,125
Time to learn
the gambles of war.

431
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,666
All hail Britannia!

432
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,458
[CROWD] All hail Britannia!
All hail Britannia!

433
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:12,125
[chanting continues]

434
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,291
[TOHDOH]
Long live Japan!

435
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,250
Long live Japan!

436
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,541
[CROWD]
All hail Britannia!

437
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,875
[chanting continues]

438
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,583
[CROWD]
Long live Japan!

439
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,250
[chanting continues]

440
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,791
[LELOUCH]
The emperor is still alive?

441
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,583
[C.C.]
Um, excuse me.

442
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,708
Welcome back.

443
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,958
[LELOUCH]
This isn't good.

444
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,041
Not good at all.

445
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,125
I have to rescue
Nunnally at once!

446
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,125
[LELOUCH] Maybe I could
use Cornelia some way.

447
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,375
No! The hostage ploy
would have no effect on him.

448
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,416
Perhaps use Jeremiah or Rolo?

449
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,541
No, I can't!

450
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,625
And Geass won't work on him!

451
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,166
Should I reveal to the world
that Zero's Lelouch?

452
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,375
No!

453
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,541
If the Black Knights
found out their leader

454
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,708
were an enemy prince,
I'd lose that too!

455
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,083
And rescuing Nunnally is useless

456
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,166
if there's no country
that will accept us!

457
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,333
Dammit! What should I do?!

458
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,708
Um, master, I kept this
last piece so you could have it.

459
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,333
You left without having
breakfast and must be hungry.

460
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,250
So please, if you--

461
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,916
[LELOUCH]
Be quiet!

462
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,291
[C.C. yelps]

463
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,750
[LELOUCH gasps]

464
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,708
[LELOUCH]
Hey...

465
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,000
Forgive me, master,
I'll clean it up at once!

466
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,083
[LELOUCH]
No. Leave it there!

467
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,041
Careful now, you're bleeding.

468
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,125
Uh... No. It's fine.

469
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,625
I'm okay.
I get cut up all the time.

470
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,208
[LELOUCH]
All the time?

471
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,208
Bleeding feels
even better when it's cold.

472
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,375
It feels warm on your outside.

473
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,625
It stings a bit,
but only on the outside,

474
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,250
and that's always better
than hurt on your inside.

475
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,625
It's just...

476
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,458
Any kind of warmth helps
make you try to keep going.

477
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,500
Oh, lookit, master,
you're shaking.

478
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,958
Are you cold now?

479
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,916
[LELOUCH]
Yeah, maybe. Maybe I am.

480
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,875
And the hurt on the inside...

481
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,291
How's it healed?

482
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,791
You just think of...

483
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,916
...some friends.

484
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,166
[C.C.]
I've never actually had one.

485
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,083
Not like families,
that always comes and goes.

486
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,708
I mean someone special
who stands beside you.

487
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:33,500
At least I guess that's what
I've heard that friends do...

488
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,875
Yes, they do.

489
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,208
[C.C.]
I'm right?

490
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,666
A friend will
stand by your side?

491
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,208
[LELOUCH]
Exactly right.

492
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,291
A friend is always there.

493
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:52,750
[phone ringing]

494
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:53,916
[SUZAKU]
I'm here.

495
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,416
It's Lelouch.

496
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,083
[SUZAKU]
I know.

497
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,541
[LELOUCH] Um, so...
Have you seen the news?

498
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,500
[SUZAKU] About Area 11
becoming a battlefield again?

499
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,500
Yes.

500
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,625
[LELOUCH]
The Tokyo Settlement.

501
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,750
It'll be in danger?

502
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,375
[SUZAKU]
Depends... on your decisions.

503
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,416
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

504
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,041
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch. Are you Zero?

505
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,083
[LELOUCH gasps]

506
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes, I am.

507
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,416
I am Zero.

508
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,791
[SUZAKU gasps]

509
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,750
Now tell me why an enemy
of Britannia is calling.

510
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,916
[LELOUCH]
Help me. Please save Nunnally.

511
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,833
The emperor has
been using her as hostage

512
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,625
to try and lure me
into his trap!

513
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,833
Don't you see?

514
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,666
That's why I've had
to operate in secret!

515
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,416
[LELOUCH]
Please, Suzaku!

516
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,625
You're the only person
I can turn to now!

517
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,916
[SUZAKU]
How dare you!

518
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,500
You think that request
means anything to me?!

519
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,625
[LELOUCH]
No, I don't.

520
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,958
But I need your help.
I need it now!

521
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,541
Always so selfish.

522
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,875
[LELOUCH]
Yes! You're all I have.

523
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,833
The only friend I can turn to!

524
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,041
Suzaku!

525
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,291
Protect her. It's Nunnally.

526
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,166
My heart's begging!

527
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,125
[SUZAKU]
Very well, then.

528
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:08,083
[SUZAKU]
However... One condition.

529
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,000
I will protect Nunnally.

530
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,583
But you must come
to Area 11 by yourself,

531
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,041
where she is.

532
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,583
The place will be
the Kururugi shrine.

533
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,458
The two of us meet there.

534
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,583
Alone.

535
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:55,958
[LELOUCH]
With things as there are,

536
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,000
should I have forced
my way through

537
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,208
to save Nunnally much earlier?

538
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,500
But if I had,

539
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,666
I'd be forced to treat her
as an enemy hostage.

540
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,625
And she will never come
to me of her own free will.

541
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,125
With all this hatred
united against Britannia,

542
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,375
I can't stop the
malice that will now

543
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,375
be directed at Nunnally.

544
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,208
It's all too dangerous.

545
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,750
Right. Only one chance left.

546
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,916
All I have left is trust.

547
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,958
I need to trust Suzaku!
