1
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,791
[C.C.]
The one time a man never lies

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,458
is when he makes a
vow in his own heart.

3
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,250
Lelouch Lamperouge made a vow

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,541
to avenge his mother
and to create a world

5
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,541
where his sister Nunnally
could live in happiness.

6
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,416
To that end, he obtained
the power of Geass.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,416
To that end, he became Zero.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
And, he undertook
all that followed.

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,541
At the very least,

10
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:42,375
that was the truth as it
seemed to Lelouch at the time.

11
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,041
Big brother,
the promise you made...

12
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,875
[LELOUCH]
Yes. I'll keep it.

13
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,041
[SUZAKU] So you've agreed
to the Special Zone.

14
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,916
That doesn't wash away the
blood that's on your hands.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,583
[GINO]
Suzaku.

16
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,458
I know, Gino, we've gotta
pull back this time.

17
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,958
[OSI AGENT]
The Black Knights seem to be

18
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,791
diving back underwater.
Shall we pursue the Vincent?

19
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,333
[VILLETTA]
Unnecessary.

20
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,708
Suspend the search for C.C.
until we receive further orders.

21
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,291
[VILLETTA sighs]

22
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,750
Be careful, Rolo.
If they get you,

23
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,958
they'll catch me
in the same net!

24
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,166
[ASAHINA] Join the Specially
Administrated Zone?

25
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,333
What is he thinking?

26
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,083
[CHIBA]
Who knows.

27
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:01,750
Ohgi.

28
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,583
[OHGI]
Huh?

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,208
If Zero is making decisions

30
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,250
that aren't in the interests of
the Japanese people, then...

31
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,500
Are you meaning?

32
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,250
[door hisses]

33
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:09,791
[OHGI]
Hm?

34
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,833
[KALLEN gasps]

35
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,625
Zero, listen.

36
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,250
Master Zero!

37
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,750
How could you leave
your new wife waiting?

38
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,125
[ZERO]
Lady Kaguya,

39
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,875
I'm glad to see you're
well and as lively as ever.

40
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,000
And I see you're still
surprising everyone

41
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,791
like you always do. Offering to
join the Special Zone!

42
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,416
No one expected that at all!

43
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,416
Yeah, she's right.
What was that all about anyway?

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,583
I told ya, he's just
bluffing so we can lure

45
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,541
the Britannians
in and nail 'em!

46
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:41,750
[ZERO] Fighting, then more
fighting and then what?

47
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,666
[ALL]
Huh?

48
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,000
Hold on!

49
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,375
What are you saying,
we should dance with them?!

50
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,750
We fight because we must!

51
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,708
Unless you know some
other way to do this.

52
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,125
No, we can never make
friends with our conquerors.

53
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,916
The Japanese people
are fighting for freedom.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,916
[ZERO]
Tohdoh! What is "Japanese?"

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,500
[grunts]

56
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,125
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Attention all Elevens.

57
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,708
You can now process your
Special Zone applications.

58
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,000
Ah, what do we do
about the Special Zone?

59
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,708
Please don't loose your nerves
about it at time like this.

60
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,416
[ELEVEN 1] Is this going
to be another massacre?

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,041
[ELEVEN 2]
Zero said if we get behind it...

62
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,250
[ELEVEN 3]
We'll be their slaves.

63
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,833
[ELEVEN 4]
Dammit, I just got a work permit

64
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,250
as an honorary Britannian!

65
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,500
[ELEVEN 5]
Exactly.

66
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,125
What's the point of being
"Japanese" again?

67
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,833
[ELEVEN 6] So only people
without jobs should join in?

68
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,791
[FEMALE REPOTTER] Thus far,
no elevens have signed up

69
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,291
for the Specially
Administrated Zone of Japan,

70
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,208
commonly called
the Special Zone.

71
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,250
As there has been
no contact from Zero,

72
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,750
some officials speculate that
he may be facing dissension

73
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,750
within his own organization,
the Black Knights.

74
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,083
[LOHMEYER]
I'd like you to please stick

75
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,125
to the prepared
manuscript this time.

76
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,625
[NUNNALLY]
I was acting as viceroy--

77
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,291
[LOHMEYER]
A viceroy is not a king.

78
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,208
Viceroys act as official
representatives of the emperor,

79
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,791
ruling each area
prudently on his behalf.

80
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,250
We will support your attempt

81
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,083
to revive the Special Zone
this time. But henceforth,

82
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,375
please consult with me on
such matters beforehand.

83
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,208
[RIVALZ]
Leave of absence?

84
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,416
[SUZAKU]
Yeah.

85
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,958
It looks like I'm going
to be a little busy.

86
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,666
With the Special Zone huh?

87
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,458
Oh? And what about all
our plans for the garden?

88
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,958
Sorry, Milly.

89
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,375
I'll be sure to come back
and help out if I get a break.

90
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,375
That reminds me, Suzaku.
Have you thought about Kallen?

91
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,791
[SUZAKU gasps]

92
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,875
[SHIRLEY] Isn't there some
way you can help her out?

93
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,041
[RIVALZ] Yeah, right, like a
plea bargain, you know.

94
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,583
Something like that.

95
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,000
We all know you're working
for world peace and all,

96
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,458
but family and friends
are important too, right?

97
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,250
Couldn't you discuss
it with the Viceroy?

98
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,250
Like when you had me talk to her
on the phone the other night.

99
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,333
Huh?! What?
You talked to her, Lulu?!

100
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,833
[gasps]
With the young princess?!

101
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,583
Uh, well, It was on the
night of the welcome party.

102
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,750
She mistook me for someone else,
so it was kind of a hazy call.

103
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,083
[RIVALZ giggles]
You botched it up.

104
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,666
[ALL laugh]

105
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,833
[SUZAKU] Lelouch, have you
really lost your memory?

106
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,791
Or, are you covering up?

107
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,458
If you do remember,
this is what I'd like to know.

108
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,583
Why did you have
to kill Euphie?

109
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,333
Surely you could have
found another way!

110
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:58,041
Suzaku Kururugi,
you traitor! Time to die!

111
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,833

Sir Kururugi!

114
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,000
[GUARD B]
Are you alrigjt, sir?!

115
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,208
[SUZAKU] You, who used your
Geass to force me to live,

116
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,208
knowing that in my heart,

117
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,291
I sought the
punishment of death.

118
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,500
Someone like you.

119
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,541
[DIETHARD] Yes, that's right
I believe it will be.

120
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,250
We've already sent
Sayoko Shinozaki there.

121
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,000
[ZERO]
I see. Well done, Diethard.

122
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,833
You really are
an expert at this.

123
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:32,250
An outstanding job.
You're truly irreplaceable.

124
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,208
[gasps]
Thank you for those words!

125
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,666
I'm deeply honored!

126
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,875
Are you sure your plan

127
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,166
for the following stage
will be consistent?

128
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,875
Yes I am. Our tactics
may have changed, but our

129
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,166
strategic objective
remains the same.

130
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,333
Take care of things on your end.

131
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,458
[ROLO] You haven't forgotten
your promise, have you?

132
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,541
[LELOUCH]
No.

133
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,291
I will protect this school.

134
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,125
You and I live here
now as brothers.

135
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,541
I won't let anything
interfere with that.

136
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,625
But, I reject the
Britannians' phony claim

137
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,666
to control our destiny.

138
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,583
[ROLO] I'm helping you because I
have something to protect now.

139
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,958
If you were discovered,

140
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,541
this school would be
destroyed and everything lost.

141
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,750
Right. And then
there's V.V. as well.

142
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,916
Mm-hm. He'd kill me as a
traitor without any hesitation.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,125
And I'd be slain in
the next moment.

144
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:19,166
So we share the
same destiny, you and I.

145
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,166
[door hisses]

146
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,125
[VILLETTA]
Sorry I'm late.

147
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,416
Club activities ran over-time.

148
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,291
Uh... so, Zero, what can I do?

149
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,541
Please, Ms. Villetta,

150
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,875
just saying that name
could cost us our lives.

151
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,875
Lelouch, what did you want?

152
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,583
[LELOUCH]
About Ohgi. Do you miss him?

153
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,625

00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,250
[SCHNEIZEL]
Hello. It's been a while.

160
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,208
[YOUNG RESEARCHER]
Prince Schneizel as well!

161
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,083
[NINA] When did you
get back from the E.U.?

162
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,500
A short time ago.

163
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,791
I just completed peace
negotiations with the French.

164
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,041
[NINA] In that case, you should
keep pushing forward.

165
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,416
If you press victory
too hard or too fast,

166
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,875
you're inviting defeat.

167
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,291
[gasps]

168
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,083
In every corner of the world,
people look for hope.

169
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,333
Our victories can trample
that hope underfoot.

170
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,791
That can be true of
enemies and allies.

171
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,541
Everyone has something
they yearn for.

172
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,125
[gasps]
What?

173
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,500
[meows]

174
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,958
You're Suzaku's cat, huh?

175
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,208
[footsteps]

176
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,208
[SUZAKU]
He seems to like you, Anya.

177
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,708
[ANYA]
Japanese clothes?

178
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:31,166
Yes, I always wear them for
any of my training sessions.

179
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,916
Do you miss them?
Japanese things?

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,458
Yes, I wonder.

181
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,333
I do have some
good memories, but I--

182
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,958
Sir Kururugi, I've been
looking for you.

183
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,125
[SUZAKU]
What is it?

184
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,916
[CLAUDIO]
I need your signature on this.

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,291
It's the order to execute

186
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,875
the Eleven who tried to
assassinate you, sir.

187
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,958
[SUZAKU sighs]

188
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,208
[CLAUDIO]
I need authorization from

189
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,458
a Knight of the Round to
carry out the sentence.

190
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,125
The experiments are continuing.

191
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,583
I won't squander the faith
you've shown in me, your grace.

192
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,208
I promise.

193
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,250
[SCHNEIZEL]
Hm?

194
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,500
[gasps]

195
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,916
I haven't forgotten.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,500
During the
Black Rebellion, when...

197
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:15,291
[gasping]

198
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,041
[gasps]
Why didn't it work?

199
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,333
[yelps]
Cécile!

200
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,333
[CECILE]
Right!

201
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,208
[NINA]
Professor Lloyd, stop!

202
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,250
[MILLY]
Nina!

203
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,791
Milly, you, too?!

204
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:29,375
Please let me kill Zero now!
Let me avenge Princess Euphemia!

205
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,083
[NINA]
That prototype was a failure.

206
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,625
But if you give me
a little more time,

207
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,916
I'm certain I can
build one that works.

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,750
You were thinking of Euphie.
You did all of it for her sake.

209
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,125
History may remember her
as a tragic figure,

210
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,625
but I still believe in my sister
and wish to honor her memory.

211
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,541
So do Cornelia and Nunnally.

212
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:49,416
Also Kannon and Suzaku and many
others whose lives she touched.

213
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,833
And you. You believe in her.

214
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,791
And that's why I believe in you.

215
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,750
I'm grateful, Your Highness.

216
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,125
Excuse me.
Is something wrong, sir?

217
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,666
[SUZAKU gasps]

218
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,500
I'm a Round, I'll sign it.

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,541
Yes, that's fine.
Thank you, ma'am.

220
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,583
Suzaku.

221
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,625
[SUZAKU]
Hm?

222
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,208
Are you some
kind of... masochist?

223
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,833
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

224
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,500
You know you're disliked here,
yet you volunteered for Area 11.

225
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,583
Hated as the hero
of the Numbers.

226
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:30,166
As a traitor to Japan.
As the man who killed Zero.

227
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,458
You're always on trial here,
and out of envy and hatred,

228
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,000
they try to pull you down.

229
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,750
There's no point in
trying to make people

230
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,458
understand why I'm
doing all these things.

231
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,750
Because there was someone
who did understand.

232
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:46,125
Anyway, when you get
down to it, I am a sinner.

233
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,250
[GINO]
Hey there, you two.

234
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,708
[SUZAKU]
Uh?

235
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,791
Looks like we gonna get that
call we were waiting for.

236
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,875
The one from Zero.

237
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,916
[grunts]

238
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,625
[CECILE gasps] Should I
really be here for this?

239
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,875
[LLOYD] You wanted to
see Zero, didn't you?

240
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,208
[CECILE]
Yes, but...

241
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,458
[SUZAKU] Sorry, all the
other rooms are in use

242
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,583
for Special Zone perparations.

243
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,916
Oh, I see.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,916
You have to keep this
confidential too, I guess.

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,625
Is there some diplomatic
reason for that outfit?

246
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,333
Ah! Yes ma'am, I apologize.

247
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,583
Here it comes now.

248
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,625
[CECILE gasps]

249
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,583
[ZERO]
Ah! Three Knights of the Round.

250
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,750
However, I don't see
the Viceroy with you.

251
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,791
We don't need to worry
her with the details.

252
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,416
Excuse me. I just
wanted to ask you,

253
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,916
are you the same Zero as before,
or are you a brand new one?

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,333
[ZERO] Zero's truth is
not based on who is within.

255
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,125
It's the actions
that measure the man.

256
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,416
[LLOYD]
Ah-hah! A philosopher!

257
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,000
You said you'd stop fighting

258
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,458
and join in the Special Zone,
but do you have full consensus

259
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,041
on that from all of
the Black Knights?

260
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,208
[ZERO]
I have more than that.

261
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,208
A million people
have been mobilized.

262
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,250
A million?!

263
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,708
And they'll all participate?

264
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,833
[ZERO]
Yes, but there's one condition.

265
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,625
You must let me go.

266
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,916
[SUZAKU gasps]

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,208
[ZERO] Of course,
you'll have to explain this

268
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,500
to your own people,
so I suggest you punish me

269
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,666
by sending me into exile.

270
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,791
[SUZAKU]
And the Black Knights?

271
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,083
[GINO]
He doesn't care about them,

272
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,166
he just wants to
save his own skin.

273
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,458
[LLOYD]
If word of this gets out,

274
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,500
your own people
will string you up.

275
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,375
[ZERO] That's why I've
taken the precaution

276
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,708
of keeping these talks secret.

277
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,916
[ANYA]
How boring.

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
[LOHMEYER] Area law,
section 12, paragraph 8.

279
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,375
It is within the
viceroy's authority

280
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,791
to apprehend subversive
or rebellious elements

281
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,541
and send them into exile.

282
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,666
Miss Lohmeyer!

283
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,666
Are you suggesting
we let Zero go?!

284
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,291
I'm simply stating the
legal basis of action.

285
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,791
[ZERO]
In that case,

286
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,000
you can make the announcement
at the opening ceremonies.

287
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,083
That's some kind of sweet deal?

288
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,583
If the big terrorist runs away,

289
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,750
the little terrorists will
shake and quake and disappear.

290
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,083
Perhaps. But where is justice?

291
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,333
[SUZAKU] Our legal counselors
have confirmed that exiling

292
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,083
Zero would be appropriate
and within precedent.

293
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,333
[NUNNALLY] Right, that might
be for the best.

294
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,958
Crimes have been committed.

295
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,083
My own desire to forgive
them is a personal matter.

296
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,125
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

297
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,291
Would you mind
doing this, please?

298
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,625
I wrote Euphie's
name right, didn't I?

299
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,375
[SUZAKU]
Mm-hm.

300
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,458
Euphie, we're going to
make your dream a reality.

301
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,291
A peaceful and
gentle world, for you.

302
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,333
[gasps]

303
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,125
Uh. Is something wrong?

304
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,541
No. It looks like
there's someone else

305
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,875
who's still grieving
for Euphie's death.

306
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,750
I wonder who it is.

307
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,875
I'm glad there are others
who loved her like we did.

308
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,041
So, are you finished now?

309
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,208
[LELOUCH]
Yes, that was the last thing.

310
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,458
There's nothing
holding me here now.

311
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,500
This is the area of
the Shizuoka ghetto

312
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,583
that will soon become
the Special Zone.

313
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,166
A huge number of Elevens has

314
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,333
already gathered for
the opening ceremony.

315
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,458
As there are over a million
people here, verifying personal

316
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,333
I.D.s will have to wait
till after the event.

317
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,916
The presence of
this many Elevens

318
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,916
is a clear testament
to the enormous power

319
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,916
and influence that
Zero still commands.

320
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,083
[GINO]
What they don't know

321
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,250
is that Zero has already
betrayed them all.

322
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,875
[CREW MEMBER A]
You think there'll be a riot?

323
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,416
If there is,

324
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,416
we'll have the perfect excuse
for a full scale crackdown.

325
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,666
Ah, but remember,

326
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,041
We don't move until
they do, got it?

327
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,125
[CREW MEMBER A]
Yes, my lord.

328
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,833
[gasps]

329
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,166
[OHGI]
It can't be. Chigusa?

330
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,500
[VILLETTA] Kaname Ohgi are
you out there somewhere?

331
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,041
Thank you for coming and
for taking me back home.

332
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,916
Are you alright with this now?

333
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,166
Of course, I was
just an acting consul.

334
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,208
Once a new consul is chosen I
simply have to return home.

335
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,583
Besides, this is an
excellent opportunity.

336
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,375
But, what about
the Black Knights?

337
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,291
The request I made
to Britannia yesterday

338
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,208
should set us up for the future.

339
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,458
[coughing]

340
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,791
Lord Xing-ke,
are you all right?!

341
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,125
Don't be concerned.

342
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,750
I just have to last
a little longer.

343
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,208
[NUNNALLY]
People of Japan,

344
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,000
Welcome to the Specially
Administrated Zone.

345
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,125
I'm overjoyed that
so many of you

346
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,541
have gathered here
for this great event.

347
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,500
Please, lend me your help so
we can make history together.

348
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,125
[CLAUDIO] Lord Guilford,
you're in no condition for this.

349
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,250
The Japan Special Zone was
Princess Euphemia's dream.

350
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,958
[DAVID huffs] But there's still
no sign of Zero anywhere.

351
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,833
That's because the
man is a coward.

352
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,416
He'll only show up when he
thinks we can't get to him.

353
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,333
[LOHMEYER] Now then, before the
ceremony officially begins,

354
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,500
there is a matter we wish
to confirm regarding Zero.

355
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,916
As imperial subjects,

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,416
all those participating in
the Japan Special Zone

357
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,541
will have criminal charges
against them reduced.

358
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,708
And criminals that are
class 3 or lower

359
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,625
will have their
sentences suspended.

360
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,166
However, the instigator
of the murder of former

361
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,708
Viceroy Calares
cannot be forgiven.

362
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,708
Therefore, under special Area
law, section 12, paragraph 8,

363
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,916
Zero alone shall be
banished and sent into exile!

364
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,666
Huh?!

365
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,916
Only Zero?

366
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,500
So that means he gets to
run away all by himself?

367
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,875
[ZERO] Thank you,
my Britannian friends!

368
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,125
[NUNNALLY gasps]

369
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,833
[ZERO] I am grateful for
your lenient treatment.

370
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,375
So he came here after all.

371
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,416
[GUILFORD] Make your move, Zero.
If there's a riot,

372
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,125
we have full license to wipe
out all the radical elements.

373
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,708
Duly authorized
by Miss Lohmeyer.

374
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,125
Show yourself, Zero!

375
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,166
I'll escort you safely out
of the country myself,

376
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,666
I guarantee it!

377
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,458
[ZERO] I don't wish to be in
your debt, Suzaku Kururugi.

378
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,125
However, I have a question.

379
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,458
[SUZAKU gasps]

380
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,916
[ZERO] What does it mean
to be Japanese? A nation.

381
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,166
What?

382
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,458
[ZERO] Is it language?
Territory? Blood lines?

383
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,458
No! That's not it!
It's in the heart!

384
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,083
[ZERO]
Then we're in agreement.

385
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:36,625
A feeling within.
Of belonging. Dignity. Pride.

386
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,583
The culture is
carried in the heart.

387
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,166
You're Japanese no
matter where you are.

388
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,291
[gasps]

389
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,708
[SUZAKU] And what
does that have to do

390
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,250
with you running
away by yourself?

391
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,375
[TOHDOH]
Zero.

392
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,875
[gasps]

393
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,875
[LOHMEYER]
I figured they'd try something.

394
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,750
What is it? What's going on?

395
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,541
Viceroy...

396
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,625
[GUILFORD]
So be it.

397
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,916
All forces, prepare to
cut them down!

398
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,708
[PILOT A]
Yes, my lord.

399
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,875
Hold on!

400
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,458
They haven't made
any violent moves yet!

401
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,958
[GINO] Zero may be the
one who planned this,

402
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,250
but does he have the guts

403
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,041
to come out in the
open and show himself.

404
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,791
[LOHMEYER]
Well, well.

405
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,000
It looks like he was right here
on the grounds all this time.

406
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,041
[gasps]

407
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,750
--[SUZAKU gasps]
--[LOHMEYER] All of them!

408
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,291
[NEWS REPORTER]
This is outrageous!

409
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,333
Zero has appeared,
but not as expected!

410
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,166
That is--

411
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,708
So this was your plan!

412
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,458
Despite our
overwhelming firepower,

413
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,166
you've figured a way to
move a million people.

414
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,208
[ZERO] Viceroy Nunnally has
ordered Zero into exile.

415
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,166
Since we are all Zero, we must
all leave this country at once.

416
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,083
What?!

417
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,291
[ZERO]
No matter where we go,

418
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,666
we are Japan, for we
carry it in our hearts!

419
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,750
[gasps]

420
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,041
[ZERO]
Let us set out for a new land!

421
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,208
[KAGUYA]
Come on, all you Zeros!

422
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,166
Let's go to a new world!

423
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,791
[TAMAKI]
Time to get exiled, everybody!

424
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,500
We're all Zero,
so we're all outa here!

425
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,666
[ELEVEN A]
That's right! I'm Zero!

426
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,791
[ELEVEN B]
Let's get deported!

427
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,833
[ELEVEN C]
I'm Zero too! Come on!

428
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,291
Ah-hah!

429
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,583
He wanted a legal excuse to
get them all out of Japan!

430
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,583
We prepared for a riot,

431
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,208
but we might have
to let them go.

432
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,000
Don't panic, it's a bluff!

433
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,791
There's no way he can
transport a million people!

434
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,625
[MESSENGER] We just got
word from the port authority.

435
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,333
The port? They wouldn't!

436
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,333
The Chinese Federation
requested safe passage for...?

437
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,958
[MESSENGER]
Yes, the iceberg Ship.

438
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,333
But the applicant has
already left the country.

439
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,666
It can't.

440
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,791
[ELEVEN A]
We're getting on that?

441
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:27,916
[ELEVEN B]
But, it's ice!

442
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,208
[ELEVEN C]
Won't it melt?

443
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,708
[RAKSHATA]
We'll be fine!

444
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,791
The iceberg ship
is indestructible.

445
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,875
It has so much insulating
polymer and super-Berthier film,

446
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,916
the ice will never melt.

447
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,875
[DAVID]
Target the leader!

448
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,458
Take out the real Zero!

449
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,666
[PILOT B]
Right! But...

450
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,666
[PILOT C] How do we
know which one is him?

451
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,000
[RIVALZ]
This is...!

452
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,583
[SHIRLEY]
What's gonna happen?

453
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,125
[MILLY] It's that Zero's more
than an idol now, he's a symbol.

454
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:54,750
[sighs] He's made himself into
a living avatar for everyone.

455
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,875
[VILLETTA]
Elevens! Take your masks off!

456
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,000
[TAMAKI]
Britannian witch!

457
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,458
[OHGI]
Don't shoot!

458
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,208
Don't let them drag
us into a fight;

459
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,958
that's not why we're here!

460
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:03,916
Ohgi, is that you?

461
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,250
[OHGI]
Uh, no. I'm Zero.

462
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,291
[NUNNALLY]
Please tell me what's going on.

463
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,291
Miss Lohmeyer has stayed behind
for operational oversight.

464
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,041
You mean leave
everything to her?

465
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,250
It'll be all right.

466
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,083
[NUNNALLY gasps]

467
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,125
Suzaku is there with her.

468
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,500
Sir Kururugi,

469
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,416
we can't let a million
laborers leave the country!

470
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,416
Make an example of--!

471
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,083
Hold on, please!

472
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,083
Zero!

473
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,000
Order them to take
off their masks!

474
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,125
Do it now or there'll
be another massacre!

475
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,958
[TOHDOH] Only if you
order it, Suzaku!

476
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,291
And even if we're all unmasked,

477
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,458
no one would know
who the real Zero is.

478
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,750
Sir Kururugi!

479
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,500
This is an act of rebellion!
Order us to fight!

480
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,833
[OHGI]
He's wrong.

481
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,500
This is a way of resolving
things without fighting.

482
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,958
[GINO]
It's your call, Suzaku.

483
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,708
You're in charge.

484
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,791
[gasps]

485
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,375
[SUZAKU]
Zero we could let you escape,

486
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,791
but a million people?
To let them all go with you?

487
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,708
[LELOUCH]
If the Black Knights leave,

488
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,750
peace will come to Area 11.

489
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,750
And Nunnally's reign will
no longer be threatened

490
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,083
by our presence.

491
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,625
[SUZAKU] Even so, this is
a dirty way to do it!

492
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,291
[LELOUCH] Give the order!
To let Zero go!

493
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,625
[SUZAKU] I must give
the order to shoot Zero!

494
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,833
To kill him!

495
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,166
[LOHMEYER]
Hm.

496
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,875
I'll do it! Zero!

497
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:13,916
[gasps]

498
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,833
[NUNNALLY]
Crimes have been committed.

499
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,958
My own desire to forgive
them is a personal matter.

500
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,166
[gasps]
That's right!

501
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,416
[LOHMEYER grunts]

502
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,875
Euphie and Nunnally both
wanted to forgive him!

503
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,083
We're dealing with Zero!

504
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,541
Zero's to be exiled!
That was our agreement.

505
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,208
If we break it, the people
will never trust us again!

506
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,166
The people?! These are Elevens!

507
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,291
Only you speak of them as people
because you are one of them!

508
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,791
This has nothing
to do with that!

509
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,208
If they're all subversives,
why do you want them here?!

510
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,541
So you can massacre them?!

511
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,333
They've challenged
Britannian rule,

512
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,833
so let them burn in hell!

513
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,083
Shouldn't we get rid of these
disruptive elements then?

514
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,458
They're exiling themselves!

515
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,375
[LOHMEYER]
But...!

516
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,958
[SUZAKU]
Zero, can you promise

517
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,583
that you'll lead
them to salvation?

518
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,125
[ZERO] Of course.
And you, Suzaku Kururugi,

519
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,791
can you promise the
ones who stay behind

520
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,000
will find salvation
in your hands?

521
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,416
That's exactly why I became
a Britannian soldier!

522
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,041
[ZERO]
I understand.

523
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,791
I will trust in the
promise you've made.

524
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,083
[ZERO]
Did you hear that? All Zeros!

525
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,333
Sir Kururugi has declared it!

526
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,625
Rebels are hereby exiled!

527
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,625
Nothing holds us back now!

528
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,500
Forward! To the land of freedom!

529
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,708
[ELEVENS chatter]

530
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,958
[TAMAKI] Let's go while
we have the chance.

531
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,666
[OHGI] Goodbye then,
Lady of Britannia.

532
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,875
[growls] A perfect
chance to kill them all,

533
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,500
and he's throwing it away!

534
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,750
My lord, Xing-ke.

535
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,958
[XING-KE]
Hm?

536
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,208
It sems the Area 11
operation has succeeded.

537
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,583
I see.

538
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,125
Looks like Zero's
next performance

539
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,125
will be... on our stage.

540
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,666
[LLOYD] So, Suzaku managed
to save a million lives,

541
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,875
and no one will ever
thank him for it, eh?

542
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:52,666
I think he knew that going in.
He's used to it now.

543
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,208
[SUZAKU] His whole plan
was based on one prediction:

544
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,208
that I would give the order
to hold fire and let them go.

545
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,208
You know me well, Zero.

546
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,791
[LELOUCH]
You are my worst enemy.

547
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,583
I know you Suzaku.

548
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,958
And I also know Nunnally.
I know her heart.

549
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,708
That is why I could
foresee the outcome.

550
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,916
And, for now,

551
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,541
I am grateful to you,
Suzaku Kururugi.

552
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,666
Don't ever forget the
promise you've made to me!

553
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,250
No matter how I multiply
the avatar of Zero,

554
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:01,833
There is still only one Zero.
That's right, Zero is...

555
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,166
I am... the one
who killed Euphie.

556
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,875
Which makes me a terrorist.
And so, Nunnally,

557
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,000
even your pure heart cannot
forgive my crimes. I have to

558
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,708
call forth a miracle to atone
for the sins I've committed.

559
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:16,125
That's why, Suzaku. Why I've
turned towards tomorrow.

560
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,833
Your becoming a Knight of
the Round changes nothing!

561
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,541
I do this to battle
your power as well!
