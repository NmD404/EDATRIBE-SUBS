1
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,083
[C.C.] For now,
there is still tomorrow.

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,875
For Lelouch Lamperouge, it is
a tomorrow he can dream of...

3
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,083
And that dream
is based on Geass,

4
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,791
the power given to him by
a mysterious girl named C.C.

5
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:34,166
It is the absolute power to
compel anyone to obey him.

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,708
Using his Geass,

7
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,708
Lelouch is determined to destroy
the Holy Britannian Empire.

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,541
...to avenge the death
of his mother...

9
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,291
...and to create a world where
his younger sister, Nunnally,

10
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,583
can live in peace.

11
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:48,750
Japan is now a colony
known only as Area 11.

12
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,708
Here, his vow is made
to change the world.

13
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,541
[ALL]
Huh?

14
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,166
[POLITICIAN]
A child?

15
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,458
[ROLO]
That's right,

16
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,166
I can't remember how
many people I've killed.

17
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,208
[gunshot]

18
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,375
[ROLO] Nobody counts the number
of times they brush their teeth

19
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,541
or eat a meal.

20
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,000
Same with this.

21
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,000
[ROLO] My Geass is
suited to assassination.

22
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,916
That's what I was told.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,916
So I kill. There was
no other place for me.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,625
An under-cover operation

25
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,458
I'll be playing someone's
little brother.

26
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,500
Are you sure this is the
right assignment for me?

27
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,375
I've never known any parents
or family, so it doesn't seem--

28
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,125
No. If that's the
order I'm given...

29
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,375
...then my big brother
shall be Lelouch Lamperouge.

30
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,958
[LELOUCH] Your Geass is
the power to stop time?

31
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,916
I have no reason to answer you.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,208
The orders given to
me are as follows:

33
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,125
If Lelouch Lamperouge's
memories return...

34
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,875
...if Zero is awakened, 

35
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,208
then he is to die.

36
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,750
[LELOUCH]
Sixteen...

37
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,750
Seventeen. Eighteen.

38
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,791
--Nineteen.
--What's that?

39
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:48,666
--Nineteen.
--Why are you counting?

40
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,083
Since the moment you appeared,

41
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,291
I've been counting the seconds
to myself, carefully,

42
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,000
one by one.

43
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,250
But now the count
is out of synch.

44
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,166
Now, why do you think that is?

45
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,333
I'll make you my pawn
to find Nunnally.

46
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,125
Rolo, you can't stop
time, no one can.

47
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,125
You've just altered
my sense of time.

48
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:17,250
Understanding that doesn't help
you; you still can't beat me.

49
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,583
[ROLO]
That's absolute.

50
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,958
No one can live in the
same time flow with me.

51
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:21,958
[LELOUCH]
You're correct, Rolo,

52
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,291
but that doesn't
help you either.

53
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,375
You'd like to kill me
now, but you can't,

54
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,041
and we both know the reason why.

55
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,291
If I die, you won't gain either
of the two things that you want.

56
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,083
Two things?

57
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,291
First, you won't get C.C.,

58
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,541
for whom I've been
the bait in your hunt.

59
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,041
But if you let me go,
I can draw her out for you.

60
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,083
I'll help you get her.

61
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,958
You'd sell out C.C. like that?

62
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,333
She isn't worth my own life;
survival comes first.

63
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,750
And what's the other thing?

64
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,208
[LELOUCH]
Your life.

65
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,166
[ROLO]
Ha.

66
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,500
Like I care about that.

67
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,208
[LELOUCH]
Rolo, what is the future?

68
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,541
The future is hope.

69
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,416
Without hope your life is
on hold. Empty. Waiting.

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,708
And you have no hope
beyond your mission, Rolo.

71
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,583
If you capture C.C., what sort
of future will it open for you?

72
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,416
Things will just go on as they
are and nothing will change.

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,375
But this is my mission.

74
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,916
[LELOUCH] Kill me and your
mission will never be completed.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,916
You wanna capture
C.C., don't you?

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,250
Tomorrow, I'll lure C.C.
out and she'll be yours.

77
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,375
Once that's done, your
new future will begin.

78
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,750
Don't worry. I would
never lie to you.

79
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,583
[LELOUCH]
Not to you anyway.

80
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,916
[KALLEN]
This reminds me of Aomori.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,791
[C.C.]
It isn't as bad as that was.

82
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,375
At least everyone here
is wearing their clothes.

83
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,041
Zero used his Geass on
the consul general, right?

84
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,750
So, why are they doing this now?

85
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,791
Who knows.

86
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,541
Still, if they
run us out of here,

87
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,041
then we and Lelouch will be--

88
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,041
Split up all over again.

89
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,041
--[door opens]
--[C.C.] Hm?

90
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,125
How unexpected. You came alone.

91
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,583
I thought the United States
of Japan had been recognized

92
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,208
by the Chinese Federation
consul general.

93
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,916
[XING-KE]
He's going to be disposed of.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
[C.C., KALLEN gasp]

95
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,541
Or do the Black Knights
choose to take

96
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,458
the path of destruction
right here?

97
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,333
[KALLEN]
Hold it!

98
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,333
You can't just spring that--!

99
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,750
[C.C.]
I see. You can arrange it

100
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,500
so it appears the consul
general is killed fighting us.

101
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,000
[KALLEN]
C.C.

102
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,125
It seems Zero is pulling a
trigger he never meant to pull.

103
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,708
Will this be noble ambition
or base treachery?

104
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,375
[LELOUCH]
Convincing Rolo to wait

105
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,333
bought me a little bit of time.

106
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,666
As long as he thinks
he can get C.C.,

107
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,125
he won't report that I've
regained my memories.

108
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,166
Still, what's his motivation?

109
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,791
Doesn't seem to be a desire
for promotion in Britannia,

110
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,250
nor simple loyalty.

111
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,666
Is there some other line of
question I should be following?

112
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,291
That's a dangerous card,
but it has its merits.

113
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,458
I don't have any
time to hesitate...

114
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,875
...'cause tomorrow,
Tohdoh and the others

115
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,000
are scheduled for execution.

116
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,791
So what do I do? Rolo knows
about my Geass now.

117
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,500
Even if I managed
to kill him somehow,

118
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,333
the O.S.I. would know that
I've regained my memories.

119
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,791
iIf that happens,
Nunnally will be--

120
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,083
[LELOUCH] It seems I'll
have to keep playing student

121
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,750
until I can rescue Nunnally.

122
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,166
Fortunately,

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,041
Guilford's men and the
Office of Secret Intelligence

124
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,041
don't seem to share information.

125
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,250
That explains why they haven't
found the Knightmare I hid.

126
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,541
But that's all I have in my
favor. So what should I do?

127
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,958
How do I save the Black Knights

128
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,875
and neutralize Rolo
at the same time?

129
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,583
[O.S.I. MEMEBER]
Unacceptable!

130
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,541
Did this kid kill Bruno
in cold blood or not?

131
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,833
And he was the fifth one.

132
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,875
All Victor did was
touch the kid's locket,

133
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,041
and the next thing--

134
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,041
Victor had his own
personality problems.

135
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,916
You don't kill a man
because of that!

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Now that there's this guy
claiming to be Zero,

137
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,791
we have to get our
priorities straight

138
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,125
and pull the team together.

139
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,625
That's exactly right,

140
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,750
and I'm not teaming up with
the freakin' Angel of Death!

141
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,291
[ROLO] Team? The mission is
what's important, isn't it?

142
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,208
Who cares about the team?

143
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,541
Hey, Ohgi, is this new Zero
the same as our Zero?

144
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,875
I wish I knew.

145
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,708
Either way, don't
get your hopes up.

146
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,666
He'll probably abandon us again.

147
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,416
[GUILFORD] What was the
source of the explosion

148
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,708
in the consulate?

149
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,208
[BART] They haven't
issued a formal statement.

150
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,416
[ALFRED] They've given their
approval for the executions,

151
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,625
that's all we've heard.

152
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,166
[GUILFORD]
Hmph.

153
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,208
These executions are a crude
show to frighten the Elevens.

154
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,833
What a vulgar approach this is.

155
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,166
You think Zero will dare
to show himself?

156
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,125
Even if he doesn't,
we still come out ahead.

157
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,291
If this "Zero" can't
pull off a miracle,

158
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,416
he'll never gain the
support of the people.

159
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,666
You've thought it through
that far, Lord Guilford?

160
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,625
[GUILFORD] In any case,
I want him to show up.

161
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,708
Or rather, I pray
deeply that he does.

162
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,166
For the sake of Her Highness,
wherever she is now.

163
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,125
[XING-KE] Why did you
recognize the U.S.J.?

164
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,625
On your own,

165
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,041
without confirmation from
the Vermillion Forbidden City?

166
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,875
Even if you are one
of the High Eunuchs,

167
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,125
that was unforgivable.

168
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,083
Just what were you
planning to use Zero for?

169
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,666
I'd no intention to
use Zero for anything!

170
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,500
Zero must be pleased
in every way!

171
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,541
And the Empress's
feelings on this?

172
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,583
That little wench
doesn't matter.

173
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,333
The absolute law is that Zero
shall bring happiness to me.

174
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,958
[XING-KE]
Simpering traitor!

175
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,541
The Crimson Dynasty is dead.

176
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,458
[LELOUCH]
It's no use!

177
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,000
Killing him, controlling
the data, disguising it.

178
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,875
No matter what plan I come up
with, Rolo remains an obstacle.

179
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,208
I need to confirm this data
before the execution starts.

180
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,166
[NEWSCASTER]
It looks like the execution

181
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,791
will be getting
underway shortly.

182
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,666
Once again, these are
the rebel terrorists

183
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,291
who formerly called themselves
the Black Knights.

184
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:43,000
Will Zero appear to stop the
execution of his followers?

185
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,500
[WOMAN 1]
Oh, Zero, please!

186
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,291
General Tohdoh...

187
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,833
Don't kill them.

188
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,125
Zero betrayed us when
we needed him most.

189
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,833
I doubt he'll show
up to save us.

190
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,416
He's gonna come. If he's
the real one, if he's alive,

191
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,458
then somehow, someway
he'll make a miracle happen!

192
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,500
A miracle? Ha.

193
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,208
[VILETTA]
Maintain tight surveillance.

194
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,416
It's a long shot,

195
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,833
but it's possible that
C.C. might show up.

196
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,125
[VILETTA]
Kaname Ohgi... this is the end.

197
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,583
[DAVID]
Show yourself, Zero.

198
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,833
My father, Andreas Darlton,
shall be avenged at last.

199
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,000
--[beeping]
--[DAVID] Hm?

200
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,125
I have top secret orders
from headquarters.

201
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,875
Communications are
being intercepted,

202
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,625
so I'm to deliver them
to you face-to-face.

203
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,666
[ROLO] Right, I'll be
borrowing your identity.

204
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,250
Tell me, how are we
supposed to interpret this?

205
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,708
If Zero appears, you're free
to do whatever you wish.

206
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,291
[C.C.] So, even if we start
shooting at the Britannians,

207
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,791
you can pretend that
you know nothing about it?

208
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,625
[XING-KE] That's not
such a bad deal, is it?

209
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,208
You may be a military officer,

210
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,208
but you can play
politics as well, I see.

211
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,541
[OFFICER]
Sir Kimmel,

212
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,666
any problems with the
A.S.E.E.C. mass-pro unit?

213
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,000
It may have some glitches left

214
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,750
from when the O.S.I.
was using it.

215
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,458
It's a high-value apparatus.

216
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,916
Report in if it
malfunctions in any way.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
[KIMMEL]
This is Kimmel.

218
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,041
No problems with
Vincent. Moving out.

219
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:21,750
[ROLO] Lelouch, if you don't
keep your promise, you'll die.

220
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,916
[BART]
Lord Guilford.

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,708
[NEWSCASTER] It's almost
time for the execution.

222
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,375
The remaining members
of the Black Knights

223
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,541
shall feel the
judgement of justice.

224
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,541
Zero, please!

225
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,708
We're waiting for you!

226
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,750
To make a miracle!

227
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,041
[GUILFORD]
Elevens!

228
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,750
The Zero who you believed
in has not appeared!

229
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,041
It has all been a deception!

230
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,500
I challenged him to
a fair and honest duel,

231
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,125
and he has skulked
away like a coward.

232
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,375
Take aim!

233
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,250
Don't do it!

234
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:52,958
My friends.

235
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,208
[C.C.]
Don't move!

236
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,041
If you go out now,
you'll just die with them!

237
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,625
[KALLEN]
I know, but--

238
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,833
It's all right.

239
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,000
We fought well,
now let's die well.

240
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,041
[ZERO]
You're mistaken!

241
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,291
[gasps]

242
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,583
[ZERO]
You're wrong, Guilford!

243
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,500
He showed up! But still...

244
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,625
Hold back, we can't
jump into this.

245
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,875
If he's by himself,
what can he do?

246
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,250
[GUILFORD]
I see.

247
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,833
You snuck up behind me... Zero!

248
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,291
[ZERO] Guilford. Those aren't
terrorists you're executing!

249
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,708
They are the Black Knights!

250
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,541
Soldiers of the army of
the United States of Japan!

251
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,083
[GUILFORD]
You expect me to recognize them

252
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,041
as prisoners of war?

253
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,291
It's Zero!

254
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,166
So, you did come.
As expected.

255
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,583
But if you break your promise
to me, I'll kill you, Zero...

256
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,583
...or rather,
Lelouch Lamperouge!

257
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,000
[NEWSCASTER]
It's Zero. Zero has appeared.

258
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,000
What a reckless, foolhardy move.

259
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,083
[SAHINA]
Zero?

260
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,041
Yes, but why?

261
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,458
Is it the real Zero?

262
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,916
Of course it's really him! Zero!

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,666
[MAN] I remember they announced
their execution, but...

264
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,875
[MAN 2]
That's all that's been reported.

265
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,375
[MAN 3]
No... no!

266
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,833
[NEWSCASTER]
He's alone. Zero is all alone.

267
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,916
He is riding atop
a Knightmare Frame,

268
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,166
so apparently he's not
here to surrender.

269
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,500
However, if he intends
to fight alone...

270
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,000
See? He came just
like I said he would!

271
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,166
Then let's proceed
with the operational plan

272
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,750
that we started last year.

273
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,875
Assuming that Zero can wriggle
out of the little tight squeeze

274
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,166
he's gotten himself into.

275
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,750
[DIETHARD chuckles]

276
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,791
[DIETHARD] Sayoko, I would
like you to begin making

277
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,791
the arrangements
for our future.

278
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,375
[NEWSCASTER] ...commandos appear
to be waiting to see what...

279
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,500
Where's Lelouch?

280
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,416
He's with Rolo at the theatre.

281
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,875
They've been in there
for the last half hour.

282
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,291
[NEWSCASTER]
What will happen?

283
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,541
[ZERO] It's been quite
a while, Lord Guilford.

284
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,708
Why don't you come out,

285
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,625
and we can talk about
the good old days.

286
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,500
[GUILFORD]
Tempting as that invitation is,

287
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll stay where I am.

288
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,541
We'll just settle
our past grudges

289
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,375
from the insides
of our Knightmares.

290
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,250
If Guilford won't come out,
Zero can't use his Geass.

291
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,833
[ZERO]
Hmph! How predictable of you!

292
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,416
Then let's set some rules!

293
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,000
[GUILFORD]
Rules?

294
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:04,375
[ZERO] The rules of our duel.
We'll settle this one-on-one.

295
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,500
Very well. No one else will
interfere with our combat.

296
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,000
[ZERO]
We will each have one weapon.

297
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,166
[GUILFORD]
Agreed!

298
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,250
[GUILFORD]
I choose this as my weapon!

299
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,000
[ZERO] And for mine,
I shall borrow that shield.

300
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,458
[GUILFORD]
What? But, that's...

301
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,875
[ZERO]
It will do.

302
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,583
He's going into battle
with a riot shield?

303
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,333
So could it be
possible that he is...?

304
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,625
[TOHDOH]
Planning to kill himself?

305
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,125
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

306
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,416
[XING-KE]
You disappoint me, Zero.

307
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,916
[CHINESE ADJUTANT]
What shall we do?

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
[XING-KE] I owe him a debt
for giving me a perfect excuse

309
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,208
to get rid of that
parasite of a eunuch.

310
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:41,208
However, this is hardly a
pledge of endearing harmony.

311
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,166
If Zero turns out
to be incompetent,

312
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,041
then we'll just use the Black
Knights as our diplomatic tools.

313
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,750
I have a question
for you, Lord Guilford.

314
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,333
What do you do when
there is an evil

315
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,750
you cannot defeat by just means?

316
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,625
Do you stain your hands
with evil to destroy evil?

317
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,166
Or do you remain steadfastly
just and righteous

318
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,458
even if it means
surrendering to evil.

319
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,583
In either case, evil remains.

320
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,208
A paradox. Is it
merely word play?

321
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,625
In the name of Cornelia,
I choose justice!

322
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,375
I understand! In my case...

323
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,041
...I commit evil to
destroy the greater evil!

324
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,416
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,958
What the--?!

326
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,000
[CROWD yelling]

327
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,500
[ASAHINA]
A-An Earthquake!

328
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,458
[TOHDOH]
No... This strategy is--

329
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,708
The same one from
the Black Rebellion!

330
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,375
Infantry unit 12!

331
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:43,125
Go to the control room on level
four! Zero's men are in there!

332
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,375
[gunshot]

333
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,250
Kallen, charge in
and take command!

334
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,166
[KALLEN] Right! Autonomous
armored knights, follow me!

335
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,333
Remember, rescuing Ohgi and
the others has top priority!

336
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,250
[BATTLE ALPHA 4]
Alpha 4 to Alpha 1! Respond!

337
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,375
Alpha 1! Somebody, answer me!

338
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,375
Disgraceful!

339
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,583
Yeah, one-on-one my ass!

340
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,208
Whoa!

341
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,333
[BART screaming]

342
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,791
No, Bart!

343
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,708
Black Knights, listen!

344
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,125
The enemy around me has
fallen into our territory!

345
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,833
Wipe out the Britannian forces
and save your comrades!

346
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,666
Our comrades...

347
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,583
He used the very structure of
the settlement against them?

348
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,125
[BLACK KNIGHT 1]
Hurry up!

349
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,458
Release everyone before the
Britannian forces can regroup!

350
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,083
They're going to escape.

351
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,958
Right into the
Chinese Federation.

352
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,708
C.C. is our primary
operational target.

353
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,166
Leave the military issues
to Lord Guilford.

354
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,125
These damned terrorists!

355
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,250
[KALLEN]
Britannia!

356
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,000
You're on notice: This is
Japanese territory now.

357
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,625
[ALFRED]
There is no Japan!

358
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,958
[KALLEN] Oh, really?
That's why I hate Britannians!

359
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,833
Goodbye, Eleven ace!

360
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,458
It's blocked at
this close range?!

361
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,500
[KALLEN]
This is the Radiant Wave Surger.

362
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,416
The moment you came in close,
my victory was assured.

363
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,833
So long.

364
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,083
[EDGAR]
Alfred! How dare you!

365
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,458
[CLAUDIO] Don't shoot! This is
Chinese Federation territory.

366
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,791
But--!

367
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,583
[CLAUDIO] There are
broadcast cameras all over!

368
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,916
[growls]

369
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,083
[SOLDIER]
Th-The Vincent!

370
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,125
The Vincent has charged inside!

371
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,166
I can't move from
here! Run for it!

372
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,208
[LELOUCH] You've come.
You've finally come... Rolo.

373
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,083
[ROLO]
So, you're running after all.

374
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,583
So much for your promise
to give me C.C.

375
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,666
Lelouch, you were lying
to me from the start.

376
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,291
[LELOUCH] Not yet!
I can't get caught yet!

377
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,541
[ROLO] All that talk
about giving me a future.

378
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,541
[LELOUCH]
I can't die here!

379
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,041
[ROLO] As long as I
complete my mission,

380
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,083
I'll open the way to my future!

381
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,166
[ROLO]
Oh, no.

382
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,208
I can't stop a physical object.

383
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,125
[ROLO]
It's gonna be a direct hit!

384
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,333
Am I gonna die in
a place like this?

385
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,000
[CLAUDIO]
David, stop!

386
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,708
If you hit the Chinese
Federation consulate,

387
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,416
it'll start a war with them!

388
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,833
[DAVID]
Understood.

389
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,166
But why?

390
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,375
Why did you save me?
Why would you?

391
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,250
[LELOUCH] Because you're
my little brother.

392
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,583
The memories may have
been planted in me,

393
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:54,250
but the time that you and
I spent together... was real.

394
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,333
[ROLO gasps]

395
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,833
[ROLO]
You're saying...

396
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,625
...all the things we did up
to now... they weren't lies?

397
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,333
[LELOUCH] Because you're
my little brother.

398
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:06,416
[ROLO]
Brother? Me?

399
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,000
That day... I'd never
had a birthday before,

400
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,666
and for the first time...

401
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,625
What about when you told me
your life... was more important?

402
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,625
Yet you risked
your life for this?

403
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,791
[LELOUCH]
I made a promise to you.

404
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,666
I promised you a new future.

405
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,458
Your future is with me.

406
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,791
[GUILFORD] Zero! Our grudges
will be settled now!

407
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,458
With one resounding blow...

408
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,458
...from this iron hammer!

409
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,958
[GUILFORD] What?! Sir Kimmel,
what's the meaning of this?!

410
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,583
Uh, no! I just--!

411
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,875
Don't tell me... you're
one of Zero's men?!

412
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,250
No!

413
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,125
[ROLO] I... If Lelouch dies,
then my mission is...

414
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,083
No, but... What am I doing?!

415
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:57,708
--[phone ringing]
--[ROLO gasps]

416
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,041
Uh, yes?

417
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,125
[LELOUCH] Rolo? Trouble.
It's Ms. Villetta.

418
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,250
I'll connect you
on a conference.

419
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,000
[VILETTA]
Rolo, where did you go?

420
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:06,708
I, uh...

421
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,250
Ms. Villetta, come on.

422
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,416
We can at least go to the
bathroom in peace, can't we?

423
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,708
So, what were you calling about?

424
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,666
[VILETTA] About the Chinese
consulate, of course.

425
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,666
[LELOUCH] Oh, yeah. Looks
like a real mess down there.

426
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,625
[ROLO]
Oh, no.

427
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,958
If they find out
what's happened,

428
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,083
I'll be thrown out
of the O.S.I.!

429
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,666
Even that person would...

430
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,041
[LELOUCH]
I understand.

431
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll keep my little brother
out of danger like that.

432
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:29,541
[gasps]

433
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,583
Of course not.

434
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,875
A place where people
are being killed

435
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,500
is no place for a boy like Rolo.

436
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,416
Britannians, this is
your last warning!

437
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,916
Any further action will be
taken as armed intervention.

438
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,458
Withdraw at once!

439
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,208
[growls]

440
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,250
[TAMAKI]
Hey, hey!

441
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,416
[KALLEN]
Thank goodness! Ohgi!

442
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,250
Thanks, Kallen, from all of us.

443
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,041
[KALLEN]
Mh-hm.

444
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,083
And Tohdoh and the others.

445
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,000
Thank goodness!

446
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,291
Sorry for being so much trouble.

447
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,541
It must've been hard for you.

448
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,916
And for you as well.

449
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,750
Hey, who's in that
Knightmare over there?

450
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,333
I don't know.

451
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:12,125
It was an enemy unit, but I'm
not sure who's piloting it now.

452
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,208
Zero was protected.

453
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,166
Whoever it is,
it's not an adversary.

454
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,458
C.C.'s right there, but
now I can't take her in!

455
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,625
[LELOUCH]
From the beginning,

456
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,625
you never felt you
belonged with Britannia.

457
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,291
You belong... with me.

458
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,750
[LELOUCH]
Ha. He's mine now.

459
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,375
Only an amateur
leaves data like this

460
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,208
lying around a control room.

461
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,916
Apart from his Geass,
he's nothing to me.

462
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,041
Leaving me this guy's password
was very convenient.

463
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,666
And it worked like a charm.

464
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,958
Pattern Delta.

465
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,291
[LELOUCH]
Correct.

466
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,541
When Zero's unit takes
that course, aim carefully

467
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,083
and shoot the pursuing
Knightmare from behind.

468
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,833
After that, if Zero escapes,

469
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,208
destroy the opposing
Knightmare completely.

470
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:57,041
If he does not escape, go into
stand-by mode and await orders.

471
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,833
[DAVID]
Right. I've got it.

472
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,041
[LELOUCH laughing]

473
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,125
[LELOUCH]
Trying to take Nunnally's place,

474
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,791
you little little phony.

475
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:10,916
I'll use you up and then throw
you away like a piece of trash.

476
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,375
[LELOUCH] Who does Rolo
Lamperouge think he is?

477
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,208
Pretending he's really
is my little brother...

478
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,875
...I shudder from the disgrace.

479
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,333
It's too bad.

480
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,791
If you were someone who is
really loyal to the O.S.I.,

481
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,583
I could've had that sniper
finish you off right there.

482
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,708
Still, you'll make
a convenient pawn,

483
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:11,166
so I'll keep you in reserve
a little bit longer.

484
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,291
But never forget.

485
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,333
All you are is a fake Nunnally.

486
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,916
For now,

487
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
we'll play the game as if you
really are my little brother.

488
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:22,250
But one day I'll use you
for a most decisive move.
