[SUZAKU grunts]

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,791
[SUZAKU gasps]

3
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,375
You woke up too soon.

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,416
Uh-- Huh?

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,083
C.C.!

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,958
[ANYA]
What exactly are you doing here?

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,125
Somehow, I get the feeling that

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,541
you didn't come
to help out Charles.

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,458
[SUZAKU]
Anya... What are you...?

10
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,625
Well, at the moment,

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,333
I'm the mother of
Lelouch and Nunnally.

12
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,208
I am Marianne.

13
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,625
[gasps]

14
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,666
[OHGI]
Yeah.

15
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,250
I'm about to apprise Lady Kaguya

16
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,250
and General Commander
Xing-ke of the situation.

17
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,541
I don't know if they're
going to understand or not.

18
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,583
But clearly, there's
one thing to do.

19
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,833
Yeah, I know.

20
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:33,000
Which is--we gotta make
sure that Zero is dead.

21
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,125
[KALLEN]
I need to find out for sure.

22
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,625
From Lelouch.

23
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:41,500
Otherwise... I'll never...
I'll never be able to move on.

24
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,625
So...

25
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,458
...since we have
plenty of time now...

26
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,083
Will you answer me?

27
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,291
Who was it that
killed my mother?

28
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,916
And what's your excuse
for not protecting her?

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,083
[EMPEROR]
How ironic.

30
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,041
Here you are, seeking the truth.

31
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,333
You, who made it this far

32
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,041
only by your deception
and your lies.

33
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,291
[LELOUCH]
That's true.

34
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,375
I've lied every step of the way.

35
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,541
And not just about
my name and past.

36
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,750
I've hidden my
true intentions, too.

37
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,750
But that's pragmatism, isn't it?

38
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,875
People need to play
along with each other.

39
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,041
We melt into a place.

40
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,416
If we didn't, then
nations and people...

41
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,416
...these things called
"communities" wouldn't exist.

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,541
Everyone uses lies.

43
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:24,166
On family. On friends.
In society.

44
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,583
And everyone wears
a different face.

45
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,666
But... is that a sin?

46
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,083
What is one's true face?

47
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,375
Even you wear a mask--

48
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,958
That of an emperor.

49
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,000
None of us can make a move now
without our respective personas.

50
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,416
[EMPEROR]
You're wrong.

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,791
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

52
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,291
When we realize that lies

53
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,000
have no meaning in the
endlessness of eternity,

54
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,083
those personas will vanish.

55
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:53,250
When we understand each other,
conflict will disappear.

56
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,750
That all sounds
like metaphysical

57
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,000
nonsense to me.

58
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,708
[EMPEROR]
It will soon be reality.

59
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,041
[LELOUCH grunts]

60
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,833
[EMPEROR] You see, this is
my Ragnarock Connection.

61
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,000
Soon, these masks
known as deceit

62
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,541
will be discarded by the world,
revealing the truth.

63
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,000
[SUZAKU]
Cs' world?

64
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,375
[C.C.]
In current terminology,

65
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,083
it's the collective unconscious.

66
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,875
A collective of peoples'
minds with memories.

67
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,791
The sea of transmigration.
The great consciousness.

68
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,500
Some refer to it as "God."

69
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,041
Was that what I saw
when we met at Narita?

70
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,000
[C.C.] There, it was mixed with
your personal consciousness.

71
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,708
I'm merely guessing, as I don't
know what it was you saw.

72
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,250
[SUZAKU]
How irresponsible.

73
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,250
Do you like having others
peep into your mind?

74
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,625
It's people.

75
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,708
They're masks are the
collective unconsciousness.

76
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,666
Windows that open into
their minds and memories.

77
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,791
And the minds of people are--

78
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,833
[ANYA]
Oh, forget it.

79
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,666
It's too messed up for me to do.

80
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,125
C.C., could you please?

81
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,958
[C.C.]
Do you really plan to go in?

82
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,333
Yes, of course!

83
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,958
Charles has been waiting
for us, after all.

84
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,416
This would have been so easy

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,916
if you'd only
given him your Code.

86
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,208
Oh... I'll go first, all right?

87
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,833
[gasps]

88
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,625
[SUZAKU]
What are you doing?!

89
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,541
You know, Suzaku--

90
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,208
You and I--we're very similar.

91
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,458
Similar?

92
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,208
In the way that
we both wish to die

93
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,875
and yet are unable to.

94
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,125
[BISMARCK]
Hm? Prince Schneizel...

95
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,416
...and the Black Knights?!

96
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,166
[KALLEN]
Stay alive, Lelouch!

97
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,333
I've got an question that
I still want to ask you!

98
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,833
Wha--?! It can't be!

99
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,916
[MARIANNE]
My, Lelouch! How you've grown!

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,333
M-Mother?!

101
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,250
[EMPEROR]
Marianne, I see you've come.

102
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,000
Is this an illusion?!
You'd do this?!

103
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:44,791
[MARIANNE]
No.

104
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,666
It really is me, Lelouch.

105
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,000
However, I can only take
on my original appearance

106
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,083
while I'm present
within this system.

107
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,500
It really is...?

108
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,416
[EMPEROR]
Lelouch, I will now answer

109
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,916
your previous question.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,541
[LELOUCH]
Tch!

111
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,000
[EMPEROR] Half a century ago,
my elder brother and I

112
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,000
existed in a hell on Earth.

113
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,500
Our family was just rivals
competing for the throne.

114
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,041
Assassinations occurred
with regularity.

115
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,291
Daily betrayals spawned by lies.

116
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,875
Killing each other off.

117
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,708
My own mother fell victim to it.

118
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,208
My brother and I were sickened

119
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:21,166
and angered by the world.
We therefore both swore an oath.

120
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,750
To create a world without lies.

121
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,791
[MARIANNE] Both C.C. and I
agreed to this as well.

122
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,500
V.V., however...

123
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,666
[MARIANNE]
What did you call me for today?

124
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,458
I've cleared everyone
out of here.

125
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,583
I even had Cornelia withdraw.

126
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,083
[V.V.]
Sorry to do this.

127
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,041
Especially without
Charles around.

128
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,000
[MARIANNE] Is this about
the sword of Akasha?

129
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,250
[V.V.] Hm? Oh, no. This is
only about Charles.

130
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,000
Ever since he met you,
Charles has been

131
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,083
acting like a different man.

132
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,208
It seems to me that you
and he have come to enjoy

133
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,208
learning more about one another.

134
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,125
You realize that,
if this continues,

135
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,541
the contract we made
will never be fulfilled.

136
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,875
I'll be left alone.

137
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:58,708
[MARIANNE]
Hm?

138
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,500
From the beginning of time,

139
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,500
it's always been the woman
who's lead the man astray.

140
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,333
[gasps]

141
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,916
[GUARD 1]
Lady Marianne.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,375
[MARIANNE]
I told you to stay out of here!

143
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,208
[gasps]

144
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,916
[GUARDS groaning]

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,458
The job is done.

146
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,541
Right. Begin the cover-up.

147
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,291
Maybe we can make Nunnally
out to be the witness.

148
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,791
It's imperative that
this looks like

149
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,166
it was the work of terrorists.

150
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,166
[MARIANNE]
Anya Alstreim...

151
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,500
The young girl who had arrived

152
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,208
a week earlier to be
schooled in etiquette.

153
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,333
[MARIANNE]
My Geass power was to cross over

154
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,416
into another person's mind.

155
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,791
[MARIANNE] The power that had
been dormant for so long,

156
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,916
activated for the first
time as I was dying.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,041
I hid inside Anya to save myself
from being killed by V.V.

158
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,541
And then, I realized.

159
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,916
Realized that when my
consciousness surfaced,

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,041
I could communicate
mind-to-mind with C.C...

161
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,625
When she discovered the truth,

162
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,208
C.C. left the
directorship to V.V.,

163
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,041
and then disappeared.

164
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,375
[EMPEROR] I spoke with my
brother about it, however...

165
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:13,291
I heard. What a tragedy.
I shall miss Marianne.

166
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,750
[growls]

167
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,791
[EMPEROR]
My brother lied to me!

168
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,875
After we had sworn
to create a world

169
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,000
without deceit!

170
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,708
Agh! How dare you!

171
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,500
Don't try to pass off blame
for everything on the dead!

172
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,708
Nunnally and I!

173
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,625
You sent us to
Japan as hostages!

174
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,916
[EMPEROR]
It was necessary!

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,541
Necessary for what?!

176
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,500
What kind of parent does that?!

177
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,625
If you have someone
you don't want to lose,

178
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,000
you should keep
them at a distance.

179
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,125
[LELOUCH gasps]

180
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,291
[PRODUCER]
Milly!

181
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,625
Uh, when the sun rises,
I wanna get a shot

182
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,708
with ground zero
in the background.

183
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,125
[MILLY]
Okay, gotcha.

184
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,458
[A.D.] Sorry about this.
Relief will be here from Niigata

185
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,250
and Nagoya by afternoon,
so hang tight.

186
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,791
[MILLY]
I'm okay.

187
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,625
[gasps]

188
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,375
[BISMARCK] Right now, we're
suppressing the rebel forces

189
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,208
with the aid of
the Black Knights.

190
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,375
However...

191
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,333
[SCHNEIZEL]
Hm? Is there something else?

192
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,333
[BISMARCK]
Prince Schneizel...

193
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,333
Just how much do you know?

194
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,541
[SCHNEIZEL] How frightening!
What are you referring to?

195
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,166
[C.C.]
I used Lelouch.

196
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,541
I was fully aware of the
truth the entire time.

197
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,833
In order to bring
about my own death,

198
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,625
I had to make his
survival a priority.

199
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,250
[SUZAKU]
Any regrets?

200
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,291
[C.C.]
Not really.

201
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,875
My sensibilities
are quite different

202
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,500
as an immortal witch.

203
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,958
I abandoned my
humanity long ago.

204
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,833
[SUZAKU]
We aren't all alike, you know.

205
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,083
[C.C.]
Huh?

206
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,166
C.C., I want you to send
me to the other world.

207
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,250
Regardless that you
may think I'm foolish,

208
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,125
I can't wait here
and do nothing!

209
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,291
[EMPEROR]
That's right.

210
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,666
I sent both you and
your sister to Japan

211
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,541
to escape my brother's sight.

212
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,583
That's also why I had Marianne's
body secretly taken away.

213
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,708
[MARIANNE]
As long as my body still exists,

214
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,791
there's the possibility that
I'll be able to return to it.

215
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,250
[EMPEROR] Anya and Nunnally
became witnesses.

216
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,958
Therefore, it was necessary
to rewrite their memories

217
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,041
in order to protect everything.

218
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,583
Nunnally?!

219
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,500
You mean her blindness isn't
psychosomatic after all, but--!

220
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,208
Even though she
was a false witness,

221
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,083
there remained a very real
danger she would be killed.

222
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,041
[EMPEROR]
To ensure Nunnally's safety,

223
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,375
proof was needed that would
lead far away from the truth.

224
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,583
[MARIANNE]
The original plan called

225
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,500
for only one immortal Code.

226
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,208
However, for research
to progress,

227
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,208
we had to have
an additional Code.

228
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,958
In other words, without C.C.,

229
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,250
we didn't have a 100% guarantee
that it would succeed.

230
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,708
[EMPEROR] When Marianne was
unable to persuade C.C.

231
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,375
to help us, we were
left with no choice.

232
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,541
We were forced to
use you, Lelouch.

233
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,500
[LELOUCH] Then... What was
the point of me doing this?

234
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,083
These tragedies will
no longer be necessary

235
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,750
once the Ragnarock
Connection is established.

236
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,541
Masks will vanish.

237
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,208
Then everyone can be exactly
who they're supposed to be.

238
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,250
[LELOUCH]
I see...

239
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,875
All the battle and
bloodshed between

240
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,541
Britannia and the Black Knights

241
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,083
was done just
to lure out C.C...

242
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,458
Well then, it seems that from

243
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,416
the very beginning,
I was merely a nuisance.

244
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,166
Just a ruckus in the world.

245
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,458
[laughs]

246
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,708
And, what do you two
think of all this?

247
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,875
Did you already know that

248
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,541
I was going to
come here, Lelouch?

249
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,083
[LELOUCH] And that you
regained your memories, too.

250
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,541
It was necessary for
this plan, wasn't it?

251
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,791
[EMPEROR]
Precisely.

252
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,500
Therefore, I cannot
see any sense

253
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,041
in your coming here
as well, Kururugi.

254
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,750
[SUZAKU]
I'm sure you can't.

255
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,041
I heard you were
already immortal.

256
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,875
That's why there's something
I want to know for certain.

257
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,541
Why did you make this
thing? For what reason?

258
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,875
Why?

259
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,083
Because it's what Nunnally
and Euphy both desired.

260
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,375
They wanted a gentle world.

261
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,875
Now I see. It's obvious.

262
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,250
The time is here.

263
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,500
C.C., since we
are all assembled,

264
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,541
the plan can commence now.

265
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:50,750
I will grant your wish after
everything has been completed.

266
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,333
[voices wailing]

267
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,333
[demonic roaring]

268
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,083
[voices wailing]

269
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,333
[demonic roaring]

270
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,916
[rumbling]

271
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,958
What the--?

272
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,125
Where am I?

273
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,541
All over the world?

274
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,083
[KANON]
Yes.

275
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,333
Bismarck?

276
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,208
It must be His Majesty's
plan coming to fruition.

277
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,958
If His Majesty succeeds
in carrying out his vision,

278
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,458
then whatever is
left of the world

279
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,625
will be yours to govern,
per his royal decree.

280
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,041
Although...

281
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,333
The sense of politics
will have changed greatly.

282
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,625
Behold! It's begun!

283
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,916
The Sword of Akasha
is slaying God!

284
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,250
Now... Once our marks
of Geass become one,

285
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:02,083
the old world will cease and
the new world will spring forth!

286
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,291
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch.

287
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,041
What was your
motivation for wanting

288
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,625
to control the world?

289
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,625
Don't waste my time, Suzaku.
You know it was Nunnally.

290
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,583
Or are you just using
her as your excuse?

291
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,791
[LELOUCH chuckles]
Yes, you're right.

292
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,000
I am.

293
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,541
I have fought to protect
everything I thought

294
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,125
I wanted to protect.

295
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,875
[SUZAKU] If you're going
to achieve that end,

296
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,708
you need to take action.

297
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,125
[LELOUCH]
Yes.

298
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,625
The means to that end requires
me to reject something.

299
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,791
[SUZAKU]
Which is...?

300
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,458
[LELOUCH]
That... I...

301
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,291
[EMPEROR]
Hm?

302
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,916
[LELOUCH]
I reject you!

303
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,666
And I reject everything
you believe!

304
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,125
Why do people lie?

305
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,541
It isn't only because they
struggle against each other.

306
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,125
It's also because there's
something that they're seeking!

307
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,500
[C.C.]
Ah...

308
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,875
You now want a world
without change. How stagnant!

309
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,333
You could hardly call it life!

310
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,666
The same as a world of memories!

311
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,166
Just a world that's
closed and completed!

312
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,208
That's a place I
wouldn't wanna live in!

313
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,500
But, Lelouch...

314
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,916
Are you saying you're
rejecting me, as well?

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,250
That depends.

316
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,625
Is your desire the same
as His Majesty's, Mother?

317
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,791
[MARIANNE] It will be so good
to rejoin all the people

318
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,958
from whom we've been separated.

319
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,166
You can be reunited with
those who have died.

320
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,375
Even Euphemia.

321
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,750
[SUZAKU grunts]

322
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,083
As I expected.

323
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,791
You both believe
that this new world

324
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,916
you envision will
be best for all.

325
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,625
But forcing your good
intentions on others

326
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,583
is no different
from an evil act!

327
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,083
In time, the people
will come to accept it.

328
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,458
[LELOUCH]
That time will never come!

329
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,750
Only one thing is
undeniably certain.

330
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,333
I understand now that what
you did to Nunnally and me

331
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,458
may have been done out of
good intentions. But...

332
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,458
The hard fact remains
that you abandoned us

333
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,541
in a foreign land!

334
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,000
But we did that to protect you!

335
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,333
[LELOUCH]
Then why didn't you stop the war

336
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,541
between Japan and Britannia?!

337
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,666
[gasps]

338
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,041
[LELOUCH] The plan was such
a priority for you both,

339
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,166
that it didn't matter to either
of you if Nunnally and I

340
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,583
were alive or dead.

341
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,125
That's why you abandoned us!

342
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,166
All you have left are
self-serving excuses!

343
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,458
[MARIANNE]
Lelouch, you're wrong!

344
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,958
You just told me!

345
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,041
You said that the dead
will rejoin the living!

346
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,958
You don't give a damn
about the future!

347
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,750
[EMPEROR] The future is
the Ragnarok Connection!

348
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,208
Once it's finally done,
the gentler existence

349
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,666
that Nunnally spoke of will--!

350
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,125
Stop it!

351
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,833
The world you're speaking of
will be kinder and gentler

352
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,250
only for you!

353
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,291
The world that
my sister wished for

354
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,541
is one in which kindness
is extended to everyone,

355
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,083
even strangers.

356
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,625
[SUZAKU]
He may be right.

357
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,541
At the very least, Euphy never
said that Lelouch was Zero,

358
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:26,541
even to the very end. Shirley
didn't either! That's why I...!

359
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,791
Let's say it was
true. What of it?

360
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,166
There's nothing to
be done about it.

361
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,250
The Ragnarok Connection
has begun!

362
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,833
You think so?

363
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,666
I am Zero!

364
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,500
The man who works miracles!

365
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,041
our Geass power will
have no effect on me!

366
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,625
Nor will it on anyone else here!

367
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:42,750
[LELOUCH]
No.

368
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,333
There's someone else
here, isn't there?

369
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,833
Huh?

370
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,000
That's right!

371
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,250
Cs' World is the will
of mankind itself!

372
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,041
And all men are not equal!
Remember those words?

373
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,708
They're your own!
And because of that,

374
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,333
I'm sure you realize
that my power will work!

375
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,250
[EMPEROR]
You're a fool, Lelouch!

376
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,958
God cannot be defeated by
the power of the king!

377
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,833
[LELOUCH]
I don't intend to defeat God!

378
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:08,500
This is a request! Yes!
Now I know who I really am!

379
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,583
God!

380
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,041
Collective unconscious!

381
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,166
[gasps]

382
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,208
[moaning]

383
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,875
Please, don't stop
the march of time!

384
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,416
Lelouch, you
ungrateful child--Agh!

385
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,916
Nobody would have wanted this!

386
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,916
No one! And
especially not Euphy!

387
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,416
And I saved you
so that you could

388
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,666
talk to Euphy again!

389
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,375
Meaning you were going
to force me to, right?!

390
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,250
You can't do this, boy!

391
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,041
Not against God, nor all
of humanity itself!

392
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,291
[LELOUCH]
Regardless, what I want...

393
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,291
...is tomorrow!

394
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,541
[gasps]

395
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,875
It can't be!

396
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,583
The Thought Elevator is falling!

397
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,041
The dream that I...
and Marianne...

398
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,000
...and my brother all shared...

399
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,416
[C.C.]
Charles, just stop already.

400
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,000
It was presumptuous of us
to even attempt this.

401
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,125
[EMPEROR] C.C.! We still
bear the marks of Geass!

402
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,083
No matter what occurs, we--

403
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,083
This isn't a falsehood, Father.

404
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,625
It's reality's response.

405
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,666
[MARIANNE]
Darling?! You--!

406
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,458
[EMPEROR]
No! It's not possible!

407
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,416
I'm supposed to be immortal!

408
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,916
We're being absorbed?
Consumed by Cs' World?!

409
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,583
But what about C.C.?!

410
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,708
Why isn't she
disappearing, as well?!

411
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,958
You supported this plan
as much as we did!

412
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,958
[C.C.]
Sorry. But I finally realized.

413
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,583
The love you have
is only for yourselves.

414
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,333
No, that's not true at all!
We love our children very much!

415
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,916
You have any idea
what the meaning is

416
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
behind Nunnally's
beautiful smile?

417
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,875
Ah-- The meaning?

418
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,375
Why don't you understand?!

419
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,166
Nunnally was blinded!
My own sister was crippled!

420
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,458
She knew!

421
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,875
She knew that there
were things in this world

422
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,916
that she would never be
able to do by herself!

423
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,375
So her smile--

424
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,166
Nunnally's smile...

425
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,083
...was her way of
expressing gratitude!

426
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,083
[EMPEROR] You're laboring
under a delusion!

427
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,000
I will not let you
call that a lie!

428
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,750
Over my dead body!

429
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:04,666
Your refusal to face reality!
Content to watch us from afar!

430
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,458
Don't make me laugh!

431
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,208
There's only one truth here!

432
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,583
You, my own parents...
You abandoned us!

433
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,166
--[MARIANNE gasps]
--[EMPEROR growls]

434
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,708
You clever little fool...!

435
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,041
Suzaku!

436
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,458
Stay out of this!

437
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,875
[EMPEROR] Can't you understand
that If you refuse me

438
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,458
and what I offer, you
will inherit his world!

439
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,666
Schneizel's world!

440
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,208
Do not judge me!

441
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,791
Good and evil intentions are
on each side of the same card!

442
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,375
Even then, you still have--

443
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,583
No matter what,
I'll always reject

444
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,458
the world you envision.

445
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,833
Be gone now!

446
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:36,833
[screams]

447
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:42,208
[MARIANNE, EMPEROR screaming]

448
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,791
[BISMARCK gasps]
It can't be!

449
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,416
Can I assume that...?

450
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,541
Yes. His Majesty has now been--!

451
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,208
[LELOUCH]
C.C... are you going, as well?

452
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,750
[C.C.] When death comes,
you want to at least

453
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,750
be smiling, right?

454
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,958
And, you two?

455
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,708
What are you planning to do now?

456
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,750
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

457
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,125
[C.C.]
You rejected Charles' plan.

458
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:10,291
Instead, you chose reality
and the forward march of time.

459
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,291
However...

460
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,583
I know.

461
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,625
Lelouch is the person
who murdered Euphy.

462
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,208
What of it?

463
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,375
[MILLY] It has been one month
since the destruction

464
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,291
caused by the
F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

465
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,166
Today, His Majesty
Emperor Charles

466
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,458
will make an
important announcement

467
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,833
to the entire nation.

468
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,083
We will be bringing you
live international coverage

469
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,250
of this from Pendragon
imperial palace.

470
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,958
Even though His
Majesty has not made

471
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,708
any public appearances
in the past month--

472
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,666
[CAROLINE]
Didn't somebody say

473
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,208
that the emperor was missing?

474
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,125
[GUINEVERE] Bismarck was
the one who reported that,

475
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,375
and now he's gone.

476
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,666
As for Schneizel and the
others, where are they?

477
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,791
Don't know.

478
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,458
There's been no word
from Cambodia yet.

479
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,833
Presenting his Imperial Majesty!

480
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,458
[PALACE GUESTS murmuring]

481
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,083
[ODYSSEUS]
Hm?!

482
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,416
But that's not...

483
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,125
Where's His Majesty?

484
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,375
What the hell?!

485
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,500
Wha...?! It can't be!

486
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,125
But how?

487
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,291
There's no way!

488
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,166
[PALACE GUESTS murmuring]

489
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,541
[LELOUCH]
Greetings.

490
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,416
I am Lelouch vi Britannia
of the royal family.

491
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,291
99TH emperor of the realm.

492
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,458
Good lord.

493
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,291
How can this be?!

494
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,958
I-It's really you?!

495
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:23,875
You're alive?

496
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,375
Yes, sister, I am.

497
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,916
I've returned from the
depths of hell intact.

498
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,708
[ODYSSEUS]
Lelouch, how good to see you!

499
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,000
When Nunnally was located,

500
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,625
I figured that you would
be found alive, too.

501
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,541
But now, aren't you
carrying this joke

502
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,000
a bit too far?

503
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,458
That's the throne
of our father--

504
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,500
Charles zi Britannia,
the 98th emperor,

505
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,625
no longer lives. And I'm
the one who took his life.

00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,000
--Huh?!
--[PALACE GUESTS gasp]

507
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,125
[LELOUCH] Therefore... that
makes me the next emperor!

00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,083
[CAROLINE] What are you
saying?! Are you nuts?!

509

and execute him!

00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,083

murdering our emperor!

513
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,583
[LELOUCH] May I introduce...
Suzaku Kururugi.

514
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,875
My knight.

515
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,583
A Knight of the Round
above all others.

516
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,541
I grant him the title
"Knight of Zero."

working together?!

518

[ODYSSEUS] Lelouch, Sir
Kururugi, this just won't do.

519
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,083
Pulling a bad stunt like this
on an international broadcast!

520
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,458
Do you think so?

521
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,541
Let me make this easy
for you all to understand.

00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,958
Acknowledge me as emperor!

stop joking around like--

526
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:53,625
[PALACE GUESTS chanting] All
hail Lelouch! All hail Lelouch!

527
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,500
I need to thank you, Lelouch.

528
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,208
Now that you've
reappeared on the scene,

529
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,708
we no longer have a
problem to contend with.

530
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,416
But why is Kururugi helping
him? What's his reason?

531
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,958
He succeeds in
furthering himself

532
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,875
by continually betraying others.

533
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,333
Don't be concerned.

534
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,166
Let Lelouch have all of it,
because it doesn't matter.

535
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,833
He can have Britannia,
the whole nation.

536
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,916
The question is,
what comes next?

537
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,375
Which will control the world?

538
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,666
Will it be Lelouch's Geass
power? Or will it be...?

539
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,833
[LELOUCH] There is nothing
that is unforgivable.

540
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,500
It's only the willingness
not to forgive.

541
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,208
That was something
Shirley once told Suzaku.

542
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,208
And that was the starting
point in the conversation

543
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,583
I had with him.

544
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,166
The starting point
to face reality.

545
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,791
There is nothing
that Suzaku and I

546
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,416
can't accomplish together.

547
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,500
[LELOUCH chuckles]
How ironic.

548
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,916
I, the one who has
perpetually rejected

549
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,041
and denounced Britannia...
