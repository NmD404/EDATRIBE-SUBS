1
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,041
Long live the Black Knights!
Hip, hip, hooray!

2
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:25,250
[CROWD cheering]

3
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,916
[KALLEN] What happened
to that Knightmare?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,083
The one that saved Zero?

5
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,458
It escaped using a
route Xing-ke gave us.

6
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,541
[LELOUCH]
Xing-ke?

7
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,791
The Chinese Federation
guy I mentioned.

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,250
[LELOUCH]
I see.

9
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,958
Then I'll be sure to make
use of that route, as well.

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,750
So, was that pilot the same
one from Babel Tower?

11
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,375
[LELOUCH] Because of
what happened to Urabe,

12
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,791
I won't tell you his name.

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,541
Simply think of him as a
person who supports our cause.

14
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,750
You didn't use your
Geass on him, did you?

15
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,750
[LELOUCH] As it turned out,
I didn't need to.

16
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,750
Anyway, C.C., about
the Emperor and--

17
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,041
Now wait a minute!

18
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,208
You'll keep the pilot
a secret from me?!

19
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,541
So what?

20
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,666
There are times when
I like to keep secrets, too.

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,916
Are you speaking as Zero,
or Lelouch right now?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,583
It's not as if
everyone knows about

23
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,833
our relationship, do they?

24
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,166
Stop saying weird stuff
like that, all right?!

25
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,041
And your true identity?

26
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,208
Kallen and I are the only
ones among the group

27
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,708
who know who you really are.

28
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,208
That's secret, too.

29
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,166
[KALLEN] Lelouch, do you still
want me to be the captain

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,083
of Zero's personal force,
as I have been?

31
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:19,958
[LELOUCH]
I do.

32
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:20,958
[KALLEN]
Understood.

33
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,916
I'll consider that
roger and out!

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,250
I'm counting on you, now.

35
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,166
[door hisses]

36
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,541
We'll talk about Geass later.
There are more pressing matters.

37
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,083
Very well. I catch your drift.

38
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,000
Here it is! Man,
I've missed my old uniform!

39
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,583
Rock n' roll...!

40
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,416
[BLACK KNIGHT A] I can't believe
they had all this ready for us!

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,666
[BLACK KNIGHT B]
They say Captain Kouzuki

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,833
and Urabe arranged it.

43
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:43,958
[BLACK KNIGHT C]
Oh man...

44
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,166
Oh, I see. And you
say Urabe died well?

45
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,416
Yes.

46
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,291
You should just
confess already.

47
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,375
W-What do you
mean by "confess?"

48
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,500
[BLACK KNIGHT C]
It's Zero!

49
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,750
[BLACK KNIGHTS chatter]

50
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,333
Hold it! Hold it!

51
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,750
While we appreciate
your rescuing us, Zero,

52
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,666
we wouldn't have been
captured in the first place

53
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,375
if you hadn't betrayed
us the way you did!

54
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,250
Don't you owe us an explanation?

55
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,291
[KALLEN gasps]

56
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,958
What happened?
We deserve to know!

57
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,583
[ZERO] Everything is for
victory over Britannia.

58
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,833
Okay... Go on.

59
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:17,666
[ZERO]
That's all.

60
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,833
[BLACK KNIGHTS]
Huh?!

61
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:19,916
Nothing more to say?

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,833
No apologies? No excuses?

63
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,333
[TOHDOH]
Stop it!

64
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,875
Zero.

65
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,291
Were your actions intended to
give us a chance of winning?

66
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,500
[ZERO] I'm always focused
on getting results.

67
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,791
I understand.

68
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,000
[CHIBA gasps]

69
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,750
At times, our operations
must be kept secret.

70
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,958
Right now, we need
to rely on his power!

71
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,750
I can think of no
one more capable

72
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,291
than Zero to be our leader!

73
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,916
I agree! We should
all trust Zero!

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,750
But Zero treated you as if you
were nothing more than a pawn.

75
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,916
Who other than Zero could
have pulled this off?!

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,041
Even the Chinese Federation
isn't strong enough

77
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,000
to wage war on Britannia!

78
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,125
And the E.U. continues to lose
to Prince Schneizel, doesn't it?

79
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,083
We're the last hope
out of all the Areas

80
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,125
that Britannia
has colonized.

81
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,583
Zero is the only one who
can lead us to victory

82
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,166
in our war of independence!

83
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,041
Ohgi's right!

[SUZAKU]
Hello, everyone.

88
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,416
My name is Suzaku Kururugi,
and I'll be returning to

89
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,041
classes here at Ashford
Academy starting today.

90
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,875
I look forward to
studying here.

91
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,416
[MALE STUDENT 1]
Suzaku Kururugi?!

92
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,083
[MALE STUDENT 2]
The guy who caught Zero?!

93
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,333
[MALE STUDENT 3] The White Death
is coming to school here?!

94
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,000
[FEMALE STUDENT 1]
He's the Knight of Seven.

95
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,250
[FEMALE STUDENT 2]
But, he's an Eleven.

96
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,333
[FEM STUDENT 1]
Doesn't matter.

97
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,708
He's the emperor's
immediate subord--

98
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,166
[VILLETTA]
Okay, quiet down!

99
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,083
Sir Kururugi has been
reassigned to Area 11,

100
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,291
and that's why he's coming
back to school here.

101
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,666
Why don't you take the desk
next to Lelouch for now.

102
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,916
[SUZAKU]
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,041
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku... You...

104
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,958
You were my first real friend.

105
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,791
[SUZAKU]
But... the war tore us apart.

106
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,625
[LELOUCH]
The Second Pacific War.

107
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,166
The conflict in which Britannia
took control of Japan.

108
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,500
[SUZAKU]
After it's defeat,

109
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,416
Japan became an Area
colony of Britannian.

110
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,875
[LELOUCH] I, who was
abandoned by my homeland...

111
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,416
[SUZAKU] I, who was forced
to abandon my homeland...

112
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,041
[LELOUCH] When reunited, we were
at once enemies and allies.

113
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,791
[SUZAKU]
Although I was Japanese,

114
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,083
I was also a Britannian soldier.

115
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,375
[LELOUCH]
I was Zero.

116
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,625
We both hid our true identities.

117
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,125
[SUZAKU]
We fought each other.

118
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,000
[LELOUCH]
However, those are memories

119
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,791
of what really happened.

120
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,375
[SUZAKU] The emperor
rewrote three things

121
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,083
in Lelouch's memory.

122
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,708
[LELOUCH]
Nunnally...

123
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,625
[SUZAKU]
Anything about Zero...

124
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,958
[LELOUCH]
And that I...

125
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,500
...was a prince of the
royal family of Britannia.

126
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,958
[LELOUCH, SUZAKU]
And so, the two of us now...

127
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,541
Hey, welcome back.
It's been some time.

128
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,125
I missed everyone a lot.

129
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,791
Suzaku, it feels like forever!

130
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,833
You've really come up
in the world, haven't you!

131
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,750
Suzaku's back?! Where is he?!

132
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,875
Madame President!

133
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,708
Class is in progress. You mind?

134
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,375
[MILLY] Oh, what's
with you, Lelouch?

135
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,541
[LELOUCH]
You screwed up, Suzaku.

136
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,958
When you heard the name Lelouch,

137
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,375
you just walked
right to my side.

138
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,500
In other words, you acted
as if you knew me.

139
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:51,291
Now, to make sure Rolo
doesn't do anything stupid.

140
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,166
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

141
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,208
[gasps]

142
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,583
[SHIRLEY] And so everybody
up and left, except us.

143
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,958
They all went back home.
Even the teachers!

144
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,208
[SUZAKU]
Back to the homeland?

145
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,458
[LELOUCH]
Yeah.

146
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,708
And that's the reason
why we're the only ones

147
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,208
here at the school who
know you. Right, Rolo?

148
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,791
[ROLO]
R-Right.

149
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,416
That explains why I don't
recognize any one here.

150
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,583
Hey, you saw
Zero's face, didn't you?

151
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,833
So what did he look like?

152
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,208
Is he really a girl?

153
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,875
It's really
Prince Clovis, right?

154
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,000
Or a prince from
another country?

155
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,875
Uhh...well, um...

156
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,583
Can't you share that with us?

157
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,625
No, it's a military secret.

158
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,875
--I'm sorry-- Ah!
--[ARTHUR growls]

159
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:27,833
Arthur!

160
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,541
Ah! You brought him with you?

161
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,208
[LELOUCH]
Well, Suzaku,

162
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,958
you really have a thing
for cats, don't you?

163
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,958
[VILLETTA]
Did anything leap out at you

164
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,375
during your contact with him?

165
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,250
[SUZAKU]
No, not especially.

166
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,416
[VILLETTA]
Then we can conclude that

167
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,333
the subject's memories
haven't returned?

168
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,750
Wait just a minute.

169
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,041
Please, I feel we have to
investigate this further.

170
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,500
Do you mean you don't
trust our surveillance?

171
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,500
There's also the matter of C.C.

172
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,958
Continue playing
his little brother

173
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,000
just the way you have been.

174
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,125
All right, my lord.

175
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,458
It seems the student council

176
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,875
is planning to throw
you a welcoming party.

177
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,791
Please reconfirm his state then.

178
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,041
Yes, understood.

179
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,500
[ROLO]
What should I do?

180
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,666
Do I dare trust Lelouch?

181
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,000
Teacher, could you
please overlook

182
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,583
all the campus infractions that
Rolo and I are involved in?

183
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,041
Very well. I can do that.
Just don't wander off

185

[LELOUCH, ROLO]
Yes, sir.

00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,416
The only member left
now is Ms. Villetta, right?

187
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,291
[ROLO]
Correct.

188
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,541
But Suzaku Kururugi is here now.

189

Shall I kill him?

190
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,750
You shouldn't behave like that.

Oh, and something else...

Yes?

193
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,541
[LELOUCH] Can you quit speaking
to me in such a formal manner?

194

After all, we are
supposed to be brothers.

Don't worry.

for your sake, as well.

of Lord Guilford's absence, too.

that Area 11's got to offer?

you care more about
protecting the building.

we're dealing with.

you guys to the test.

245
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,291
to bring Lancelot here for me.

246
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,750
[GINO] Yeah, but Earl Asplund
is coming with it next week.

And not to change the subject,
but what's with that outfit?

from school. It's required.

a great, noble family,

00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,541
but can't you act more normal?

253
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,708

344
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,875
Uh?

345
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,458
[MILLY] Um, has Earl Asplund
happened to mention me?

346
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,875
[ARTHUR whimpers]

347
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:56,875
Afraid not.

348
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,500
[MILLY]
Maybe he was overwhelmed?

349
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,083
The wedding was put off because
I had to repeat school.

350
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,416
[SUZAKU]
The thing with him is...

351
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,000
So many things are wrong
with him as a human being,

352
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,458
so--Uh! What the--?

353
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,250
[ARTHUR meowing]

354
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,833
[SUZAKU]
Arthur! That was Euphie's!

355
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,208
Suzaku!

356
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,916
You're the guest of honor!
You have to wait here!

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,166
You can't run off like that!

358
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,625
[GINO]
What have we here?

359
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,583
They're using a Knightmare
to create a giant pizza?!

360
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,750
[LELOUCH] So, the person who
gave the emperor his Geass

361
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,750
is the same person
who told Suzaku?

362
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,083
[C.C.]
That's right.

363
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,291
But you shouldn't delve
into it any further.

364
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,541
[LELOUCH] I'm already
involved in this.

365
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,291
V.V.

366
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,500
V.V.?

367
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,583
Did he give Suzaku
a Geass power?

368
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,125
[C.C.] No, it doesn't
appear that he did.

369
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,416
Aanyway, about Villetta--

370
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,541
[SHIRLEY]
Lulu!

371
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,625
[C.C.]
Uh?

372
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,291
--What's up, Shirley?
--[C.C. grunts]

373
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,875
[SHIRLEY]
Hm? Oh, there you are.

374
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,583
[LELOUCH]
Do you need something?

375
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,875
[SHIRLEY]
Well, I have a little problem

376
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,375
that I hope you
can help me with.

377
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,125
Ms. Villetta seems
to be avoiding me,

378
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,708
so I was thinking you should...
Huh? You're alone?

379
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,166
[LELOUCH]
Yeah.

380
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,250
I could've sworn you were
talking to someone just now.

381
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,291
Nope. We're the only ones here,
just the two of us.

382
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,416
[C.C. grunts]

383
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,750
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

384
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,916
[SHIRLEY] Just the two of us?
What awful timing,

385
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,708
but this might be my best
chance to tell him how I feel.

386
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,833
Listen, um, Lulu.
Would you go out--

387
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,875
[yelps]

388
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,833
[LELOUCH] Sorry, but I
couldn't quite catch that.

389
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,916
Hey! What's the big idea?!

390
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,125
[LELOUCH]
What are you doing?!

391
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,583
If someone spots you, as well--

392
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,333
Don't worry! I'm came here
to take Pizza Girl back!

393
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,583
[LELOUCH] Fine. She's in
with the tomatoes.

394
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,708
Take the whole container,

395
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,208
then have Tohdoh or
Ohgi command the--

396
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,625
[LELOUCH groans]

397
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,500
[LELOUCH, SHIRLEY yelp]

398
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,375
Who's in there being so rude!

399
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,625
[LELOUCH groans]
How undignified!

400
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,625
[SHIRLEY] Will you quit standing
there and say something!

401
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,333
[KALLEN] If I say something,
she'll find out who I am!

402
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,125
[SHIRLEY]
Ugh! Hey, wait!

403
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,083
Shirley! Be careful with that!

404
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,291
--Hey, Lelouch!
--[LELOUCH] Huh?

405
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,875
Say, have you seen Arthur?!

406
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,916
He grabbed a valuable
quill pen from me, and--

407
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,750
[banging]

408
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,416
[LELOUCH]
Uh!

409
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,791
[C.C. grunts]

410
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,833
[SUZAKU] Oh no, is he
inside this thing?!

411
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,208
[LELOUCH]
No! Cats and tomatoes don't mix!

412
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,250
[gasps]

413
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,875
[KALLEN gasps]

414
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,333
[GINO] You're supposed
to start with this, right?

415
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,166
[SUZAKU]
It can't be... Gino?!

416
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,250
Yeah! This commoner
school is really a blast!

417
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,208
Hey! Wait!

418
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,166
[SHIRLEY grunts]
Hey!

419
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:19,958
[ARTHUR]
Hm?

420
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,000
[ARTHUR yelps]

421
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,375
[KALLEN, SHIRLEY grunting]

422
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,750
Was that Arthur?

423
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,833
[MILLY sighs] Now we'll
have to change the schedule.

424
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,250
[RIVALZ] It looks
like it's coming out

425
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,208
onto the parade route now!
They'll be marched around

426
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,875
the school building first,
then make their way down here!

427
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,583
Even though it's a
vintage Knightmare,

428
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,291
it's handling well.

429
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,625
Okay, the route's all set, so...

430
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,125
Shake time!

431
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,083
[C.C. grunting]

432
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,166
[LELOUCH]
What a mess!

433
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,750
He's taking her
straight to the stage!

434
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,708
Let me at least
see who you are!

435
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,625
[SUZAKU grunts]

436
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,958
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

437
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,333
[LELOUCH gasps]

438
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:58,666
[LELOUCH panting] I'm not
cut out for this sort of thing.

439
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,291
[MILLY]
Release the hounds!

440
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,333
[LELOUCH growls]

441
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,875
[FESTIVAL CROWD chatters]

442
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,208
[RIVALZ]
Over there!

443
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,375
The Knight of Seven,
Suzaku Kururugi!

444
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,958
He's arrived, along with our
Andes-grown Ultimate Tomatoes!

445
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,416
Suzaku, come on over!

446
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,250
You're the one we've
been waiting for!

447
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,000
[RIVALZ]
Uh. Except that...

448
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,041
There's a different
person piloting!

449
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:19,750
[FESTIVAL CROWD gasps]

450
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,000
Ah! Whoa!

451
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,291
[C.C. grunts]

452
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,750
Team Leader 1! Turn around,
and look up at me!

453
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,541
Yes, what is it, Vice President?

454
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,000
Employ system pattern rouge!

455
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,166
Now going to system
pattern rouge.

456
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,000
Release fire-extinguishing gas.

457
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,416
Initiating.

458
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,958
[ALL gasping, coughing]

459
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,916
[SHIRLEY yelps]

460
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,666
[GINO laughing]
What's the matter?

461
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,791
Is it really that
much of a surprise?

462
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,166
What the hell's
going on here?! Ugh!

463
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,125
Sorry. Are you okay?

464
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,500
Uh, oh no,
it was my fault.

465
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,541
Ah!

466
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,958
[KALLEN]
That was...

467
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:02,583
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

468
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,541
[camera beeping]

469
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,916
Recorded. Thank you, Miss.

470
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,833
No problem. You're welcome.

471
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,666
[SUZAKU]
Oh, Arthur.

472
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,958
[MILLY]
Well, sometimes you just get

473
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,166
these little filler
incidents in life.

474
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,958
And that's fine!

475
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,208
[LELOUCH]
So then?

476
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,208
The person who saw you
was from the Swim Club?

477
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,000
[KALLEN] I think it may
have been the teacher.

478
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:21,916
[LELOUCH]
Villetta?!

479
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,500
[KALLEN]
I didn't get her name.

480
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,291
But the weird thing is that
I think I remember seeing her

481
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,375
at the festival
last year with Ohgi.

482
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,000
Ohgi and Villetta?

483
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,208
[KALLEN] Minami said that Ohgi
might have had a collaborator

484
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,250
who reported directly to him.

485
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,250
Ohgi kept a secret from me?

486
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,875
[C.C.] When it comes
to these sorts of things,

487
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,583
you're really very thick.

488
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,791
The truth is...

489
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,958
That's it, Rolo?
You've turned traitor?

490
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,250
[LELOUCH]
Villetta Nu.

491
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,166
The woman who was
awarded the rank of baron

492
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,833
for ascertaining
Zero's real identity.

493
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,958
But unknown to most,

494
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,458
you're connected to
the Black Knights.

495
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,125
Not true! I never betrayed--

496
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,166
Kaname Ohgi.

497
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,291
[gasps]

498
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,458
[LELOUCH]
If word of your relationship

499
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,833
with him ever got out,

500
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,250
you'd have to
relinquish that title

501
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,375
you worked so
hard to earn.

502
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,583
Why not be reborn
as someone new?

503
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,625
Oh, yes.

504
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,208
Shirley gave me
this to give to you,

505
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,500
so the timing works out nicely.

506
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,750
Happy birthday, Coach Villetta.

507
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,875
[LELOUCH]
It seems I owe you another debt.

508
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,500
[XING-KE] I simply used
my diplomatic immunity.

509
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,125
Besides, I'd like to repay my
debt to you as quick as I can.

510
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,833
[LELOUCH] Then, may I
ask another favor of you?

511
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,125
I don't like to be in
collusion with you.

512
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,708
[LELOUCH] I'd like to get in
contact with the High Eunuchs.

513
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,750
[XING-KE gasps]

514
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,416
[LELOUCH] The only one
left to defeat is Suzaku.

515
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,208
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch?

516
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,625
[LELOUCH]
Mm?

517
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,083
Shouldn't the guest of
honor be at the main stage?

518
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,583
[SUZAKU]
Hm? No.

519
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,375
Everyone seems to be having
a fine time without me.

520
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,208
Besides, I want to discuss
something with you.

521
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,333
[LELOUCH]
What is it?

522
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,666
Well you see...

523
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,916
I'm aspiring to become
the Knight of One.

524
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,250
[LELOUCH]
Whoa!

525
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,458
That's the greatest knight
in the entire empire--

526
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,875
The Knight of One is
bestowed the privilege

527
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,916
of choosing one of the
Britannian Areas for his own.

528
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,041
I intend to have Japan.
I'll take this area for myself.

529
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,833
[SUZAKU] Lelouch, I've lost
too much; Precious friends

530
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,458
and a woman who no
one can ever replace.

531
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,083
By acquiring power,

532
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,125
I will never again lose
anyone else I care about.

533
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,708
And then, the Japanese people
won't need Zero any more.

534
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,916
[LELOUCH]
Hm? Indirect rule, huh?

535
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
You wanna make
it a protectorate?

536
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,000
You can ask this person.

537
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,125
--They'll know.
--[phone beeps]

538
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,500
Huh?

539
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,291
[SUZAKU] The new viceroy
who's coming to take charge

540
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,291
of Area 11 next week.

541
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,625
You think a student should
speak to the viceroy?

542
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,333
[SUZAKU]
It's Kururugi.

543
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,958
Yes. He's standing right
here in front of me.

544
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,875
Yes.

545
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,875
What do I say?
How awkward.

546
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,750
This is such an
important person.

547
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,375
[NUNNALLY]
Hello? Big Brother?

548
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,916
[LELOUCH gasps]

549
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,666
Lelouch, is that you?!

550
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,791
It's me! Nunnally!
Can you hear me?

551
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,583
I'm coming there
to be the viceroy!

552
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,625
Um, is there
something wrong?

553
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,416
Lelouch, it's Nunnally.
Your sister.

554
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,291
[LELOUCH]
At this very moment,

555
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,500
Nunnally is on the
other end of the phone.

556
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:01,291
Does she know that
I'm Zero? No, I doubt it.

557
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,750
Then this must be a trick Suzaku
is perpetrating against me.

558
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,666
Because if I respond
to my little sister,

559
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,000
he'll know that my
memories have returned.

560
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,333
He's using Nunnally to trap me!

561
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,625
Nunnally! Suzaku!

562
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,583
No matter how he wears
the face of a friend,

563
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,666
his true face is that of
the fiend who sold me

564
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,791
to the emperor!

565
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:19,875
There mere thought

566
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,708
that he's been at
my sister's side!
