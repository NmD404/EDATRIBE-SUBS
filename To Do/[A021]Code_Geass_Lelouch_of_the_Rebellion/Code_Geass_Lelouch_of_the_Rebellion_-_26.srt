00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,208
Your flight objective here is
commercial advertising, correct?

[C.C.]
No change in that.

00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,833
As filed, the duration of
our flight will be 14 hours.

00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,458
[ATC] That is confirmed.
You are cleared for fly-over.

Acknowledged. I appreciate it.

[URABE]
We're the only ones left now.

10
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,625
This is all that remains
of the Black Knights who,

11
00:00:58,708 --> 00:00:59,875
along with Zero,

12
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,166
once struck terror in
the heart of Britannia.

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,083
Still, it's too soon
to give in to despair!

14
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,458

Uh? Oh, not again.
You are persistent.

20
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,166
You're not going to
get away this time!

21
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,625
[STUDENT A] Hey, Lelouch,
about what you said--

22
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:35,958
Sorry! Catch ya later!

23
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,583
Lelouch, you come back here!

24
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,625
Vice Prez!

25
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:39,708
[STUDENT B]
Hope you get lucky.

26
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,125
Yeah, whatever!

[LELOUCH panting]

28
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,208
You lost the moment
you turned this into

29
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,291
a contest of strength and speed.

30
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,625
Aren't you overreacting?

31
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,708
I mean, this is just about
making up a P.E. class.

32
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,708
No! Quit cutting class, Lelouch!

33
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,125
I have more than
enough school credits

34

00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,083
[LELOUCH] Don't worry,

What kind of student
president are you?!

Oh, I'm so sorry.

What're you up to now, Lulu?

47
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,000
[LELOUCH]
For crying out loud!

48
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,500
Can't they give me a break and
leave me alone after school?

49
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,458
But... they only do that because

50
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,208
you're always skipping
class, big brother.

51
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,708
Because I find them
insufferably boring.

52
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,833
Here, have some.
It's from Milly.

53

[LELOUCH]
Whoa!

[ROLO]
I can't eat and steer!

56
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,458
You're right. I'm sorry.

57
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,208
[LELOUCH] It's been a year
since Britannian forces

58
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:40,083
crushed the Black Rebellion--
the revolt instigated by Zero.

59
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,125
Things have finally
quieted down,

60
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,250
even here in Area 11.

61
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,875
When the insurrection began,

62
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,208
all sorts of rumors were flying.

63
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,500
At one point, I considered
returning to the homeland

64
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,000
with my brother.

65
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,708
[ROLO] Did you hand in your
career guidance report yet?

66
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,958
Huh?

67
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,708
That's the reason
Ms. Villetta was so upset.

68
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,458
Oh...

69
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,083
So, what about college?

70
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,916
Well, I haven't decided yet.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,166
I am sick and tired
of being a student.

72
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,708
But I'm not ready to get a job
and join the system, either.

73
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,416
A typical answer.

74
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,583
[LELOUCH] Besides, what could
I ever hope to attain

75
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,166
by entering the workforce?

76
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,875
Big corporations
and the nobility

77
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,541
would still be above me.

78
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,541
A structured, mature world.

79
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,041
I would simply be absorbed
into the hierarchy of adults.

80
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,625
We all need to understand that
this is not discrimination!

81
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,125
But rather,
it's differentiation!

82
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,916
The Elevens revealed
themselves to be a dangerous,

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,208
belligerent race!

84
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,041
They followed the
scoundrel, Zero,

85
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,083
and took up the name "Japanese"!

86
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,916
It's our duty as
Britannians to control

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,458
and educate them!

88
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,458
[LELOUCH] The Elevens lost.
They didn't have the strength.

89
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,500
If they'd only kept
quiet and behaved,

90
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,000
this place wouldn't
have been downgraded

91
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,041
to a re-education zone.

92
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,750

going to carry it out?

I seriously doubt that
the scattered remnants

anything to us at this point.

The guy's Mafia, Lelouch!

177
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,666

Hm?

00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,500
[LELOUCH]
Feeding upon the weak, are you?

180
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,875
This is the grownup world in
here, schoolboy, so get lost.

181
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,125
Then will the adult world
devour the student,

182
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,916
or is it the other way around?

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,791
Why don't we find out
the answer with this?

184
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,666

much of anything, do they?

That's not true, Mr. Black King.

[KING]
Hm?!

191
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,958
You're a famous chess player

192
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,083
in the gambling
arena, aren't you?

193
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,125

So, you know who I am, huh?

you wouldn't be acting so tough!

Do me a favor.

00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,500
Don't say that

00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,333
Hey, Zero didn't betray us!

Shut up, you stinkin' Eleven!

200
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,291
There has to be a
reason for what he did.

201
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,583
What reason? Why'd
the commander vanish

202
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,666

Zero's dead, after all.

And that's checkmate.

209
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,208
Impossible!

Looks like you're the one
who's been devoured here.

214

Damn. That's inconvenient.

00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,375
How will I ever be able
to show my face in public

216
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,916
if word of this gets around?

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,583
I would never spread rumors.

218
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,583
No, schoolboy, not that.

219
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,208
What I'm saying is
that others will hear

220
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,916
how you cunningly cheated me.

221
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,958

how could you?

There's no way to do it!

226
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,000
Get him and hold him.

227
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,416
Now to whip up a little
evidence against the kid.

You filthy, lying adult!

229
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,958

We welcome you

00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,500
I'm on your side, an ally.

352
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,791
And your sworn
enemy is Britannia.

353
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,958
Huh?

354
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,708
We have a contract.

355
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,125
You and I are both accomplices.

356
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,458
[LELOUCH]
Contract? Accomplices?

357
00:16:55,541 --> 00:17:00,375
[C.C.] I'm the only one who
knows you. The real you.

358
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,708
What does she mean, the real me?

359
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,250
--[gunshot]
--[LELOUCH gasps]

360
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,875
Le-Lelouch...

361
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,583
Hey, are you all right?!

362
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,041
[gasps]

363
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,208
Why are soldiers--

364
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,250
[LELOUCH gasps]

365
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,041
No, hold on! What are you--

366
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,250
[WOMAN screams]

367
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,000
Stop it, that
woman's still alive!

368
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,500
[gunshots]

369
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,291
[COMMANDER] You've served
your function well.

370
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,791
Good Lelouch Lamperouge.

371
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,250
[LELOUCH] Function?!
What're you talking about?!

372
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,458
We've had our eye on you

373
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,666
for a very long
time now, young man.

374
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,916
Wakes up at 6:59 AM.

375
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,958
From 7:12 AM, watches the
news with his little brother

376
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,166
while eating breakfast.

377
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,916
No ideological deviations

378
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,791
with the program he watches.
8:45 AM, goes to class.

379
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,708
Doesn't attend his
morning homeroom

380
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,208
or first period class.
Instead, he reads on the roof.

381
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,333
During his second period...

382
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,416
Those are things...
I've done today...

383
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,083
I prefer to think of it
as a pet diary, or...

384
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:18,791
...bait journal.

385
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,000
Bait journal?

386
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,666
[COMMANDER]
Or call it a trap, if you wish.

387
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,083
For that witch. All to
lure C.C. out of hiding!

388
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,416
No, wait, please!
What's going on?!

389
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,833
Boy, I'll have you know
that I am a Baron.

390
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,375
I'm through wasting
words on bait like you!

391
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,166
Now, time to dispose of you.

392
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,791
And there won't be
any witnesses left.

393
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,916
Dispose...?

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,708
Is this... the end for me?

395
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:47,166
Without even knowing why?
So matter-of-factly?

396
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:56,541
[LELOUCH] To hell with that!
Power! If I only had power!

397
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:01,166
Power to escape this place!
Power not to lose the world...!

398
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,833
[gasps]

399
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,666
[LELOUCH gasps]

400
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,416
[LELOUCH]
What... What is this?

401
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,958
[C.C.]
You desire power?

402
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,250
[LELOUCH] That voice...
The girl who was shot?

403
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,250
[C.C.] You already possess
the power you seek.

404
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,833
It's merely imprisoned
within a cage of amnesia.

405
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,000
Remember...

406
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,875
Remember who you really are!

407
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,166
The power of the king!

408
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,791
[C.C.]
Now... let the seal...

409
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,208
...be broken!

410
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,541
[LELOUCH]
I see now.

411
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,458
Persistent irritation
that pricked me

412
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,583
like thorns in my everyday life.

413
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,708
Yes... Heh!

414
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,833
It was all the phony
memories implanted in me!

415
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:58,291
[LELOUCH]
But I remember now... I am...!

416
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,833
I am...!

417
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,625
I am... Zero!

418
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,250
[SUZAKU] Lelouch. I'm not
asking for forgiveness.

419
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,458
After all, we're
friends, aren't we?

420
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:19,791
[LELOUCH] Yes... That's your
answer, isn't it, Suzaku?!

421
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,291
[LELOUCH]
Before you dispose of me,

422
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,458
I'd like you to
answer a question.

423
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,666
[PURPLE SOLDIER 1]
That girl's still alive!

424
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,541
[PURPLE SOLDIER 2]
Impossible!

425
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,250
She was shot through the heart!

426
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,958
If being powerless
is so terribly wrong,

427
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,500
then does having
power make you right?

428
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,875
Do you find vengeance evil?

429
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,791
What's your value of
friendship? Is it justice?

430
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,791
Heh, there is no
justice or evil.

431
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,708
The only truth that's
left for you, bait,

432
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,416
is the simple reality of death.

433
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,916
[LELOUCH]
I see.

434
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,125
Then that reality is all that
remains for you, as well.

435
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,625
I, Lelouch vi Britannia,
command you!

436
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,541
All of you... die!

437
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,250
[COMMANDER]
It-It can't be!

438
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,666
[PURPLE SOLDIERS]
Yes, Your Highness!

439
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,416
[laughs]

440
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,791
[gunshots]

441
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,291
[bodies thudding]

442
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,041
[LELOUCH]
Ever since that day, my heart

443
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,750
simply couldn't accept it.

444
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,541
This fake life I was
never able to fit into.

445
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,750
All the time that was lost.

446
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,041
These false memories
planted in me,

447
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,458
giving me a life
as one of the herd.

448
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,708
And yet...

449
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,416
The truth continues to
guide me toward itself.

450
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,625
That's right!

451
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:40,166
It wasn't me who was
wrong! It was the world!

452
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:47,166
The world has to change.
So I will change it.

453
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,583
[URABE] We've been waiting
for you, Master Zero!

454
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,125
Please, give us your orders!

455
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,291
[LELOUCH]
Very well...

456
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,083
Because, after all, I am Zero!

457
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,916
The one who will
crush the world...!

458
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,041
...and the one who will
re-create the world anew!

459
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,166
[SUZAKU]
Yes... Your Majesty.

460
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,625
I have no intention of assigning
this task to anyone else.

461
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,666
The one who will kill Zero...

462
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,666
...shall be me.

463
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:58,166
[LELOUCH] I can't forgive them!
I mustn't forgive them!

464
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,208
My memories are my own
personal and individual reality!

465
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,916
They are the truth,
and that truth defines me!

466
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,583
Someone trampled them.

467
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,958
I was tamed like a domestic
animal then looked down upon

468
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:11,958
as mere bait. The time
for payback has come!

469
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,583
Now, I'll give Britannia
something to remember.

470
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,750
The true meaning of Zero's
return to this world!

471
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:21,000
Because I no longer have need
for their deceptive rule!
