1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,875
[C.C.]
The young Britannian Lelouch

2
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:22,208
vowed to avenge his mother
who was killed 8 years ago,

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,083
and he pledged to create a
world where his younger sister,

4
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,583
Nunnally, could find happiness.

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:31,125
For that purpose, he gained
power from a mysterious girl

6
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,375
named C.C., the power of
Geass, the absolute ability

7
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:39,625
to compel any person to
do whatever he commands.

8
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,375
Lelouch used this power to
embark on a path of destruction

9
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,708
aimed at the heart of

10
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,333
the Holy Britannian Empire
ruled by his father...

11
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,916
But at the end of that path,
what will he have gained?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,458
And what will he have lost?

13
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,166
Geass is called the
power of the king,

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,500
yet of this power,
only one thing is clear:

15
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,791
those who use it walk
a path of solitude.

16
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,541
[EMPEROR]
It's been a long time, Lelouch.

17
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,625
My prodigal son.

18
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,958
[LELOUCH gasps]

19
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,125
[LELOUCH] Answer my
question about 8 years ago!

20
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,291
Why didn't you try
to protect mother?!

21
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,375
You knew the others
were plotting against her!

22
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,708
You knew everything!

23
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,958
[EMPEROR]
People are not equal.

24
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,166
[LELOUCH]
What?!

25
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,083
[EMPEROR] You have a
unique form of Geass,

26
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,416
a power that no one
else possesses.

27
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,791
Use it to get the
answer from me!

28
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:09,958
[LELOUCH]
He's baiting me,

29
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,500
trying to get me to
use my Geass on him.

30
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:17,333
But, if I look into his eyes,
then he'll look into mine!

31
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,125
His Geass requires eye contact,
just like mine does...

32
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,875
So the moment I look,
his Geass will take control

33
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:28,875
of me and he'll alter my
memories! What do I do?!

34
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,208
[EMPEROR]
What's wrong?

35
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:34,625
Are you not my son,
a prince of Britannia?

36
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,500
[LELOUCH] I have no time
to make the wrong choice!

37
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,958
These orders are from Zero!

38
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,583
Search through all
facilities! Obey Zero!

39
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,875
Bring all corpses to
the designated area.

40
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,666
We must determine if any of
the experimental soldiers

41
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,958
are among them.

42
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,666
But this is... a massacre!

43
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,500
[JEREMIAH]
Bartley, I hated you

44
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,875
for reconstructing
me with this body.

45
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,625
But your loyalty to the
imperial family was genuine.

46
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,166
So be it.

47
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,166
I make my final decision!
I will respect you!

48
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,458
Lelouch vi Britannia
commands you!

49
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,291
And now, die!

50
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,333
[EMPEROR growls]

51
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,916
[EMPEROR]
Very well, then.

52
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,125
I won.

53
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,083
[LELOUCH]
I won.

54
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,916
[LELOUCH]
Nunnally... Mother...

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,666
I, uh... I did it.

56
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,833
[yells]

57
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,791
I don't knowbout Lelouch!
How many times must I say it?!

58
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,541
Would you swear to it
solemnly, on Shirley's grave?

59
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,333
[KALLEN]
Uh.

60
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,916
[KALLEN groans]

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,875
[SUZAKU] Now, you're going
to tell me everything.

62
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,291
With the help of this Refrain!

63
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,750
[KALLEN]
Don't. Please, don't! Stop it!

64
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,000
[SUZAKU]
You don't have to be afraid.

65
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,208
You'll lose your
will-power soon,

66
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,416
and then you'll answer
all my questions.

67
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,333
[KALLEN whimpers]

68
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,041
Brother, help me...

69
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,708
Now, you will obey my commands.

70
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,750
[SUZAKU grunting]
I will not... be like him...

71
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,750
[C.C.] How many years
has it been since we were

72
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,083
together face to face, V.V.?

73
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:02,833
In the end, I couldn't run
away from my destiny, could I?

74
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:08,458
Now I bear the burden
of... that destiny...

75
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,291
Huh?

76
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,166
[V.V.]
Of immortality...

77
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,333
[C.C.]
What? V.V., are you...?

78
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,708
[V.V.]
So, please, Charles...

79
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,125
Well, do you swear it?

80
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,291
[EMPEROR] Yes. In this
world full of lies...

81
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:28,000
We will never
lie to each other.

82
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:34,291
That's because I... I am
your... your big brother...

83
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:39,291
[LELOUCH]
I killed him. It was so easy.

84
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,541
I had questions for him.

85
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,166
Deaths he should have
answered for, but now...

86
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,333
[EMPEROR]
Oh? Whose?

87
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,000
You're impudent, Lelouch!

88
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,416
You're alive?!
That's impossible!

89
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,708
That bullet went
through your heart!

90
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,416
[EMPEROR]
Plots and schemes, deceptions.

91
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,541
You really thought
you could defeat me

92
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,916
with those cheap tricks?

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,041
You want the
power of a king?

94
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,916
Then have the courage
to come at me like a king!

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,916
[LELOUCH grunts]

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,208
Die!

97
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,958
[EMPEROR] You think that's
how a king does it?

98
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,583
[gasps] My Geass isn't working!

99
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,625
You still do not understand?

100
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,750
I am beyond the power
of guns or swords now!

101
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:30,333
No matter how you
attack me, it's useless!

102
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,416
[LELOUCH gasps]

103
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:38,208
[C.C.] Charles, why
steal V.V.'s Code now?

104
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:43,916
Why would you kill the older
brother you loved so much?

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,916
V.V. You loved
Marianne, didn't you?

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,375
[LELOUCH grunts]

107
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,041
[LELOUCH]
He's become immortal, too?!

108
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,416
I can't win.
There's no way I can win!

109
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,208
[EMPEROR] I've gained a new
power in place of Geass.

110
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,458
A power that goes far beyond.

111
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,958
And so, Lelouch, behold
and I shall show you

112
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,125
the true nature of this world!

113
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,291
What is this?!

114
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,208
Chigusa.

115
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,625
[VILLETTA] That was the name you
called me when I lost my memory.

116
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,375
What's my real name?

117
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,375
Villetta.

118
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,166
But that doesn't
change anything.

119
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,375
[VILLETTA]
I'm a Britannian baroness.

120
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,958
No matter what the reason,

121
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,791
if I don't erase the disgrace
of my having loved an Eleven,

122
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,833
I won't be able to
live in this world.

123
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,000
[OHGI]
Hmph. I suppose not.

124
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,541
If I must die, I just wish
it could've been in Japan.

125
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,958
[VILLETTA] You came here
knowing I was going to kill you?

126
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,250
Everybody dies. I wanted
to choose the time.

127
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,125
[VILLETTA] You can also
killed me if you want.

128
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,625
Tell me!

129
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,083
Why did a terrorist save a
Britannian in the first place?!

130
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,500
[OHGI]
In the beginning,

131
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,333
I thought I could get
information from you about Zero.

132
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,500
I tricked you, kept you
under surveillance.

133
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,583
But, while we lived together--

134
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,666
I'm your sworn enemy!

135
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,375
[OHGI]
But I still love you!

136
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,541
Are you insane?!

137
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:31,666
I must be. You are the enemy.

138
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,083
But I can't stop myself
from loving you!

139
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,666
[VILLETTA whimpers]

140
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,500
I wish I'd never
set eyes on you!

141
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,208
--[rustling]
--Uh?!

142
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,666
Uh? From intelligence?

143
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,625
[LELOUCH] What is Geass?!
I want the truth?!

144
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,166
[EMPEROR] How strange.
A child who's wrapped himself

145
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,500
in lies desires the
truth from others.

146
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,750
What?

147
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,875
[EMPEROR] The false name
and false mask of Zero,

148
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,291
what has it gotten you?

149
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,583
Everything! It got
me all the things

150
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,708
that ordinary people
can never obtain!

151
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,625
Followers! Territory!

152
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,250
[MASK 1]
You lost Euphemia.

153
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,750
[LELOUCH gasps]

154
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,833
[MASK 2] Suzaku and Nunnally
are also lost to your lies!

155
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,000
[LELOUCH] Shut up!
I did what I had to do!

156
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,958
People lie to survive!
No one is blameless!

157
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,166
[MASK 3] You want others
to know your true self,

158
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,750
yet you only show
them a false face.

159
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,583
[MASK 4] How can anyone know you
if you don't reveal yourself?

160
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,833
[MASK 5]
If you hide behind masks.

161
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,333
[MASK 6] You are afraid
that they'll find out

162
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,791
who you really are.

163
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,166
[LELOUCH]
No!

164
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,791
[EMPEROR] In the end,
your lies serve no purpose.

165
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:38,750
Because you are me and I
am you. All else is illusion.

166
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,666
Though there be worlds without
end, there is but one being.

167
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,750
In the past. In the future.
And now. Only one.

168
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,750
[LELOUCH]
One...? What are you saying?

169
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,250
[C.C.]
Charles.

170
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,083
[C.C.]
Play time is over now.

171
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,750
There's nothing
in it for me now;

172
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,583
no value in the games anymore.

173
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,166
C.C.?

174
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,708
[C.C.] You don't have to cajole
him like this to get me here.

175
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,916
I already exist
in this realm.

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,666
[EMPEROR]
True enough, C.C. In that case,

177
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,833
I shall grant your wish.

178
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,083
You know what C.C.'s wish is?!

179
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,875
[C.C.]
Lelouch. It's time you knew

180
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,666
the conditions of our contract.
And what I desire.

181
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:29,041
My wish is to die. To end my
existence in all worlds forever.

182
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,250
But why? Why would
you want to die?!

183
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,375
[C.C.]
In the final stage of Geass,

184
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,375
the user attains the position
of the one who granted them

185
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,750
the power. Thus, you have
gained the power to kill me.

186
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,000
[LELOUCH]
Kill you? C.C...

187
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,583
[C.C.] Of all those I
made contracts with,

188
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,958
none has ever
reached that point.

189
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,541
But now there's Charles.
He has done it.

190
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,000
You mean... you made
your contract with me

191
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,791
so that you could
cease to exist?!

192
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,000
[C.C.]
Correct.

193
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,250
But why would you want to die?

194
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,958
[C.C.]
It's providence, a boundary.

195
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,625
Only when it's finite
can we call it life.

196
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,500
That's wrong! We call it
life because we feel it!

197
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:12,750
[C.C.] Same thing. There is
no life unless there is death.

198
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,875
That's just wordplay;
it's not real!

199
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,000
People die. That's real.

200
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,416
[LELOUCH]
Then why are we born at all?!

201
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,333
What's the purpose of it?
The meaning?!

202
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,958
You know the answer.

203
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,958
Those things are all
just illusions.

204
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,750
[LELOUCH] No! Living
just to die is too sad!

205
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,875
Without death, all we have are
random events... accumulation.

206
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,375
You can't call that life.

207
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,875
[LELOUCH gasps]

208
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,750
If you have a reason for living,
then you have to kill me.

209
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,125
Do that, and you'll
be Charles's equal.

210
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,583
You'll finally be
able to beat him.

211
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,125
So fare thee well, Lelouch.

212
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,458
You're too kind to
end our contract.

213
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,916
Wait! You're-- [screams]

214
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,458
[C.C.] Charles, why did
you steal V.V.'s Code?

215
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,250
Is there any point in
asking such questions?

216
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,208
After all, you're about to die.

217
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,166
I suppose you're right.

218
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,625
[LOHMEYER]
So very well then,

219
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,125
I'll proceed with
the redevelopment

220
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,708
of the Saitama ghetto
according to this schedule.

221
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,958
Wait a minute, please.

222
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:23,666
[LOHMEYER]
Huh?

223
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,625
[NUNNALLY]
Here.

224
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,291
[LOHMEYER]
Is something wrong?

225
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,958
[NUNNALLY]
This plan you worked out,

226
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,833
it isn't going to penalize
the Elevens, is it?

227
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,166
Of course not.

228
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,000
It's the best possible plan
for them and for us.

229
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,041
[NUNNALLY]
That is a lie, isn't it?

230
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,250
[gasps]

231
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,833
[NUNNALLY] Please rework
the plan once more.

232
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:46,333
I don't wish the Elevens
to be disadvantaged by it.

233
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:50,375
Princess, I am an expert.
Please let me handle the--

234
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:55,875
Miss Lohmeyer! I-I believe
that I... I'm the viceroy!

235
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,750
[SUZAKU]
After all this,

236
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,333
my only choice is to confront
Lelouch about it directly!

237
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,583
[RIVALZ]
Huh?

238
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,000
Suzaku did you finish
your work at the bureau?

239
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,625
[SUZAKU]
Have you seen Lelouch?

240
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,291
Uh-uh. I guess what happened
to Shirley really shook him up.

241
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,041
He hasn't been
home or at school.

242
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:13,791
[SUZAKU]
Hey!

243
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,416
[meow]

244
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,208
[gasps]

245
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,375
[SUZAKU]
Where's Lelouch Lamperouge now?!

246
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,250
There is no unusual activity.

247
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,166
I asked where he is!
Where's Commander Villetta?!

248
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,541
Where's his "brother" Rolo?!

249
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,708
As I said, there's no
unusual activity to report.

250
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,875
[OSI AGENT B]
It's the same as always.

251
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,125
So that's it. The entire
O.S.I. staff has been...

252
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,791
Please forgive me. I had
to speak with Nunnally.

253
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,458
It's all right. We're
still getting ready.

254
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,500
[KANON]
What happened?

255
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,041
[SCHNEIZEL]
Oh, you know the topic.

256
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,458
Lloyd's Camelot
group and Suzaku.

257
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,458
[KANON]
I meant with the Toromo Agency.

258
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,750
Oh, that.

259
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,791
It depends on the
results of this test.

260
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,708
[NUNNALLY] Yes. My brother
Schneizel contacted me.

261
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,375
We can raise Area 11's
status to satellite region.

262
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,500
He said it's in
recognition of improved

263
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,541
public order
and productivity.

264
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,083
[SUZAKU]
That's good news.

265
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,833
[SUZAKU] Lelouch must
have been Zero all this time.

266
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,583
But if I report that
to the Emperor,

267
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,375
what happens to Nunnally?

268
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,208
[EMPEROR] If Lelouch
regains his memories,

269
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:22,000
then I shall simply use
Nunnally to deal with him.

270
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,083
Suzaku, you're not
hiding anything, right?

271
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,333
[SUZAKU]
Of course not.

272
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,625
You're the one person
that I'd never lie to.

273
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,208
[NUNNALLY]
Then will you tell me who it was

274
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,708
I spoke to on the
phone that time?

275
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,791
[SUZAKU gasps]

276
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,708
[NUNNALLY]
Wasn't it my big brother?

277
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,166
[SUZAKU gasping]

278
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,500
[NUNNALLY]
Suzaku...

279
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,333
You're just like him, aren't
you? Like my brother...

280
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,041
He's gone? Zero's gone?

281
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,250
[KINOSHITA] Yes. We received
a signal that he'd sighted

282
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,625
the target, but he and the
Shinkiro are missing.

283
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,250
[ROLO]
Missing? My brother is...?!

284
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,583
[LELOUCH]
Where am I?

285
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,708
Uh! Hey!

286
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,416
[LELOUCH gasping]

287
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,458
[C.C.]
It's no use.

288
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,875
These are all my memories.
You can't interfere.

289
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,125
[LELOUCH] C.C... No.
You're not, are you?

290
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,625
Who are you? Tell me.

291
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,958
I'm Lelouch. I am your...

292
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,458
[FEM NUN] Do you have some
reason to live, child?

293
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:36,291
[C.C.] I don't know.
I just don't want to die!

294
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,208
Then let's make a contract.

295
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,458
I will give you a special
power so you can survive.

296
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,583
And in return, one day you
will grant me a special wish.

297
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,041
Do you swear that you'll do it?

298
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,291
[LELOUCH]
So is this...?

299
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:52,208
[C.C.] It is. I swore to
uphold that contract.

300
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:00,583
Stop it! Stop it,
both of you! Please!

301
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,208
[SAYOKO]
I'm sorry about this.

302
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,833
We were getting along
quite well together.

303
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,666
[OHGI]
Stop! [groans]

304
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,708
[SAYOKO gasps]

305
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,125
[VILLETTA]
Ohgi!

306
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,250
[C.C.] The Geass I manifested
was to make people love me.

307
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,708
Love you?

308
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:28,625
[C.C.]
Because, deep in my heart, I...

309
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,333
I wanted to be
loved by someone.

310
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,958
[C.C.]
And my wish was granted.

311
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,666
Because of my Geass,
I was loved by everyone.

312
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,500
But in the end it was too much.
Love without limit was love

313
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,958
without meaning. I forgot
what love really was.

314
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,416
The only person I
believed in was her.

315
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,708
Because my Geass
couldn't work on her,

316
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,250
she was the one person who would
scold me for being trivial.

317
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,458
And yet...

318
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,000
[C.C.]
Yes yes...

319
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,916
I gave back all the gifts I
received, like you told me to.

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,583
But it can't be helped, can it?
It's because of the Geass.

321
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:04,958
I'm grateful to you Sister,
but this is a pain for me, too.

322
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,208
I'm so tired of all the
proposals and flowers.

323
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,125
Now some of them are starting
a religion around me!

324
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,666
[NUN]
Then shall we end it?

325
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,208
Huh?

326
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,416
[NUN] I need someone to take
my place. Someone with a Geass

327
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,083
that's exceptionally strong, so
eternity can finally end for me.

328
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,208
Can you imagine the agony?

329
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,125
The hell of living on
and on for eternity?

330
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,375
[C.C.]
Uh, what are you talking about?

331
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm sorry, dear!
I'm afraid I tricked you!

332
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,833
[gasps]

333
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,916
[C.C.] She had just pretended
to be friends with me

334
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,625
right from the start.
I was a tool,

335
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,916
a way for her to end
her life. That's all.

336
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,666
[C.C.]
You're still not in here.

337
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,000
That means you're
not from my past.

338
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,291
You're a real person,
aren't you?

339
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,375
[LELOUCH]
Am I? I couldn't really say.

340
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,791
[C.C.] I wonder if you're
very important to me.

341
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,083
[LELOUCH]
That's impossible.

342
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,666
[C.C.] Oh? The fact you
were sent here means

343
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,208
I once tried to save you
from something. Or someone.

344
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,250
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

345
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,708
[C.C.] The people who hated me,
the ones who were kind to me.

346
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,583
All of them eventually vanished
into the flow of time,

347
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,416
the endless flow of eternity...

348
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,416
[EMPEROR]
But now, your tormented days...

349
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,166
[C.C.] Yes. They're over now.
My long journey ends here.

350
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,250
[LELOUCH]
C.C.!

351
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,791
[gasps]

352
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,416
[EMPEROR] You've opened it,
Lelouch! The Thought Elevator!

353
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,541
I see it now! This
realm of existence

354
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,250
is itself is a system for
interfering with thought!

355
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,500
[grunts]

356
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,833
[EMPEROR]
Soon it will be over.

357
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,916
Lelouch, sit where
you are and watch!

358
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
[LELOUCH gasps]

359
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,666
[C.C. gasping]

360
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,541
Stop it! C.C. is my...
She's my...!

361
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,458
Tell me, C.C...

362
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,333
Why didn't you make
me take your place?!

363
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,125
You could've had
your death that way!

364
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,750
Forcing me into your
hell of eternal life!

365
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,583
C.C., it wasn't out
of pity?! Was it?

366
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,875
[C.C. whimpers]

367
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,791
Don't die looking like that!

368
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,750
You should come
to death smiling!

369
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,750
I promise you the smile
you never had! Please...!

370
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,083
[C.C. grunts]

371
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,625
[EMPEROR] What do you think
you're doing, C.C.?!

372
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,166
You have stolen enough
from me already, Father!

373
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,000
You won't have her, too!

374
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,250
No! No, you'll ruin it all!

375
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,291
I know what it was now! I
understand what your Geass was!

376
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,333
And I know your true wish!

377
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,166
Come closer.
Let me reach you!

378
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,750
[DALLAS A] F.L.E.I.J.A.
Activation confirmed.

379
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,375
[KANON sighs]
It worked.

380
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,416
I can't believe
the explosive force!

381
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,541
Chief. Congratulations!

382
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,708
[NINA] Oh, no. The whole staff
at Invogue deserves the credit.

383
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,083
You'll have to accept
the compliment, Nina.

384
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,500
You are a genius.

385
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,791
I'm very honored,
Prince Schneizel.

386
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:42,166
Now war itself will change,
and mankind with it.

387
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,666
Damocles is here at last!

388
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:52,166
[LELOUCH]
Hey! We're back, C.C.! Wake up!

389
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,333
[gasps]

390
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,166
I've already contacted Rolo.

391
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,666
We'll use him to
get out of here.

392
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,208
Who are you, sir?

393
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,458
[LELOUCH]
What are you saying?

394
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,708
We need to talk about
the Emperor and that--

395
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,750
Are you my new master?

396
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,250
[LELOUCH]
Uh.

397
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,250
[C.C.] I-I can clean and help
prepare food for cooking.

398
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,750
I can also fetch water
and tend cows and sew.

399
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,958
I can read a little
and count to twenty.

400
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:19,750
Oh. I can carry away corpses,
if you need that.

401
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,666
[LELOUCH] Kallen has been
captured, Shirley is dead.

402
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,625
And now I've lost C.C. as well.

403
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:02,541
Even so, this is no time to
wallow in sentimentality!

404
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,375
I have a plan to
rescue Nunnally.

405
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,375
The problem is timing.
When to strike.

406
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,291
Even if we move now, there are
too many uncertain elements

407
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:13,166
waiting for the aftermath.
If I want to be sure of this,

408
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,458
I'll need a United
Federation of Nations.

409
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,875
And for that, keeping the
Emperor in that other realm

410
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,708
will be an absolute requirement.

411
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,833
But...
