00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,916
[UNF ANNOUNCER]
99th emperor Lelouch,

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,333
who ascended the throne
only a few days ago,

3
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,083
has ordered the destruction
of the imperial mausoleum

4
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,833
which held the remains of
past Britannian emperors.

5
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,250
Following his abolition
of the aristocracy,

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,083
breaking up of
plutocratic cliques,

7
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,625
and liberation of the Numbers--

8
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,041
Odysseus and other
royals expressed support

9
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,291
for the new emperor
despite these actions.

10
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,125
However...

11
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,541
[TAMAKI]
He's just amazing!

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,250
[TOUDOU] Does he really
intend to completely

13
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,625
remake Britannia?

14
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,000
[RAKSHATA]
Don't you mean "destroy" it?

15
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,708
Are we to believe
Lelouch really did

16
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,750
hate Britannia, as he claimed?

17
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,583
He's eliminating any faction
which could oppose him.

18
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,083
Even in the U.F.N.,
most people are expressing

19
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,833
their support for
Emperor Lelouch.

20
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,500
[TAMAKI] I knew he was
really on our side;

21
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,875
I always said that!

22
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,375
[XIANG-LIN] Some media
people are calling him

23
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,166
the knight for justice
and hero of the masses.

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,750
Speaking of media,
where's Diethard at?

25
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,166
I doubt he's coming back here.

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,416
You're right. As long
as he's with Cornelia

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,041
and Schneizel,
he'll stay hidden.

28
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,875
So, what's our next move?
What do we do now?

29
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,375
What do you mean, from now?

30
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,541
Well, but I mean,
everything's different;

31
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,291
the new emperor is
doing good things.

32
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,333
He is?

33
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,375
[XING-KE]
No, he isn't.

34
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,375
[gasps]

35
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,750
[OHGI, VILLETTA]
Huh?

36
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,083
[TOHDOH]
It's the truth.

37
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,916
Emperor Lelouch has one--
no, Zero, has one goal.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,166
Lelouch vi Britannia
commands each one of you!

39
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,458
Be my slaves! Now!

40
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,666
[MASKED SOLDIERS]
Yes, Your Majesty!

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,083
[MASKED SOLDIERS]
All hail Lelouch!

42
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,875
[LLOYD] Your Majesty,
won't you let me analyze

43
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,708
that power, just a little bit?
For science, of course.

44
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,333
[JEREMIAH]
Do you want to die, Lloyd?

45
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,625
You mean, in the
traditional sense?

46
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,875
Ridiculous.

47
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,333
Jeremiah Gottwald
returns from battle,

48
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,875
to announce that
he has vanquished

49
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,083
former Earl Rosenkreuz.

50
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,250
[LELOUCH]
Well done.

51
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,458
[JEREMIAH]
Hum.

52
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,875
Still, I'm not very
popular out there, am I?

53
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,583
The nobles are rising up
and rebelling everywhere,

54
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,083
isn't that true?

55
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,416
People resist when you take
away their vested intrests.

56
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,291
They fight back.

57
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,583
That's why we need to make them

58
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,666
fully understand how
foolish and pathetic it is

59
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,458
to cling to vain pedigrees
and past glories.

60
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,375
[LLOYD]
Is this a good thing?

61
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,333
[CECILE]
Is what a good thing?

62
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,916
[LLOYD groans]
Well, you know...

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,250
The way Prince Schneizel
and Princess Cornelia

64
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,208
have disappeared
without a trace.

65
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,416
This is the legitimate Holy
Britannian Empire, isn't it?

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,000
[CECILE]
Yes, you have a point.

67
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,625
And if they know what
Suzaku and the others

68
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,083
are actually trying
to do here...

69
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,791
[LLOYD] I wonder if we've
become cogs in a machine,

70
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,625
without even realizing it.

71
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,333
[CECILE]
By the way, did you know?

72
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,750
[LLOYD]
What?

73
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,125
[CECILE] Suzaku used to attend
school with his Majesty;

74
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,583
they had classes together.

75
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,916
Oh... Milly and Nina's school?

76
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,750
[MILLY]
I won't be back until night.

77
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,500
[NINA]
Covering something?

78
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,166
[MILLY]
A conference.

79
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,875
To decide if we support
His Majesty or Lelouch?

80
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,375
[MILLY]
That's part of it.

81
00:04:56,458 --> 00:05:00,208
Area 11--sorry, I mean Japan--
It's about whether or not

82
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,500
we should go back
to the homeland

83
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,083
now that it's no longer
a part of Britannia.

84
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,500
And...?

85
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,333
[MILLY] Uh, well, even my family
isn't nobility any more.

86
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,375
Lelouch is the one who--

87
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,708
[MILLY]
Stop!

88
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,791
Uh?

89
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,333
Can we just drop
this whole subject now

90
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,083
and talk about something else?

91
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,958
Man, I'm hungry. Here, Nina.

92
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,083
[NINA]
Sorry, Rivalz.

93
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,541
[RIVALZ]
Forget it, forget it.

94
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,041
You shouldn't go out.
You're safe here in the school.

95
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,958
Thanks a lot.

96
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,250
When I built the F.L.E.I.J.A.,

97
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,333
I never in my
wildest dreams thought

98
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,500
all those countries would
target me. They're relentless.

99
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,083
[RIVALZ]
Mm...

100
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,583
[SUZAKU] So, soon after
ascending the throne,

101
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,916
the name Emperor Lelouch
has become part of history.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,250
All because you dismantled
Britannian culture.

103
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,375
[LELOUCH]
The real work is yet to come.

104
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,208
At this moment, I'm about
to spill a sea of blood.

105
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,000
Enough blood to
wipe away all memory

106
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,583
of princess massacre forever
from peoples' minds.

107
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,333
Lelouch, are you saying...?

108
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,833
Euphy wasn't the only one.
It was Nunnally, too.

109
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,666
We've both lost so much.
Far, far too much.

110
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,750
But, to move forward
into the future,

111
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,791
we need to take over
the entire world.

112
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,250
[chuckles] Just saying those
words makes me laugh.

113
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,916
[C.C.] Yet you're both
absolutely determined

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,500
to do it, Isn't that right?

115
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:20,250
[LELOUCH] Yes. It's for the
sake of the Zero Requiem.

116
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,541
Yes, Your Majesty.

117
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,416
[LLOYD] Well then,
what will you do about

118
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,625
the problem at hand,
Your Majesty?

119
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,208
[LELOUCH]
Hm... I took over Britannia

120
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,458
to address that, but...

121
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:34,458
[C.C.] Is it true? About what
Schneizel is planning?

122
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,041
[LELOUCH] Yes. According to
the intelligence reports.

123
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,125
And, given that the
Toromo Agency in Cambodia

124
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,916
has seceded from Britannia.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,250
When you add it all up...

126
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,375
It leads to one conclusion.
There's no choice...

127
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,208
We have to move the
plan to the next phase

128
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,625
before Schneizel has a chance

129
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,583
--to put his plan into action--
--[phone rings]

130
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,916
--Hm?
--[phone rings]

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,333
Yes, what is it?

132
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,000
[MAN ON PHONE] Majesty!
It's the Knights of the Round!

133
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,333
Huh?

134
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,333
[MAN ON PHONE]
They're approaching,

135
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,083
with the Knight of
One in the lead!

136
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,708
We can only confirm four
of the Rounds among them.

137
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,166
They're accompanied by
their personal forces!

138
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,250
[BISMARCK]
We swore absolute loyalty

139
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,833
to Charles zi Britannia!

140
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,166
We will never recognize
this damned usurper!

141
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,500
[alarm beeping]

142
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,583
[NONETTE] An interceptor?
But there's only one...

143
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,708
One is enough
with Lancelot Albion.

144
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,250
[gasps]

145
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,541
[NONETTE]
I can't track it!

146
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,708
He got me already?!

147
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,000
[BISMARCK]
Huh? The Albion?!

148
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,208
A ninth generation
Knightmare Frame!

149
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,750
It's Suzaku Kururu--

150
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,875
[GINO]
Will you wake up, Suzaku?!

151
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,041
You can still come back to us!

152
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,500
[SUZAKU] Come back?
You've got it all wrong.

153
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,458
If you've sworn true
loyalty to Britannia,

154
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,541
then it's you who should
join our side, Gino.

155
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,625
--[gasps]
--[SUZAKU] Or...

156
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,750
...will you stand
against Britannia?

157
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,833
Huh? Stand against it...?

158
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,125
[BISMARCK]
Suzaku Kururugi!

159
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,708
I heard that your
goal was to become

160
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,458
the Knight of One!

161
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,208
But I am the only Knight of One!

162
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:26,291
And I'll never lose that
title to a traitor like you!

163
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:30,416
My title is the Knight of Zero,
and that trumps you, Bismark.

164
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,250
An empty title with no honor!

165
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,750
We interrupt our programming

166
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,291
for this live broadcast from
the Holy Britannian Empire.

167
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,583
[KALLEN]
That's... the Lancelot!

168
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,458
[RAKSHATA]
With energy wings?

169
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,625
And it's challenging Bismarck.

170
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,083
How can he know
Lancelot's flight path?!

171
00:08:56,166 --> 00:09:00,625
My Geass gives me the
power to see the future!

172
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,500
And again?!

173
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,958
Only once before
I used this power

174
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,500
when I battled Lady Marianne!

175
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,333
He can predict my
moves. But still...

176
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,916
Suzaku.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,333
As we planned, this battle is
being broadcast to the world.

178
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,750
Right.

179
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,291
For the sake of the Zero
Requiem, I must be victorious!

180
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,541
And that's why I'm
ordering you, to live!

181
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,250
[SUZAKU]
Yes, Your Majesty!

182
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,250
[BISMARCK]
My name will always be linked

183
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,500
with the title of mightiest
knight of the empire!

184
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,958
Wh-What?!

185
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,125
What is this?

186
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,666
Is it the machine's
special functions...

187
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,833
...or is it Kururugi's skill?

188
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,291
[LELOUCH] Suzaku, your will
power is extraordinary.

189
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,208
Turning my Geass
command "to live"

190
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,166
into an unexpected weapon.

191
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,541
You've become a
warrior like no other.

192
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,708
Even though you can
predict my moves...

193
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,750
If I do this...!

194
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,541
Head on?! You insult me!

195
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,375
[gasps]

196
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,625
I failed you, Lady Marianne!

197
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,541
[gasps] The Knight
of One has fallen!

198
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:24,291
What have I become? Am I
a knight of Britannia?

199
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:29,750
And If I'm not then what am I
fighting these battles for?!

200
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,208
[LELOUCH]
To the people of the world!

201
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,458
[KALLEN]
Lelouch!

202
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,541
The video that you've
just seen is final proof

203
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,791
that I am the true
ruler of Britannia

204
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,708
in name and in deed.

205
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,125
Now that that is clear,

206
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,125
the Holy Britannian
Empire is ready

207
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,500
to join the United
Federation of Nations!

208
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,708
[ALL gasp]

209
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,875
Does that mean...

210
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,666
Britannia will be on our side?

211
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,916
There, ya see?

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,666
I told you he was one
of us. He's my buddy!

213
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,375
[LELOUCH]
For the negotiations, I will not

214
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,541
be with Suzaku Kururugi
nor any of my generals.

215
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,166
I shall follow all
rules of the U.F.N.

216
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,750
However, the site of
the negotiations shall be

217
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,458
the one nation which is neutral,

218
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,750
standing between Britannia
and the U.F.N. Japan.

219
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,083
The Ashford Academy
will be the site

220
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,125
of the conference.

221
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,500
[BOTH]
Wha--?

222
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,541
[RADIO GUY] This is one four
four. North wing, clear.

223
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,250
Is there something
going on, Schneizel?

224
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,583
A certain person decided

225
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,666
she didn't approve of us,
so she's chosen to flee.

226
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,083
[CORNELIA gasps]

227
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,125
We need to deploy Damocles
now. There's no more time.

228
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,416
Is that the only
option we have?

229
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,916
That will be up to
the world to decide.

230
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,958
[C.C.] Lelouch, are you
really certain about this?

231
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,125
Just me and a few
security police?

232
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,583
We're going there to
ask them for a favor.

233
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,541
To participate in an
enlightened democratic system.

234
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,791
Uh-huh.

235
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,833
And we know how everyone
loves their democracy.

236
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,000
[MILLY] We're coming to you
from Ashford Academy,

237
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,375
the site chosen by
His Majesty Lelouch,

238
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,166
Emperor of Britannia.
It is here that the U.F.N.

239
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,500
will debate whether to allow
the Britannian Empire

240
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,083
to become a member.

241
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,541
[MILLY] It's the emperor's
personal transport.

242
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,166
[CROWD murmuring]
Ooh!

243
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,125
Lelouch, is it really you?

244
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,666
[gasps] I'm sorry. Emperor
Lelouch has just landed

245
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,333
inside the school grounds.

246
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,500
[WOMAN] It's Lelouch,
the emperor for justice!

247
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,250
--[MAN] He's just a kid!
--[WOMAN 2] Your Majesty!

248
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,291
[RIVALZ] Lelouch! I need to
know the truth, Lelouch!

249
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,458
Why didn't you ever
tell me who you were?!

250
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,625
--[COP] Hey!
--[yelps]

251
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,875
--[COP] How dare you!
--[RIVALZ] Lemme go!

252
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:41,875
[COP]
Disrespecting the emperor!

253
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,208
We're friends!

254
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,958
He was my best friend
at school here. He was...

255
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,958
Lelouch!

256
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,041
Hey!

257
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,458
[COP]
Right...

258
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,541
[NINA] He's sorry! Let him go!
We'll leave right now!

259
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,666
[RIVALZ]
Huh?

260
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,791
Let's go. Come on.

261
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,125
[gasps]

262
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,916
Lelouch, tell me wh--

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,875
[LELOUCH]
Nice to meet you.

264
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,583
You're Capt. Kallen Kouzuki,

265
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,125
a leader of the Black
Knights, are you not?

266
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,458
That's right.

267
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,541
I'm here to escort you
safely to the conference.

268
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,750
Fine.

269
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,083
Do you mind if we take
the long way around?

270
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,458
[gasps]

271
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,750
I am feeling a bit
anxious about this.

272
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,000
A little walk might be helpful.

273
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,208
I understand.

274
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,625
[OHGI] Is Zero, uh, Lelouch--did
he come here to pull something?

275
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,833
[VILLETTA]
He can't.

276
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,083
The O.S.I.'s systems are
completely down now.

277
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,375
We've also supplied
the guards with goggles

278
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,041
that have special lenses.
Advanced Geass countermeasures.

279
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,125
Kouzuki wants us to
watch her closely;

280
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,166
if we think he used
his geass on her,

281
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,125
she wants us to shoot her.
She said to use the snipers.

282
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,958
You're all just paranoid.

283
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,375
He came here to make
friends; get over it.

284
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,083
Nostalgic, isn't it?

285
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,833
I'm... I'm grateful
for what you did.

286
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,833
[KALLEN] I know if it weren't
for you, I'd have ended my life

287
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,000
back in the Shinjuku ghetto.

288
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:12,875
The Black Knights would never
have existed at all. I was glad,

289
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,041
proud and honored to be needed
by our masked leader, Zero.

290
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,333
But, when I learned
you were Zero,

291
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,583
I didn't understand anymore.

292
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:27,041
Even so, the man I saw
fighting against Britannia...

293
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,958
Now you've joined
forces with Suzaku.

294
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,458
What are you really
trying to do?

295
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,125
[KALLEN]
Do you want personal power?

296
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:41,000
To be above everyone else?
Or is this just a game to you?

297
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,916
During the Black Rebellion,

298
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,625
Ohgi told me to guard
you with my life.

299
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,958
He told me that you could make
my brother's dream come true.

300
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,791
Lelouch, after everything
we've been through,

301
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,500
what do I mean to you?!

302
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,750
On the day that you left
the Ikaruga, you told me

303
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,333
"Kallen, you have to live."

304
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:20,375
This is it then. Bye, Lelouch.

305
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,750
The supreme council will be
meeting in the gymnasium.

306
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,291
So then, it is goodbye, Kallen.

307
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,083
[LELOUCH]
Chairman Kaguya Sumeragi

308
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,458
of the U.F.N. supreme council.

309
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,583
I desire that the Holy
Britannian Empire participates

310
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,666
in the United
Federation of Nations.

311
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,208
[KAGUYA]
Master Zero.

312
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,208
Do you understand
that participation

313
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,666
is dependent upon a
two third majority vote

314
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,291
of U.F.N. members?

315
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,625
Of course.

316
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,833
That's the democratic way
of doing things, right?

317
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,375
Yes, that's right.

318
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,500
[ASHFORD REPS murmuring]

319
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,083
This is rather uncourteous,
don't you agree?

320
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,875
It was former emperor, Charles,

321
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,458
who carried out all
those crimes, wasn't it?

322
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,666
[LELOUCH]
Geass countermeasures, huh?

323
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,625
Well, now it's clear that only
Kaguya and the core members

324
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,416
of the Black Knights
know about Geass.

325
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,833
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

326
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,958
Now, what are you really
trying to do here,

327
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,791
treacherous Emperor Lelouch?

328
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm surprised at you.

329
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,375
Isn't the new Britannia a better
country for the entire world?

330
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,291
[XING-KE]
That remains to be seen.

331
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,416
U.F.N. resolutions
are always determined

332
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
by majority vote.

333
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,750
Voting rights are apportioned

334
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,750
according to each member
nation's population.

335
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,000
[XING-KE] The Chinese Federation
has been broken up,

336
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,958
so the nation with the largest
population in the world now...

337
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,416
[OHGI]
...is Britannia.

338
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,750
[XIANG-LIN]
If we allow Britannia

339
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,708
to join the U.F.N. today...

340
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,583
[HONG GU] You will have
more than half the votes,

341
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,125
Emperor Lelouch.

342
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,416
In short, if we
vote in your favor,

343
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,375
you would usurp our power and
take control of the U.F.N.

344
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:11,416
So that's it! I always
knew he was a bad guy!

345
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,791
[RAKSHATA] He really is
exceptionally dim, isn't he?

346
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,958
[TAMAKI]
I heard that!

347
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,000
What's your response,
Emperor Lelouch?!

348
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,583
Break up your empire.
Let your territories

349
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,291
secede from Britannia...

350
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,000
...or limit your
total votes to 20%.

351
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,916
Those are your options.

352
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,041
Chairman Kaguya,
I have one question

353
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,541
that I would like to ask you.

354
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,708
You may do so.

355
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,083
[LELOUCH]
What trait is most important

356
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,750
for governing the world?

357
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,750
It's pride. The pride
of self-governance.

358
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,791
[LELOUCH]
Good answer.

359
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,833
[gasps]

360
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,041
You speak with
wisdom, Lady Kaguya.

361
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,291
However, I would submit
a different answer.

362
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,291
Oh, and what would
that answer be?

363
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,833
[LELOUCH]
The will to destroy.

364
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:48,958
Destroy?

365
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,541
Destroy the world
and even one's self!

366
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,458
Careful, he's trying
to pull something!

367
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,625
[gasps]

368
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,333
Dammit!

369
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:02,708
[ASHFORD REPS yelling]

370
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,750
[SUZAKU] I will not allow
this affront to His Majesty!

371
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,958
Where the hell were
our perimeter guards?!

372
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,375
[MAN ON RADIO 4] Sorry,
sir! He launched suddenly

373
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,750
from underwater!

374
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,125
Is he gonna make the
leaders of the entire world

375
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,458
obey him at gunpoint?

376
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,916
Deploy to Ashford Academy!

377
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,791
We need to save Lady Kaguya!

378
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,083
The Britannian forces
have started to move!

379
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,500
What's that?!

380
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,666
[MINASE] They're crossing
from international waters

381
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,708
into Japanese territory!

382
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,000
He's caught us off guard.

383
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,416
Meeting with the U.F.N.

384
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,916
and then choosing the
school as the site...

385
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,041
All of this was
nothing but a decoy!

386
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,000
If that's true, then
he's betrayed the trust

387
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,416
of the entire world.

388
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,666
You heard him.

389
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,041
He was never interested
in joinging the U.F.N.

390
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,875
In other words, his goal
is a pure dictatorship.

391
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,000
He abolished the
old aristocracy,

392
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,583
yet he still continues
to call himself emperor.

393
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,833
You're right.

394
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,541
Zero is-- Lelouch is now
the enemy of the world!

395
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,250
[XING-KE] Retreat!
Get out of there, Kozuki!

396
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,416
Negative, I'm taking
Lelouch down!

397
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,875
This Guren's the
only unit that can

398
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,500
go up against the Lancelot!

399
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,625
If you fight here,
you'll be putting

400
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,916
everyone's lives at risk.

401
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There are leaders from
every nation on Earth!

402
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,166
But the Empress is
also in grave danger!

403
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,541
I know that, Kallen,
but the enemy is Lelouch!

404
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,208
He won't hesitate to kill
everyone around him!

405
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,375
You can't act on your own.

406
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,208
We have to let the
representatives decide

407
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,458
how to respond.

408
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,750
Otherwise, the U.F.N.
itself will collapse!

409
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,208
And that would leave
Britannia victorious!

410
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,541
[KAGUYA]
Suzaku...

411
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,583
[LELOUCH]
Now, Chairman Sumeragi...

412
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,916
[gasps]

413
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,958
[LELOUCH] I request
that you take the vote.

414
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,250
Will you allow Britannia
to join the U.F.N.?

415
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,791
We'd be voting under duress.

416
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,250
Will you stop them from
casting their decision?

417
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:44,416
No. Then let's start
the democratic process.

418
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,333
[RIVALZ] Lelouch and Suzaku!
What are they thinking?!

419
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,166
They've declared war
on the whole world.

420
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,916
[RIVALZ]
A roadblock?

421
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,833
Don't try to protect me,
it's not worth it.

422
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,708
You'll get tangled up
in this whole thing.

423
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,791
I'm not gonna let them
get their hands on you!

424
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,458
Why, just as a favor to
Milly?! If that's it--

425
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,041
Idiot! It's because
I'm your friend!

426
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,833
Ah?!

427
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:15,000
[breaks screech]

428
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,500
[LLOYD]
Congratulations!

429
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,125
[BOTH]
Huh?

430
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,541
[LLOYD laughing]

431
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,666
[MASKED SOLDIER] Priority
target one has been captured.

432
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,458
It all went as you
predicted, Your Majesty.

433
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,625
Good. Treat her with
courtesy as I instructed.

434
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,333
Oh, one more thing.

435
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm sure there was
a student with her.

436
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,375
Let him go free.

437
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,125
[MASKED SOLDIER]
Yes, Your Majesty!

438
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,333
--[SUZAKU] Majesty!
--[LELOUCH] Hm?

439
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,166
[SUZAKU] Emergency dispatch
from the Avalon!

440
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,750
[LELOUCH]
What is it?

441
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,666
Pendragon, the capitol
city-- It's been...!

442
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,666
[LELOUCH]
Dammit! He struck first!

443
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,625
[CECILE] The radius of
destruction is approximately

444
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,666
100 kilometers.

445
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,166
We have to assume it was
caused by a F.L.E.I.J.A.

446
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,958
And that's not all...

447
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,333
There's a fortress
in the sky above it.

448
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,750
It's three kilometers long.

449
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,333
What's he doing now?

450
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,958
[SUZAKU] Lelouch! It's
just as you guessed!

451
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,250
[LELOUCH]
Yes, I had no doubt

452
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,708
that all the F.L.I.E.J.A.
warheads were there.

453
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,833
The sky fortress
Democles was developed

454
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,833
by the Toromo
Agency in Cambodia.

455
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,458
It is a perfect base
for the F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

456
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,875
Hm?

457
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,083
The only one who would know

458
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,833
the imperial private
channel is...

459
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,166
[grunts]

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,875
Do you enjoy forcing
others to submit

461
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,708
to your will, Lelouch?

462
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,958
What do you want?

463
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,208
I've gathered all the
F.L.E.I.J.A. warheads.

464
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,125
They're deployed
to the Damocles.

465
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,416
[LELOUCH]
You're prepared to attack

466
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,833
the Britannian emperor?

467
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,250
I'm afraid that's a moot point

468
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,166
since I don't recognize you
as the emperor, Lelouch.

469
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,541
I see.

470
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,333
I suppose you think that
you're best suited to rule.

471
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,583
No. You're mistaken.

472
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,583
There's another who's
destined for the throne.

473
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,166
Hm?

474
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,291
The one who's truly best suited
to rule Britannia is right here.

475
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,166
[BOTH gasp]

476
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,458
[gasps]

477
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,000
[gasps]

478
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,708
Nunnally!

479
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:15,208
Listen well, Lelouch
and Suzaku, I declare...

480
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,750
You're my enemies from now on.

481
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,666
[LELOUCH] Nunnally, ever since
that day eight years ago

482
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,458
when we were abandoned,

483
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,333
I've needed a reason
to go on living.

484
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:05,416
Instinctively, I made
you my guiding star.

485
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,125
You became the
foundation of my life.

486
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,750
Perhaps, it is
about those issues

487
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:14,250
that Suzaku and Kallen
feel are so important.

488
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,958
Am I to once again lose the
very basis for my existence?

489
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,250
If not, do I now have to...!
