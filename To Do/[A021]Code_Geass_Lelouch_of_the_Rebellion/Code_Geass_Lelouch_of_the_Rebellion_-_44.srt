1
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,333
[KNIGHT 12]
There was a giant explosion

2
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,000
in the Tokyo Settlement.

3
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,125
It appears that a F.L.E.I.J.A.
warhead caused it.

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,958
Your Majesty, should we
remain here at Kamine Island?

5
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,791
Enough! Let Schneizel
handle mundane affairs.

6
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,250
[NEWSMAN A] At least
ten million inhabitants

7
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,125
are believed dead from the
initial impact of the blast.

8
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,458
[NEWSMAN B] Secondary damages
might have caused 25 million

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,458
more casualties. All rescue
facilities were wiped out,

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,333
so we cannot care for
any of the wounded.

11
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,750
[NEWSMAN C] The Tokyo
settlement is now no more.

12
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,958
No. How could this
have happened?

13
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,541
They're all They're all...!

14
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:01,500
I did it?! I did this?

15
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,541
[GINO] The school was outside
the blast radius. But...

16
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,583
This has gone beyond war.

17
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,791
[TOHDOH]
If they use this weapon again,

18
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,375
the Black Knights will
be completely wiped out!

19
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,250
[ZERO]
Tohdoh, it's me.

20
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,666
Zero, we can't remain--

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,125
[ZERO] Have all forces
land in the Tokyo settlement.

22
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,250
Search for Nunnally.

23
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,416
Wait a minute!
We've lost Asahina!

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,333
And we have massive casualties!

25
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,625
[ZERO]
You think I care about that?!

26
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:25,625
[TOHDOH]
Uh?!

27
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,666
Find Nunnally now!
That's an order!

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,750
All forces search for Nunnally!

29
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,875
[TOHDOH]
What's happened to Zero?!

30
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,791
[OHGI] The fugitives on the
portside runway, right?

31
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,291
[FUTABA] Wait! We need to
reorganize our forces first!

32
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,416
[OHGI] Understood! I'll be
back there in a minute!

33
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,083
[VILLETTA]
Ohgi!

34
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,041
[OHGI]
Uh?

35
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,250
Chigusa.

36
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,125
[DIETHARD] That's far enough!
Miss fugitive.

37
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,208
[gasps]

38
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,958
[gasps]

39
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,375
[DIETHARD] Cornelia?! I thought
it was Villetta who'd escaped.

40
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,541
So it's you.
Newsman and turncoat.

41
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,416
[DIETHARD]
Is Zero behind this?

42
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,125
Secretly holding the
princess as a captive?

43
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,333
He should have shown a
little more trust in me.

44
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,833
Aim for her legs!
I want her taken alive, men!

45
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:43,666
[MEN]
Yes, sir!

46
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,625
[siren wails]

47
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,875
[RADIO GUY] Attention! We
are carrying a Britannian

48
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,291
special envoy on an urgent
diplomatic mission!

49
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,541
We have no hostile intentions!

50
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,583
Diplomatic mission? Minase,
was that craft cleared

51
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,125
to land through
official channels?

52
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:04,791
Schneizel!

53
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,375
Impossible!

54
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:10,208
Why would he step right into
the midst of his mortal enemies?

55
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,458
[LELOUCH] Tohdoh!
I told you to find Nunnally!

56
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,750
Now deploy the search teams!

57
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,666
Kallen, do you hear me?
Rolo! Jeremiah!

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,666
Nunnally has to be alive!
Find her! Find Nunnally!

59
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,791
[TOHDOH]
Attention, all forces!

60
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,500
Fall back to Makuhari
and reform our battle line!

61
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,500
All forces, fall back now!

62
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,541
Tohdoh! I told you to
search for Nunnally!

63
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,416
[gasps]

64
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,750
As long as my brother is safe...

65
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,583
..then we will have
another chance.

66
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,916
[XING-KE] Why have they called
a temporary cease fire?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,583
What are the Britannians up to?!

68
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,791
Why did Bismarck withdraw?!

69
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,208
[XIANG-LIN]
We're trying to find that out,

70
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,666
but they don't seem to
be preparing a new attack.

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,416
And there's a cease
fire in Tokyo, as well.

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,250
Did Zero order it?

73
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,083
[C.C.]
Uh? Master, you're back! Uh!

74
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,541
Hang in there, big brother.

75
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,000
[LELOUCH]
Nunnally...

76
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,000
[ROLO]
Big brother, I'm here for you...

77
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,333
We've been doing fine with just
the two of us, haven't we?

78
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,125
[phone rings]

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,791
[ROLO] Jeremiah?
Please give my brother some

80
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,000
time right now.
You can talk to him later.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,583
Right. It may not mean
much of anything. Mm.

82
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,291
After all, I'm here with him.

83
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,791
[LELOUCH gasps]

84
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,416
What are you doing with
this?! It's Nunnally's!

85
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,291
I wanted to give this locket
to Nunnally, not to you!

86
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,208
To Nunnally!

87
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,500
You think you could ever
replace Nunnally in my heart?!

88
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,041
You're an imposter!

89
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,083
[ROLO, C.C.]
Uh!

90
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,208
Haven't you figured
it out yet? I hate you.

91
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,333
I loathe you. I despise you!

92
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,708
I've been trying to kill you,

93
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,125
but I just keep
missing the chance!

94
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,541
[ROLO]
Big brother...?

95
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,958
[LELOUCH]
Get out of here!

96
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,208
I never want to see
your face again!

97
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,625
I said get out!

98
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,666
[ROLO whimpers]

99
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,708
[NINA] I didn't understand
what this kind of destruction

100
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,333
really means. It was all
just numbers. But now...

101
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,541
[LLOYD] You need to
make a choice, Nina.

102
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,583
Do you abandon science
to preserve your heart,

103
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:13,666
or abandon your heart and
sacrifice yourself to science?

104
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,041
How can I do either?

105
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,458
Did you make such a
choice, professor Lloyd?

106
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,000
[LLOYD] I didn't have to,
I'm a sociopath.

107
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,333
I was born with an
abandoned heart.

108
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,291
But I'm the one who built
the F.L.E.I.J.A warhead.

109
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:32,333
All those people's lives
are gone. I killed them!

110
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,250
All of them!

111
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,916
[CHIBA]
It's no use. There's no answer.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,583
[DIETHARD]
We don't have any choice, then.

113
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,791
We'll have to meet Prince
Schneizel without Zero.

114
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,583
[RAKSHATA] But, Zero's
our leader, after all.

115
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,000
Should we be making
decisions without him?

116
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,458
It was a massacre! They
killed everyone, including

117
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,166
women and children! Kinoshita
said it was Zero's orders!

118
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,416
[CHIBA]
Diethard!

119
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,166
[CHIBA] Why didn't you
take Schneizel captive?

120
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,791
We could've avenged Asahina.

121
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,041
He only has one
Knightmare guarding him.

122
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,375
Because they came equipped

123
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,250
with a massive
F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

124
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,458
F.L.E.I.J.A.?

125
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,958
[DIETHARD] Like the one
that just destroyed

126
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,458
the Tokyo settlement.
It's a new weapon.

127
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,166
If they unleash it, it will kill
us and Zero in a heartbeat.

128
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,125
We don't know what
Schneizel's objective here is.

129
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,833
So our best option is to
meet with him and find out.

130
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,250
[RAKSHATA]
I think, I'll pass.

131
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,958
I want to system-check my
Guren now that it's back.

132
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,916
Then the negotiators
will be myself,

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,583
Chiba, Diethard, as well as--

134
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,458
[TAMAKI] Forget it.
I can't find Ohgi anywhere.

135
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,625
Dammit! Where'd
that fool go, huh?

136
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,625
[MINAMI]
Kallen!

137
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,958
Thank goodness, you're
back in one piece!

138
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,041
Sorry to worry you, I'm okay.
Uh, where's Zero?

139
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,583
I heard he's in his quarters.

140
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,000
There's a rumor that
he was wounded.

141
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:53,625
Lady Nunnally, I pray you're
still alive. Fervently.

142
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,500
[CORNELIA]
That's all,

143
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,708
everything I saw and
heard at the Order.

144
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,791
[SCHNEIZEL] Thank you, Cornelia.
With this information, I can--

145
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,333
[DIETHARD]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

146
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,833
[TAMAKI] Yeah, Sorry.
We've had our hands full

147
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,000
with all the ten million dead
people you guys slaughtered.

148
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,791
Tamaki, we discussed
this already.

149
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,083
You can't be here for this.

150
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,250
Why not? I'm the
Black Knight's Interior

151
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,625
Custodian Minister so I can
sit in for my bud, Ohgi,

152
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,083
and fill him in later!

153
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,625
[DIETHARD] You're the only
one who has that impression.

154
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,833
[SCHNEIZEL]
No...

155
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,625
Please. I'd like for
him to join us, as well.

156
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,708
[DIETHARD]
Huh?

157
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,500
[SCHNEIZEL]
Shin'ichiro Tamaki.

158
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,250
As Zero's oldest comrade,

159
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,500
you are the brave veteran
of many historic battles.

160
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,625
[TAMAKI]
Ha! You all know about me, huh!

161
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,916
[DIETHARD]
T-Tamaki! Please.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,208
[JEREMIAH] You rescued me a
long time ago, didn't you?

163
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,833
Very courageous.

164
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:43,625
I came here to thank you for
that honorable act. Indeed...

165
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,666
You and I share a
rather odd connection,

166
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,125
don't you think?

167
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,500
I suppose it's fate that we
became enemies in the end.

168
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:54,666
I'll take my leave now, sir. I
must search for Lady Nunnally.

169
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,458
Nunnally's dead. She's gone.

170
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,125
[CLAUDIO] Survivors are
directed to register in order.

171
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,583
Along with your I.D. number,
give your name, age, address,

172
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,666
and blood type. If you
require medical attention,

173
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,625
please go to the medical
information desk

174
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,750
and take a number.

175
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,333
To minimize disorder, please...

176
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,708
[RIVALZ screams]

177
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,750
Rivalz!

178
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,541
Oh, Prez, just tell
me you're alive.

179
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,583
Yes. I am. I'm alive!

180
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,083
[RIVALZ]
Thank goodness!

181
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,041
[MILLY]
You can say that again!

182
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,916
[RIVALZ, MILLY laugh]

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,125
[SCHNEIZEL]
Now that I think of it,

184
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,333
I never finished my
match with Zero, did I?

185
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,166
Zero won't be attending.

186
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,875
Not until we have the
details of the proposal.

187
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,541
[SCHNEIZEL] Of course.
I didn't expect him to show up.

188
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,041
[DIETHARD]
Hm?

189
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,791
[SCHNEIZEL] He's not the type
who consults with others.

190
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,791
No, he keeps things to himself
and holds people at a distance.

191
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,041
[DIETHARD]
That's strange,

192
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,291
you talk about him as if
you know him intimately.

193
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,458
[SCHNEIZEL]
More than any of you do.

194
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,833
[ALL gasp]

195
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,916
Zero is our younger brother.
Cornelia's and my own.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,750
Huh?

197
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,000
What are you saying?!

198
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,291
He is the former
11th royal prince

199
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,750
of the Holy Britannian Empire:
Lelouch vi Britannia.

200
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,750
The man whom I both loved and
feared more than any other.

201
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,166
Impossible!

202
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,333
You're telling us that Zero's
a Britannian prince?!

203
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,625
Diethard, please
in all this time,

204
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,708
you never figured that out?
Even with all the information

205
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,041
you were getting from
Jeremiah and Villetta?

206
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,625
[TAMAKI exhales]

207
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,583
[DIETHARD] You're wasting your
time. You can't cause chaos

208
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,666
here by spreading
these irrelevant stories.

209
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,708
It's not Zero's lineage that
matters, but rather his efforts

210
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,000
and the miracles that
he's performed for us.

211
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,083
But, what if all those
miracles he performed

212
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,583
were actually tricks?

213
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,000
[DIETHARD]
Tricks?

214
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,958
Zero possesses a special power.
It is known as Geass.

215
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,375
[ALL]
Huh?

216
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,041
[SCHNEIZEL] It's the absolute
power to compel anyone

217
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,625
to obey him. You can think
of it as extreme hypnosis.

218
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,000
You're saying his miracles
come from that power?

219
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,458
Are you tryin' to
dis my man Zero?

220
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,875
He's got brains and guts
and he kicks Britannian butt!

221
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,958
A prince with Geass power!

222
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,041
Where's the proof of
all this bull, huh?

223
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,000
[OHGI]
I have the proof!

224
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,125
[TAMAKI]
Ohgi.

225
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,375
[CORNELIA]
And Villetta?

226
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,625
What he's saying is all true.

227
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,833
Zero is a former Britannian
prince named Lelouch.

228
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,958
He controls people
with his Geass power.

229
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,708
A con man!

230
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,000
[OHGI] Zero's been
tricking us all along!

231
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,750
Using us like pawns,
from the start!

232
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,833
[TAMAKI]
You don't mean this, Ohgi.

233
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,625
[CHIBA] But, if that's
really true, then...

234
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,583
[DIETHARD]
Then it doesn't matter!

235
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,416
It doesn't erase a single thing
that he's done for us.

236
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,583
And if he really does
have this Geass power,

237
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,666
then doesn't that just help us?

238
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,791
It's another weapon to use in
our fight against Britannia.

239
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,375
Yes, that would
make perfect sense

240
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,500
if he only used it
against our enemies!

241
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,666
[TAMAKI]
What?

242
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
[CHIBA] Are you saying
he used it on us?

243
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,125
Of course.

244
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,500
He used geass to control
his own sister, Euphemia.

245
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,166
He made her slaughter the
Elevens in the Special Zone!

246
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,625
You're lying. Zero's
a knight for Justice!

247
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,000
He would never do
something like--

248
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,375
We have evidence.

249
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,958
[SUZAKU] Did you use your Geass
Power on Euphy? Be honest.

250
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,208
[LELOUCH]
Yes.

251
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,583
[SUZAKU] You caused her
massacre the Japanese?

252
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,750
[LELOUCH]
I ordered her to do it.

253
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,666
Then, that whole
bloodbath was...

254
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,916
Euphy was just a girl.
Zero was in control.

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,041
So Zero slaughtered our people
for his own ambitions?!

256
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,000
That recording is fake!

257
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,875
These are people and incidents
that we suspect he manipulated,

258
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,375
with his Geass.

259
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:41,250
[gasps] Kusakabe.
Even Major General Katase.

260
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,583
[CHIBA]
I can't... believe it.

261
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,000
[DIETHARD]
Clovis...

262
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,583
[VILLETTA]
He used it on me, too.

263
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,750
[DIETHARD]
Hm?

264
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,500
[OHGI] That explains
why Gao-Hai changed.

265
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,666
[VILLETTA]
And it explains why

266
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,291
Jeremiah and the others
became traitors.

267
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,666
His Geass might be
controlling even me now.

268
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,875
There's no way to be
certain about that.

269
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,500
When you think about it,
it's a terrifying prospect.

270
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,166
You mean...?!

271
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,541
We could be...?!

272
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,875
[KANON] There's one more
thing. We notified Zero

273
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,708
about the F.L.E.I.J.A.
warhead before the battle.

274
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,041
We wanted to avoid using it.

275
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,916
It's still in the Lancelot's
communications record.

276
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,416
However...

277
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,833
He never told us
anything about that.

278
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,625
We can't trust
Commander Zero!

279
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,166
[TOHDOH]
Asahina...

280
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,458
I wanted to put
my trust in Zero!

281
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,708
I wanted to believe in him!

282
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,541
But we mean nothing to him,
we're just pawns.

283
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,750
Treating us like chumps?! Damn!
How could he do this to us?!

284
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,208
[yells]

285
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,750
Everyone, Zero is my brother.

286
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,333
Will you please hand him
over to me for justice?

287
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,875
[TAMAKI cries]

288
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,000
On one condition.

289
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:51,583
[ALL gasp]

290
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,000
[TAMAKI]
Ohgi!

291
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,541
You think you're in a position
to bargain over this?!

292
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,958
Wait, let's hear it.

293
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,000
Our Japan. Return it.

294
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,375
[ALL gasp]

295
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,458
[OHGI]
We're betraying our comrade.

296
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,000
So at least we deserve
to regain Japan.

297
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:10,083
Otherwise I could never
forgive myself.

298
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,375
[C.C.] Master, please
take off your clothes.

299
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,791
[LELOUCH grunts]
What?

300
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,666
Are you hurting somewhere?

301
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,291
If it's someplace you can't
reach, I can help.

302
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,083
[LELOUCH gasps, sighs]

303
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:31,833
[LELOUCH] That's right.
It's someplace I can't reach.

304
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,666
[KALLEN] Zero, are you there?
Can I come in?

305
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,875
It's me.

306
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,791
Is that Kallen?

307
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,208
[KALLEN] Ohgi asked me to
bring you to Warehouse Four.

308
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,500
[LELOUCH]
Why there?

309
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,958
[KALLEN]
Sorry, I didn't get the details.

310
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:46,916
[C.C.]
Master?

311
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,625
[KALLEN]
Uh?

312
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,416
Please take off your clothes.

313
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,583
I'll do the best
I can, I promise.

314
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,583
Uh! What the hell have the
two of you been doing here?!

315
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,250
While I've been
rotting in a cell y--!

316
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:01,875
[LELOUCH] No, you've got
it wrong. She was...

317
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,916
C.C. lost her memory.

318
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,833
[gasps]

319
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,500
It happened because of me.

320
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:10,416
So, the C.C. you knew is gone
now, erased, and it's my fault.

321
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,750
[gasps]

322
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,916
[KALLEN]
Her mind was erased?

323
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,291
[KALLEN] C.C.'s gone.
And Nunnally's been killed.

324
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,125
That means Lelouch is now...

325
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:23,791
[LELOUCH]
Kallen.

326
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,916
[KALLEN]
Uh!

327
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,250
[LELOUCH]
It's good you made it back.

328
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,166
I'm sorry it took so
long to get you out.

329
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,250
Lelouch, listen when
I was imprisoned,

330
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,083
I happened to talk to Nunnally.

331
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,541
She stood up for me
and she saved me.

332
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,125
[LELOUCH]
I see.

333
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,791
[KALLEN] Look, I'm not sure what
to say at a time like this...

334
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,958
But when I lost
my brother, I--

335
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,000
[KALLEN, LELOUCH gasp]

336
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,708
Surrender, Zero!

337
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,416
How dare you try to run
a con game on us!

338
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,958
We know everything
about your Geass power!

339
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,666
[LELOUCH gasps]

340
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,291
[DIETHARD]
"Zero, the renowned hero,

341
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,083
died in battle before
he could triumph.

342
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,250
But his gallant life
and daring deeds will

343
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,875
continue to live on
in myth and legend!"

344
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,000
[LELOUCH] Is that the script
you've written for me, Diethard?

345
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,791
Actually, I wanted to film
your brilliant campaign

346
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,000
and glorious victory
over Britannia,

347
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,000
but I'm afraid that show has
been permanently cancelled.

348
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,250
[LELOUCH]
What do I do?

349
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,500
Knightmares are
beyond my reach,

350
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,500
but Ohgi and the others
are defenseless!

351
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,250
If I can use my
Geass secretly...!

352
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,166
Everybody trusted you, Zero!

353
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,208
Inoue and Yoshida sacrificed
their lives for you!

354
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
Wait a minute!
This is all one-sided!

355
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,000
Look at how far we've
come because of Zero!

356
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,541
At least let him answer!

357
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,916
[TAMAKI]
You're in the way, Kallen!

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,750
[SUGIYAMA]
Do you want to die with Zero?!

359
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,875
[MINAMI] Don't tell me he
used his Geass on you, too!

360
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,666
I need an answer, Lelouch.
What do I mean to you?

361
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,250
I have to know.

362
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:52,166
[KALLEN] If I could stay
with you, I would... Please.

363
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,333
[LELOUCH gasps]

364
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,958
[LELOUCH]
Schneizel. You made your move

365
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,000
and now you're calling check.

366
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,125
There's no way out of
this for me. It's over.

367
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,041
Please, answer me, Lelouch!

368
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,708
[LELOUCH laughs]

369
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,916
[KALLEN]
Uh!

370
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,125
[LELOUCH] Fools!
You finally figured it out!

371
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,958
That I've been using you all.

372
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,208
That's right. You're all
just pawns in my game!

373
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,875
Zero! So, you really are...

374
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,791
Zero!

375
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,166
Lelouch, no.

376
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,625
Kallen, you were my
most useful piece;

377
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,333
much like a well-played,
knight. This whole world

378
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:29,833
was the board for the game.
And all for my entertainment.

379
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,416
I see...

380
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,250
[KALLEN]
Goodbye then, Lelouch.

381
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,333
Get ready!

382
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,541
Kallen. You have to live.

383
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,750
[KALLEN gasps]

384
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,833
Fire!

385
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,166
[ALL gasp]

386
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,375
[ROLO]
Are you okay, brother?!

387
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,708
Rolo!

388
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,791
[TOHDOH] Never mind!
Open fire! Hit the Shinkiro!

389
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:52,750
Wait!

390
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,875
Big brother,
I'll protect you!

391
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,208
Stop it, Rolo!
You've done enough!

392
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,625
Uh!

393
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,083
Oh, my master...

394
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,750
Uh. They're gone!

395
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,000
The Shinkiro...!

396
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,166
Vanished. Just like
in Babel Tower...

397
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,541
Anya, Zero has escaped.

398
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,500
Can you capture him
with the Mordred?

399
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,583
I can only destroy it.

400
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,041
I never knew how hard it was

401
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,791
to calculate the Absolute
Defense Field.

402
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,333
My big brother really is
incredible, isn't he?

403
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,583
[LELOUCH] Rolo! I have no
reason to live anymore!

404
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:34,875
Huh?

405
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,250
Uh?

406
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,125
How can it move like that?

407
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:43,041
[ROLO] I won't let them
kill you! I swear it!

408
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,500
[LELOUCH] Using your Geass over
such a large area...

409
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,583
Rolo! I's way too much,

410
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,958
your heart can't take
that much strain!

411
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,625
[DIETHARD] Attention, all units!
The Shinkiro has been stolen!

412
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,500
Search out and
destroy the Shinkiro!

413
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,500
I Repeat, destroy the Shinkiro!

414
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,125
[ROLO, LELOUCH groaning]

415
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,458
That's enough, Rolo! I don't
want to live any more!

416
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,000
I won't stop, brother.
Because of this...

417
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,750
[LELOUCH]
Don't do--

418
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,541
All throughout my whole life,
people have used me like a tool.

419
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,833
...this, Rolo! Why are
you still trying--

420
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,750
[ROLO]
I was used by the Order...

421
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,375
...to save me?! You know that--

422
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,250
[ROLO] And then you
used me, big brother.

423
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,833
Uh. Yeah, Maybe
you've been using me

424
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,458
for your own ends right
from the very start...

425
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:44,250
But only the time I spent
with you seemed real.

426
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,833
...I was only usin--

427
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,625
[ROLO] It was those memories
that finally made me...

428
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,000
human!

429
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,208
[ROLO groaning, coughing]

430
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,250
...using you! Uh! Rolo!

431
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,083
That's why I'm not I'm not...!

432
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,416
[coughs] I'm not...

433
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,125
No, stop using your Geass like
that! Do you want to die?!

434
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:15,416
I'm not... a tool. I do this...
of my own... free will!

435
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,333
As a human being!

436
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:33,458
[LELOUCH] Rolo, why did you save
me? After all I've done to you?

437
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,541
[ROLO] Because you're
a liar, big brother.

438
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,375
[LELOUCH]
Uh.

439
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,791
[ROLO]
It was a lie, wasn't it?

440
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,916
What you said about
trying to kill me.

441
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,250
About hating me
and all of that.

442
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,000
Of course And you saw
right through me, didn't you?

443
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,875
Just what I'd expect
of my little brother.

444
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,083
That's right. I thought so...

445
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,458
'Cause I know who you really
are inside your heart...

446
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:02,541
I know everything about
you, big brother...

447
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,333
Yes, you got it right.

448
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:10,750
Your big brother is just a liar.

449
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,500
[RADIO GUY C]
We cannot locate the target.

450
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,333
[RADIO GUY D]
Increasing the search area.

451
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,791
[RADIO GUY E] Request to
send in ground units.

452
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:22,416
[SUZAKU laughs]

453
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:29,125
[LELOUCH]
Nunnally. Rolo. Shirley.

454
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,500
The Black Knights.
I've lost everything.

455
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,250
This is the result which
I've been left with.

456
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,291
No. It's my just punishment.

457
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:43,541
But now, thanks to this...
Thank you, Rolo.

458
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,416
You saved my life for a reason,
because there's still a task

459
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,458
that's waiting
for me out there.

460
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,916
Yes. Something
I have to finish...

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,833
[EMPEROR]
Who would've imagined

462
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:59,000
that I would ever happen
to use the system here.

463
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,250
The Ragnarok Connection.

464
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,583
So now, the old world
shall be destroyed,

465
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,750
and a new world shall
be created in its place!

466
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,916
[LELOUCH] My father,
Charles zi Britannia!

467
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
If I am on the road to hell,
then I'll take you with me.

468
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,750
This is my final
mission! I swear it!

469
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:58,500
[LELOUCH] Rolo. What was our
relationship, in the end?

470
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,291
[laughs]

471
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,833
It's strange to think that.

472
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,291
Even knowing the
truth, you still...

473
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:10,250
You of all people stuck by
me to the very last. Yeah...

474
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:14,000
I always realize these
things when it's too late.

475
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:17,666
To you, I wasn't Lelouch
vi Britannia, was I?

476
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,375
I was Lelouch Lamperouge,
your big brother.
