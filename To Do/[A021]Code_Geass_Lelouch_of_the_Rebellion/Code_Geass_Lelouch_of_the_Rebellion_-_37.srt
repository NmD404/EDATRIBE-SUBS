1
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:18,875
[LELOUCH] The Knights of the
Round have become members

2
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,375
of the student council.

3
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,708
And while I still haven't
cleared that problem, what...

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,750
What were you saying?!

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,541
That Shirley and I were--

6
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,375
Yes. It's true, Shirley
and you were kissing.

7
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,541
Mm! Uh?!

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,833
Um, I wasn't wrong
in doing that, was I?

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,166
I was afraid she might
discover this control room,

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,708
so I thought that's what I
should do in your character.

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,000
Bad call.

12
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,250
You were mistaken there.

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,583
Sayoko! I've told you already!

14
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,625
You were acting too nice
as his stand-in!

15
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,958
No, hold on.

16
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,666
Aside from this,
she did a good job.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,916
[ROLO]
Lelouch!

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,416
I know Sayoko used to be
in your service but...!

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,583
[SAYOKO]
Actually, to be precise,

20
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,208
I was working for
the Ashford family.

21
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,541
[ROLO]
I know that!

22
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,375
You were in charge of caring
for Nunnally, right?

23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,458
[VILLETTA] I guess the problems
of the Knights of Round

24
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,000
will have to wait.

25
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,333
[SAYOKO] Master Lelouch, I have
your schedule for tomorrow.

26
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,541
Tomorrow?

27
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,000
[ROLO] Sayoko made promises
to other people

28
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,958
without considering all
the consequences.

29
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,416
[SAYOKO]
I was instructed to maintain

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,125
his interpersonal relationships.

31
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,583
[LELOUCH]
It can't be helped.

32
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,500
Quite careless for
a female ninja.

33
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,208
I am a secret service agent.

34
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,375
A 37th master of the
Shinozaki school--

35
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,291
[LELOUCH] Sayoko! Wha...
What's with this schedule?!

36
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,166
[SAYOKO] Allowing for
three hours of sleep,

37
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,708
you have dates scheduled
with 108 girls.

38
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,041
Fourteen of them are waiting
for cancellations,

39
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,791
and they've been on the
wait list for six months.

40
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,166
[SHIRLEY]
Lulu just did it so suddenly!

41
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,000
I wonder if I can say
we're going steady...

42
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,958
But I wasn't able
to talk to him today.

43
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,708
[SHIRLEY]
Prez!

44
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,166
Can I have a minute with you
when we go back to our room?

45
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,500
There's something I'd really
like to talk to you about.

46
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,250
Prez?

47
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,375
Huh?!

48
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,500
Oh, sorry, Shirley.
I didn't hear you.

49
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,750
[SHIRLEY]
No, it's okay. I just--

50
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,541
[GIRL A] I've got a date
with Lelouch tomorrow!

51
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,875
Huh?!

52
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,875
[GIRL B] Oh? I heard that
Giselle in class B said

53
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,666
that she'd go to the
art gallery with him.

54
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,291
[GIRL C] Yup! He's taking
me out, too, to a movie.

55
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,375
[GIRLS]
Me, too!

56
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,000
Me, too!

57
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,541
Lu... Lu...!

58
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,291
[SAYOKO] And that confirms
your schedule for today.

59
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,916
Since you have no
classes pending,

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,166
I was able to fill all 24 hours.

61
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,166
At 0700 hours, you'll enjoy
a homemade box lunch.

62
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,458
At 0900 hours, you'll
visit the art gallery.

63
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,750
At 1030 hours, shopping.
At 12 noon, a trip to

64
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,666
the aquarium, and from there
travel abroad aboard Shinkiro.

65
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,166
Please go underwater until you
are 400 kilometers from shore.

66
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,458
You'll change clothes inside
the cockpit and proceed

67
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,458
to the Chinese Federation, where
you'll conclude a trade treaty

68
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,583
in

69
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,250
You are allotted 47 minutes to
complete your business there,

70
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,541
then you'll return here to see
a late movie at 2100 hours.

71
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,625
At midnight 02, you'll meet your
next date for a live show,

72
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,291
and then...

73
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,166
He's late! [growls]

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,458
Sorry, Shirley.

75
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,916
I promise I'll make time later
to explain all this to you.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,875
[ANYA] You can start by
explaining it to me.

77
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,041
[LELOUCH gasps]

78
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,500
[LELOUCH]
Lady Anya!

79
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,541
There's something
I want to ask.

80
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,958
[LELOUCH] Don't tell me I have a
date with a Knight of the Round!

81
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,416
[ANYA]
Same Lelouch?

82
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,250
[LELOUCH]
Uh?

83
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,625
[LELOUCH]
That's a picture of me

84
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,875
when I was still a prince
back in the homeland!

85
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,708
O-Of course not.
Remarkable likeness.

86
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,958
But you know I'm
only a commoner.

87
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,291
[GINO]
Lelouch, old man!

88
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,625
[LELOUCH]
Ah!

89
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,875
What?!

90
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,333
May I please go to your
chess games with you?

91
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,333
Only the underground
ones where you bet!

92
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,125
[RIVALZ] When I told him h
you gambled on your games,

93
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,708
he begged me to take him along.

94
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,458
[LELOUCH]
Rivalz... I swear, you're--!

95
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,666
[GIRLS scream]

96
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,625
Oh, brother, they never quit!
Just gimme a break, already!

97
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,916
[GROUPIE A]
He's running away!

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,041
[LELOUCH]
Don't go ruining my reputation!

99
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,625
I've got tickets for the
late show in my room!

100
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,666
If I break my commitment, then
my next date will-- Ah...!

101
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,291
Darn it, Sayoko!

102
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,958
Lelouch is too frail for
such a heavy schedule.

103
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,000
And what's up with
all these women?

104
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,041
It's sorta like a
mental problem

105
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,666
[LELOUCH grunting]

106
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,250
Who did that?! I said
I wasn't running away!

107
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,208
Uh?!

108
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,500
[LELOUCH gasps]
Shirley...!

109
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,958
So, what lucky girl do you
have a date with this time?

110
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,458
[LELOUCH]
Um, I uh...

111
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,166
[SHIRLEY] You not only
gamble, but you run around

112
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,791
with other girls, too?!
Ah! You're pathetic!

113
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,291
[LELOUCH]
Wait a minute! It's just--

114
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,166
Uh. I forgot. Here.

115
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,750
This is for not explaining
to you about it.

116
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,250
[LELOUCH gasps]

117
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,458
Oh, it's an apology? What,
you think you can fix what you

118
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,208
did by giving me
some silly thing?!

119
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,208
[LELOUCH]
You've got it all wrong!

120
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,791
I just wanted to apologize!

121
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,083
[SHIRLEY]
An apology?!

122
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,833
[LELOUCH]
This is not good. I'm clearly

123
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,291
doing something wrong and
don't know how to make it right.

124
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,625
Dammit, if only C.C.
was here to help me.

125
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,916
[MILLY]
Attention everyone!

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,125
I have decided on my
graduation event!

127
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,750
And I'm going to christen
it Cupid Day!

128
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,625
[GINO] That's swell, but isn't
it a bit early for graduation?

129
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,208
Well not for me. I'm
repeating my senior year.

130
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,833
I can graduate as soon as
I earn enough course credit.

131
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,875
[GINO] Oh... so that's how the
education system works here.

132
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,291
Prez, are you really planning
to graduate soon?

133
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,125
Why not wait and do it
with the rest of us?

134
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,541
Milly, my dear...

135
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,958
Madam President!

136
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,291
[GINO] This "Cupid Day" of
yours, what exactly is it?

137
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,166
[MILLY laughs]
You wanna know?

138
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,416
Meow.

139
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,208
On the appointed day,
I'll have every student

140
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,875
in school wearing
one of these hats.

141
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,541
The boys will get this color.

142
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,125
Then, if you steal the hat of
your target and put it on...

143
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,541
And then what?

144
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,583
[MILLY] By order of the student
council president, me,

145
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,500
those two will be proclaimed
boyfriend and girlfriend!

146
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,375
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?!

147
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,291
[GIRLS]
Wha...?!

148
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,916
[ODYSSEUS]
Hm... It's a bit rash, isn't it?

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,458
Declaring war on the
Chinese Federation?

150
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,333
[SCHNEIZEL] Hm, is that
what His Majesty said?

151
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,708
Yes. He told us
to take all of it.

152
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,208
[CARINE]
I agree!

153
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,666
I say take out the Chinese
Federation for good!

154
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,833
Those savages
humiliated Odysseus,

155
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,666
and we can never
forgive them for that.

156
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,708
Guinevere, I harbor no grudge

157
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,916
for the incident that occurred
with the empress.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,125
[ODYSSEUS] The war with
the E.U. is ongoing,

159
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,625
and Area 11 is on
the path to peace,

160
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,958
so I'd prefer to
settle this without--

161
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,666
Oh, as if we care about
what Nunnally does there!

162
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,083
[ODYSSEUS] Carine,
Nunnally is around your age.

163
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,333
You should make an attempt
to be friends with her.

164
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,916
[GUINEVERE] This would be
an easy matter to solve

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,083
if Cornelia was present.

166
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,291
Bismark, have you
heard anything?

167
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,791
[BISMARK]
I haven't.

168
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,208
And she apparently hasn't
contacted Lord Guilford, either.

169
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,333
[GUINEVERE]
Then who will lead our troops?

170
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,125
[SCHNEIZEL]
We can station two divisions

171
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,791
along the Mongolian border.

172
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,125
Huh?

173
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,958
Are you offering to take
command, Prince Schneizel?

174
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,541
[SCHNEIZEL]
Battle is unnecessary.

175
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,041
The Chinese Federation
has fallen apart.

176
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,791
We can gain half their
territory by rattling sabers

177
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,833
and through negotiations.

178
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,000
Will that placate the emperor?

179
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,541
[EMPEROR] Oh? Is that
what Schneizel said?

180
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,666
[BISMARK] Yes, Your Majesty.
Do you approve?

181
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,333
[EMPEROR]
You, the Knight of One,

182
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,583
the mightiest knight of
the empire, asks me that?

183
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,125
[BISMARK] Your Majesty, war is
merely one method of diplomacy.

184
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,083
However, it's far and away
the least efficient of them.

185
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,750
Heh. Perhaps you're right.

186
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,875
War has historically been an
action favored by idiots.

187
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,791
[RESEARCHER groans]

188
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:38,041
I've finally grabbed it.
The tail of Geass!

189
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,750
And now I'll drag it
from the shadows.

190
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:45,541
I'll wipe away the stain
from Euphy's name at last!

191
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,583
[GUILFORD]
Princess... Where are you now?

192
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,666
[GINO] C'mon, Suzaku. It's
Milly's graduation event.

193
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,208
[SUZAKU] It's like I said
before. I'd really wanna go.

194
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,541
But unlike you and Anya,

195
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,916
I'm an aide to a viceroy,
so I just can't.

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,166
Meetings come first.

197
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,708
Jeez, you really need
to loosen up, my friend.

198
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,041
Say hi to my fiancé
for me, will you?

199
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,875
What? You're serious about that?

200
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,416
You should probably give her
a call after we're done here.

201
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,875
Huh?!

202
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,625
"Now" has a funny habit of
not waiting around forever.

203
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,208
Wow, what a surprise.

204
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,833
I never thought I'd hear you say
something like that, Guilford.

205
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,666
[GUILFORD]
Your rank may have changed,

206
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,541
but you did start out as
Princess Euphemia's knight.

207
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,166
As the knight of Princess
Cornelia, I'd like you to see

208
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,875
me as a source of advice that
you'll ask for when needed.

209
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,583
Well that's mature of you!

210
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,375
Anyway, can we get to the
main question at hand now?

211
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,750
It's about the Guren, which I
have taken into my care...

212
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,125
[KALLEN]
Took you long enough.

213
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,000
So, am I here for torture?
Or maybe execution?

214
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,250
Do what you want with me.

215
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,375
[NUNNALLY] I'll do nothing
like that to you.

216
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,958
It's been a such a long
time. Hello, Kallen.

217
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,833
[LELOUCH] At this rate,
it'll be impossible for me

218
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,916
to smash the world and
create a new one!

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,416
It's Cupid Day. I'm going
to end my relationship

220
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
with all the girls
at today's event.

221
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,541
[ROLO] Ah. That will leave
you free and in the clear.

222
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,541
[LELOUCH] Fortunately, we
were able to get the teachers

223
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,583
to participate in this, too.

224
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,000
Huh?

225
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,666
[LELOUCH] Villetta, you're going
to steal my hat from me.

226
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,125
But won't that just invite
weird misunderstandings?

227
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,583
I think Sayoko needs to
take responsibility here--

228
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,166
Sorry, but I can't help.

229
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,208
I have to play stand-in during
the event for Master Lelouch.

230
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,500
And we've got to make sure

231
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,166
that some strange
girl doesn't get it!

232
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,083
[VILLETTA]
Have Shirley grab the hat!

233
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,375
Yes, that's definitely
an option to consider.

234
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,000
That girl is completely
head-over-heels for you.

235
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,708
She did shoot me in order
to protect you, after all.

236
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,083
[LELOUCH]
That's why I don't want her

237
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,416
mixed up in this any further.

238
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,458
[ROLO]
Huh?

239
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,125
[MILLY]
Yes, that's right, Suzaku.

240
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,500
The rooftop garden's
finally finished.

241
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,583
Suppose I can't keep avoiding
the real world forever.

242
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,833
[SUZAKU]
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,083
I really hate missing
your graduation event.

244
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,250
[MILLY] I understand. You have
important work to do, right?

245
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,791
[SUZAKU]Um, y-yeah.

246
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,916
Then my final act for you is to
cast my special magic spell!

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,458
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

248
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:04,875
[MILLY] Relax! Ha, ha. You need
to unwind from time to time.

249
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,958
Thanks a lot Prez,
I appreciate it.

250
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,416
[MILLY]
See ya!

251
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,166
Now let's get this
show on the road.

252
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,958
[MILLY] Attention everyone!
This is Milly Ashford speaking

253
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,041
for the last time as student
council president!

254
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,291
My graduation event, Cupid
Day, is about to begin!

255
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,166
Oh, and before you start,

256
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,666
make sure you're at least two
meters away from your target.

257
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,916
[SHIRLEY] Lulu. I don't care
how hopeless you are...

258
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,500
No!

259
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,500
Since you are utterly hopeless,
it's up to me to salvage you!

260
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,666
[RIVALZ] Prez, you don't really
want to be engaged, do you?

261
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,875
Deep down, you want me
to steal you away. Right?

262
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,125
[MILLY] You should all be
familiar with the rules.

263
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,500
If you capture your
target's hat and put it on,

264
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,041
then you have to be
boyfriend and girlfriend!

265
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,333
I won't question how
you obtain the hat.

266
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,583
You're allowed to use
teams or tools, as well.

267
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:58,208
Now, before we begin,
I'll just say one thing.

268
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,125
Any club that brings me the
hat of Lelouch Lamperouge

269
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,500
in class 3-D gets their
budget increased ten-fold!

270
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,375
[LELOUCH]
What?!

271
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,458
Lulu's hat?!

272
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,541
Prez, why?!

273
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,041
[STUDENTS shouting]

274
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,416
Tsk! This is all
a horrible dream!

275
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,750
[MILLY]
All right! Let's do it!

276
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,625
[SHIRLEY]
Lulu wait--

277
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,500
[ROLO] Stopping this many people
at once is incredibly hard work!

278
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,916
Oops. Sorry 'bout that.

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,250
Now, move.

280
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,666
He's mine! [groans]

281
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,166
--[FEMALE E] Huh?!
--[SHIRLEY] Aagh!

282
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,875
He vanished!
Where'd he go?!

283
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,000
Sorry about this.

284
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,416
Forget it. We're good.

285
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,500
[BARTLEY]
H-H-Hold on.

286
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,375
Should that theory be accurate,

287
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,791
then we're the worst
criminals in all of history!

288
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,125
[LAB WORKER A]
Let's get out of here!

289
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,750
We're through fine-tuning
Jeremiah!

290
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,750
We'd be abandoning our nation!

291
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,541
[CORNELIA]
Freeze! My dear Bartley...

292
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,500
That voice...
Princess Cornelia?!

293
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,333
Why are you here, Bartley?

294
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,125
[BARTLEY] Thank heaven
you've come! Please save us!

295
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,583
[CORNELIA]
Hm?

296
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,250
[BARTLEY] We were ordered
to be here. By the emperor.

297
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,291
My father?

298
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,541
[BARTLEY]
The world is racing

299
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,208
down the path
towards destruction!

300
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,541
[CORNELIA]
Uh?!

301
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,333
[GINO laughs]

302
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,000
[GINO]
Follow me, ladies!

303
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,708
[GIRLS]
Lord Gino!

304
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,291
[LELOUCH]
I see.

305
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,250
It appears that Gino did come to
this school just to play around.

306
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,666
Anya seems suspicious
about my true identity,

307
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,916
but not enough to
prove troublesome.

308
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,625
The matter of the Knights of
the Round has been cleared.

309
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,000
Now, I've only to switch
places with Sayoko

310
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,666
and have her play along
with the Prez...

311
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,250
[MIYA] I did it! Now I get
to be Lelouch's girlfriend!

312
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,791
Of course.

313
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,666
Miya, right?

314
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,250
What's up, honey bunch?

315
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,666
[LELOUCH] Would you mind very
much... giving me that hat back?

316
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,708
[MIYA]
Okay.

317
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,541
So where should we switch?

318
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,291
Here will do.

319
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,708
Very well, then.

320
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,375
[MIYA] Hm? Whoa, now I'm
more confused than usual.

321
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,666
What am I doing here?

322
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,708
[MILLY]
Huh? Lelouch is gone?

323
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,291
[UNDERLING] Yeah, according
to the gardening club.

324
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,416
[RUGBY GUY]
Rugy team here!

325
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,958
Lelouch has been spotted
at point KT-01!

326
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,458
Yes...!

327
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,625
Alert all Ashford Academy club
members! Surround Lelouch

328
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,958
between the boy's dorms
and the central courtyard!

329
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,208
[RUGBY TEAM]
Sir! Yes, sir!

330
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,458
[SAYOKO]
Hm? Agh!

331
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,666
The rugby team's getting
that budget bonus, pal!

332
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,625
GO...!

333
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,625
[RUGBY TEAM yells]

334
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,416
[SAYOKO grunts]

335
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,208
[RUGBY GUY]
Huh?!

336
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:41,958
[SAYOKO]
Fair thee well!

337
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,250
Huh?

338
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,833
[LELOUCH] Sayoko!
Watch what you have me say!

339
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,416
Or I'll come off as
being kind of mental.

340
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,458
[SAYOKO]
Sorry, it was involuntary.

341
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,625
[LELOUCH] Just be careful.
And don't go to the rear gate.

342
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,916
Villetta's standing by there.

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,500
[SAYOKO]
Understood.

344
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,625
Lelouch is more
physical than normal.

345
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,291
[SAYOKO] I would like to let
you catch me, Miss Milly,

346
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,041
but at the moment...

347
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,750
Archery and equestrian clubs,
from the side of hall,

348
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,125
you can surround him!

349
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,333
Go on around the school
buildings to gym number two.

350
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:12,666
The science club will probably
be positioned dead ahead.

351
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,958
[SCIENCE CLUB A]
Fire!

352
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,791
[SCIENCE CLUB B]
No way!

353
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,416
Lelouch can't do
stuff like that!

354
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,666
[ROLO] If this keeps up, he
won't need my help after all.

355
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,333
[LELOUCH] Sayoko's overdoing it,
but that's how she operates.

356
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,458
There's no point
ordering her to stop.

357
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,708
Oh, well, she can take my place
in phys. ed from here on.

358
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,500
Glamour squad, move in!

359
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,375
[GLAMOUR GIRL A] After all,
Lelouch is a warm-blooded male.

360
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,500
[GLAMOUR GIRL B]
Yeah, we'll catch him off guard.

361
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,750
[SAYOKO] Using your bodies
against me is useless!

362
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:44,625
[GLAMOUR GIRLS]
Huh...?!

363
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,000
Wow, I'm sort of in shock!

364
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:46,833
[MALE STUDENT]
Where's Lelouch?!

365
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:47,833
[FEMALE D]
Where'd he go?!

366
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,750
[FEMALE B]
Nobody's caught him yet!

367
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:49,875
[MILLY]
Attention, all students!

368
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,208
If Vice President
Lelouch is spotted,

369
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,708
commence a simultaneous...

370
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,166
[SHIRLEY] Oh boy, the Prez is
in full-scale "play" mode.

371
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,583
Still... what's going on?

372
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,583
I thought Lulu was
completely hopeless

373
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:03,166
but now I'm finding out
he's a super athlete.

374
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,416
[STUDENT B]
Hey look, it's Shirley!

375
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,791
[FEMALE D]
We have to catch Lelouch!

376
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,250
[RIVALZ] Prez! If Lelouch
is who you want,

377
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,791
then I, Rivalz Cardemonde,

378
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,916
will give you what you want!
My best friend in the world!

379
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,250
Uh. Huh? Whoa, that
can't be for real...!

380
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,708
It is.

381
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,708
[SUZAKU] The Mordred's
just been launched?!

382
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,250
[GUILFORD]
It's the Black Knights then?!

383
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,750
[ANNOUNCER] Emergency dispatch
from the government bureau!

384
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,541
Defcon 2! Defcon 2!

385
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,666
A riot has erupted in
the school district!

386
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,250
Knight police SWAT unit,
prepare to move out!

387
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,333
[LELOUCH] Uh! I should have
guessed that Anya doesn't

388
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,958
possess a grain of
common sense, either!

389
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:43,333
Take the operation into final
phase! Sayoko, to the library!

390
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,666
Oh, there.

391
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,416
Hm...

392
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,791
This is the spot where
Lulu was acting strange.

393
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,500
I wonder...

394
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,500
[SAYOKO]
Shirley... Why now all times?

395
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,166
[ANYA]
Heat sources. Two places.

396
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,083
But which one is Lelouch?

397
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,125
[SHIRLEY]
Hm?

398
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,625
[gasps]

399
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,250
Watch out!

400
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:12,958
[LELOUCH grunts]

401
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,000
[SHIRLEY screams]

402
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,750
Twin Lelouches?

403
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,708
[VILLETTA]
Knight of Six, my lady!

404
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,583
This is an operations
area of the O.S.I.!

405
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,375
Please, withdraw your
Knightmare at once!

406
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,958
[ANYA]
This is wrong?

407
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,208
[VILLETTA]
Yes, very wrong.

408
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,666
[ANYA]
Wrong.

409
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,708
[SHIRLEY]
Say, Lulu...

410
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,333
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

411
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,458
[SHIRLEY]
Why did you kiss me before?

412
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,375
Well, um, because...

413
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,750
...I like you.

414
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,291
[SHIRLEY] That's a lie,
I know you aren't serious.

415
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,041
Wrong!

416
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,000
[SHIRLEY]
Uh?

417
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,958
[LELOUCH]
I mean... I just...

418
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,208
A good question.

419
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,291
[SHIRLEY laughs]

420
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,583
So, you wanna do
more than just kiss?

421
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,708
Huh?!

422
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:58,000
It's okay, even if
you're not serious.

423
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,250
Uh! You shouldn't
speak that way!

424
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,125
Welcome back, Lulu.

425
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,541
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

426
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,166
[SHIRLEY] You haven't been
yourself lately, you know.

427
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,500
[SHIRLEY]
It's okay. I forgive you.

428
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,416
In return, close
your eyes for me.

429
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,291
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

430
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,125
[SHIRLEY]
Hurry up.

431
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,833
[LELOUCH]
O-Okay.

432
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,000
[LELOUCH grunts]

433
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,125
You thought I was gonna
give you a smooch?

434
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:45,541
Um, well, ya know... I thought
there was a possibility...

435
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,750
Oh, you dirty boy!

436
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,916
[LELOUCH]
No, it's just...!

437
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,333
Even so, I wanna
try and make you

438
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,000
fall in love with me
for real, some day.

439
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,041
[LELOUCH]
Uh...

440
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,916
I told you.
I said love is power.

441
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,791
I can see you guys still have
a lot to learn around here,

442
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,791
don't you?

443
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,500
This is a school for commoners.

444
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,333
Things like this take
place all the time!

445
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,750
[STUDENT C]
Look at that!

446
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:15,125
[FEMALE F] How disappointing,
but I'm not surprised.

447
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,250
I guess that's
the end of game.

448
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,458
Butit might have meant little
more this time around.

449
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,541
[MILLY]
Huh?

450
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,958
Yeah. Maybe It did...

451
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,500
...a bit.

452
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,625
What in the world was
all that uproar about?

453
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,041
Sorry, sir.

454
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,916
It looks like it was the
president's graduation event.

455
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,750
[VILLETTA]
It's unusual to say the least

456
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,416
that he would change
plans like that.

457
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,375
[ANYA]
Changed plans?

458
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,791
Uh, I meant she.

459
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:46,416
Shirley's plan apparently
worked out quite well.

460
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,708
[MILLY]
Lelouch!

461
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,000
Looks like you
finally understand.

462
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:50,875
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

463
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,041
You mean you did this for us?

464
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,333
Cause you two really
wear on my patience.

465
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,166
Don't ever hesitate, your
student days coming to an end.

466
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,458
Uh! Prez, are... you
really graduating?

467
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,500
[MILLY]
Mm-hm!

468
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,000
Hey, Prez!

469
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,375
What is it?

470
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,041
Thank you for everything
you've done here at school.

471
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,375
Uh.

472
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,625
[FEMALE D] The last three
years were so much fun!

473
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,166
[FEMALE C] You were
the best president ever!

474
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,000
[FEMALE B]
Thank you!

475
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,541
[SUZAKU]
Madame president!

476
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,166
Congratulations on
graduating from Ashford.

477
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,000
[MILLY]
Mm-hm. And with that,

478
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,416
this girl is no longer
avoiding real world!

479
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,916
[STUDENTS cheer]

480
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,708
Hello, everyone! How are you?

481
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,458
My name's Milly Ashford!

482
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,958
Beginning today, I'll
be your go-to-girl

483
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,666
for weather information
here on the weather corner!

484
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,250
Let's start with an update...

485
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,708
[RIVALZ] From student council
president to a weather reporter.

486
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,208
[ROLO]
How'd she qualify?

487
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,958
I heard she chose a talent
agency while still in school.

488
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,208
[GINO]
Hmm...

489
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,625
[ANYA]
She's from nobility.

490
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,750
[RIVALZ]
She said she never likes

491
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,500
to do anything halfway, so...

492
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,416
[ROLO] Then why'd she
call off her engagement?

493
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,666
Did she have to?

494
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,708
[GINO] Wow, Lloyd must
be in a state of shock!

495
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:55,208
[laughs] Just what I'd expect
from my former fiance.

496
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,250
Lloyd doesn't seem
upset about it.

497
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,791
It's all bravado.

498
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:03,083
No, the man never wanted to
get married in the first place.

499
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,375
[MILLY]
You see, Nina?

500
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,166
I'm trying to face
who I really am.

501
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,250
[SHIRLEY]
Yeah, I saw her on TV.

502
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,833
Typical Prez, huh?

503
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,291
So, what do you think we ought
to do with the rooftop garden?

504
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,125
Right. Well then, I'll bring
back some herb seedlings

505
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,750
from the store.
Would you talk

506
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,375
to the gardening club, Lulu?
Okay, see ya later!

507
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,041

Huh?!

508
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,125
[V.V.] This is the
eighth area, correct?

509
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,916
[JEREMIAH] Yes. But the people
who were affected by the Geass

510
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,333
power have been deployed as
secret police, haven't they?

511
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,166
We don't know, so we're
cleaning up the situation.

512
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,166
You've been given
a Geass Canceller,

513
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,458
which can destroy all types
of Geass power. Therefore...

514
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,875
Yes, I understand.

515
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,416
We don't know who's under
the influence of Geass.

516
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,541
However, once I'm done
with Ashford Academy,

517
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,416
I'll take care of old
business with Lelouch.

518
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,125
[SHIRLEY]
I'm remembering now...

519
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:17,541
I remember Zero, and the
one who killed my father...

520
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,875
It's Lelouch!

521
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,625
[LELOUCH] I must give
Japan its independence.

522
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,041
And at the same time,

523
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,333
I have to put together a
dating itinerary with Shirley.

524
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,250
There are 18
hypothetical routes.

525
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,208
I've set up a way
for C.C. and Kaguya

526
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,916
to send me emergency messages.
I may even get the chance

527
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,166
to work out rescue
preparations for Kallen.

528
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,541
But I have no idea
what Shirley will like.

529
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,791
What should I do? Is there
someone I can consult?

530
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,666
I get the feeling that I'm going
to make the wrong choices again.

531
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,875
That worries me to no end!
