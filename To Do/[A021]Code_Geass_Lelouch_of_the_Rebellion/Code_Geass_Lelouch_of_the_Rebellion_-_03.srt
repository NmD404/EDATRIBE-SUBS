1
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,500
[NARRATOR]
The date was August 10

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,583
in the year 2010 of
the Imperial calendar.

3
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:28,500
The Holy Britannian Empire had
just declared war upon Japan.

4
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,791
Confronted by Britannia's
newest weapon,

5
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,625
the formidable Knightmare Frame,

6
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,541
Japan fell to its enemy
in less than a month.

7
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:36,958
The conquered
nation was stripped

8
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,333
of its freedom, rights,
culture, and dignity.

9
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,333
Finally, even its
name was taken away.

10
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:44,916
Eleven.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,791
The name of Japan and its people
was replaced with a mere number.

12
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,166
[JERIMIAH] Why the hell are
we letting the Elevens go?!

13
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,750
What about the poison
gas they've stolen?!

14
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,208
[OFFICER] But it's by
order of Prince Clovis!

15
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,416
[JERIMIAH]
What about Bartley?!

16
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,958
Get the general
staff on the line!

17
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,750
[OFFICER]
They're not at their posts, sir.

18
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,750
[JERIMIAH]
Are you telling me

19
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,250
Prince Clovis is
alone on the con?!

20
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,791
I'm overjoyed, Lelouch.

21
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,208
They said you died when Japan
was brought into the fold.

22
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,125
What a blessing
to have you back.

23
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,000
We should depart for
the Homeland immediately.

24
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,583
[LELOUCH] So you can use
me as a tool of diplomacy?

25
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,333
It seems you've forgotten
why we were used

26
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,500
as tools in the first place.

27
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,208
That's right.

28
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,875
It was because my
mother was killed.

29
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,750
[LELOUCH] Mother held the
title of Knight of Honour,

30
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,833
but was a commoner by birth.

31
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:17,958
No doubt the other imperial
consorts held her in contempt.

32
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,958
[LELOUCH] Even though
you made it look like

33
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,583
the work of terrorists,
I'm no fool...

34
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,583
You people killed my mother!

35
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,375
[CLOVIS] It wasn't me!
I swear to you, it wasn't!

36
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,666
Then tell me
everything you know.

37
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,583
The truth cannot be hidden
from me any longer.

38
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,083
By whose hand was she slain?

39
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,375
My brother, second
prince Schneizel,

40
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:52,000
and second princess Cornelia,
they can tell you...

41
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,083
They were at the heart of this?

42
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,083
[LELOUCH] That's all that
you know, isn't it?

43
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,291
[gasps]

44
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,000
[CLOVIS yelps]

45
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,500
I swear it wasn't me!

46
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,250
I had... nothing to do with it!

47
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,958
I believe you.

48
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,541
However...

49
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,125
Please, you can't!

50
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,666
We may have different mothers,
but you and I are still blood!

51
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,083
[LELOUCH]
You can't change the world

52
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,916
without getting
your hands dirty...

53
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,333
[MILLY]
Wake up, Lelouch!

54
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,916
I know you were sleeping,
your hand stopped moving!

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,333
Well ya don't have ta
beat me up over it, do you?

56
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,583
Ahh, serves ya right
for ditchin' me like that.

57
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,083
That's right. What was
up with you yesterday?

58
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,500
Oh, well...

59
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,791
That's enough you guys.
Let's not get sidetracked here.

60
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,625
If we don't come up with a fix
for the club activities budget,

61
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,000
there won't be money left
for anything at all.

62
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,708
And if it comes to that point...

63
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,833
The Equestrian Club'll
be pissed!

64
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,250
We don't want 'em comin'
in here on horseback!

65
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,333
Rivalz, can't you be a more
serious student council member?

66
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,916
You know, it woulda
been nice of you

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,541
if you would've reminded us
about this mess a day ago.

68
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,458
I would have to say a day later,
then we would've given up.

69
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,500
Good idea, we can
still do that.

70
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,625
Guts!

71
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,250
[ALL groan]

72
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,416
Are you tryin' that
"guts" spell again?

73
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,875
Yup. I want you people to start
putting your all into this.

74
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,583
I really don't think that your
magic's gonna do a whole lot.

75
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,083
Actually, it's got me
going, Madame President!

76
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,125
[MILLY] Supple and willing,
that's what I like.

77
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,291
I train hard in
the gymnastics club!

78
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,166
That's not what
I was getting at.

79
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,208
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

80
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,041
You're a ten.

81
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,583
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

82
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,875
[MILLY] From what I've seen
in the girl's bathroom anyway.

83
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,458
You've been filling out in
all the right places, huh?

84
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,625
[RIVALZ chuckles]

85
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,625
Wh-What are you
talking about, you perv?

86
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,000
Jeez, our president's just a
dirty old man on the inside.

87
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,458
Sullying the meeting
with her filthy mind.

88
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,166
[NINA] Yeah, well,
that's Milly for you.

89
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,500
[RIVALZ chuckles]

90
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,875
[RIVALZ]
Look on the bright side,

91
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,208
we got the budget
balanced, didn't we?

92
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,541
[MALE STUDENT A]
They used poison gas?!

93
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,708
[ALL]
Huh?

94
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,041
[MALE STUDENT B]
Man, that's freaky!

95
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,000
Shinjuku's only 30
minutes from here!

96
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,083
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Oh my god,

97
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,458
I saw smoke rising
over in Shinjuku!

98
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,333
It musta been the gas.

99
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,500
[MALE STUDENT C] Are they
saying anything else about it?

100
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,000
Shinjuku?

101
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,791
I heard about it in
real time from a friend.

102
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,416
That's why I called
you yesterday.

103
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,666
[MALE STUDENT D]
Hey!

104
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,041
Check out the footage
of those dead Elevens!

105
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,958
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
Uh! Don't look at that!

106
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,625
[LELOUCH] This is strange...
Why would they cover it up?

107
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,083
[gunshot]

108
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,375
[LELOUCH]
Are they hiding Clovis's death

109
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,000
to fend off anarchy?

110
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,416
But if that's the case, when
they finally do announce it...

111
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,041
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

112
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,000
I guess that I'm not as
tough as I thought I was.

113
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,000
That ex-civil servant
is such a fool.

114
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,916
So, are you referring
to Bartley?

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,333
The killer has breached our
heaviest security twice already.

116
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,666
This perfunctory
inspection is a farce.

117
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,458
Margrave Jeremiah.

118
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:06,041
Now that Prince Clovis is out
of the way, we purebloods can--

119
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,083
Let me make that call.

120
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,500
We still need to
woo everyone over.

121
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,375
[LONG WAVY HAIR GIRL]
Kallen! It's been ages!

122
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,916
[PIXIE CUT GIRL]
Are you all right?!

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,833
[PONY TAIL GIRL] Sophie's been
worried sick all this time.

124
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,458
[PIG TAILS GIRL]
You're okay though, right?

125
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,666
Yeah. I just have to go
easy for a little while.

126
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,333
[LELOUCH]
Of course...

127
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,458
That's why she's so familiar...

128
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,750
Anyway, if I stay home any
longer, I'll never catch up.

129
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,500
What's up, buddy?
See something you like?

130
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,083
You've got a thing
for her, don'tcha?

131
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,583
[LELOUCH] Just thinking
this is a rare event.

132
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,291
She hasn't been here at school
since this whole term started.

133
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,416
[ALL giggling]

134
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,083
[RIVALZ]
Kallen Stadtfeld.

135
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,041
[RIVALZ] They say
she's sick or something.

136
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,500
And she barely showed up
school last year, either.

137
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,750
Still, her grades are
at the top of the class.

138
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,041
And she's a member of
the Stadtfeld family,

139
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,791
which means she's well-bred
and rolling in money!

140
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,500
Man, you sure know
how to pick 'em!

141
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,541
[LELOUCH]
It's not like that.

142
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,208
[RIVALZ]
Ah, ya don't hafta hide it.

143
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,958
A touch too sheltered,
though, if ya ask me.

144
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,083
[GIRLS screaming]

145
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,541
[PIG TAILS GIRL]
There's a bee! A bee!

146
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,791
[KALLEN]
Huh?

147
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,541
[LONG WAVY HAIR GIRL]
Oh my god, Kallen! Run!

148
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,833
[GIRLS screaming]

149
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,125
[LONG WAVY HAIR GIRL]
Hurry up and run!

[GIRLS screaming]

151
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,166
I don't get it.
Why's a bee after me?

152
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,750
I wonder if there's
a hive nearby.

153
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,458
God, I hate this!

154
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,458
I'm sick of acting
like a freaking invalid!

155
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,083
[KALLEN]
Crap! He saw me!

156
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,166
[LELOUCH]
There's no question it's her...

157
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,125
Can... can I help
you with something?

158
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,791
[LELOUCH]
I want answers.

159
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,333
[KALLEN]
Of course.

160
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,250
Were you the one piloting
the Glasgow in Shinjuku?

161
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,166
Yes.

162
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,291
Why terrorism?

163
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,458
Because I'm Japanese.

164
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,708
Though technically
I'm half Britannian.

165
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,083
[gasps] Half blood?

166
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,416
But why go so far?

167
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,208
[gasps]

168
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,583
Um... Did you want something?

169
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,666
No. I got what
I wanted here.

170
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,041
Oh wait. Just to be sure...

171
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,250
Don't tell anyone
about Shinjuku.

172
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,291
[KALLEN]
Uh?

173
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,291
What do you mean
"about Shinjuku"?

174
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,208
[gasps]

175
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,791
[KALLEN]
Why would you say that?

176
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,125
Go back to class.

177
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,916
As soon as I get an answer
to my question, I will!

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,958
[LELOUCH] It's not working?
What's going on here?

179
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,958
[SHIRLEY]
Hey, Lelou! Kallen!

180
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,541
You know it's time to
head over to the Chem. Lab!

181
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,208
You better get a move on!

182
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,333
Ah, crap, it's my turn
to set up for class!

183
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,916
[LELOUCH]
It didn't work? But...

184
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,416
[SAYOKO]
Well, what shall we do?

185
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,125
He may be late
again this evening.

186
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:05,208
I'll wait. He said that we'd
have dinner together tonight.

187
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,250
There now. This one's finished.

188
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,291
[NUNNALLY]
Uh?

189
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,250
A bird?

190
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,875
Yes. It's a crane.

191
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,750
Amazing. The Japanese
are so skillful!

192
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,041
Lady Nunnally?

193
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,083
Uh?

194
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,083
I'm sorry I'm so late.

195
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,250
Hi, Lelouche. Welcome home.

196
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,500
Yes, welcome home, my lord.

197
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:37,416
No place like it, Sayoko.
Right, Nunnally?

198
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,125
[BARTLEY]
As you know full well,

199
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,625
the project was
a complete failure.

200
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,250
Therefore, this research
division is being gutted.

201
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,583
--[RESEARCHER 1] Wha--?!
--[RESEARCHER 2] Yes, but--

202
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,875
[BARTLEY] I've set up
a place in Narita for you.

203
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,708
Move everything out there.

204
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,416
While we may have
no memory of it,

205
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,375
the fact is, the other
staff officers and I

206
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,208
left Prince Clovis on his own.

207
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,666
I'm gonna be called
out on the carpet

208
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,083
for this back at home.

209
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,291
When that happens...

210
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,291
If His Majesty learns
this experiment's...

211
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,208
...gone on without his
knowledge... I...

212
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,250
[RESEARCHER 2]
Understood, sir!

213
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,125
We'll start prepping,
immediately!

214
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,166
[NUNNALLY]
Miss Sayoko was just teaching me

215
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,333
about the art of origami.

216
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,208
Fold a piece of paper
the correct way

217
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,458
and you can make birds,
boats, almost anything!

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,333
Uh, easy there,

219
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,166
you don't have to tell me
everything all at once,

220
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,166
you know.

221
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,000
It's not like I'm
going anywhere.

222
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,250
Yeah, you're right. Thank you.

223
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,583
You're very welcome.

224
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,458
[NUNNALLY chuckles]

225
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,041
[NUNNALLY]
I'm so happy!

226
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,375
'Cause last night,
you scared me a little.

227
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,166
Did I? Sorry, I just have
a lot on my mind is all...

228
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,041
[NUNNALLY]
Hey.

229
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,375
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

230
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,583
They say if you fold a
thousand of these cranes,

231
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,166
your wish'll come true.

232
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,041
So if there's anything at all
that you've been wishing for.

233
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,833
No. Not really.

234
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,583
What about you? Do you
wish for anything?

235
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,250
[NUNNALLY]
Hmm...

236
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,666
I wish the world
was a gentler place.

237
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,125
When the day finally comes
that you can see again,

238
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,125
I'm sure that it will be.

239
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,291
[NUNNALLY]
Really?

240
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,791
[LELOUCH]
I promise.

241
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,208
[LELOUCH]
The truth is...

242
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,250
...there are very few paths
our future can take.

243
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,958
The Ashford family's
sheltering us for now.

244
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,916
But how long can that last?

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If our identity is exposed,

246
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,375
even Rivalz, Shirley, and
the others will abandon us.

247
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,916
We'll end up political tools,
or a casualty of royal ambition.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,208
I have to build a world

249
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,166
where Nunnally can at
least find happiness.

250
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,875
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

251
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,916
Sayako taught me
this the other day.

252
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's called a Japanese promise.

253
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,791
♪ Cross my heart,
hope to die, ♪

254
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,333
♪ eat a thousand
needles if I lie. ♪

255
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,208
♪ Pinky promise song! ♪

256
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,458
[giggles]

257
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,750
Well, that's scary.

258
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,083
I may have to eat a
thousand needles someday!

259
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,333
That's right.

260
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,458
So I better not catch
you telling lies, okay?

261
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,791
Don't you worry.

262
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,583
I'll never lie, I swear.

263
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,750
[LELOUCH]
Not to you, anyway.

264
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,791
[LELOUCH]
This is the only weapon I have.

265
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,083
And I don't even
know how to use it.

266
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:15,750
[MALE TEACHER]
Lelouch!

267
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,208
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

268
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,458
Class'll be starting
any minute, you know.

269
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,166
[LELOUCH]
Oh, yes, sir.

270
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,125
Um, sir?

271
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,125
What are the topics gonna be for
the essays on your next exam?

272
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,791
The Humiliation of Edinburgh,

273
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,375
the transfer of the Capital,
and north 'n south war topics.

274
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,583
[LELOUCH] So. I haven't
lost the power then.

275
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,541
[LELOUCH]
Sir?

276
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,750
[MALE TEACHER]
Hm?

277
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,458
What exactly are
the topics gonna be

278
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,083
for the essays
on your next exam?

279
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,416
Right, very funny. Maybe you
should try studying, huh?

280
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,625
Just apply yourself,
you'll do fine.

281
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,500
Yes, sir.

282
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,958
[LELOUCH]
As I suspected...

283
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,625
...I can only use it
on a person once.

284
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,083
[OHGI] So, how's campus
life treatin' ya?

285
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,166
[KALLEN]
Stifling.

286
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,666
I was stuck in history
class yesterday.

287
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,125
Look, maybe I should
just head back.

288
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,208
[OHGI] The army's on
a high alert right now.

289
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,750
Stay there and
let things cool off.

290
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,208
[KALLEN] But what about
the voice on the radio?

291
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:14,041
[OHGI] Can't go lookin'
for a voice. Besides...

292
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,541
...Naoto would be happy
to see ya back in school.

293
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:22,208
Forget about Shinjuku
for now. I'll be in touch.

294
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,416
[KALLEN] Shinjuku...
I guess he's right, but--

295
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,708
[gasps]

296
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,666
Don't tell anyone
about Shinjuku.

297
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,500
[KALLEN] No, it couldn't
have his been his voice.

298
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,625
[LELOUCH] The aristocracy
was highly educated.

299
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,125
With such an emphasis on
edification and training,

300
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,583
they produced a superior
breed of ruler.

301
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,416
And secondly, they possessed
heightened efficiency.

302
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,250
Since only a...

303
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,458
[KALLEN]
It... could be...

304
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,750
No. I can't remember
well enough to be sure...

305
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,000
Good. That will do.

306
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,041
With the enthronement
of Henry the 9th,

307
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,291
son of the great
Elizabeth the 1st,

00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,208
the golden age of
the Tudor dynasty...

309
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,958
[LELOUCH] All I did was
simply mention Shinjuku...

310
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,291
But...

311
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,875
[KALLEN] If he knows who
I really am, then...

312
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,708
[LELOUCH]
At the first opportunity...

313
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,916
[KALLEN]
I need to take care of him.

314
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,583
[BARTLEY]
And the research center?

[SOLDIER 1] Transferred
to Narita last night.

316
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,166
[BARTLEY]
Right then.

I pray you forgive me,

00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,166
[PONY TAIL GIRL] Why don't we
all go for out for some tea?

319
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,500
[GIRL B]
Kallen, you should join us.

320
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,375
[GIRL A]
Yeah, tag along.

321
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,208
Hey, Lelou. You comin' along?

322
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,291
Sorry, maybe some other time.

323
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,333
[KALLEN]
Maybe I can.

324
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,583
Yeah, I thought so.

325
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,625
You've gotta go
straight home then, huh?

326
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,208
What do you have,
a curfew? Huh?

327
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:34,875
[GIRLS]
Hm?

328
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,041
What's up?

329
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,333
You think that you could spare a
minute? I need to talk to you.

330
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:41,958
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?!

331
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,125
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,500
[KALLEN]
Sure.

333
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,291
I was wondering when
you were gonna ask.

334
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:47,916
Huh?!

335
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,666
[GIRLS squealing]

336
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,083
[JEREMIAH] I hope you can see
how determined we are now!

337
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,916
But... I've already told you!

00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,375
[JEREMIAH]
That you don't remember?

Still clinging to that
ridiculous excuse?

00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,625
Just ask the others!
They'll testify that--!

341
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,916
Ducking the blame?
You're pathetic!

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,541
You shant remain at his royal
Highness's side another minute!

343
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,000
[KALLEN] I didn't even
know this room existed.

344
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,333
[LELOUCH] It's the club house
for the student council.

345
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:19,208
They built it as a ballroom
for various special occasions.

346
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,250
And we won't be
disturbed inside here?

347
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,375
Yes, that's correct.

348
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,250
[SHIRLEY]
Here it is!

349
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,333
I found it! Look!
This is it, right?

350
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,291
Ah! What a relief you
found our lab data!

351
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,500
[RIVALZ]
Ugh, good.

352
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,500
My ass is killin' me...

353
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,416
Were you able to find it?

354
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
I finished up on my end,
shall we dig in?

355
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,458
Aww, wow!

356
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,000
Way to go, Milly!

357
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,333
[MILLY chuckles]

358
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,291
[MILLY]
You adore me, I know.

359
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,291
Um... what is all of this?

360
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,583
Lelouch, don't you know?

361
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,250
I thought that's why
you brought her.

362
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,875
We're inducting Kallen
into the student council.

363
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,916
It was my grandfather's
idea, actually.

364
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,083
The principal's?

365
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,666
He thought it best
with her poor health.

366
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,458
She'd have a harder time
with regular club activities.

367
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,958
Oh! I'm Milly, the
president of the council.

368
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,333
Pleasure to meet you.

369
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh. Thank you, the
pleasure's all mine.

370
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm Rivalz, the secretary!

371
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,000
If there's anything you need
help with, I'm your man!

372
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,208
Hi, I'm Shirley.

373
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,500
And I'm a member of
the swim club. Welcome.

374
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,958
Um. Hi there. My name's Nina.

375
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,000
[KALLEN] It's...
nice to meet all of you..

376
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,083
[NUNNALLY]
Shirley? I'm sorry, but...

377
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,583
...do you think you could set
these on the table for me?

378
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,125
Oh, sure, thanks, Nunna!

379
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,041
Nunnally, what're
you doing here?

380
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,625
This is Lelouch's sister.

381
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,333
I'm still in the
middle school group,

382
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,500
so I can't be on
the council yet.

383
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,791
That's all right, you're an
honorary member in our book.

384
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,166
[NINA]
Mh-hm.

385
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,375
Hello, there. It's a pleasure
to meet you, Kallen.

386
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,375
Thank you. You as well.

387
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,125
[RIVALZ] Right! Shall we kick
this off with a toast?

388
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,541
--[MILLY] Huh?
--Champagne??

389
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,791
Yeah, but we're on the
student council, we shouldn't!

390
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,958
Ah, c'mon, loosen
up, you guys!

391
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,208
No way! We're gonna
get in trouble!

392
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,791
What's going on?

393
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,125
Here, Nunnally.

394
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,416
Lelouch, heads up!

395
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,833
[SHIRLEY] You're not getting
away with this either, Lelou!

396
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,416
What just happened?

397
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,791
[MILLY]
We have clothes for her?

398
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,625
[SHIRLEY]
Sayoko's on it.

399
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,333
This is why I hate
Britannians...

400
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,000
[knocking]

401
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,291
[gasps]

402
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,291
[LELOUCH]
It's Lelouch.

403
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,208
I brought you a
change of clothes.

404
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,416
[KALLEN] You can come in.
I've drawn the curtain already.

405
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,416
[LELOUCH]
Uh... sorry about all this.

406
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,625
I know they can be
a little over the top.

407
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,250
[KALLEN]
That's okay.

408
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,666
Nothin' wrong with cutting loose
every once in a while, ya know?

409
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,166
[LELOUCH] These are some of
my clothes, hope that's okay.

410
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,583
It's cool. Don't worry 'bout it.

411
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:52,208
That was fast. You went all
the way to the boy's dorm?

412
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,875
[LELOUCH]
Actually, I live here.

413
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,375
[KALLEN]
Uh?

414
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,458
It'd be pretty hard for my
sister to live off in the dorms.

415
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,500
The principal of the school
lets us stay here, as a favor.

416
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,958
I see.

417
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:03,958
[LELOUCH]
Anyway...

418
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,333
Hey, wait!

419
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,291
[KALLEN] Can you hand me
that pouch over there?

420
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,416
[LELOUCH]
Sure.

421
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,208
You really are a
livewire, aren't you?

422
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,166
Were you the one in Shinjuku?

423
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,958
What do you mean?

424
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,166
[KALLEN]
Don't play dumb!

425
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,666
You brought up Shinjuku
the other day. Why?

426
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,458
Why do you ask, is there
something wrong with Shinjuku?

427
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,041
Don't answer my question
with a question!

428
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,833
Yes or no. That's all
I wanna hear outta you.

429
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,916
[phone ringing]

430
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,750
[LELOUCH] If I don't answer
it, someone'll come.

431
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,833
That okay?

432
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,541
Hello? Ashford Academy
student council.

433
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,083
Uh. No, this is... oh...

434
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,291
It's for you.

435
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,125
He says he knows you.

436
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,041
Hello?

437
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,083
[LELOUCH'S VOICE]
Glad you're still alive... Q-1.

438
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,250
[gasps]

439
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
[KALLEN]
Was I wrong?

440
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,666
[LELOUCH'S VOICE]
Sixteen hundred hours,

441
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,125
the day after tomorrow.

442
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,958
The observation deck at
Tokyo Tower. Come alone.

443
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,291
Who are you?!

444
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,666
How did you arrange
that cease-fire order?!

445
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,958
Uh! Hey! Don't hang up!

446
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,625
[LELOUCH]
Did you say "cease-fire"?

447
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,875
Sounds like you keep
dangerous company.

448
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,708
Oh, uh... that was...

449
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,750
[LELOUCH]
Let me guess...

450
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,291
You're talkin' about
a game? Something online?

451
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,500
Uh, yeah! You got
me. 'Cause, ya know...

452
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,583
...I've been shut up
in my house so long...

453
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,750
That's what I was
warning you about,

454
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,333
when I told you not to
bring up Shinjuku before.

455
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,625
Seriously, some guys'll
try to show you footage

456
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,500
of what happened that day,
and it's pretty damn grim.

457
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,541
By the way... you know
I can see you, right?

458
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,583
[KALLEN gasps]

459
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,958
[KALLEN yelps]

460
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,333
[LELOUCH]
Um, I won't tell anyone! Later!

461
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,666
I was wrong...

462
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,583
[LELOUCH'S VOICE]
Glad you're still alive... Q-1.

463
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,625
[gasps]

464
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:30,666
[SAYOKO]
Huh?

465
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,916
[LELOUCH] The council doesn't
require much actual work,

466
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,750
I guess.

467
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,166
Beyond occasional paperwork,

468
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,875
we'll sometimes
plan school events.

469
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,291
[KALLEN] So, you mean,
like the Culture Festival?

470
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,333
[LELOUCH]
Yup, like that,

471
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,708
along with the Cross
Dresser's Ball,

472
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,166
the Absolute Silence Party,
and Swimsuit Day.

473
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,333
What's up with that?

474
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,166
Blame our president.

475
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,958
You'll be spending a lotta time
with her. Hope you're ready.

476
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,458
[NUNNALLY]
Lelouch, it's awful!

477
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,708
[LELOUCH]
What is?

478
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,583
Prince Clovis has
been found dead!

479
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,083
They're saying he was killed.

480
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,166
[BOTH gasp]

481
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,500
Prince Clovis has
been taken from us.

482
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,291
He fought for peace and justice
against all of the Elevens!

483
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,291
He died a martyr!

484
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,625
We must all bury our sorrow.

485
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,666
And carry on his will.

486
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,958
[NEWS ANCHOR]
We interrupt this broadcast

487
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,250
with breaking news.

488
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,708
The man suspected as the
murderer has been captured.

489
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,333
According to this report,

490
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,875
the suspect is an
honorary Britannian.

491
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:24,958
What the--?!

492
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,708
[NEWS ANCHOR]
Private Suzaku Kururugi.

493
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,458
A former Eleven and
Honorary Britannian.

494
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:33,583
I repeat, Suzaku Kururugi,
arrested for murder.

495
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,916
[LELOUCH] Shouldn't I
be happy at this news?

496
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,041
Suzaku is still alive!

497
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,333
But... why has he been
arrested in my place?

498
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:17,083
I have to save him...
I don't care what it takes!

499
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,583
If I have to step up
my plans... so be it!

500
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,958
For I have the power to do it!
