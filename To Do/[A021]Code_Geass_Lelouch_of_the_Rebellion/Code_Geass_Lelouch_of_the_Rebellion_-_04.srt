00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,041
[NARRATOR]
Lelouch, a youth of Brittania,

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,791
had been granted
special abilities

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,666
by a mysterious girl.

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,125
Geass.

5
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:29,916
The power to command others.
To do absolutely anything.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,625
And Lelouch is determined
to use that power

7
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,541
to bring the Britannian
Empire to its knees,

8
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,166
to avenge his mother,
and create a world

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,625
where his younger sister
Nunnally can find happiness.

10
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,208
All the while knowing
at the end of his quest,

11
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,500
the Britannian Emperor,
his father, awaits.

12
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,000
Or at least.

13
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:52,458
that was the hope Lelouch
carried in his heart back then.

14
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,625
[JEREMIAH] Do you know
anything about this weapon,

15
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,333
Suzaku Kururugi?

16
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:36,166
It was the one used to rob
Prince Clovis of his life.

17
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,208
The barrel striations
leave no doubt.

18
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,000
And we've done a little
homework on you as well.

19
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,416
You're the eldest child

20
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,333
of Japan's last acting Prime
Minister, are you not?

21
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,416
Your motive here is clear.

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,708
You're making a mistake.

23
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,333
I have never even
laid eyes on that gun.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,750
We found your fingerprints
all over this weapon.

25
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,791
You're also suspected
of murdering members

26
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,083
of the royal guard.

27
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,166
Come clean now, and
you'll be judged as though

28
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,166
you were born a Britannian,
not some worthless Eleven.

29
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,041
You're wrong! I've done nothing!

30
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,958
[NUNNALLY] That was Suzaku
they mentioned on the news,

31
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,208
wasn't it?

32
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,208
[LELOUCH] Yep. It looks
like he's still alive.

33
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,625
[NUNNALLY]
Yeah.

34
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,250
It's been ages. We haven't seen
him since the war ended.

35
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,708
Even we...

36
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,250
And, Lelouch?

37
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,458
What is it?

38
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,375
It wasn't true what
the news said, was it?

39
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,958
Of course not.

40
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,333
Suzaku would never
do anything like that.

41
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,041
They've just made a mistake.

42
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,791
Yeah... Must be.

43
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:38,166
[LELOUCH] Right. Well...
Good night, Nunnally.

44
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,208
That's why we should've issued
a friggin' statement sooner!

45
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,333
We could've taken credit for it!

46
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,208
[OHGI sighs]

47
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,541
[OHGI] Naoto...
I'm not cut out for this.

48
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,291
I'm no leader...

49
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,250
[OWNER] Yes, everything
is just as you requested.

50
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,541
We have the best in
the business working on it.

51
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:03,708
Once the slide system
is in order, it's all yours.

52
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,416
Once I've erased
all of the evidence,

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,250
I should forget this
ever happened, right?

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,500
[HEADMASTER] Truly this has been
a painful incident for all.

55
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:17,541
The Viceroy of Area 11,
our beloved Prince Clovis,

56
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,791
has been lost to us forever.

57
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:24,083
However, we can and will bear
the weight of this tragedy.

58
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,750
And from this darkest
of hours, draw strength.

59
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,791
[LLOYD] We've lose the most
crucial part of the equation...

60
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,208
[CECILE]
Can we do it without him?

61
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,791
[LLOYD]
Don't I wish.

62
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,041
The other units never
let go of a good pilot.

63
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,583
And even if we got one, they'd
never match his readings...

64
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,625
His operational efficiciency
clocked in at 94%!

65
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,375
And you wanna replace him?

66
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,083
You should tell them that,
perhaps they'll let Suzaku go.

67
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,750
He's an honorary Britannian,
they'd never listen.

68
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,541
Ever since General
Bartley's disgrace,

69
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,333
the purebloods have the
military in an iron grip.

70
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,500
The purebloods what?

71
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,750
[LELOUCH]
Well, from what I understand,

72
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,375
they're saying that only
pureblood Britannians

73
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,000
should be allowed to
serve in the military.

74
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,166
[LLOYD]
Their view is,

75
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,875
one of their own can
never be a criminal.

76
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,583
But if the criminal
is an Eleven,

77
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,458
it paves the way for Margrave
Jeremiah to shut down

78
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,416
the practice of granting
natives Honorary status.

79
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,916
And what of Suzaku?

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,416
[LLOYD]
His fate's all but decided.

81
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,833
Hey, Lelouch, you got
anything goin' on later?

82
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,166
After all, classes have been
canceled for the day.

83
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,041
Folks have been
askin' for a rematch!

84
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,666
You are not gambling, you guys!

85
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,666
C'mon, don't be such
a stick in the mud.

86
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,708
She's right, though,
maybe it's time to quit.

87
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,875
Huh?!

88
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,125
I've found a better
opponent, actually.

89
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,416
You did? I don't get it?

90
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,583
You're cuttin' me in on
the action too, right?!

91
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,000
[LELOUCH laughing]

92
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,791
[LELOUCH] Better not.
It's not really up your alley.

93
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,875
[MUSEUM ANNOUNCER 1] Britannia's
resounding victory over Japan

94
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,458
opened the unenlightened
nation's eyes

95
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,916
to its true place
in today's world order.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,625
Since then, the Empire
and Area 11

97
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,250
have walked hand in hand
down the road to revival.

hours at Tokyo Tower.

99

Why here of all places?

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,708
[SUGIYAMA] It was Kururugi
who contacted us, wasn't it?

101
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,083
[OHGI]
Hard to say.

102
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,375
Yeah, but he might
have been arrested

103
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,291
after his communciation
with Kallen.

104
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,708
Then we're in danger
here, we should go...

Um, something wrong,
it is yours, isn't it?

[KALLEN]
Uh-- Yeah. Thank you so much.

112
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,916
[OHGI]
Oh yeah, there's no debating it,

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
life is better here
thanks to Prince Clovis.

114
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,166
I mean, it's all
due to Britannia

115
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,291
that we could rebuild
as quickly as we did.

116
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,083
I'm happy about that...

I want you to board the

[KALLEN]
What?!

122
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,291
You handled His Highness's
memorial program very well.

123
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,666
A little too weepy
for my tastes, but...

124
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,083
Yes, well, the masses
tend to like tearjerkers,

125
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,333
Your Excellency.

126
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,250
Spoken like a true TV man.

127
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,125
Still, I have to acknowledge
the finesse you've shown.

128
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,416
You did well in the
short time you had.

129
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,041
One would almost think
you were expecting

130
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,208
His Highness to meet
his untimely end.

131
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,333
[DIETHARD] It's quite common
for memorial programs

132
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,916
to be set in advance
for important people.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,958
Does that include me as well?

134
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,125
[DIETHARD] Recent events may've
bumped you up the list a bit,

135
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,583
Your Excellency.

136
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,416
I wasn't deemed important
enough till now, is that it?

137
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,833
How forthright of you.

138
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,375
I'm afraid so, sir.

139
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,708
[JEREMIAH]
Ever thought of enlisting?

140
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,708
The army could use
more men like you.

141
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,708
I don't think it would
be a very good fit.

142
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,500
Not really my cup of tea.

143
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,791
You prefer the civil
sector, I take it?

00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,541
No matter. I have another
favor to ask of you.

who see Private
Kururugi as a hero.

an attempt to free him.

00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,750
Now make your way to
the front of the train.

173
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,333
[TRAIN ANNOUNCER] The next stop
is Okubo. Okubo is next.

174
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,000
Those wishing to transfer
to the Chuo Soubu line

175
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:02,625
should exit at the next stop.
Okubo will be next.

Once again, those wishing to
transfer to the Chuo Soubu line

177
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,166
should exit at the next stop.

00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,583
Was it you... on the phone?

180
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,875
[YOSHIDA] Whoa...
Do you think it's a trap?

181
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,666
[KALLEN]
Well? Was that you in Shinjuku?

182
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,208
Was that cease-fire your doing?

183
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,708
[SUGIYAMA]
Hey, we're talkin' to you!

184
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,041
[ALL gasp]

185
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,791
[ZERO] What do you think of
my tour of the settlement?

186
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,041
Your tour?

187
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,625
Aw, come on, there's no
way it was this joker.

188
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,250
[ZERO] I wanted you
to fully grasp the two.

189
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,666
The settlement...
And the ghetto.

190
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,833
Yeah, we know.

191
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,000
There's a difference
between us and them.

192
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,666
A very harsh one.

193
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,041
And that's why we resist them.

194
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,125
[ZERO]
You're wrong.

195
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,166
Britannia will not
fall to terrorism.

00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,500
[OHGI]
Fall...?

197
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,833
[ZERO] It's little better
than childish nuisance.

198

00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,458
[YOSHIDA]
You callin' us a buncha kids?!

200
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,333
[ZERO]
You should know your enemy.

201
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,791
It is not people...
but Britannia itself!

202
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,541
It is a war you must wage,
but not on the innocent!

203

Take up your sword!
Fight for justice!

204
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,000
Heh... Oh, please.

205
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,083
That's all easy enough
to say, isn't it?!

206
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,458
Hiding behind that mask.

207
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,041
Why should we even trust you?!

208
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,000
[YOSHIDA]
She's right!

209
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,291
[SUGIYAMA]
Lose the mask!

210
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,458
[OHGI]
Right.

211
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,958

your face or not?

212
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,250
[ZERO]
Very well. I'll show you.

213
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:36,250
But rather than my face,
bear witness to my power.

214
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,708
If I deliver to you
the impossible,

215
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,416
then I might have
earned your trust.

[JAPANESE SOLDIER 1]
He killed a Prince of Britannia!

217
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,666
Suzaku Kururugi should
be treated as a hero!

218
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,500

But he's an honorary Britannian!

220
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,625

So what!

222
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,958
The bastard gave up Japan!

223
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,625
Our people don't know
that about him!

224

[MAJOR GENERAL]
The whole Shinjuku business

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,125
was the work of Kouzuki's
group, wasn't it?

226
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,375
Yes, sir, they're being led by
a man named Ohgi at the present.

227
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,208
[MAJOR GENERAL]
Hmm...

228
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,375
Has Kururugi's family
said anything?

229
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:08,166
No, sir, they broke contact with
him once he joined the military.

230

Tohdoh, what are
your thoughts?

231
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,291

in this public execution.

233
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,541

238
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,666
weren't on the list
of casualties.

That's good to hear...

on your end though.

You may be getting a trial,

242
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,791
but no one is pulling
for you, certainly.

where truth comes to light.

I can't beg for their

by their "rules" anymore!
