1
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,000
[C.C.] To this day, no one has
understood the urgent desires

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:25,416
and heaving emotions within
the young Britannian Lelouch,

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,250
despite his expectations
for the final outcome.

4
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,125
Before he can go forward,

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,333
there is one more enemy
Lelouch must confront.

6
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,125
However, this one is
different than all others.

7
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,375
For this enemy is
human nature itself.

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,708
Hope and atonement.
Freedom and solitude.

9
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,708
That mass of matter and
energy known as the world...

10
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:53,250
Keeps on flowing forward despite
the desires of any one man.

11
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:45,541
[V.V.] Charles, have you learned
anything by becoming emperor?

12
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,583
Yes, big brother.
All people are liars.

13
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:52,333
And this vast nation we call
Britannia never changes.

14
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,875
[V.V.]
That may be true,

15
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,333
but it's just human
nature, isn't it?

16
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,333
[EMPEROR]
Perhaps you're right about that.

17
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:02,833
[V.V.] Charles you won't forget,
will you? Our contract?

18
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:08,833
[EMPEROR] I know. To kill God
and smash this world of lies...

19
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,000
[ROLO]
That was a close call,

20
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,458
big brother. Shirley
regained her memory.

21
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,458
She had a gun, and she
was coming after you.

22
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,541
[LELOUCH] I see. So you were
the one who killed her.

23
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:30,750
Yes, I did it for you; I have
to eliminate your enemies.

24
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,000
[LELOUCH]
Rolo...

25
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,625
[ROLO]
What, big brother?

26
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,750
You handled it very well.
If it weren't for you,

27
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,041
everybody would've known
about my secret.

28
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,500
Exactly and it isn't just your
secret anymore, brother.

29
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:49,541
[LELOUCH] True. So, shall we
destroy the Geass Order now?

30
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,708
[ROLO]
Uh?!

31
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,833
[LELOUCH]
The Black Knights can wipe out

32
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,250
the source of Geass
once and for all.

33
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,083
[ROLO]
Big brother, we can't.

34
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,458
There are still
Geass users there.

35
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,916
If we keep avoiding
this, we'll never win.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,833
Remember, this is for our
happiness. For both of us.

37
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,083
For both of us?

38
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right. V.V. has
begun to suspect you.

39
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,625
[LELOUCH]
Are you afraid of V.V.?

40
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,208
[ROLO] Well, he was
the one who found me.

41
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:20,125
Still, Lelouch, can I
really believe in you?

42
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,333
[LELOUCH]
Of course.

43
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,708
We're the only brothers
we have, aren't we?

44
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,291
[CORNELIA]
Are you going to kill me?

45
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:31,083
Or control me with your Geass?
Like you did to Euphy?

46
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,875
To prove your
sister's innocence,

47
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:37,041
you renounced your position gave
up everything. That's inspiring.

48
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:37,875
[CORNELIA grunts]

49
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,583
You made me think, Cornelia.

50
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,625
Is there any more splendid
relationship in this entire

51
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,958
world than that of
loyal siblings?

52
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,208
[DOCTOR] Organ failure
due to gunshot wounds

53
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,750
and loss of blood.

54
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,375
[SUZAKU] Shirley. You're
saying that she shot herself?

55
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,375
[DOCTOR]
Yes. Apparently on impulse.

56
00:04:56,458 --> 00:05:00,083
[SHIRLEY'S MOM crying]

57
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,250
Suicide? She couldn't...

58
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,375
Has anyone seen Lelouch?

59
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,750
[RIVALZ]
Mm-mm.

60
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,375
[SHIRLEY'S MOM cries]
No!

61
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,625
[KANON] I see.
She was a friend of yours.

62
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,333
[NINA] Yes. Milly just
told me about it.

63
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,250
[KANON]
Were you close?

64
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,750
[NINA] I'm not sure. She was
just always so cheerful.

65
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,625
To be honest,
she kind of bothered me.

66
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,541
[KANON] I see. Perhaps you were
envious of her happiness?

67
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:39,250
[NINA] Maybe Maybe that
was it. That's why...

68
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,416
I never imagined that
I would cry over her!

69
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,750
[KANON] Nina as long
as you can shed tears,

70
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,375
then you're all right.

71
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,833
[C.C.] I can't believe Lelouch.
Who does he think I am?

72
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,333
Leaving me behind here

73
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,250
like I was a messenger
girl or something.

74
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,375
[C.C.]
What?! Ugh, hardly.

75
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,375
I'm just really worried that
he's forgotten our contract.

76
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,416
Anyway, what are you
planning to do?

77
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,083
How long are you going
to stay inside of--

78
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,166
C.C.

79
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,541
[C.C.]
Hm?

80
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,250
[LELOUCH] I have finally
located where the Order is.

81
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,666
Jeremiah and Rolo provided
key information.

82
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,500
We're going to send in the
Zero Squad and wipe it out.

83
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,625
[C.C.] Wipe it out?
Weren't you going to use it?

84
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,416
They're not a military group.

85
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,125
They just do research
into Geass--

86
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,666
We'll crush them!

87
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,541
Tell me what happened.

88
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,750
[LELOUCH] The power of
Geass which they unleashed

89
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,416
caused Shirley's death.
She was killed by Geass!

90
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,041
[C.C.] And so now you're
going to wipe out the Order?

91
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,583
As atonement.

92
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,708
To make sure the same thing
doesn't happen to anyone else.

93
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,708
You said Geass is the
power of the king.

94
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,750
There can be only one king,
so I alone shall have it.

95
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,500
I will erase Rolo. I'll erase
Geass from all the others.

96
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,750
Its power to make people
sinful will be obliterated

97
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,041
from this world!

98
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,041
I owe that to Shirley.
At the very least!

99
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,208
And are you going to
erase me, as well?

100
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,666
[LELOUCH]
You know I can't do that.

101
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,625
You are eternally young.
And immortal.

102
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,958
V.V. is also eternally young.
And also immortal.

103
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,291
I'll neutralize him
and leave him helpless.

104
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,916
And there's always the method
that Clovis used on you.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,458
Besides, I want to see if you're
really loyal to me now.

106
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,541
Since you were once the leader
of the Order we're fighting.

107
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,791
That was a long time ago.
And I was just window dressing.

108
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,041
I never had real
power like V.V...

109
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,208
Still.

110
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,208
We've been accomplices,
haven't we?

111
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,083
[LELOUCH] The order will be
wiped out which will test you.

112
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,541
[C.C.] I'm prepared to
see it through to the end.

113
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,833
[LELOUCH] Good, because
there's one thing more:

114
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,875
I want to know the details
of our contract.

115
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,000
What is it you want
from all this?

116
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,000
[C.C.] That has nothing
to do with the mission;

117
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,875
I have no intention
of 

118
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,708
[LELOUCH]
Hmpf! Willful woman!

119
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:58,875
Yes, that's right. That's
exactly what makes me C.C.

120
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,916
[PRIEST B] Bartley and
the others are one thing,

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,458
but what do we do about
Princess Cornelia?

122
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,541
[PRIEST C] Shouldn't we at
least contact His Majesty?

123
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:13,166
[V.V.] Hm. I wonder if Charles
knew about Cornelia's actions.

124
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,916
Or if he didn't...

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,958
[PRIEST B]
Huh?

126
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,250
[PA VOICE]
Director V.V., we have

127
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,250
the scheduled transmission
from Lord Jeremiah.

128
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,541
[V.V.] Right. Can you
patch it through?

129
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,791
Surprised to see me?

130
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:24,708
[V.V.]
Uh.

131
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,708
[LELOUCH]
So, you're V.V...

132
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,208
Lelouch!

133
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,500
[PRIEST A] How can he have
access to Jeremiah's network?!

134
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,916
[PRIEST D]
Where's the signal from?

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,916
[PRIEST C] Area 11. Looks
like he's inside Ashford.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,500
[LELOUCH] I'm sure I need no
introduction at this point,

137
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,750
so I'll just start with
direct questions.

138
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,500
Was it you who
kidnapped Nunnally

139
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,250
during the battle for Tokyo?

140
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,041
Also, did you put Suzaku
and I and the others

141
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,541
on Kamine Island to observe us?

142
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,958
[V.V.]
Yes, that's correct.

143
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,083
But the fact that you're
asking these questions

144
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,833
means you've regained all of
your memories, doesn't it?

145
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,958
That's right, I am Zero.

146
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,291
[V.V.] Then C.C. must be with
you. Can you hand her over?

147
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,041
We'll let you go free if you do.

148
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,458
It's too late for that!

149
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,125
I hereby declare war against
you, with no mercy!

150
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,250
[V.V.] Oh yeah! But by the
time you get here from Area 11,

151
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,458
we'll have moved
to another place--

152
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,583
[explosion]

153
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,541
[PA VOICE]
Director V.V.! Knightmares!

154
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,625
What?!

155
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,416
[PA GUY]
I think it's the Black Knights!

156
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,833
[C.C.] V.V.'s current
location is verified.

157
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,791
Strike force,
encircle point alpha-7!

158
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,750
[V.V.]
I see. So, that's how it is.

159
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,000
That's right. I'm glad you
gave me a bit of your time.

160
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,416
You just had to let down
your guard for a moment.

161
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,416
Since you believed
I was in Area 11,

162
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,125
you thought you had
time to escape.

163
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,166
That's why you're
trapped now.

164
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,541
V.V., the one who shall render
judgement here is me!

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,291
[ALL screaming]

166
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,958
[V.V.] Load the research
data into the Eject Dart

167
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,750
and prepare the device;
you know which one I mean.

168
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,833
[PRIEST A] Director, you're
facing them personally?

169
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,500
I need to buy you time
to escape with the data.

170
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:09,041
Besides, I have to teach some
discipline to Marianne's child.

171
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,041
I never would have guessed.

172
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,916
I mean, that you were a
royal princess, Nunnally.

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,250
[NUNNALLY] Forgive me for
hiding things from you.

174
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,250
[KALLEN]
Same for me.

175
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,666
[NUNNALLY] It's so nostalgic,
talking about Ashford Academy.

176
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,250
They told me I wouldn't
see Milly and the others.

177
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,375
So Suzaku is the only one
I've been able to talk to.

178
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,125
They also said my
brother has vanished.

179
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,833
No one knows where he is.

180
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,416
Tell me, what sort of brother
was Lelouch for you?

181
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,625
Huh?

182
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,083
[KALLEN] I used to have
a brother, too, so,

183
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,083
that's why I ask.

184
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,708
[NUNNALLY] I'm happy
just to have someone

185
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,625
to talk to about Lelouch.

186
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,916
Excuse me, please.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,125
[KALLEN]
Mm?

188
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,375
[SUZAKU]
Viceroy Nunnally,

189
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,541
I'd like to borrow prisoner
1-0-7 from you.

190
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,416
[NUNNALLY]
Uh.

191
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,750
[ALL screaming]

192
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,875
[STAFF groaning]

193
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,333
[BLACK KNIGHT A]
Sub-commander Kinoshita,

194
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,708
something's wrong here!

195
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,291
This isn't a Britannian
military installation.

196
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,416
Uh. Yeah, you're right.

197
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,708
They haven't put up
any resistance at all.

198
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,916
They don't even seem
to have weapons.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,916
[ZERO]
Use extreme prejudice!

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,250
But, sir...!

201
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,666
[ZERO] Britannia has
been colluding with traitors

202
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,041
in the Chinese Federation.

203
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,916
This lab is developing
immortal warriors

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,875
whose purpose
is to destroy us!

205
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,541
I won't let them violate
the sanctity of life!

206
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,833
The researchers and their
data are to be wiped out!

207
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:30,958
We don't know where the subjects

208
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,958
of the immortality
research are hidden!

209
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,166
Therefore, encircle point
alpha-7 and destroy everything!

210
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,958
Burn it to the ground! Any
experimental subjects found

211
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,375
are to be sealed inside
of high pressure casing!

212
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,541
I will investigate each
one of them personally!

213
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,250
[BARTLEY] Have you found
Princess Cornelia yet?!

214
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,625
We have to use this
chance to save everyo--

215
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,791
[ALL screaming]

216
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,916
That man there, wasn't
he working with Clovis?

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,583
[STAFF A]
Director C.C.!

218
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,333
You've come back to us!

219
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,958
[STAFF B]
Please save us, C.C.!

220
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,125
[C.C. gasps]

221
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,333
Your Highness, Prince Clovis...

222
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,791
The eternally young, immortal
woman you wished to present

223
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,791
to His Majesty. It would
seem that he was already

224
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,375
aware of her
existence. Please...

225
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,458
Please forgive me,
Your Highness...

226
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,375
We never should've involved
ourselves with that witch.

227
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,625
[DIETHARD]
Yes,

228
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,375
Zero's gone to attack a
Britannian research facility.

229
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,916
He's kept the location
and mission secret.

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,958
More of those
clandestine activities?

231
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,000
And now that the Saudis
have been subjugated

232
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,250
we must ratify the united states
charter as quickly as possible.

233
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,916
It's true that more factions
are caving in to Britannia,

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,166
so we need to move very
quickly as you say.

235
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,916
[XING-KE] But there's positive
movement as well.

236
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,083
Italy and Poland have
come over to our side.

237
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,000
We need to speak to Zero
as soon as he returns.

238
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,500
[DIETHARD]
Understood.

239
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,833
[DIETHARD] This is what
Zero wants, isn't it?

240
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,083
Yes. We have to
maintain tight secrecy

241
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,458
around his activities
and his very existence.

242
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,208
[DIETHARD] Then I want you to go
after deputy-commander Ohgi.

243
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,291
[SAYOKO]
Huh?

244
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,541
[DIETHARD]
He's been acting strangely

245
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,875
since the meeting a few
days ago. No. He's been

246
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,416
hiding something from us
for a long time before that.

247
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
[AIRPORT STAFF sighs] Flights
to the Chinese Federation

248
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,000
right now are cancelled...

249
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,916
[VILLETTA] I belong to the
Office of Secret Intelligence.

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,333
[AIRPORT STAFF]
Th-he one that reports

251
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,041
directly to His Majesty?!

252
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,250
[VILLETTA]
Right. I believe you have

253
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,833
special flights for
diplomatic purposes.

254
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,083
[AIRPORT STAFF]
Yes ma'am we do.

255
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,875
[VILLETTA] Now that Lelouch has
roped even Jermiah into this...

256
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,166
For Zero's sake, if
the deputy-commander

257
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,083
is collaborating with
the enemy, then...

258
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,375
[VILLETTA]
I must kill Ohgi Kaname!

259
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,375
[MORI]
Huh?

260
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,458
What are children
doing here?

261
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,375
Uh... Hm?

262
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,416
What the...?!

263
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,416
Ugh! My hand! [grunting]

264
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,083
What the devil are
you doing, Mori?!

265
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,541
It's not me!
I can't control it!

266
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,166
Uh? It's Geass?

267
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,583
That power means it's...

268
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,083
Big brother Rolo!

269
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,208
Hey, I miss all you guys:
how have you been?

270
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,250
The new guy.
Your name's Rolo, isn't it?

271
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,166
Are you one of them?

272
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,416
I have nothing to
do with them now.

273
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,250
As long as I keep following
my brother, I'm all right.

274
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,083
[LELOUCH laughs]
Once he corners V.V.,

275
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,250
I'll simply detonate the bomb I
planted in Rolo's knightmare.

276
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,125
My funeral offering to
Shirley will be Rolo's life!

277
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,625
He will atone for
what he did to her!

278
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,916
What?!

279
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,041
The Siegfried!

280
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,250
[JEREMIAH]
Impossible!

281
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,958
[LELOUCH]
Jermiah! Isn't that unit...?!

282
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,125
Yes. Since it works on
direct bio-connect...

283
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,250
The only one who can
use it beside me is...!

284
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,083
[V.V.]
Heh.

285
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,208
[LELOUCH]
I thought so!

286
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,125
You surprise me, V.V.!

287
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,500
[LELOUCH] The observer
becomes the perpetrator!

288
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:33,250
[V.V.] Y'know, I sort of
liked you, Lelouch.

289
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,958
Because you reminded
me of Charles.

290
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,291
[C.C.]
I can't believe it...

291
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,291
He's using the
Siegfried unit here?!

292
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,875
[LELOUCH] Get out of here!
You're the one he's after!

293
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:46,958
[V.V.]
Oh?

294
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,291
[JEREMIAH]
Hold it right there, V.V.!

295
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,000
[ROLO]
Please, just surrender.

296
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,375
Who do you think
you're talking to?

297
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,291
You're just a bunch of
traitors, aren't you!

298
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,500
V.V., I swear I'll tear you
out of that thing myself!

299
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,208
All units: attack!

300
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,708
Yes, Your Majesty!

301
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,000
[laughs]

302
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,083
[LELOUCH growls] That spinning
shield is powerful!

303
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,333
Marianne's son is getting
carried away with himself!

304
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,750
[JEREMIAH]
That machine

305
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,666
was made so that I
could prove my loyalty!

306
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,208
Jeremiah, I thought that you had
a personal grudge against Zero?

307
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,875
I did! Because I thought
he was a mere commoner

308
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,333
preventing me from
serving the royal family.

309
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,375
But now I know who he is, and I
know that by serving him...

310
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,000
I am serving my lady, Marianne!

311
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,333
[V.V.]
Even you...!

312
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,916
You dare speak
her name to me!

313
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,791
[BLACK KNIGHT RADIO]
Send out all remaining units!

314
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,208
It looks like that
monster outside

315
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,125
is piloted by their leader!

316
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,375
[KALLEN]
Shirley?!

317
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,000
[SUZAKU]
According to the forensics,

318
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,208
she committed suicide.

319
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,541
[KALLEN]
She'd never do that!

320
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,458
Suzaku, you know
that, don't you?!

321
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,625
[SUZAKU] Yeah, I do. Which means
that if somebody murdered her...

322
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,583
[gasps]

323
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,083
[SUZAKU]
Yes. Lelouch...

324
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,875
[LELOUCH grunts]

325
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,833
[LELOUCH] Rolo! Can you get
to the Siegfried somehow?

326
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,250
I'm not able to use my Geass
to do time stops on V.V...

327
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,250
[LELOUCH] You just need
to grab onto the unit.

328
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,541
I have a plan after that.

329
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,291
Okay, I'll do my best.

330
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,666
[LELOUCH] Rolo, the bomb I
planted on the Vincent is ready!

331
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,125
It'll destroy the Siegfried
and you in one blast.

332
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,166
[ROLO]
I have to try!

333
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,833
For big brother!

334
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,375
And now it's Rolo's turn.

335
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,291
You've lied to me just like
all the others, haven't you?

336
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,625
Even knowing that your
Geass won't work on me...

337
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,375
Oh, yeah!

338
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,958
[PRIEST A]
Director V.V.,

339
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,375
we've finished preparations to
escape with the research data.

340
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,208
Shall we take it to
the E.U. for now?

341
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,958
[V.V.] Yes. I'll join you after
I've finished things here.

342
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,833
Now I know how to capture C.C.,

343
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,333
so all we need to do
is escape and regroup,

344
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,250
then Charles and I can put
an end to this for good.

345
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,041
I just have to grab it!

346
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,000
You are a failed experiment,
don't you know that?

347
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,958
Your heart stops every
time you use your Geass.

348
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:13,208
That means you're defective. You
could conk out at any moment.

349
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,250
Not yet! If I eject them...!

350
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,083
Oh, yeah!

351
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,875
[ROLO]
I've done it, big brother!

352
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,875
[screams]

353
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,166
[V.V. laughs]

354
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,125
[LELOUCH]
Well done, Rolo!

355
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,708
Now, it's time for goodbye!

356
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,208
[LELOUCH grunts]

357
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:40,333
[V.V.] Who? Who could know the
Siegfrieg's only weak point?

358
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,708
[V.V. growls]

359
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,541
So, your name is V.V.?
You were mistaken

360
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,041
when you treated me like
an incompetent weakling.

361
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:52,958
[ROLO gasps]

362
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,375
[ROLO]
Forgive me, Big Brother!

363
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,541
[LELOUCH]
No, it's all right.

364
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,875
[LELOUCH] I never expected
Cornelia to be here!

365
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:04,416
The Siegfried's shields are
all down! Direct attack!

366
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,250
[V.V.]
Uh... Uh!

367
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,958
Now you're going to suffer,
for what you did to Euphy!

368
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:10,958
The source...

369
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,625
[LELOUCH, CORNELIA]
...of Geass!

370
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,708
[V.V.] It's no use! The
Siegfried is finished!

371
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,125
Uh!

372
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:27,250
It's you, Lelouch!
You are an abomination!

373
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,041
[JEREMIAH]
Come, Your Highness!

374
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,375
[PRIEST A]
The Siegfried!

375
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,958
[PRIEST B]
Director V.V.!

376
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:41,125
[PRIEST C] Calm down! Remember,
director V.V. cannot be killed.

377
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,083
He can always use the Twilight
Gate on the lowest level.

378
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,958
If we just get the research data
away from here, then we...

379
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:48,750
[PRIEST A]
Ah!

380
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,583
[PRIEST B]
Is that...?!

381
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,791
[PRIEST C]
Huh?! Lady C.C.!

382
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,833
[C.C.]
Forgive me.

383
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,041
This is my personal sin
for having neglected you.

384
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,583
At last I shall put an end
to the lineage of Geass.

385
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,750
So be it. Perhaps, this is
how Lelouch and I should...

386
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,541
[SUZAKU] All of the evidence
and testimony imply

387
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:16,666
that Lelouch is innocent...
But in my heart, I've known

388
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,958
all along that Lelouch was the
culprit. That he was Zero.

389
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,625
[KALLEN]
I don't know who Zero is!

390
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,625
I told you that when
I was captured.

391
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,958
[SUZAKU]
Enough of that!

392
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,000
To prevent another
death like Shirley's...

393
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,625
Nothing is off limits;
not anymore!

394
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,958
And that includes Refrain.

395
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,125
[KALLEN gasps]

396
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,250
[LELOUCH]
The target has fled inside!

397
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,500
I'll look for him, starting
on the lowest level!

398
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,708
Rolo, you search from
the top down! Kinoshita!

399
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,541
Take command and sweep
the middle levels!

400
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,458
[V.V. sighs, groans]

401
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,666
Lelouch How dare you!

402
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,958
I'm glad you came
after all... Charles.

403
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,375
The most splendid
relationship in the world

404
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,291
is that of loyal siblings.

405
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,250
[EMPEROR]
Big brother, is it true

406
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,208
you were the one who sent
an assassin after Lelouch?

407
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,000
[V.V.]
Yes. And thanks to that,

408
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,708
I've been the victim
of his assassins.

409
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,666
But I've also learned something.
That Lelouch is Zero.

410
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,166
That he even tricked Nunnally.

411
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,541
You lied to me once
again, big brother.

412
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,333
[KINOSHITA] This is as barbaric
as the Britannians!

413
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:33,291
Was it really necessary to
shoot children? Was it?

414
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,458
I'm picking up signs of life.

415
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:44,500
Have you returned to the
point where you began? V.V.!

416
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,375
What's this?! Dammit!

417
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,708
This is what happened
on Kamine Island!

418
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,625
[gasps] How was I pulled
out of the Shinkiro?

419
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,750
Where is this place? It's not
an illusion or a hologram.

420
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,208
[EMPEROR]
That is correct!

421
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,625
[LELOUCH gasps]

422
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,625
[EMPEROR] And knight mares
are such inelegant things.

423
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:10,375
Especially in the face of this
system: the Sword of Akasha!

424
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,583
[gasps] It's you...!

425
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,708
[EMPEROR] Lelouch, my son!
The time has come at last!

426
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:20,125
The time for final redemption!

427
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,125
[LELOUCH] How did the
Emperor bring me here?!

428
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,458
Dammit, I have to
think this through!

429
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,875
If he did this, he must
know that I'm Zero!

430
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,416
So there's no reason
to hide it anymore!

431
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,666
The best plan is to use my
Geass to make him my servant.

432
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,458
Then I won't need to capture
V.V. and trade him for Nunnally.

433
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:13,583
But his own Geass and
this place stand in my way!

434
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,208
So what are my options?!

435
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,916
It's all or nothing now!

436
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,541
This is a once in a lifetime
chance! I have to seize it!
