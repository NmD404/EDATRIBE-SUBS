1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,041
[C.C.] Lelouch, a young,
outcast prince of Britannia,

2
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,458
possesses two great powers:

3
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,791
One of them is Geass,
the absolute ability to compel

4
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,625
any person to do
whatever he commands.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,458
[The other is the Black
Knights, his military force

6
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,416
assembled with the intent of
destroying

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,333
the Britannian Empire
ruled by his father.

8
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:41,625
Veiling his true identity behind
a mask and the code name Zero,

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,791
Lelouch has made his move
to avenge his mother's murder

10
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,166
and to create a world in which

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,208
his younger sister Nunnally
can find happiness.

12
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,125
What will be the final
outcome of these actions?

13
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,750
At this point,
no one can predict.

14
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,166
[LELOUCH]
Hm? A Britannian?

15
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,833
Looks too confident to be a spy.

16
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,250
An extremist?

17
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,250
[C.C.] Isn't it wonderful
how the number of recruits

18
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,416
keeps growing?

19
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,666
And it was simpler
than I ever expected.

20
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,541
"While I bitterly hate
the Britannians,

21
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,625
I refuse to condone terrorism."

22
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,250
That's the prevailing view
of most Elevens.

23
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,916
[C.C.] Then basically, Elevens
support the Black Knights

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,041
for the most part.

25
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,291
[LELOUCH]
Which in turn,

26
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,416
makes it easier for us
to operate as a whole.

27
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,041
It's a huge help that the people
don't report our activities

28
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,375
to the Britannians.

29
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,666
Plus, I hear some
group called "Kyoto"

30
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,375
offered to send us
some Knightmares.

31
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,250
The number of informants has
been increasing quickly, too.

32
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,416
The Japanese can't resist
jumping on the bandwagon.

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,083
They hear a well-grounded
buzzword, and off they go.

34
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,208
[C.C.] Hence the big
"Knights for Justice" act?

35
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,166
Yeah, well,
everybody loves a hero.

36
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,708
And what better
hero than a knight.

37
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,291
[C.C. giggles]

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,791
I kinda doubt that's what a real
Knight for Justice would say.

39
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,458
[LELOUCH]
You don't think so?

40
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,541
Yes, I was demoted
from my position.

41
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,333
In very much the same
way that you were.

42
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,750
[JEREMIAH growls]

43
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,291
[VILETTA] We have no intention
of letting the situation

44
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,041
end this way. And we have
the sneaking suspicion

45
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,166
that you don't, either.

46
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,625
[DIETHARD]
That so? Well, who can say?

47
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,500
We have a lead that
might help us find Zero!

48
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,000
[DIETHARD gasps]

49
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,958
[VILETTA] You're familiar
with Ashford Private Academy?

50
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,416
I want to investigate a male
student attending there.

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,625
I think he may be
working with Zero.

52
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,208
[JEREMIAH] Viletta and I
are going to be shipping out

53
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,875
with the military soon for duty,

54
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,250
and we'll be stationed in
the Narita mountains.

55
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,125
Therefore...

56
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,625
[DIETHARD]
Narita?

57
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,583
Isn't that where the Japan
Liberation Front headquarters

58
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,625
are rumored to be located?

59
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,083
You may be a bit too clever
for your own good.

60
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,041
Heh, you overestimate me.

61
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,958
Wow, it's amazing!

62
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,583
[BLACK KNIGHT B]
These are Glasgows, aren't they?

63
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,916
[BLACK KNIGHT C]
Burais. A Japanese modification.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,500
[BLACK KNIGHT D]
I've never seen these before!

65
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,666
[BLACK KNIGHT E]
Man, the Black Knights

66
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,166
have got some serious muscle!

67
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,208
[BLACK KNIGHT F] It wasn't
easy to sign up with the B.K.

68
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,791
[BLACK KNIGHT G]
So, that makes us special, huh?

69
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:28,791
We're elite!

70
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,666
[BLACK KNIGHT H]
I'm totally amped!

71
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,125
Those guys from Kyoto,
they believe in us.

72
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,458
They sent us this.

73
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,416
[YOSHIDA] A completely-made
Japanese Knightmare!

74
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
[KALLEN]
The Guren MK-II.

75
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,250
[MINAMI]
Did you check out the manual?

76
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,458
[INOUE] The Radiant Wave
Surger? What a weapon!

77
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,791
Heh, heh!
I'm really lovin' this!

78
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,041
The big shots in Kyoto
are recognizing us!

79
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,666
We've got their approval!

80
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,541
[BLACK KNIGHT D]
Tamaki-san!

81
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,125
[TAMAKI]
Huh?

82
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,041
[BLACK KNIGHT D] Would you show
me how to use this equipment?

83
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,500
[TAMAKI]
Oh, sure, hang on!

84
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,833
I'll be right there!

85
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,166
[INOUE]
Newbies. What're you gonna do?

86
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,750
[ZERO] First Tamaki,
and now Inoue and the rest

87
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,208
are treating this like a party.

88
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,333
Ah...

89
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,666
[ZERO]
Kyoto is backing multiple

90
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,791
resistance groups, correct?

91
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,875
Yes, which means that
we finally made it in.

92
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,041
They know that we're worthy.

93
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,791
[ZERO]
No, you're wrong there, Kallen.

94
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,708
This is merely a test
they've put to us.

95
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,958
[KALLEN] So, what if it is?
This is still incredible!

96
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,416
[ZERO]
You are an optimist.

97
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,416
What's this?

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,666
[ZERO] The Guren MK-II
is yours now, Kallen.

99
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,666
Mine?! But we have
a lot more people now,

100
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,125
and we can't afford
to lose you.

101
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,000
We need the Guren's
defenses to protect you--

102
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,625
[ZERO]
You're a top-notch pilot.

103
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,333
I'm a commander.
I'll use a Burai,

104
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,750
but you're our only ace
to play during a battle.

105
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,125
Besides, you have
reason to fight.

106
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,125
[gasps]

107
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,875
Right.

108
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,583
[OHGI]
Zero. You got a second?

109
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,791
We got some weird intel
here from a Britannian

110
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,541
who wants to join up
with the Black Knights.

111
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,291
[ZERO]
Hmm?

112
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,458
[OHGI] This may be
a trap to draw us out.

113
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,125
I'd say even if we want
to confirm the information,

114
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,458
it's too risky to
contact him directly.

115
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,000
But news like this isn't
something we can just ignore.

116
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,541
What should we do?

117
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,541
[ZERO] This weekend,
we're going hiking.

118
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,458
What?

119
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,000
[ZERO]
To the Narita mountains.

120
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,416
Very well, then.

121
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,833
[NUNNALLY] Sayoko,
we won't need any breakfast

122
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,458
for my brother this morning.

123
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,875
[SAYOKO]
He's going out?

124
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,666
He'll be leaving on a
three-day trip starting today.

125
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,083
Oh, I see.

126
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,166
My, your brother's been
going out quite a bit recently.

127
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,625
Think it's a girlfriend?

128
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,166
[NUNNALLY sighs]
Maybe it is...

129
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,958
[GUARD A]
Sector 5, nothing to report.

130
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,291
Right.

131
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,583
The next scheduled report
will be in two hours.

132
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,750
[GUARD B] Of course
there's nothing to report.

133
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,416
This area's controlled by
the Japan Liberation Front.

134
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,166
No one can just stroll in-- Huh?

135
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,541
[GUARD A]
Huh?

136
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,583
Zero!

137
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,291
[ZERO]
Relax. I only came to talk.

138
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,958
I want you to ignore any unusual
activity during your watch.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,708
[GUARD A]
Sure, no problem.

140
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,333
[GUARD B]
C'mon, it's your turn.

141
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,416
[GUARD A]
What's the rush?

142
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,333
We're just on
regular duty, y'know?

143
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,416
[OHGI] I've confirmed
the signal from Zero.

144
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,375
We're now moving to way point 2.

145
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,250
[TAMAKI] Hey, why doesn't Zero
just use the radio in his Burai?

146
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,083
[INOUE] What d'ya suppose he
meant when he said "hiking"?

147
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,041
[YOSHIDA]
Uh, military training, right?

148
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,125
[TAMAKI] Only with
Zero in another location?

149
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,666
[MINAMI]
Maybe we'll dig a hot spring.

150
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,458
[SUGIYAMA] Is that why we
brought those excavators?

151
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,083
Then hell, I'm all for it.

152
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,875
[TAMAKI] Kallen,
you heard anything about this?

153
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:31,916
[gulps]

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,833
I haven't.

155
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,750
[TAMAKI]
You, Ohgi?

156
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,375
Nope, not a word.

157
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,208
[OHGI] Zero isn't using the
radio to avoid being traced.

158
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,958
Is he serious about this?

159
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,916
The day I've waited for
has finally come, Cornelia.

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,041
Hmm?

161
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,208
[LELOUCH gasps]

162
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,250
[DARLTON] We're certain that
the Japan Liberation Front's

163
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,041
headquarters are in this area.

164
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,416
We've already split four
battalions into seven units

165
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,208
and hidden them in the vicinity.

166
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,291
We've only to wait for
the viceroy's signal,

167
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,916
then we'll surround them in one
fell swoop and wipe them out.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,041
And are you confident
that the enemy won't show up

169
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,625
outside the encirclement line?

170
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,458
[DARLTON]
Hmm?

171
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,250
[CORNELIA]
You mean Zero?

172
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,541
Have no fear about that.

173
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,666
As the operation begins,
we'll be blocking off

174
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,166
the surrounding highways
and mountain roads, also.

175
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,708
[CORNELIA]
Plus, we have reserve units.

176
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,541
If Zero's stupid enough to show
up, it'll be the end of him.

177
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,666
[MILLY]
What?!

178
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,500
You wanna meet her?!
Are you kidding?!

179
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,916
Do you know who
you're talking about?!

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,208
She's a princess and
you're just a citizen.

181
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,958
What do you have in common
aside from that hoteljacking?

182
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,291
Yes, but...

183
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,541
As for Princess Euphemia...

184
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,916
I never got to thank her.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,166
[MILLY] Hmm... There was a time
when my family name

186
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,958
had the influence
to arrange that.

187
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,750
So tell me, Nina, do you
know what the social status is

188
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,958
of a Principal's granddaughter?

189
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,791
Um... not a very high one?

190
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,166
Correct. Not very.

191
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,083
[LELOUCH]
C.C.! What are you doing here?

192
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,291
I said that I would
protect you, didn't I?

193
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,875
[LELOUCH]
Aren't you over doing it?

194
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,083
I've been wondering
about something, Lelouch.

195
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,625
Why are you Lelouch?

196
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,041
[LELOUCH] I don't have time
to discuss philosophy with you.

197
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,833
You changed your family
surname to Lamperouge,

198
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,000
but you kept Lelouch, the name
that was given to you at birth.

199
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,916
How sentimental.
You can't let go of the past.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,541
[LELOUCH] Well, C.C. swings to
the other extreme, doesn't it?

201
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,708
It's not a human name.

202
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,166
[LELOUCH gasps]

203
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,416
[C.C.] Lelouch... do you know
why snow is white?

204
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,916
[LELOUCH]
Hmm...?

205
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,583
Snow is white
because it's forgotten

206
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,291
what color it's supposed to be.

207
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,958
[STAFF OFFICER]
All units are in position.

208
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,500
[CORNELIA]
Understood.

209
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,041
Euphemia will provide logistical
support from G1, as planned.

210
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,833
Have her command
the medical group.

211
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,625
[STAFF OFFICER]
Yes, Your Highness.

212
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,791
[GUILFORD]
Princess Cornelia...

213
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,291
Guilford, let me guess:

214
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,166
This is about Euphy, isn't it?

215
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,500
[GUILFORD]
Yes.

216
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,208
She really should be in
a government agency, not--

217
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,875
But she's being unusually
stubborn about this.

218
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,416
She told me she wanted to see
actual combat for herself.

219
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,625
[EUPHEMIA]
Hmm?

220
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,791
What's that unit there,
holding to the rear?

221
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,416
[SOLDIER A] Our reserve force
with an Eleven pilot.

222
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,250
What?! You mean
that's the Lancelot?

223
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,916
As a rule, Numbers
aren't permitted

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,041
to operate Knightmares, but that
particular unit is an exception.

225
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,291
[SOLDIER A] The second prince
is the patron of that unit.

226
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,791
We have no say over
their personnel selection.

227
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,958
But he said he wants them to
have as many chances

228
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,291
at real combat as possible.

229
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,958
[OHGI] Are you really
going through with this?

230
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,500
[ZERO] Our opponent is Cornelia,
whose forces are among

231
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,083
the best Britannia has to offer.

232
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,083
Then why don't we cooperate
with the Japan Liberation front?

233
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,208
[ZERO]
What was that?

234
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,875
Oghi, don't you
believe in me any more?

235
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,208
What d'you mean?!

236
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,125
I was the one who asked
you to be our leader!

237
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,458
Don't you remember?!

238
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,458
[ZERO] Then there's only
one answer to give.

239
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,500
[OHGI]
Uh. Right...

240
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,208
[DARLTON]
Viceroy, it's time.

241
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,541
[CORNELIA]
Right. Commence operation!

242
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,166
You, the Japan Liberation Front.

243
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,791
You, who time has left behind.

244
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,000
You, who have forgotten
basic human decency.

245
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,375
You and your dream of
a bygone golden age

246
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,083
shall fall and rot
to nothingness.

247
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,458
We're under enemy attack?!

248
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,666
Yes, sir! The Britannian
forces have completely

249
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,916
encircled the Narita mountains!

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We've counted over 100 units!

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,375
[ZERO]
It's begun.

252
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,208
[growls]

253
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,833
Huh?! What the hell--?!

254
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,416
You've gotta be kidding, Zero!

255
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Those troops coming in have this
whole area totally surrounded!

256
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,541
There's no way out!

257
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,250
[ZERO]
We've already been cut off!

258
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,416
Our only chance of
surviving now is to fight!

259
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,875
What?! We can't fight
the Britannians!

260
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,375
Lemme get this straight:

261
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,958
We're surrounded, and you
want us to fight them head on?!

262
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,916
And we'd be fighting
against Cornelia!

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,208
Her forces are far stronger
than any we've encountered!

264
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,041
[ZERO] Correct. It would be
a miracle if we win this.

265
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,500
[OHGI]
Zero, what're you saying?!

266
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,666
[ZERO] Even messiahs
need to perform miracles

267
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,166
if they're to be acknowledged!

268
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,083
Therefore, we have to produce
our own miracle, don't we?

269
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,083
Now look, pulling this off
isn't gonna be cheap!

270
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,791
The price could be our lives!

271
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,000
I knew it was insane
to make you our leader!

272
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,250
It should be me!

273
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:46,875
[OHGI gasps]

274
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,250
[TAMAKI whimpers]

275
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
[ZERO] Our path of
retreat has been cut off.

276
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,708
If you think you can win
without me, then shoot me.

277
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,500
Someone. Anyone.

278
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,958
[gasps]

279
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,458
[ZERO] Since you've
joined the Black Knights,

280
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,166
you have only two choices:

281
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,333
You may either live with me...

282
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,375
or you may perish with me!

283
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,125
[SOLDIER 1]
We're completely surrounded,

284
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,666
and our underground reserve
forces were captured

285
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,041
all at once!

286
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,833
[SOLDIER 2] General Katase,
we've received a message

287
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,250
from Cornelia's forces
demanding our surrender!

288
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,666
Imbecile! If we fall here,
then we've lost,

289
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,875
and the whole resistance
movement falls with us!

290
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,375
[JLF STAFF OFFICER 1]
Then, General...

291
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,416
[JLF STAFF OFFICER 2] Do we
engage the enemy in battle,

292
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,750
or do we dig in?

293
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,833
[KATASE]
What about Tohdoh? Where is he?!

294
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:42,916
[JLF STAFF OFFICER 3]
He's gone to Kyoto

295
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,125
to get the custom Burais!

296
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,291
[JLF STAFF OFFICER 1]
The four Holy Swords

297
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,541
are traveling with him, too.

298
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,666
[JLF STAFF OFFICER 2]
If they're on schedule,

299
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,666
they should be
returning soon, but...

300
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,291
[KATASE]
Tohdoh won't make it in time.

301
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,125
Prepare to send out the Burais!

302
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,833
We'll break the encirclement
on one side and evacuate!

303
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,208
We'll show them the
Japanese spirit and pride!

304
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,166
This is our moment of truth!

305
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,166
We believe that the
enemy's main base is located

306
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,041
in the mountains here, but
we haven't pinpointed it yet.

307
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,833
However, until we obtain a list
of their collaborators,

308
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,666
we can't burn down everything
with our aerial bombing.

309
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,500
[SOLDIER B] The enemy is
engaging our encirclement,

310
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,333
and they'll try to break
through at some point.

311
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,125
From there, we'll be able to
ascertain where their base is.

312
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,333
[SOLDIER A] Our forces are
divided into three fronts:

313
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,458
The units led by General Darlton
here, General Alex here,

314
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,541
and Viceroy Cornelia here.

315
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,000
As for our flanking
forces-- What...?

316
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:30,875
[gasps]

317
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,958
[SOLDIER B]
It's enemy ECM.

318
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,500
[DARLTON] The main enemy force
should be coming out

319
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,416
any time now. We're
switching to ECCM mode.

320
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,958
Link up on channel alpha-four!

321
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,500
The enemy--what are
we calling them again?

322
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,750
[SUBORDINATE]
Burais, sir.

323
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,458
Right. They're rather
like pseudo-Glasgows,

324
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,541
so watch out for em.

325
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,000
[SUBORDINATE]
Yes, my lord!

326
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,208
How clever. They turned this
whole mountain into a fortress.

327
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,875
[GUILFORD]
Your Highness, please fall back!

328
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,625
[CORNELIA] Guilford,
don't treat me as though

329
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,666
I'm another one of your women.

330
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,291
Princess Cornelia!

331
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,000
[JLF SOLDIER]
It's... Cornelia!

332
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,958
[JLF COMMANDER] Don't panic!
Take out the leader!

333
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,666
[CORNELIA]
Insolent worms!

334
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,458
[JLF COMMANDER screams]

335
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,500
[GUILFORD] Right. Well then,
I'll cover you from the rear.

336
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,333
[CORNELIA]
Heh.

337
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,458
Well?! Cornelia is here!

338
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,625
is there no one who
will challenge me?!

339
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,708
[ZERO]
What's wrong?

340
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,541
Challenge me,
and try to take me down!

341
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,541
All right, fine!
Do what you want!

342
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,208
We acknowledge you
as our leader, Zero.

343
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,125
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

344
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,791
[ANNOUNCER] An evacuation order
has been issued for this area!

345
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,416
Anyone remaining
must evacuate at once!

346
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,541
I repeat, an evacuation
order has been...

347
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,625
[RESCH A]
Why did they choose this place?

348
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,000
If the military should find
the experimental data

349
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,583
on Code R, it's all over!

350
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,666
Oh my. Being inside
the terrorist's area,

351
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,958
we thought it would be difficult
for them to discover us.

352
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,875
This was all General
Bartley's decision,

353
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,208
so there's no use
complaining about it.

354
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,166
They're too fragile.

355
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,291
[DARLTON] The enemy seems
to be concentrated over here.

356
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,083
This may be the target!

357
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,541
Split up now!

358
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,208
[SOLDIER 6] No good! Our second
attack wave had no effect!

359
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,791
Their sheer dominance
is insurmountable!

360
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,958
[SUBORDINATE] General Darlton,
based on the analysis

361
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,000
of the enemy's movements,
I've determined that the

362
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,333
entrance to the JLF
main base is that lodge

363
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,958
located up on that mountain.

364
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,833
I believe the proper word
for this situation is "bingo."

365
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,458
[SUBORDINATE] Well, to be
more precise, sir, it'd be--

366
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,250
Oh, just call it in
already, Mr. Literal.

367
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,125
[CORNELIA]
Is that... Darlton?

368
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,375
So, that's where the
main enemy base is located?

369
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,541
[CORNELIA] Right. We'll be
securing our position here.

370
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,166
Are you sure about this?

371
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,791
[CORNELIA] I don't need
to steal achievements

372
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,291
from my subordinates.

373
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,541
Send the reserve force
to back up Darlton!

374
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,000
Looks like he'll be
getting another medal.

375
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,958
[LELOUCH]
Impressive as always, Cornelia.

376
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,458
A very logical deployment.

377
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,625
However, excellent though
it is, it's also easy to read.

378
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,416
As is your location.

379
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,833
I thought the reserve units
were supposed to be assigned

380
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:01,916
to General Darlton?

381
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,500
[VILETTA]
That's right, they were.

382
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,583
But our unit has to secure the
rear line of Viceroy Cornelia.

383
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,000
[JEREMIAH]
You mean this is the rear line?!

384
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,041
You can't get any farther
away from the battlefield!

385
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,125
How am I going to redeem
my reputation out here

386
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,791
if I'm not even
near the fighting?!

387
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,833
[JLF SOLDIER 2] We've lost
contact with Nakamura's unit!

388
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,291
[JLF SOLDIER 3]
No response from Sector 3!

389
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,833
[JLF SOLDIER 4]
Major Tabata's been killed!

390
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,666
[JLF SOLDIER 2]
Kuroda and Kurata are gone, too!

391
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,416
[JLF SOLDIER 4]
What about Nagai?!

392
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,916
Where is Tohdoh?!

393
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,833
If only he were here,
the divine wind would blow!

394
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,375
We'd have another
miracle of Itsukushima!

395
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,666
[GUARD A]
Look out!

396
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,375
[ASAHINA] Sir, don't you think
this is a little extreme?

397
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,708
Asahina, Chiba!
Prep the custom Burais ASAP!

398
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,208
Tell Urabe and Senba
behind us to do the same.

399
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,625
Traffic is blocked off
all around Narita,

400
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,500
and they've already
begun to attack!

401
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,458
I just pray that we're in time.

402
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,291
Now, any resistance
still remaining in Area 11...

403
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,291
...will soon be finished.

404
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,125
Right! All preparations
have now been completed!

405
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,708
Black Knights,
prepare to move out!

406
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,166
[BLACK KNIGHT A]
Dammit, we have no choice!

407
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,375
[BLACK KNIGHT B]
I don't wanna die!

408
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,708
[BLACK KNIGHT C]
We'll make a miracle happen!

409
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,583
[BLACK KNIGHT E]
Yeah, we'll have Zero with us!

410
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,291
[LELOUCH] We, the Black Knights,
are going to launch

411
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,166
a surprise attack
on the Britannians

412
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,875
from the summit of the mountain!

413
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,041
Per my instructions,
you will charge en masse

414
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,916
down toward point three!

415
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,750
And the intent of this operation
is to capture Cornelia,

416
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,458
second princess of Britannia!

417
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,958
Our breakthrough route will be
opened by the Guren MK-II.

418
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,083
[LELOUCH] Kallen! Use
penetrating electrode number 3!

419
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,541
Settle things with one blow!

420
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,000
Got it!

421
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,750
[KALLEN]
Output confirmed.

422
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,250
Wave surger levels
ready and holding.

423
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,041
[sighs]

424
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,916
Activating gauntlet now!

425
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,708
[sighs]

426
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,000
It worked!

427
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,750
--[screaming]
--[KATASE] What's happening?!

428
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,250
[SOLDIER 6]
I-Is this an earthquake?!

429
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,250
[SOLDIER 7]
At a time like this?! [screams]

430
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,291
[DARLTON]
What the hell?!

431
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,708
[EUPHEMIA]
What's happening?!

432
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,208
Impossible! How could a
landslide come out of nowhere?!

433
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,250
[SOLDIER A] Alex's and Darlton's
units are getting wiped out!

434
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,250
[DARLTON]
Climb! Get to higher ground!

435
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,500
[CORNELIA]
Status report!

436
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,916
[SUBORDINATE]
We're still trying to confirm!

437
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,791
[GUILFORD]
Your Highness, pull back!

438
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:36,916
You're in danger there!

439
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,625
I don't care!
Forget about me!

440
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,666
Find out about Darlton!
And where is Alex?!

441
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,375
[KATASE]
Will this place hold together?!

442
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,500
[JLF STAFF OFFICER 1]
The central area

443
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,250
should make it through!

444
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,750
[LLOYD]
Oh, my!

445
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,375
At this rate, they'll be swept
all the way to the bottom.

446
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,916
These heat readings
are abnormal.

447
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,666
Do you believe a
hydro-volcanic eruption

448
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,958
was artificially induced?

449
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,750
[LLOYD]
Impossible. Unless, of course,

450
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,416
someone's used Rakshata's
Radiant Wave Surger.

451
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,583
[SUZAKU]
Has something happened?

452
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,708
[LLOYD]
Uh-huh...

453
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,583
But it has nothing
to do with us,

454
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,416
so just relax and
continue waiting.

455
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,875
Ah...

456
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,583
[LELOUCH]
Hmph...

457
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,916
It's even more destructive
than I anticipated.

458
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,333
We did succeed in
isolating Cornelia's unit,

459
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,416
but we could have been
a bit more accurate.

460
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,541
Perhaps I should have
consulted a physics teacher?

461
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,500
Or asked Nina to
tutor me in probability?

462
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,875
[STAFF OFFICER]
New enemy force confirmed

463
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,125
moving in from the summit.

464
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,291
Carius unit is moving
to engage them.

465
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,791
Hoping to take advantage of
all the confusion, are they?

466
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,625
[STAFF OFFICER] Emergency call
from Carius unit!

467
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,000
What's wrong?

468
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,750
[STAFF OFFICER] It's not
the Japan Liberation Front!

469
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,333
They think it's...
the Black Knights!

470
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,666
[CORNELIA]
What?! Then it's...

471
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,833
Zero!

472
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,333
How dare he show up here?!

473
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,583
ZERO!

474
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,708
Lord Jeremiah, you can't
just abandon your post!

475
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,541
[JEREMIAH]
This requires drastic measures!

476
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,000
If you want glory in life,
then follow me!

477
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,250
[LELOUCH] Cornelia has only
limited reinforcements

478
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,583
headed her way.
Smash right through them!

479
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,333
[MINAMI]
Yeah! We can do this now!

480
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,416
All right, everybody,
you know the game plan.

481
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,125
Our job is to watch their backs!

482
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,083
Get ready... FIRE!

483
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,125
The enemy's taken out
Carius' unit?!

484
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,958
If I can finish this before Zero
reaches Princess Cornelia,

485
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,250
then I'll be golden!

486
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,250
[VILETTA]
Lord Jeremiah!

487
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,583
Viletta, you came!

488
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,000
I knew that you would!

489
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,333
[LELOUCH]
Burn the bridges behind you,

490
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,833
and keep your back to the wall.

491
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,833
Classical strategies remain
effective ones, don't they?

492
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,333
[JEREMIAH]
Zero!

493
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,125
[MINAMI]
Ugh! Dammit!

494
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,291
[JEREMIAH] Is Zero here?!
If he is, then face me!

495
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,000
Come forward, and fight
Jeremiah Gottwald!

496
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,458
[LELOUCH] Well, well...
it's been a while, Jeremiah.

497
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,625
So, you're still in the army?

498
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,291
I'd love to stay and
catch up,

499
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,666
but I'm afraid I don't have time
right this minute, "Orange boy."

500
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,291
O-Ora-a-a-a-a-a-a... Orange?!

501
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,750
DIE!

502
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,333
[JEREMIAH gasps]

503
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,083
Lord Jeremiah!

504
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,833
[JEREMIAH] Stay out of this!
This is my duel!

505
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,125
[VILETTA]
But look at it!

506
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,708
I've never seen a Knightmare
like that before!

507
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,666
Is it possible that
the Elevens have--

508
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,750
[JEREMIAH] You think Elevens are
capable of such technology?!

509
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,958
It's fast!

510
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,208
[JEREMIAH]
This thing...

511
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,250
Is this what destroyed
Carius' unit?!

512
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,833
Yeah, that's right, Britannia!

513
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,500
We can finally go up against you
on an equal footing, head on!

514
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,166
And our counterattack begins
with this baby, the Guren MK-II!

515
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,333
[yells]

516
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,416
[JEREMIAH]
Oh, hell!

517
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,416
There's something
on its right hand!

518
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,125
But if I keep my distance...

519
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,583
What's this?!

520
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,750
Sorry.

521
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,500
[JEREMIAH gasps]

522
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,500
Wha-What the hell's happening?!

523
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,916
[VILETTA]
Lord Jeremiah, eject!

524
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,583
I can't run now!
Zero's right in front of me!

525
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,791
He's standing right here!

526
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,166
Dammit! The auto-eject!
Don't you dare activate!

527
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,666
I can still get Zero...!

528
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,083
I know it!
I know I can still get him...!

529
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,375
[JEREMIAH rasps]

530
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,208
I won't lose. Not with this.

531
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,541
Guren MK-II!

532
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,500
She defeated Lord Jeremiah.

533
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:24,416
Who are the Black Knights?
Who are they, these warriors?!

534
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,791
All our tasks at hand
have been cleared.

535
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,333
The pieces are in position.

536
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,875
The only thing left to do is
check my opponent's stronghold.

537
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,333
[LELOUCH]
Decision time!

538
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,625
Even Cornelia will lose

539
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:10,083
with only limited
allied reinforcements.

540
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,291
Plus, we have the Guren MK-II.

541
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,875
I'll capture her.

542
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,000
Then at last I'll learn the
truth about my mother's death!

543
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,500
And once she's my prisoner...

544
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,666
I win.

545
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,375
Barring any unforeseen events,

546
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,750
my Black Knights
will claim victory!
