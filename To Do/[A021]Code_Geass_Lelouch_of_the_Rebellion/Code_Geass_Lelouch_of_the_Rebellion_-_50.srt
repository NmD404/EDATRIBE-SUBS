1
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,083
This is the first
time in eight years

2
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,666
I've seen your face.

3
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,166
The face of a brother
and a murderer.

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,458
[grunts]

5
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,333
[NUNNALLY] And I wear
the same face, as well,

6
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,000
don't I, Lelouch?

7
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,375
[LELOUCH]
Then...

8
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,125
It's been you firing the
F.L.E.I.J.A.s up until now.

9
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,833
[NUNNALLY] Yes. I wanted to
stop it all. To stop you.

10
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,750
I would have done
whatever I had to,

11
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,666
even if it meant
killing my big brother.

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,583
That's why I can't allow
you to have control

13
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,916
of the F.L.E.I.J.A.s...

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,791
Why I can't hand
this key to you.

15
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,000
And I wouldn't even if you--

16
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,958
Even if you used
your Geass on me!

17
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,541
[gasps]

18
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,750
[LELOUCH]
Use Geass on Nunnally?

19
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,083
It's true.

20
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,666
Time after time, I've
wanted to use it on her.

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,125
At the very least, I wanted to
use it to cure her blindness.

22
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,583
The power of the king...

23
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,333
But Nunnally was the reason
for everything I've done,

24
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,125
so I could never
use Geass' power

25
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,333
of absolute submission on her.

26
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,166
But now... No, I can't!

27
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,958
If I resort to twisting
my own sister's will...

28
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,375
...then I'm...!

29
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,541
[growls]

30
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,916
[SUZAKU] Kallen... Are you
determined to defy me?

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,875
[KALLEN] It's clear to me now
that I misjudged you, Suzaku.

32
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:20,958
[SUZAKU]
Hm?

33
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,125
Even though we're
on opposite sides

34
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,458
and our methods differ
from one another,

35
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,750
I always thought you cared
about Japan in your way.

36
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,791
But now...!

37
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,333
[SUZAKU]
There's something that I...

38
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,500
...that Lelouch
and I have to do.

39
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,875
[KALLEN]
I see...

40
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,000
You really crave
power that much?

41
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,041
In that case...

42
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,541
[SUZAKU]
In that case, what?

43
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,791
You mustn't be allowed
to live, Suzaku.

44
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,333
I'm going to defeat
you and stop Lelouch!

45
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,583
[SUZAKU]
No, that won't happen!

46
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,208
You having any second thoughts
about not running away?

47
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,416
Just where exactly
would I be running to?

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,708
[chuckles] You have
a point, Rivalz.

49
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,125
What I wish for...

50
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,250
...is to enjoy fun-filled days
with the old gang again,

51
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,083
the way we used to.

52
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,041
Mm. I do miss them.

53
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,208
You, power without a master!

54
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,541
You, who has to have
something to depend on.

55
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,916
A weak man!

56
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,291
Stop, please! You're
too badly wounded!

57
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,125
No, I have to
take responsibility

58
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,416
for starting this!

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,958
Because that's what
allows me the right

60
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,208
to lead others!

61
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,750
[NUNNALLY] Lelouch, you
have no right to seize

62
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,000
control of the world.
You, of all people,

63
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,708
who took the name Zero then
bent the will of so many

64
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,416
in order to serve your own!

65
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
[LELOUCH] Are you saying we
would have been better off

66
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,666
to remain in hiding? Did you
want a future of living

67
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,125
in constant fear
of assassination?

68
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,500
This was for your
future, too, Nunnally.

69
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,666
My future?!

70
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,458
When did I ever say
that I wanted this?!

71
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,583
Lelouch...

72
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,291
I would have been
perfectly satisfied

73
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,875
by just living with you!

74
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,208
Don't you see?

75
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,875
Our reality is restricted
by all sorts of things!

76
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,708
Our whole history is struggle!

77
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,125
[KALLEN] That's the reason
I've been fighting

78
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,416
on the side of the resistance!

79
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,750
[SUZAKU]
You could have used the system

80
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,875
to achieve your ideals!

81
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,708
But what about the others?!

82
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,000
Those people who aren't
allowed into the system?

83
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,458
How will they ever
be able to voice

84
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,458
their objections to anything?!

85
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,958
[SUZAKU]
You...!

86
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,875
[KALLEN] Don't you dare look
down on others, you elitist!

87
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,375
[SUZAKU] What about
those who've no choice

88
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,333
but to join the system?!

89
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,750
What's fair?!

90
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,125
[TOHDOH] When you follow the
methods of an aggressor,

91
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,500
then you're only serving
to legitimize them.

92
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,416
[CHIBA] But, if you go into
battle now, you'll die!

93
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,458
Why you...! And you
call yourself a--!

94
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,125
[gasps]

95
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,416
I apologize.

96
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,000
Huh?

97
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,166
[TOHDOH grunts, gasps]

98
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,750
This is the only way
I know how to live.

99
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,750
[CHIBA]
Kyoshiro!

100
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,041
Why do people always
have to fight?!

101
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,583
I fight because
there is something

102
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,250
that I must protect!

103
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,291
[CORNELIA] It may be that
we can no longer find

104
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,875
morality or a sense of
dignity in our warfare.

105
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,083
[VILLETTA] Regardless, I still
needed to belong somewhere.

106
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,791
[OHGI] For that reason
alone, we fought.

107
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,708
Naoto... This is really
the best thing for us?

108
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,625
[LLOYD]
You know what they say,

109
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,500
war is the mother of invention.

110
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,083
[RAKSHATA]
Nonsense, Earl of Pudding.

111
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,791
You don't care one
bit whether or not

112
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,041
your invention benefits mankind.

113
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,500
Nina, was it?
What about you, huh?

114
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,833
I was just... doing
whatever I could.

115
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,291
You see, we simply didn't
want it to happen again.

116
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,458
Oh?

117
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,583
However, people are
subject to weakness.

118
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,625
[TAMAKI] That's right!
Even I have dreams, don't I?!

119
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,208
But now they're
telling me I don't have

120
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,500
any right to them!

121
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,166
They don't think I'm
able to fight, but I can!

122
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,833
Why does everyone
treat me like a fool?!

123
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,333
Poor guy.

124
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,000
[C.C.]
I've seen it before.

125
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,750
I've seen it over and over.

126
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,416
Human history is one
of struggle. Even so...

127
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,291
The world and the
people in it...

128
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,291
They'll never be what
we want them to be!

129
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,583
[KALLEN]
So now you'll force them?!

130
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,166
That's your solution?!

131
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,958
That's plain--

132
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,291
[NUNNALLY]
Despicable!

133
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,791
Using Geass, a power that
manipulates the minds

134
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,250
of people and violates
their human dignity.

135
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,416
[LELOUCH]
Then what about the Damocles?

136
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,583
So would you agree that's
a despicable method

137
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,958
that forces people to obey?!

138
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,166
The Damocles...

139
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,083
...will become the
symbol of their hatred.

140
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,166
[LELOUCH gasps]

141
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,458
All their hatred
will be focused here.

142
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,208
That way, people can
move toward the future.

143
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,875
[LELOUCH] I see. You have
the same idea, Nunnally.

144
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,333
In that case...

145
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,291
Lelouch vi Britannia
commands you!

146
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,291
Hand over the Damocles
key to me now!

147
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,458
[gasps]

148
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,750
No!

149
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,625
No, I mustn't give it
to you! I mustn't do it!

150
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,958
All the sins...

151
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,375
...you've... committed!

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,541
Take this. It's yours now.

153
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,416
[JEREMIAH grunts]
Why you impudent--!

154
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,583
Memorized recording complete.

155
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,416
[JEREMIAH]
Not quite!

156
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
[gasps]

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,166
Fire!

158
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:41,916
Memorize this! Memorize
Jeremiah Gottwald!

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,750
Commit it to memory,
because that's

160
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,291
the memorable name of the
man who has defeated you!

161
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,625
Memory? What memory?

162
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,583
I remember nothing,
I have no memories.

163
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,708
[JEREMIAH]
No memories? Could it be...?

164
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:01,500
C'mon, Tristan, move it!
Just let me fly, will ya?

165
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,625
The radiant wave
surger's out of ammo.

166
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,041
Now my shield energy
is exhausted, too?

167
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,500
[KALLEN]
Big deal!

168
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,500
[SUZAKU]
I can't beat her!

169
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,791
Even using the Geass
I'm cursed with!

170
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,041
Your strength is
unimaginable, Kallen!

171
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,500
My machine has better
specs than yours, yet...

172
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,541
Why...? While you're
this strong...

173
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,375
Do the right thing!

174
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,541
Let's end this once and for all!

175
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,041
If only you had
justice on your side!

You mean I didn't get him, then?

You're wrong. You got me,
all right... Kallen.

You won. You beat him, Kallen.

...you've grown up
following your own thoughts,

without help from others.

183
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,291
Which means, I am now
free to follow the path

184
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,541
I must take to my destiny.

185
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,791
I thank you.

You've become a demon, Lelouch!

193

Despicable!

00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,708
Cowardly!

you be so cruel?

[KAGUYA] The traitorous

has reportedly been killed.

Aren't you going to beg

00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,000
You never knew Lelouch's
true face until recently,

203
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:36,750
isn't that right?

[KAGUYA]
What of it?

205

So you're obviously
a very kind young woman.

It's not possible!

If Lelouch used a F.L.E.I.J.A.,
then that means...!

It can't be!

[LELOUCH]
Schneizel has surrendered to me!

219
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,416
As a result of this, I am
now in control of both

the Damocles and the
F.L.E.I.J.A. weapons!

And even the

If anyone dares to resist

His Majesty

Our emperor also
carries the distinction

of being CEO of the
Black Knights, as well as

241

the current chairman of
the U.F.N. Supreme Council.

242

opposed Emperor Lelouch

are being transported
to the execution grounds.

During the latest

Pendragon, was destroyed
and countless soldiers

247

that we advance.

it wasn't anything at all.

As planned...

The hatred of the whole world
is now focused directly upon me.

And now, the only
thing that remains

311

is to get rid of me and finally
break the cycle of hatred.

312

The legend of Zero isn't dead.

It lives within the hearts
of the Black Knights.

Schneizel will serve Zero, also.

315

With this, the
world will gather,

316
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,416
not for an exchange of
force, but for an exchange

of open dialog around one table.

The price you're going to
pay for using your Geass

are those prepared to be killed.

00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,916
ou will no longer
live your life

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,750
as Suzaku Kururugi.

351
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,166
You shall sacrifice
the ordinary pleasures

352
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,125
of your life for the
benefit of the world...

353
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,833
For eternity...

354
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,916
[SUZAKU] This Geass...
I do solemnly accept.

355
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,000
Lelouch? Are you...?

356
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,250
[gasps]

357
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,708
[gasps]

358
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,375
You mean...

359
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,500
...everything you've
done until now...

360
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,541
Oh, big brother, I love you!

361
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,750
[LELOUCH]
Yes... I...

362
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:30,541
[LELOUCH]
I destroy... the world...

363
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,500
...and create it...

364
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,541
[LELOUCH]
...anew...

365
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
[gasps]

366
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,875
You can't leave me!

367
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,125
You can't!

368
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,333
Please open your eyes,
big brother! Please...!

369
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,291
Big brother...!

370
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,541
Lelouch the demon is dead!

371
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,833
Free his prisoners!

372
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:56,666
[CROWD cheers]

373
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,333
This isn't good!
Everyone, retreat!

374
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,833
Is that... who I think it is?

375
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:04,625
It's Zero!

376
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,500
[TOHDOH]
Uh?!

377
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,208
It's him!

378
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,083
It's Zero!

379
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,541
It's unfair!

380
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,958
All I wanted and needed to
be happy was to be with you!

381
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,166
How can I ever look
forward the future

382
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,208
without you?

383
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:30,625
[CROWD chanting]
Zero! Zero! Zero!

384
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,416
[KALLEN]
Well, Lelouch...

385
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,166
The world's gotten a lot better
since that eventful day.

386
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,916
All the energy that
was once expended

387
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,375
on war has now
been directed toward

388
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,833
solving hunger and poverty.

389
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,166
As expected,
all sorts of hateful

390
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,083
and evil deeds have been
blamed on you. Hm...

391
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,166
Maybe that's because
people find it a lot easier

392
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,291
to accuse a person
with a name,

393
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,291
rather than a piece of
technology called Damocles.

394
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,666
Perhaps that's putting
it too simply.

395
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,041
But... whatever the reason...

396
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,708
...the world is free of
the past and it's finally

397
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,625
able to move forward
into the future now.

398
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,083
I wonder if you're
laughing right now

399
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,291
about how everything went

400
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,916
according to your
elaborate strategy.

401
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,666
Nevertheless, there are
still plenty of problems

402
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,708
we have to work
out for ourselves.

403
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,416
But even so...

404
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,875
I said that Geass was
the power of the king

405
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:33,458
which would condemn you
to a life of solitude.

406
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,500
I think maybe that's
not quite correct.

407
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,666
Right... Lelouch?
