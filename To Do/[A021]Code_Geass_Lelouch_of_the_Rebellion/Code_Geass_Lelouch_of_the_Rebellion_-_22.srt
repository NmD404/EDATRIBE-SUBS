[MED. OFFICIAL 1] About this

00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,416
zone of Japan...

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,458
There is some unpleasant rumors
about Princess Euphemia.

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,666
[VICE MINISTER] It must be due
to the Kamine Island matter.

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,333
You think she
contacted Zero there?

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,875
[MINISTRY 2] I suspect
there's a connection here

7
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,458
that goes all the way to top.

8
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,958
No connection.

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,208
The viceroy wasn't the only one
asking what was going on.

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,625
But in any case, our connections
with them need to be...

11
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,250
Mm, right, we'll have
to sever ties at once.

12
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,333
I'm afraid it's too late.

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,875
--[GROUP gasps]
--[VICE MINISTER] Uh?!

14
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,583
All the evidence has already
been gathered, Vice-Minister.

15
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,166
Namely, that NAC
profit-sharing bribe.

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,958
I appreciate this,
General Darlton.

17
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,500
With this...

18
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,875
With this, we can finally
sweep away the parasites

19
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,500
who were sucking
Prince Clovis dry.

20
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,541
[chuckles] There are
more rats than expected.

21
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,083
And all of them are confused by

22
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,208
Princess Euphemia's proposed
special zone, aren't they?

23
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,750
[SUZAKU]
Over two hundred thousand people

24
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,083
have applied to join
the Japan special zone.

25
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,625
The way things look, that
number's only going to grow.

26
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:17,916
Thanks to you, Suzaku.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,375
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

28
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,625
Because of what you represent
to the Japanese people,

29
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,125
everyone is rallying.

30
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,791
They believe in what
we're doing here.

31
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,583
No, you're giving me
too much credit.

32
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,208
It must be due to your
proclamation, Princess.

33
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm truly thankful
for this. I really am.

34
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,541
Just as I'm thankful to you.

35
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,500
And I hope that you're going
to help me with everything

36
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,500
that's still to come.

37
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,625
--Yes, Your--
--Not like that...

38
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,083
Yes.

[EUPHEMIA giggles]

00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,833
[NEWS WOMAN] The specially
administrated zone of Japan

41
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,250
is the first attempt
of its kind in Britannia,

42
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,125
and was personally proposed by
Her Highness, Princess Euphemia.

43
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,708
This youthful inspiration was
an idea from her school years.

44
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,791
It has not only caught
the Homeland's attention,

45
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,250
--but tomorrow's inaugural
--If Princess Euphemia

--broadcast worldwide.
--then even I have to...

48
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,458
The NAC, lead by
Kirihara Industries,

49
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,500
gives its wholehearted
support to the plan.

50
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,416
[SCHNEIZEL] Euphy really
is amazing, isn't she?

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,250
Now the terrorist
groups in Area 11

52
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,708
will lose their popular
support and fall apart.

53
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,416
Public order will be stabilized.

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,166
I personally oppose this.

55
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,125
[SCHNEIZEL] But, since you
understand the situation,

56
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:56,041
you've sent Darlton to
advise her, have you not?

57
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,416
To ensure public policy
stays on track.

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,166
It's a measure that a viceroy
would obviously take.

59
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,250
[SCHNEIZEL]
Hm.

60
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,833
Did you approve
her future plans

61
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,291
as the viceroy or
as her older sister?

62
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,458
[CORNELIA grunts]

63
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,333
The Japan special zone
doesn't sound that bad.

64

[KUBOUIN]
A shadow of Japan

65
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,041
that's given to us out
of pity is worthless.

66
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,541
We were granted this
concession by the Britannians

67
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,666
as a result of our
resistance efforts.

68
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,291
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

69
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,625
Lord Kirihara!

70
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,125
I heard a rumor
that you'll be given

71
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,916
a favored position
in the special zone

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,333
in exchange for the
Sakuradite mining rights.

73
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,583
[KIRIHARA]
Don't be suspicious.

74
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,250
It's merely a request
to join the ceremony.

75
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,750
[KUBOUIN]
That's a clever excuse.

76
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,875
[KIRIHARA]
How dare you!

77
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,458
Zero.

78
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,916
What about him and all
of the Black Knights?

79
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,958
[TOHDOH]
The situation is serious.

80
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,416
It's not only supporters.

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,083
Some of the members
within our own ranks

82
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,291
have already applied to
join the special zone.

83
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,500
Unlike the Black Knights,
there's no risk involved

84
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,708
in signing up for the
Japan special zone.

85
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,291
Besides, when you compare
the pedigreed princess

86
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,625
with the mysterious
unknown man behind the mask,

87
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,083
it's obvious which one
exudes more appeal.

88
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,125
[MINAMI]
There's a rumor that

89
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,583
Kyoto's cooperating
with them, too.

90
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,791
[TAMAKI]
What's up with that?!

91
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,875
They're offering
equality, that's why.

92
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,083
Equality, my ass!

93
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,791
Don't just accept
their word for it!

94
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,791
I agree.

95
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,750
[KALLEN]
Mm?

96
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,750
[ASAHINA]
But unless we decide

97
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,750
how to respond to
this quickly...

98
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,625
[OHGI] You want to apply
to the special zone?

99
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,666
[VILLETTA] Because there it
won't make any difference

100
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,500
who's a Britannian
and who's an Eleven.

101
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,541
[OHGI]
Listen--

102
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,250
If it works like
Euphemia's proposal,

103
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,000
then it wouldn't be wrong
for the Black Knights

104
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,500
to support this, right?

105
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,791
Yeah, sure, like Britannians
would ever honor a promise!

106
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,708
I think we should
support the zone.

107
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,000
It doesn't contradict
what Zero said, does it?

108
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,250
But Ohgi, that's--

109
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,416
First off, if we accept
peace on their terms,

110
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,625
we'll be forced to disarm.

111
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,583
That is a problem, isn't it?

112
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,625
We would also get
swallowed up in their regime

113
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,041
and lose our independence.

114
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,791
[DIETHARD] On the other hand,
if we don't support it,

115
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,708
then we're against
equality and freedom.

116
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,875
[OHGI]
Then let's support it!

117
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,291
What, without any
guarantees in place?

118
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,125
[OHGI]
But we can't ignore it, either!

119
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,125
[LELOUCH] Sorry about having
you drop me off like this.

120
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,333
Hey, you helped me go
shopping after all.

121
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,083
Besides, I heard that you were
gonna go meet up with Shirley.

122
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,166
She might need me
to go shopping, too.

123
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,458
Britannians shouldn't be worried

124
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,583
just because of the
special zone starting up.

125
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,375
Oh, yeah, I think
you're right about that.

126
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,958
Anyway, you'd better make up
with Shirley pretty soon, buddy.

127
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,750
[NOBLEMAN] I don't care
about your "special zone"!

00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,750
It's a Nobleman, a
shining example of class.

131
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,458
[NOBLEMAN] You think
you're equal to us now?!

132
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,875
The lower classes should
simply obey their betters

133
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:23,958
without any backtalk!

00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,500

--[LELOUCH] There it is.

135
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,833
That's the true nature of the
sub-viceroy's "benevolence."

136
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,208
[NOBLEMAN]
What do you want?

137
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,375
Doesn't it feel good to
look down from above?

138
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,625
It is rather like being a god.

139
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,833
Hold it, school boy.
Just back off.

140
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,416
[LELOUCH] I think you
should go home right now.

141
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,458
Yeah, okay, I will.
Well, I'd better get going.

142
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,375
[NOBLEMAN] Huh? What
did you say to him?!

143
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,916
Come back here at once!

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,291
[LELOUCH]
What's wrong, Sir Nobleman?

145
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,625
Confusing borrowed power
with your own ability

146
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,208
is a big mistake, you know.

147
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,916
Garbage like you
should simply die

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,583
and be thrown out where no--

149
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,625
All right, already,
let's break this up!

150
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,916
Mister, why don't you
apologize? Whaddya say?

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,833
Apologize?! You insolent whelp!

152
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:08,875
Go away!

153
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,208
[NOBLEMAN]
Uh... Hmph!

154
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,916
[KID]
Um... Thank you very much.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,125
[LELOUCH]
It was nothing.

156
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,333
[SHIRLEY] He came to
the aid of that Eleven,

157
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,500
even though he's Zero!

158
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,166
Or because he's Zero!

159
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,458
So, why would he have been
talking to Princess Euphemia?

160
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,833
Stop it.

161
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,791
If I dig too deep,
it'll be dangerous.

162
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,833
[DARLTON]
The NAC...

163
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,500
Or rather, Kyoto, as it's
known among the terrorists.

164
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,333
Tomorrow, after the ceremony,

165
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,041
why don't you dissolve your
group and leave Mt. Fuji?

166
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,583
We can talk about
a legal agreement

167
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,541
if you hand over the mining
operation to us peacefully.

168
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,750
[KIRIHARA]
Uh...

169
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,083
[DARLTON] Of course,
that will mean the end

170
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,125
of your support to
the Black Knights.

171
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,166
Whether Zero comes tomorrow
or not doesn't matter.

172
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,958
With this, that man's
downfall is assured.

173
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,000
[LELOUCH chuckles]

174
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,916
--[NUNNALLY] Hm?
--[LELOUCH] I'm back.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,708
Hello, Lelouch. Welcome home.

176
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,125
Oh, where's Shirley?

177
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,333
I'm sorry, Nunnally,
she never showed up.

178
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,083
I wasn't able to get
a hold of her, either.

179
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,833
More of her getting
back at you, huh?

180
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,250
Well, you have seemed
sort of chilly toward her.

181
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,250
You think so?

182
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,625
Then I'll be nicer.

183
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,500
Um, Sayoko, would you
bring us some tea, please?

184
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,666
Yes. As you wish, my lord.

185
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,791
I get the feeling you're worried
about something, Lelouch.

186
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,791
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

187
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,416
[NUNNALLY]
Does it involve Euphy?

188
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,208
It'd be selfish to say that
I want to see her again.

189
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,583
I'd like to, I admit it,

190
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,375
but that would simply cause
trouble for you both.

191
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,083
[LELOUCH]
You like Euphy, don't you?

192
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,666
[NUNNALLY]
Yes, very much.

193
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,208
The same way you like her.

194
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,875
[LELOUCH]
Yeah... I did like her.

195
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,375
[REPORTER] We're bringing you
live coverage from the stadium

196
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,583
where the inaugural
ceremony will be held

197
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,458
for the specially
administrated zone of Japan.

198
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,625
The place is already
packed full with Elevens--

199
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,416
Sorry, I mean with Japanese--

200
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,875
and those unable to get in are
gathered outside the stadium.

201
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,750
[REPORTER 2] Leslie, do you
think Zero will show up here?

202
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,125
[LESLIE] No, and we've heard
nothing about it at this time.

203
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,375
[HIGH OFFICIAL chuckles]
Will Zero even show up?

204
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,333
I seriously doubt it.
What do you think?

205
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,416
[E.U. CHAIRMAN] If the data
we have on the man is accurate,

206
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,541
then I don't believe
he will, either.

207
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,208
Princess Euphemia, it's time.

208
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,458
Right.

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,708
[STADIUM gasping, chattering]

210
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,083
[EUPHEMIA gasps]
Huh?

211
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,291
Zero!

212
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,208
[MAN 1]
It's Zero!

213
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,750
[MAN 2]
Zero is here!

214
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,750
Oh! He came after all!

215
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,916
You accept that you've lost?

216
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,625
[KIRIHARA]
What are you doing?!

217
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,625
I thought I would have
to carry your identity

218
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,125
with me to the grave!

219
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,083
If people discover that
Zero is a Britannian prince,

220
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,541
it's all over!

221
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,166
They'll mistake this for a
farce planned by the Empire!

222
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,500
That would even cause

223
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,833
the specially administrated
zone to fall apart!

224
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,166
[CAPTAIN]
Your target is Zero.

225
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,958
If he makes any suspicious
moves, kill him at once.

226
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,541
[MEN]
Yes, my lord.

227
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,916
[EUPHEMIA] Zero! Welcome to the
specially administrated zone!

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,250
[ZERO] Greetings,
Euphemia li Britannia!

229
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,666
I wish to request an
audience with you!

230
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,000
Just with me?

231
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,625
[ZERO]
Yes, with you alone!

232
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,000
[LESLIE] Something
major has happened here,

233
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,125
ladies and gentlemen!

234
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,083
Zero has just
appeared in the open!

235
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,000
Under Princess
Euphemia's direction,

236
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,708
he is moving toward the G1.

237
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,166
[CECILE] I'm afraid
something's going to happen.

238
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,125
We should have gone
there like I thought.

239
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,375
[LLOYD]
What for?

240
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,000
It's not as if we had
choice in the matter.

241
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,125
Everyone said that if
Lancelot was there waiting,

242
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,666
Zero wouldn't show.

243
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,708
[BODYGUARD 1] It appears
to be safe, Your Highness.

244
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,791
Then this way, please.

245
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,500
Princess Euphemia,
it's too dangerous

246
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,708
to be alone with this man.

247
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,208
As your knight,

248
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,708
I request that you allow me
to accompany you to safety!

249
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,125
No, it's all right.

250
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,208
Please, just trust me, Suzaku.

251
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,333
[TAMAKI]
C'mon...

252
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,250
How long are we supposed
to hang around here?

253
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,291
What, it's not enough for you

254
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,250
that Zero instructed
us to wait here?

255
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,625
Yeah, whatever...

256
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, first of all,

257
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,916
we have to confirm the
empire's true intentions.

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,833
[TOHDOH]
Deputy-commander?

259
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,083
Uh-- Yes.

260
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,750
[TOHDOH] Zero knows
their real intentions.

261
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,208
Isn't that why
he told us to hide

262
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,541
and wait in all four directions?

263
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,250
[OHGI]
A risky assumption!

264
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,500
[TOHDOH] He's even got Diethard
and Rakshata standing by.

265
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:20,208
Zero is probably planning
to assassinate Euphemia.

266
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,666
[EUPHEMIA] Even though
the cameras are off,

267
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,041
you're still being
extremely careful, aren't you?

268
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,041
[ZERO] I've been in
hiding for a long time

269
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,375
due to a certain
empire, I'm afraid.

270
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,375
This is a needle gun made
from ceramic and bamboo.

271
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,750
It can't be picked up
on a metal detector.

272
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,708
Lelouch, you would never
shoot me, would you?

273
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,416
No... I would never do that.

274
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,666
You'll be doin' the
shooting, Euphy.

275
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,125
Huh?!

276
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,750
Is this really all right,
leaving her alone with Zero?

277
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,416
But she ordered us to.

278
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,625
[BODYGUARD 2]
Well, she can always press

279
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,958
the emergency call button.

280
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,291
[SUZAKU gasps]

281
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,166
[SUZAKU gasps]

282
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,791
--[BODYGUARD 3] Hm?
--Is there something wrong?

283
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,708
Why are you here?
What are you doing with Zero?

284
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,666
[C.C.]
It looks like he can see me.

285
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,416
Is that because of
our indirect contact

286
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,791
and what occurred
at Kamine Island?

287
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,583
Or is it because he--

288
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,375
But if that's the case, then...

289
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,041
[LELOUCH] This ceremony
is being broadcast globally

290
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,625
and the world is
going to witness you,

291
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,833
a Britannian princess,
shoot Zero.

292
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,583
What do you think
will happen next?

293
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,708
Rioting would
break out, I imagine.

294
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,125
[LELOUCH]
Right.

295
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,208
Zero will become a martyr,
tricked into a deathtrap,

296
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,333
and instantly, your popularity
will crash to Earth.

297
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,458
What kind of nonsense
are you saying?

298
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,333
You should just help
me to rebuild Japan.

299
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,125
[LELOUCH] If you force
it upon us from on high,

300
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,875
then you're as bad
as Clovis was!

301
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,125
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

302
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,250
[LELOUCH] All tasks at
hand have been cleared.

303
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,875
After hovering near death,
Zero will be met with cheers

304
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,750
when he makes a
miraculous recovery.

305
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,750
Because people don't
give a damn about reason,

306
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,166
but nobody can resist miracles.

307
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,916
Now, take the gun.

308
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,208
Huh...?

309
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,791
There can only be one
messiah, you understand.

310
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,000
And when the people realize that

311
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,041
you're a false one,
they'll-- Ugh!

312
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,875
I-- I thought so.

313
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,833
I need to know one thing.
Are you the-- [groans]

314
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,833
[LELOUCH groaning]

315
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:21,916
[C.C. groans]

316
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,583
No... He's reached
that... point...!

317
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,083
[SUZAKU]
Hey! What's wrong?!

318
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,125
[gasps]

319
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,791

320

[BODYGUARD 3]
Major Kururugi!

321
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,000
[BODYGUARD 2] Why you...!
What have you done to him?!

322
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,375
[BODYGUARDS scream]

323
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,458
[EUPHEMIA]
Lelouch!

324
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,416
--[gasps]
--[LELOUCH] Stop it!

325
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,250
Stop giving me your pity!

326
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,000
Spare me your charity!

327
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,166
This is something I have
to achieve on my own!

328
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,583
And so for that, I shall now
stain your hands with blood,

329
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,791
Euphemia li Britannia!

330
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,666
That isn't my name!
I've renounced it!

331
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,041
[LELOUCH gasps]

332
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,416
[EUPHEMIA] There'll probably
be a formal announcement

333
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,750
issued by the Homeland
about it any day now,

334
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,083
but I've given up my
claim to the throne!

335
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,666
But why?

336
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,083
It isn't because you
accepted Zero, is it?

337
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,583
Well, of course.

338
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,583
I have to pay the price for
doing something so selfish.

339
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,125
Those are the consequences.

340
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,875
[LELOUCH gasps]

341
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,166
Yes, but it wasn't difficult for
you to give that up, was it?

342
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,166
And I suppose you
did it for my sake.

343
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,583
[EUPHEMIA giggles]
As conceited as you ever were.

344
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,250
But no, I did it for Nunnally.

345
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,208
[LELOUCH gasps]

346
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,583
[EUPHEMIA]
She told me herself.

347
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,333
"All I want to is to
be with my brother.

348
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,541
and that's all that matters;
I want nothing more."

349
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,125
For that petty reason?

350
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,041
That's right, Lelouch.
That's how I made up my mind.

351
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,250
It made me stop and
seriously reflect on

352
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,583
what was truly
important to me in life.

353
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,000
Do you understand now?

354
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,375
I'm not giving up anything

355
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,083
that has significant
meaning or real worth to me.

356
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,416
And you don't need to worry.
I won't tell anyone about you.

357
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,416
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

358
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,833
[chuckles]
And Cornelia?

359
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,583
It's not like we'll never
see each other again.

360
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,791
Euphy, you are a fool.

361
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,250
An amazing fool.

362
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,208
[EUPHEMIA] I know I'm not
as smart as you, Lelouch.

363
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,125
I've never been able to beat you
at games or studies, however--

364
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,375
However...

365
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,416
In your usual rash
"Euphy" fashion,

366
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,875
you've managed to end
up winning all of it.

367
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,708
When I think of you,
I don't visualize

368
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,625
a sub-viceroy or a princess.

369
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,875
I only see the plain little
Euphy who you used to be.

370
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,625
Then will you join plain
little Euphy and help her?

371
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,833
[LELOUCH grunts]

372
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,416
You are...

373
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,625
You are the worst opponent
I have ever faced.

374
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,125
[chuckles]

375
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,333
You win.

376
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,916
[EUPHEMIA]
Huh?

377
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,291
[LELOUCH] I'll amend my plans
to help out your special zone.

378
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,541
--[EUPHEMIA giggles]
--[LELOUCH] Ah.

379
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,250
But not as your
subordinate, all right?

380
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,750
All right!

381
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,583
Though you haven't got very
much faith in me, have you?

382
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,750
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

383
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,000
[EUPHEMIA]
Did you honestly believe that

384
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,833
by simply threatening
me, I would shoot you?

385
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,083
Oh, no. You've got it all wrong.

386
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,125
When I really want people
to follow my orders,

387
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,750
they will not resist me.

388
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,625
Whether it's to shoot me,
to grant pardon to Suzaku,

389
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,291
or... any order at all.

390
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,708
[EUPHEMIA]
Oh, now you're being silly.

391
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,000
Stop playing with me.

392
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,416
[LELOUCH]
I'm serious!

393
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,625
For example, if I told you
to kill all the Japanese,

394
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,583
it wouldn't matter
how you felt about it.

395
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,208
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

396
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,625
No! Don't make me do it, please!

397
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,125
--I'm not...!
--[LELOUCH gasps]

398
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:22,166
Not going to do it... Please!

399
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,458
I don't want to kill them!

400
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,625
--[EUPHEMIA] No...!
--[LELOUCH] Did I...?!

401
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,833
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

402
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,041
You're right.

403
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,125
I have to kill all the Japanese.

404
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,458
[LELOUCH]
I've become like Mao!

405
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,666
I can't control my Geass power!

406
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,166
[LELOUCH] Forget the
order I just gave you!

407
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,250
Euphy!

408
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,750
Wait, Euphy! Don't!

409
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,208
[SCHNEIZEL]
Right.

410
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,625
I've reached an agreement
with the Chinese Federation,

411
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,958
therefore I should be returning
to the Homeland today.

412
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,875
Should we keep the
experimental subject

413
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,041
here then, Your Highness?

414
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,041
[SCHNEIZEL]
Yes. How intelligent is he?

415
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,750
Our resources are
rather limited in Area 11.

416
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,125
[SCHNEIZEL]
I see.

417
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,541
We should ask the Rosenberg
Institute about that.

418
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,166
Very well, I'll
arrange it with them

419
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,833
for you to send over
the experimental subject.

420
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,208
[BARTLEY]
Understood.

421
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,166
Then, what do we do with
the ruins on Kamine Island?

422
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,750
We have to wait to do anything

423
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,208
until the security situation in
Area 11 has been stabilized.

424
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,000
We can thank the specially
administrated zone for that.

425
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,166
Owing to Euphemia, everything's
going to work out perfectly.

426
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,125
Sub-viceroy, where's Zero?

427
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,583
[EUPHEMIA] Those of you who
call yourselves Japanese,

428
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,250
I have a favor to ask!

429
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,625

I was hoping you'd all
just commit suicide,

but you can't, can you?

437
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,583
Okay, soldiers, please
kill the Japanese!

438

stand in my way.

Perfect! That clears up
our last problem, then.

[DIETHARD] I have no idea how
you arranged the situation,

00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,625
[DARLTON groans]

513
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,000
[LELOUCH grunts]

514
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,041
[C.C.] I'm shocked. I didn't
think you'd go this far.

515
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,416
[LELOUCH]
It wasn't me.

516
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
What?! [gasps]

517
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,875
This time, I didn't
use the power.

518
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,166
Or I should say, I didn't
mean to use my Geass.

519
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,250
[C.C.]
I see...

520
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,083
Then what I felt earlier was...

521
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,500
I knew there were risks
when we made our contract.

522
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,416
You told me how dangerous
this power could be.

523
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,458
Nonetheless...!

524
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,666
[EMPEROR cackling]

525
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,083
Yes! You're worthy of
being called my child now!

526
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,583
[SCHNEIZEL gasps]
What madness is this?!

527
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,791
[BABY crying]

528
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,458
[GUILFORD]
Princess Cornelia, wait!

529
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,875
Don't follow me unless
you wanna come along!

530
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,208
[SUZAKU]
Euphy!

531
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,500
Have you located her
yet? Where is she?!

532
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,916
[CECILE]
I don't know!

533
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,708
We haven't been able to contact
General Darlton, either!

534
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,541
[MUNAKATA]
Something's dreadfully wrong.

535
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,458
Euphemia would never
do such a thing.

536
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,083
[OSAKABE] I wish there was
room to negotiate here,

537
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,250
but we can't be connected
to Kirihara now!

538
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,666
[KUBOUIN] Mm. We need
to save ourselves first.

539
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,958
Yes, and the "souvenir,"
is it ready?

540
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:20,833
[KAGUYA]
How pathetic.

541
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,166
[GROUP]
Hm?

542
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,458
Your survival is all
that counts in all of this?

543
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,791
My Lady, you really
shouldn't speak like that.

544
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,583
We need to survive for
the sake of Japan as well.

545
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,833
But then what's the point
if we're all that's left?

546
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,125
Watch your tongue, Kaguya!

547
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,708
You're just a girl
with family rank!

548
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,916
What purpose is having
Kyoto if we don't act now?!

549
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,791
[SUZAKU] I can't believe Euphy
would order the slaughter

550
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,708
of all those innocent people!

551
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,208
I've got to find her,
no matter what!

552
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,291
[WOMAN 3]
Huh?

553
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,083
[PEOPLE scream]

554
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,625
Hey! The Britannian forces have
begun moving out of the stadium!

555
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,500
[ZERO]
Right.

556
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,000
In this case, our only option is

557
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,583
to exploit Euphemia
to the utmost.

558
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,791
It's the... least we can do...

559
00:21:58,875 --> 00:21:59,875
[C.C. sighs]

560
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,708
[gasps]

561
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,125
[PILOT 2]
Attention, Zero!

562
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,750
Return that unit! It's
property of our military-- Ah!

563
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,416
[ZERO] This is my order
to all Black Knights!

564
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,458
Euphemia has become our enemy!

565
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,458
The specially
administrated zone of Japan

566
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,541
is a cowardly trap
designed to lure us in!

567
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,875
All armored autonomous
battle knight units,

568
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,708
advance on the ceremony
grounds and wage an attack!

569
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,958
Wipe out all Britannian forces!

570
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,208
Save the Japanese! Hurry!

571
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,375
I have to!
I must find Euphy!

572
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,375
[LELOUCH]
Find her and kill her!

573
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,083
[LELOUCH]
Who is the one responsible

574
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,875
for creating this situation?

575
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:12,000
Who is the one to bear the
sin for this grotesque tragedy?

576
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,708
Who is the one craving
for this battle?

577
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,750
And who is the one who
possesses the world?

578
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,125
Yes. I understand.

579
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,125
But, even so...
Even so, I...!
