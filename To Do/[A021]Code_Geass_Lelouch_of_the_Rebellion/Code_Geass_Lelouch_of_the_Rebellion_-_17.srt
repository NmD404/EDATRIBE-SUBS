1
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,000
[C.C.] The young
Britannian, Lelouch,

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,458
is faced with a choice
between two divergent paths.

3
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,041
One leads to the past

4
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,875
in a quest to find
his mother's enemies.

5
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,916
The other way takes him to
the future where he will create

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,250
a world in which his
little sister, Nunnally,

7
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,000
can live happily.

8
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,625
Only Lelouch can choose
which direction he will go.

9
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:40,958
Will he follow the path

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,125
that ends in destruction
of the world?

11
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,833
Or will he travel the road to
building a bright, new one?

12
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,041
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku...

13
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,458
I finally understand.

14
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,541
You...

15
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,750
[LELOUCH] Suzaku.
What Mao said...

16
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,875
Did you do it?
Did you kill your own father?

17
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,000
[gasps]

18
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,750
I see.

19
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,041
It's not just
your secret, is it?

20
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,125
Lelouch, I...

21
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,458
[LELOUCH]
Kirihara!

22
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,708
I think that was
the old man's name.

23
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,666
He claimed that Prime Minister
Genbu Kururugi killed himself

24
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,583
in order to stop all of
those in his cabinet

25
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,875
who called for
do-or-die resistance.

26
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,041
The story was a necessary one.

27
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,333
For Japan, and Britannia.

28
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,333
Thank you for that.

29
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,666
[LELOUCH] Frankly,
he's at odds with himself,

30
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,875
because he used to be different.

31
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,958
He never placed any
importance on another person.

32
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,333
It was tough enough for me
to kill my half brother...

33
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,500
Yet Suzaku killed his father
when he was only 10 years old...

34
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,083
He's been carrying that burden
around all these years?

35
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,458
[RIVALZ] C'mon, Lelouch,
quit moving around, will ya?

36
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,500
[LELOUCH gasps]

37
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,458
O-Oh, sorry, guys.

38
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,000
[RIVALZ] No, your
sight line was lower.

39
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:32,916
[LELOUCH]
Like this?

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,416
[RIVALZ]
Too far! Little higher!

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,166
[LELOUCH]
Good?

42
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,333
[RIVALZ groans]

43
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,541
Now your expression's
totally different

44
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,916
from when we started!

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,958
This was like this...
That went kinda like that...

46
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,208
And this was here...

47
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,333
There!

48
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,208
[GIRL ART A]
That's not how he was!

49
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,750
[GIRL ART B] I like
the frowny face more!

50
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,041
[RIVALZ] Come on, everyone!
I prefer him looking clueless.

51
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,041
Shirley, don't we have
math for first period?

52
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,875
Don't you remember?
It's Art Week?

53
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,583
Prince Clovis had
declared it that.

54
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,625
[CURATOR] We will open
Art Week with the dedication

55
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,125
of the Clovis Memorial
Museum of Art.

56
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,250
You, Princess Euphemia, will
select the First Place winner

57
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,666
from among these
submitted works.

58
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:11,000
[EUPHEMIA]
Oh, this one's nice.

59
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,875
I particularly
like this painting.

60
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,250
It's regrettable that
our investigation revealed

61
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,083
that the artist happens
to be one-quarter Eleven.

62
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,833
Perhaps it shouldn't
have been displayed here

63
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,250
in the first place, then.

64
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,875
[CURATOR] Well it's a delicate
balance with our public.

65
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,958
Anyway, take a look
at that painting right there.

66
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,166
It was painted by the
son of Marquess Nicolai.

67
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,583
[OHGI]
Octopus hotdogs...

68
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,208
Hmph. That girl...

69
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,625
[INOUE]
Excuse me...

70
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,875
No, these aren't
what you think!

71
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,083
[INOUE]
We have visitors.

72
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,000
They also have an
introduction from Kyoto.

73
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,708
You're the...
Four Holy Swords?!

74
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,291
I'll get straight
to the point here.

75
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,291
We've come to you today
to ask you for your help.

76
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,458
Uh, how do you mean?

77
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,250
Lt. Col. Tohdoh
has been apprehended.

78
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,041
He sacrificed himself
so that we could escape.

79
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,416
[LELOUCH]
I see. We'll help them.

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,958
You sure?

81
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,833
[LELOUCH] The Black Knights
fight for the cause of justice.

82
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,875
There's nothing odd about that.

83
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,416
[OHGI chuckles]

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,375
[GROUP sighs]

85
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,083
We'll use assembly
method B-13.

86
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,750
Take the sectioned
Knightmares via course 18.

87
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,375
You can have Diethard handle it.

88
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,916
Also alert those who are
to rendezvous with us.

89
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,250
Sorry I didn't meet with
the Chinese Federation.

90
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,291
Don't worry about it.

91
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,958
I've revised all
our plans with them.

92
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,958
Making any changes in
your usefulness to me

93
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,833
will only hinder the plan.

94
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,333
Besides, two chess pieces
I've been wanting

95
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,750
will be mine today.

96
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,541
And with any luck, a third...

97
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,583
[GUILFORD] Today, Kyoshiro
Tohdoh will be executed.

98
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,041
[CORNELIA]
I won't be present for that,

99
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,500
now that the Japan
Liberation Front is defunct.

100
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,500
[GUILFORD]
Right.

101
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,000
[CORNELIA]
No, wait.

102
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,708
Let him handle
the execution.

103
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,708
[EUPHEMIA]
Viceroy!

104
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,916
--[CORNELIA] Hm?
--[GUILFORD] Huh?

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,166
[CORNELIA] Sorry to
summon you like this.

106
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,708
How's everything at the museum?

107
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,500
The dedication is later on.

108
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,916
Of greater importance, though,

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,500
the N.A.C. reported there
was unrest in Ishikawa.

110
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,583
Probably backed by the E.U.
or the Chinese Federation.

111
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,541
And there have also been
sighting of Gun-Rus.

112
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:14,500
Still, it's our chance to
bring Hokuriku under control.

113
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,291
I'll leave Darlton
here while I'm gone.

114
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,375
If anything happens,
consult him.

115
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,375
Also, concerning what
we spoke of earlier...

116
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,416
[EUPHEMIA]
Huh?

117
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,750
[CORNELIA] You may choose any
one of them to be your knight.

118
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,750
They're all excellent soldiers
from respected families.

119
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,708
[NUNNALLY] Yes, the pond does
freeze solid in the winter.

120
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,708
Although, big brother
scolded me once

121
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,541
when he caught me skating on it.

122
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,708
[SUZAKU] We had a pond, too,
at the Kururugi shrine.

123
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,041
It was small, but I
used to catch zarigani--

124
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,291
I mean crawdads, all the time.

125
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,958
[NUNNALLY]
You would catch crawdads?

126
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,125
How?

127
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,375
It's simple.

128
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,000
You just tie a string
to a frog's back leg.

129
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,000
Huh? Frog, as in those things
that sit on lily pads

130
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,458
and go "croak!"?

131
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,041
Yeah, but in Japanese, they
go "kero-kero, kero-kero."

132
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,333
Huh? "Kero?"

133
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,333
--[SUZAKU] Yup. Kero-kero.
--[NUNNALLY laughs]

134
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,833
[LELOUCH] If things
continue at this pace

135
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,708
and keep proceeding
according to plan,

136
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,250
I won't be able to stay
with Nunnally any longer.

137
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,291
That affair with Mao
also drove home the fact

138
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,041
that I need someone to
protect my little sister.

139
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,625
Whoever that person will be,

140
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,583
if Nunnally's the one who gives
him a reason to live, then...

141
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,916
--[NUNNALLY laughs]
--Um? Lelouch?

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,416
I need to... tell you--

143
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,958
[CECILE]
Suzaku!

144
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,041
[LELOUCH]
Who's that?

145
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,500
She's a soldier.

146
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,666
Friends of yours?

147
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,333
Yes.

148
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,750
[CECILE]
I'm sorry,

149
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,416
but I need to pull Suzaku
away from you for a while.

150
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,791
Uh... but, um...

151
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,666
Don't worry,
I told you it's all right.

152
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,458
That guy isn't going
to come back here.

153
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,416
Right.
See you, then.

154
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,208
Please come again, Suzaku.

155
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,250
I will!

156
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,291
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku!

157
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,291
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

158
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,541
When you return,

159
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,208
there's something that
I want to... discuss.

160
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,833
It's an important matter.

161
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,666
Uh-oh.
I'm nervous.

162
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,166
I'll talk to you
when I get back.

163
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,250
Well, it seems that Suzaku's
really important to them.

164
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,208
I'm glad.

165
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,125
Nunnally, you seem...
fond of Suzaku.

166
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,166
Am I right?

167
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,333
I adore him.

168
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,458
But of course, I love you
more than anyone, Lelouch.

169
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,458
I see.

170
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,208
[SOPHIE]
Shirley, I'm gonna go on ahead.

171
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,208
[SHIRLEY] Oh, just
wait up, will ya?

172
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,458
Ah!

173
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,458
Oh, great...

174
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,583
Hm?

175
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,708
[REPORTER A] Sub-Viceroy, is it
true that no Eleven companies

176
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,791
were used in the construction
of this museum?

177
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,625
W-Well, with regard to
that question, I, uh...

178
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,000
We're looking into it right now,

179
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,291
so we have no answer
at this time.

180
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,708
Idiot!

181
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,791
Why bother asking princess
Euphemia about politics?!

182
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,166
[KERIMAN]
Keriman from Interstate.

183
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,041
Your Highness, there
have been rumors lately

184
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,458
that you're close to
choosing your knight.

185
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,291
Um... a knight.

186
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,291
Yes, well, you see I'm...

187
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,666
[CURATOR]
Ladies and gentlemen!

188
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,750
We ask that you please
limit your questions

189
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,166
to those concerning
the museum only.

190
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,125
[BK MEMBER A]
Hey, I heard from Brown Bear.

191
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,625
Salmon's group is moving in.

192
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,083
[BK MEMBER B] Gotcha. Tell
Ohgi it's too soon to reel...

193
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,875
[MINAMI] I told you not to
bunch up all the hydro lines

194
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,416
in one place!

195
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,250
[YOSHIDA] That's why I said it
was different from a Burai!

196
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,958
[ASAHINA] Are you sure
it's a good idea

197
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,541
to throw in with
the Black Knights?

198
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,833
[CHIBA] Can you think
of any other way

199
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,333
to rescue Col. Tohdoh?

200
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,958
[URABE] There's also
what Kyoto said,

201
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,791
that they would lend us
the new models.

202
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,041
Still, their principles
seem to be somewhat off.

203
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,500
We're not ethnocentric,

204
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,666
but after all, you
already know that.

205
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,041
We can worry
about the details

206
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,791
after we've rescued the colonel.

207
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,291
I understand.

208
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,666
But no matter where Tohdoh
may be, it's the place I belong.

209
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,916
[TAMAKI] Look, just stuff
'em in and close the lid,

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,958
for crying' out loud!

211
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,541
It's almost time to move out!

212
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,166
[RAKSHATA] Take your time, and
treat it with the utmost care!

213
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,250
[GROUP]
Huh?

214
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,666
It was far more fragile
than any of you

215
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,958
when I gave birth to it.

216
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,666
[TAMAKI] Huh?
Who the hell are you?!

217
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,291
I am its mother!

218
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,708
[ZERO]
You arrived on time.

219
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,791
Hm? Are you Zero?
It's a pleasure.

220
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,708
I've heard a lot of
things about you.

221
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,083
[ZERO] The pleasure
is all mine, Rakshata.

222
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,708
I've been reading about you
on the net for some time, now.

223
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,250
You have?

224
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,708
[ZERO] The articles relating
to medical cybernetics.

225
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,333
[chuckles] I do hate talking
about the past.

226
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,541
Anyway, here.

227
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,583
[ZERO]
Hm?

228
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,458
[RAKSHATA]
A souvenir from Kyoto.

229
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,875
[KALLEN]
Excuse me...

230
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,791
Is this really going to improve
the interfacing system?

231
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,208
[RAKSHATA]
No, of course not.

232
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,458
Huh?!

233
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,000
It's going to improve
your life expectancy.

234
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,333
I just heard they
changed your executioner.

235
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,708
It's going to be Warrant
Officer Suzaku Kururugi.

236
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,583
You oughta be glad
it's someone you know.

237
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,750
[LLOYD]
Wha...?

238
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,250
You need my signature again?

239
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,291
Even though Princess
Cornelia ordered this,

240
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,708
there are still some
formalities to be followed.

241
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,375
A change of executioner is

242
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,833
the most excepti
of circumstances.

243
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,875
[SUZAKU grunts]

244
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:20,833
[SUZAKU gasps]

245
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,291
What was that?

246
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,750
What happened?!

247
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,208
[LLOYD] Good, now we're free
of this hellish paperwork.

248
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,625
Colonel, we're
coming to save you.

249
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,083
These Gekkas are awesome!
Way superior to Burais!

250
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,083
Yeah! Ya got that right.

251
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,583
[RAKSHATA]
Hmm...

252
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,791
You think the sub-weaponry's
linkage isn't tight enough?

253
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,416
[TECH A] No. However,
I suspect it might be the line.

254
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,708
[TECH B] I'm reading
a 0.7 variance to specs.

255
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,833
[RAKSHATA] Obviously,
those old codgers in Kyoto

256
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,000
need to supply us
with better parts.

257
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,041
[INOUE]
Hm?

258
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,875
[SOLDIER A] My superiors have
just ordered that you be

259
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,458
unofficially executed before
you're busted out of here.

260
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,750
Any last words?

261
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,000
[TOHDOH] It's a life
I gave up once before.

262
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,375
It's worth nothing.

263
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,833
[ZERO] In that case,
I'll claim your life for myself.

264
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,208
What the hell?

265
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,916
[SOLDIER A screaming]

266
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,500
Zero!

267
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,875
[ZERO] Kyoshiro Tohdoh,
the only Japanese who,

268
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,333
seven years ago, brought
the mighty Britannian forces

269
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,875
to their knees in defeat.

270
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,541
You mean Itsukushima?

271
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,500
You want me to perform
a miracle for you, as well?

272
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,958
[ZERO]
That was no miracle.

273
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,333
It ended in victory

274
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,958
because it was based on
excellent intelligence work.

275
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,500
That's why I want you.

276
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,166
[TOHDOH] I pledged my loyalty
to General Katase.

277
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,500
Now that he's dead,
I wish to die, too.

278
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,125
[ZERO]
Don't be a coward!

279
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,166
What?

280
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,166
[ZERO] You must
take responsibility!

281
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,500
Responsibility for the
miracle that you made!

282
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,166
[ZERO] The Area 11
resistance movement

283
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,875
is more intense than that
of any other area because Japan

284
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,791
surrendered before exhausting
all of its military strength.

285
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,833
You failed to continue
the great hope

286
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,875
known as the Miracle
of Itsukushima!

287
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,666
You're saying it's my fault?

288
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,916
[ZERO]
Yes. People grasp at illusions

289
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,750
because they're
desperate for miracles.

290
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:38,166
Why else has there been
such rampant use of Refrain?

291
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,958
You must endeavor!

292
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,916
To the bitter end,
beyond all that's decent,

293
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and then you can die!

294
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,791
Till the name of
Tohdoh the Miracle

295
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,791
has grown ragged and tattered!

296
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,791
You're telling me that
the Japanese people

297
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,916
can't accept their
defeat until then?

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,875
[ZERO] Till now,
they had to accept it.

299
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,791
However, now that
I'm here, there's hope,

300
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,250
because I can likely turn
their dreams into reality.

301
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,708
[TOHDOH]
Heh.

302
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,541
[CURATOR] And now for the
highlight of today's events.

303
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,583
Princess Euphemia will select
the grand prizewinner.

304
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,875
The work of art upon
which you place this flower

305
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,833
will be deemed the winner,
Your Highness.

306
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,208
[CHIBA]
Colonel!

307
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,041
Welcome back,
Col. Tohdoh!

308
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,125
Thank you.

309
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,458
You've all worked
so hard for this.

310
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,583
No effort at all, sir.

311
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,125
[TOHDOH]
Cooperate with Zero!

312
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,125
Eliminate the remaining
forces here!

313
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,250
[GROUP]
Roger!

314
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,208
[LELOUCH] Now all the tasks
at hand have been cleared.

315
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,416
And Nunnally's knight
has already been chosen.

316
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,375
That leaves only--
[gasps]

317
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,291
Damn!
What's he doing here?!

318
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,875
Well, how convenient.

319
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,833
The one problem left to contend
with has come here on his own!

320
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,416
[CURATOR]
Please, Your Highness,

321
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,750
it's time for you to decide.
We can't wait any longer.

322
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,208
I know, but I--

323
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,125
[EUPHEMIA]
But I...

324
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,000
[phone rings]

325
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:10,833
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

326
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:11,541
[REPORTER C]
Hello?

327
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,333
[multiple phones ring]

328
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,250
[REPORTERS]
Hello? Hello?

329
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,500
Escaped?!

330
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,708
They're skilled fighters!

331
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,041
[LLOYD]
Oh, my...

332
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,875
Aren't those new
enemy models amazing?

333
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,250
However, Ms. Cecile...

334
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,583
Yes?

335
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,458
In hindsight, it's certainly
quite fortunate that

336
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,875
the Lancelot's trailer is our
primary means of transport.

337
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,833
No, it's because you
spent our entire budget

338
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,208
on the Lancelot itself.
That's hindsight.

339
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,750
[RAKSHATA]
That's it?

340
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,875
The White Knightmare that's been
giving such trouble to Zero?

341
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,041
Uh, yeah.

342
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,375
[RAKSHATA]
Hm...

343
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,291
[REPORTER A] That's crazy!
One against seven?!

344
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,916
[REPORTER C] But that Lancelot
knightmare is holding its own!

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,416
[KERIMAN]
Whoa, he dodged it!

346
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,583
[REPORTER C]
Wow, and again!

347
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,916
[REPORTER A]
You show 'em, White Knight!

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,833
[DARLTON] Listen, send in
everything we've got.

349
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,333
Lend support to Kururugi,

350
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,875
then make them report that
we're wiping out the terrorists.

351
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,708
[TOHDOH] Zero, do you have any
data available on this unit?

352
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,958
[LELOUCH]
Possibly.

353
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,291
However, I want you to
do exactly as I say...

354
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,208
[TOHDOH] Ah. Very well.
I'll defer to you in this.

355
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,458
All units, give him distance!

356
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,500
[LELOUCH] Its speed
and maneuverability

357
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,916
are truly astonishing.
Nevertheless...

358
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,083
[LELOUCH] Its movements
follow a predictable pattern.

359
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,416
Its initial attack is
always straight on!

360
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,833
It never feints that first move.

361
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,541
[LELOUCH] Once you
dodge that attack,

362
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,750
he immediately moves
to avoid your offensive.

363
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,625
Check the data I'm sending you.

364
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,916
S-5-7!

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,958
[SUZAKU gasps]

366
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,083
Hey... He's really doing it.

367
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,333
[LELOUCH]
Right!

368
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,083
So now, the next move
he makes will be...

369
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,000
falling back to the rear!

370
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,083
Coordinates: X-2-3!

371
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,541
And with that...

372
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,250
...check!

373
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,291
[SUZAKU gasps]

374
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,000
I know this!

375
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,000
Who dares anticipate
my moves?!

376
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,291
No matter!

377
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,750
Dammit! It doesn't have
an ejection block on it!

378
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,000
What?! You mean we
didn't install one?!

379
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,750
[gasps] No way!

380
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,666
Is that really you, Suzaku?

381
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,125
What? Huh?

382
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,416
Zero! What now?!

383
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,833
Give us our next instructions!

384
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,958
Zero!

385
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,333
[LELOUCH] All this time,
it was him?!

386
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,916
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku!

387
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,125
[REPORTER A]
Hey, isn't that--?!

388
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,166
[REPORTER C]
Yeah. The Eleven.

389
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,750
[REPORTER D]
That's Suzaku Kururugi!

390
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,375
[KERIMAN] The one accused
of killing Prince Clovis?!

391
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,541
[REPORTER C]
They let an Eleven--

392
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,500
That's enough!
Turn off the monitor, now!

393
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,708
[EUPHEMIA]
Wait, please!

394
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,708
What?!

395
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,375
I'd like to watch
it to the end.

396
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,583
Good. I can still pilot.

397
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,041
Do not do this, Suzaku!

398
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,625
[gasps]
Col. Tohdoh!

399
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,250
So then. You want to live

400
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,083
more than you want to
follow your own principles?!

401
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,583
Do I disappoint you?

402
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,375
Very well, then keep to your
schedule and execute me!

403
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,333
[SUZAKU gasps]

404
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,458
But why?
Why are you there?

405
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,333
You can't be, because you...

406
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,041
...have to be by
Nunnally's side.

407
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,208
[TOHDOH]
What's wrong?

408
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,041
That's the reason
you're here, isn't it?!

409
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,583
You have become
a cowardly boy

410
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,958
who's afraid of altering
the status quo!

411
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,750
Denying everything in
our society is pointless!

412
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,083
Once I make them trust me,

413
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,541
I'll have the power
to change it!

414
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,416
[TOHDOH]
You're serious?!

415
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,666
I'm dead serious!

416
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,458
[TOHDOH] Then you must
continue down that path.

417
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,500
Huh?!

418
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,875
Regardless of whether
you win or lose,

419
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,541
you'll achieve nothing
unless you're prepared

420
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,083
to sacrifice everything!

421
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,708
And that goes for countries
as well as individuals!

422
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,833
Right!

423
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,458
[KALLEN] Zero, what do we do,
capture him or--Zero!

424
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,458
[SENBA] We're destroying the
White Knightmare! Got that?!

425
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,166
Wait for Zero's orders!

426
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,541
[CHIBA]
We're not waiting!

427
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,833
Captain Senba, take Spinning
Life-or-Death Formation!

428
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,291
[SENBA]
Roger!

429
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,791
[KALLEN]
Don't do it...!

430
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:04,958
No wait!
Stand down!

431
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,000
Don't worry.

432
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,625
It's a synchronized
4-way attack.

433
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,000
He'll never dodge it!

434
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,041
Kururugi, release the
harken booster, quickly!

435
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,708
The password is
my favorite food!

436
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,208
[CHIBA]
It can't...!

437
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:20,791
No way!

438
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,833
Huh?

439
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:29,875
Are you okay?!

440
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,000
Interesting fighting
style he uses!

441
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,250
This time, Asahina,
circle 'round to the left!

442
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,875
Stop it!

443
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:36,958
Zero!

444
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,666
We've done enough
fighting for now!

445
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,708
We achieved our
objective here!

446
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,916
Use escape route 3.

447
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,791
Withdraw immediately!

448
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,833
Mm?

449
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,875
An unwinnable battle's not
the same as a lost battle.

450
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,125
You seem to be well
aware of that, Zero.

451
00:20:58,958 --> 00:20:59,916
Wait!

452
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,125
Now, releasing chaff smoke!

453
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,333
[REPORTER A]
Look, they're running!

454
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,333
[REPORTER C] He fought them
off?! The Black Knights?!

455
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,583
[EUPHEMIA]
Suzaku... well done.

456
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,833
[REPORTER C]
Damned traitor!

457
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,125
Why won't he follow them?!

458
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,750
[REPORTER D]
'Cuz they're Elevens, like him.

459
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,125
[KERIMAN]
Of course!

460
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,625
I thought 1 against 7 was
a bit much to swallow!

461
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,875
[DARLTON]
Hm? Princess Euphemia?

462
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,041
All of you!

463
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,291
I'll now answer the question
you asked me earlier!

464
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,125
You had inquired as
to whom I would select

465
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,625
to serve as my knight, correct?

466
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,166
[MUSEUM VISITORS mumbling]

467
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,375
The knight I have chosen

468
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,500
will be the young man
you see before you!

469
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,083
[EUPHEMIA] Warrant Officer
Suzaku Kururugi!

00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,666
Tohdoh, I... I'm your--

472
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,791
I am your foe.

473
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,750
Hey, isn't Zero coming out?

474
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,791
[KALLEN] No. I called him,
but he won't answer.

475
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,125
[LELOUCH laughing]

476
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,083
What's wrong?

477
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:24,125
[LELOUCH laughing]

478
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:33,000
[LELOUCH laughing]

479
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,541
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku Kururugi.

480
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,375
Is he my enemy?

481
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,500
The man who I intended
to be Nunnally's protector

482
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,333
is now Euphemia's knight.

483
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,625
The Black Knights stand
ready for battle...

484
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,541
but am I ready for this?

485
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,041
Must I carry on regardless...

486
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,416
...so that I can reshape the
world into what I want it to be?
