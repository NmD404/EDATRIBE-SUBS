00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,416
[C.C.]
Imperial calendar year 2017.

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
The colony of Japan,
now re-named Area 11,

3
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,541
declared a war of independence
against the suzerain state of

4
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,750
the Holy Britannian Empire.

5
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,125
This uprising, which came to be
known as the Black Rebellion,

6
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,166
was marked by heavy bloodshed

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,500
and ended with the second
historic defeat for Japan.

8
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,833
Since then, one
year has passed.

9
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,500
The terrorist known
as Zero, presumed dead,

10
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,875
has again appeared in Area 11.

11
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,208
Zero leads an armed
group of Japanese

12
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,625
known as the Black Knights.

13
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:51,291
His true identity:
Lelouch Lamperouge,

14
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,375
the exiled prince of
the Britannian Empire.

15
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,500
[ZERO] Therefore, once
again, here and now,

16
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:38,333
I declare the establishment of
the United States of Japan!

17
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,041
Starting from this moment,

18
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,458
this room shall be the
first dominion of the USJ!

19
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,291
Race, ideology, and
religion will not matter!

20
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,833
Being a citizen will have
but one requirement:

21
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,041
To do that which is just!

22
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,208
I came here to kill...

23
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,375
...Zero.

24
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:00,083
[phone rings]

25
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,416
It's my cell phone.
Nothing else.

26
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,833
[LELOUCH]
Rolo! Are you okay?!

27
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,666
[ROLO gasps]
Lelouch?!

28
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,708
Thank heaven!

29
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,791
I was getting really worried

30
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,458
because I couldn't
get a hold of you.

31
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,666
You aren't hurt, are you?
You're somewhere safe, right?

32
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,250
[ROLO]
What's going on here?

33
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,333
Is the Zero making the speech
right now a different person?

34
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,583
Uh, Big Brother,
where are you right now?

35
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,583
Me? What are you talkin' about?
Especially since-- Huh?

36
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,458
Hello, Rolo, it's me.

37
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,708
M-Miss Villetta?!

38
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,083
Lelouch came back to school,

39
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,375
and he's making up all the
classes that he missed.

40
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,166
You should get back
here soon, too.

41
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,500
Yes, ma'am, I understand.

42
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,916
Well, then? Are you finished
with your phone call?

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,458
It seems all my business...
is finished here.

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,708
The rag-tag remnants
of the Black Knights

45
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,333
and the man claiming to be
Zero are currently hiding in

46
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,708
a section of the Chinese
Federation consulate.

47
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,041
However, there is
no cause for alarm.

48
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,166
Acting Viceroy Guilford has
taken command of the army

49
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,000
in the absence of
wounded Viceroy Calares...

50
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,166
--[door opens]
--[footsteps]

51
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,208
You have the town
jumping, Lelouch.

52
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,208
[C.C.]
Naturally.

53
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,416
[KALLEN]
Uh?!

54
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,041
[C.C.] A new nation
has just been created

55
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,708
in their own territory.

56
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,541
And not to mention, of course,

57
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,875
that it also just
declared war on Britannia.

58
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,750
What's the matter?

59
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,791
When did you two switch places?

60
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,500
[C.C.]
Before the speech.

61
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,708
But I...

62
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,541
[C.C.]
His voice was re-recorded.

63
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,250
The moment "he" appeared,
it was already me.

64
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,750
Just like in a magic show.

65
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,250
You planned it on your own.

66
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,708
We don't like it when
you keep secrets from us.

67
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,750
[C.C.]
"We" don't like it?

68
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,125
You mean, you don't
like it. Do you?

69
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,583
[KALLEN grunts]

70
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,083
Lelouch, open the oven!

71
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,333
[LELOUCH]
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,375
Some salt.

73
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,875
Frying pan.

74
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,833
A fresh egg.

75
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,708
Bechemel sauce.

76
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,208
Put the gelato
on another plate.

77
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,250
Oh, and add the
rosemary to the sorbet.

78
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,083
Then, add the dill
to the sauerkraut.

79
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,000
The Black Forest Cake--

80
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,708
I can't do this by myself!

81
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,750
Why do you only keep asking
me to help with it all?

82
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,083
We didn't have a choice.

83
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,541
Rivalz has no sense of taste.

84
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,791
And of course, she is..

85
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,541
[SHIRLEY groans, screams]

86
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,875
Well, after all, she isn't

87
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,875
the most focused
person in the world.

88
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,000
[MILLY] Oh, just behave and
do what you're told, now.

89
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,583
Usually, a character like you,

90
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,041
would act as the type who
couldn't earn a living.

91
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,208
And he keeps a book of
his household spending.

92
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,208
[LELOUCH]
How'd you know that?!

93
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,291
[RIVALZ]
Oh, jeez, you really do?!

94
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,500
--[clanging]
--[SHIRLEY screams]

95
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,791
[RIVALZ]
Want a towel?

96
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,958
I will get it myself, thank you.

97
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,833
President, can I ask something?

98
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,333
Certainly, although I may
choose not to answer you.

99
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,333
So today... we are celebrating
Rolo and me coming back alive.

100
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,625
[MILLY]
Mm-hm!

101
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,625
You two escaped that
terror attack, all right!

102
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,291
Shirley was practically out
of her mind, the poor girl!

103
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,166
"Oh! If my Lulu's
been killed, I'll--"

104
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,416
[SHIRLEY screaming]

105
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,625
--[screaming continues]
--Hey, where is Rolo?

106
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,541
[MILLY] I spoke with
him, but, you know...

107
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,041
The boy's a lot more sensitive
than his older brother.

108
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,500
That's partly why he doesn't
have any friends, isn't it?

109
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,625
You should simply
say he's quiet!

110
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,000
[MILLY]
Uh...

111
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,875
Not that I mind your dirty hands
on my mouth, but...

112
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,791
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

113
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,125
--[RIVALZ laughing]
--[SHIRLEY] Look at this mess!

114
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,791
[LELOUCH] Nobody remembers
anything about Nunnally.

115
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,458
My little sister's been replaced
by a pretend little brother.

116
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,541
I wasn't the only one
whose memory was rewritten.

117
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:20,250
The entire student council has
been manipulated with, as well!

118
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,458
How dare they!

119
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,166
[AGENT A] Even after the
Babel Tower incident,

120
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,125
Lelouch Lamperouge has
shown no special changes.

121
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,291
[AGENT B]
There are 180 cameras on campus,

122
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,041
as well as 47
undercover observers.

123
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,125
That's 48 observers.

124
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,250
We've found no clues or
information that could

125
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,333
connect Lelouch with the
destruction of Carthage's unit.

126
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,291
Surveillance is perfect.

127
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,083
He has no opportunity
to use his Geass.

128
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,916
If he is Zero, it would be odd

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,583
if he returned
here to the school.

130
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,333
[ROLO]
And what's the status of C.C.?

131
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,750
Where is she?

132
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,083
If she's not in close
proximity to Lelouch, then...

133
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,583
...the odds are very slim that
she would be in the consulate.

134
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,708
[ROLO]
You mean things are the same

135
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,833
as they were before
the incident?

136
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,916
You've still no clue
where C.C. is?

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,833
[VILLETTA grunts]

138
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,041
Those of us in the Office
of Secret Intelligence

139
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,833
will carry on our
mission to capture her!

140
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,500
People, continue observing
the bait as you have been.

141
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,083
[AGENTS]
Yes, My Lord.

142
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,291
[LELOUCH]
The enemy's center is

143
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,625
where their surveillance
data is transmitted.

144
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,500
I can just keep acting
the way I have been,

145
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,583
but the problem is Nunnally.

146
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,833
The fact that all memory of her

147
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,416
has been erased from
everyone's minds

148
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,750
tells me she would never
show up here at school.

149
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,666
In short, the
probability is high

150
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,291
that the Britannian
emperor has my sister now.

151
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,333
I'm dealing with a man who would
use his own children as pawns.

152
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,666
If they learn that I've
regained my memories...

153
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,708
that I've reverted
to being Zero...

154
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,791
Nunnally will be in danger!

155
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,416
I have to plan my
movements carefully.

156
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,708
First, I'll trick the people
they have spying on me.

157
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,375
And then...

158
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,541
[VILLETTA]
Lelouch?

159
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,083
[LELOUCH gasps]

160
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,916
[VILLETTA] Make sure you come
to class tomorrow, you hear?

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,541
Yes, I hear you.

162
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,916
Coach Villetta, you really
should have more faith in me.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,416
[LELOUCH]
Villetta Nu...

164
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,333
A woman I once used my Geass on.

165
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,750
[LELOUCH] I can use my Geass
power on a person only once.

166
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,708
Which means... it won't
work on her any more.

167
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:31,916
That leaves my brother Rolo,
who shouldn't even exist.

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,291
Why don't I begin by
gradually subduing him?

169
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:39,333

we drink tonight will
be a fine vintage!

174
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,416
Unknown craft
approaching from above!

175
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,458
What?!

176
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,875
[EU 1]
The Lancelot!

177
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,583
[EU 2]
Britannia's White Death!

178
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:59,041
[EU 1] Knights of the Round
here at the front line?!

179
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,375
[SUZAKU]
Please surrender.

180
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,625
--[EU SOLDIERS] Huh? What?
--[SUZAKU] You have no

181
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,250
chance of winning.

182
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,833
Anyone who throws his weapon
down will not be shot.

183
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,041
Of all the impertinent--!

184
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,875
Destroy him, dammit!
He's only one knight!

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,416
Then so be it.

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,458
[SUZAKU]
Do you want more?!

187
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,583
[KANON] Allowing him to
conduct a solo operation?

188
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,000
Are you sure?

189
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,375
Kururugi used to be your
subordinate, Your Highness.

190
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,916
[SCHNEIZEL]
He's now the Knight of Seven

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,250
and reports directly
to His Majesty.

192
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,125
Yes, My Lord...

193
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,208
He has been elevated in rank.

194
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,875
He's to be admired.

195
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,750
The world today is
overflowing with despair.

196
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,250
That's why he uses his humility
and sense of duty as a compass

197
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,708
to guide him through
these dark times.

198
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,291
[LELOUCH]
Nina's gone, too.

199
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,083
I wonder if Suzaku
took Arthur with him.

200
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,125
Huh?

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,083
[ROLO]
What's up?

202
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,750
How come you're looking
through the album?

203
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,833
Hey, that's the student council
marathon dance file, isn't it?

204
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,833
You know the Prez.
She runs us ragged with

205
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,708
all these events
she likes to put on.

206
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,541
[ROLO] Oh, that's the
Broken Heart Contest.

207
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,125
[LELOUCH chuckles]
Talk about sad irony.

208
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,375
The Prez stomps
on Rivalz's heart

209
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,166
then presents him with
the award for winning.

210
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,416
[laughs]

211
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,750
Weird how you
happened to escape.

212
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,791
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

213
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,708
[ROLO]
You heard the news, didn't you?

214
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,875
Our military had Babel Tower
completely surrounded.

215
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,541
So how did you do it? How did
you manage to get past them?

216
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,500
What're you talking about, Rolo?

217
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,708
Do you wanna know how I
got away from the military,

218
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,375
or did you mean
to say terrorists?

219
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,666
[ROLO gasps]

220
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,708
I took an emergency corridor.

221
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,041
I tried to call you,

222
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,125
but my cell wouldn't work
in that particular area.

223
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,333
I see.

224
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,666
[LELOUCH]
A locket...

225
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,916
That's right.

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,833
I remember giving it to
Rolo for his birthday.

227
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,291
No, that's wrong.

228
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,208
October 25th... is
not his birthday.

229
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,583
It's Nunnally's birthday!

230
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,416
Rolo, give me that locket.

231
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,416
[ROLO]
Huh?

232
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,750
I don't know what
I was thinking.

233
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,500
That's not a good
gift for a guy.

234
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,708
I'll get you something else--

235
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,083
Don't take it! You gave
it to me! It's mine!

236
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,541
Please don't!
Don't take it back!

237
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,375
Uh... Sure, fine.

238
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,083
You keep it then, Rolo.

239
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,125
[ROLO]
Uh...

240
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,250
[ROLO]
Right.

241
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,583
We haven't observed any changes
in Lelouch's behavior.

242
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,458
There are no indications that
he's used his Geass, either.

243
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,666
[VILLETTA] The order won't
divulge the secrets of Geass

244
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,583
due to its religious nature--

245
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,083
[ROLO gasps]

246
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,750
[AGENT K] Uh, sorry, I can
see you're busy. It can wait.

247
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:42,916
[ROLO grunts]

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,458
[VILLETTA gasps]
Rolo, no! He's one of us!

249
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,250
He's on the same
mission we are--

250
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,500
Wait for orders! [gasps]

251
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,541
[ROLO] There's a chance
he overheard us.

252
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,875
Knowledge of Geass is restricted

253
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,791
to just us two in
the Tokyo section!

254
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,500
We can't take the risk!

255
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,791
But still...

256
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,083
How many of our agents
have you killed so far?

257
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,875
It was the quickest and
most certain method

258
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,375
to keeping the secret.

259
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,875
Or am I wrong?

260
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,291
[KALLEN]
It's been three days

261
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,208
since the United States
of Japan was established.

262
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:20,041
I doubt Britannia is going to
keep glaring at us indefinitely.

263
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,583
There's even talk about
ousting the consul-general

264
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,666
back in the Chinese
Federation's homeland.

265
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,083
And yet, we still
haven't received

266
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,708
any instructions from Lelouch.

267
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,875
What on earth is he doing?

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,791
[KALLEN]
You really are Zero, aren't you?

269
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,958
[gasps]

270
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,250
Of course!

271
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,625
[GAO-HAI]
I can drag out

272
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,958
the extradition negotiations
with the Britannians.

273
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,208
I think I might be able
to buy us up to a week.

274
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll report that to Zero.

275
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,916
As for the Chinese
Federation government's--

276
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,833
[KALLEN]
C.C.! I was just thinking!

277
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:56,916
Wouldn't it have made more sense

278
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,750
for you to have
played the bunny girl?!

279
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,666
[gasps]

280
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,625
Huh?!

281
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,833
Uh!

282
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,666
[gasps, screams]

283
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,083
Zero is... a girl?!

284
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:08,875
Correct.

285
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,208
I'm not Zero!

286
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,833
[C.C.]
Oh, you let on too soon.

287
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,833
You have no sense
of humor, do you?

288
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,083
Don't play around with Zero!

289
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:15,875
[C.C.]
We 

290
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,708
[KALLEN gasps, screams]

291
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,166
It's a pleasure to meet
you, Ms. Kallen Kouzuki.

292
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,458
You're the pilot of the
Guren MK-II, right?

293
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,208
[KALLEN gasps]
How did you--

294
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,875
I'm someone who takes an
avid interest in you people.

295
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,458
--[door opens]
--[XING-KE gasps]

296
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,458
[BLACK KNIGHT]
There's trouble!

297
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,041
It's Ohgi and the
other prisoners!

298
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,083
[KALLEN gasps]

299
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,208
[GUILFORD]
Can you hear me, Zero?

300
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,416
Listen closely. I am Lord
Gilbert G.P. Guilford,

301
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,375
knight of her royal highness,
Cornelia li Britannia!

302
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,625
Beginning tomorrow
at 15:00 hours,

303
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,916
these 256 special
class A felons,

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,208
--who are guilty of treason
--They wouldn't...

305
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,333
[GUILFORD]
against the empire,

306
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,000
will all be executed
for their crimes!

307
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,125
[GUILFORD]
Zero!

308
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,208
If you value the lives of your
people, then you will face me,

309
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,958
one-on-one, in an
honorable duel!

310
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,708
[LELOUCH] Guilford... You've
really gone and done it now.

311
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,583
Lulu! Are you in here
all by yourself?

312
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,500
Yeah. Shirley, don't you
have swim club now?

313
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,166
Yes, I do, but...

314
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,500
You see, I have to go shopping

315
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,333
because I have to
buy a birthday gift.

316
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,666
[LELOUCH]
Whose birthday?

317
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,916
Ms. Villetta, our counselor.

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,250
They all agree I should buy it,

319
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,625
since I'm always the one
who always gets her mad.

320
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,500
Problem is,
I'm incredibly impaired

321
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,166
at picking out presents.

322
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,791
She seems to enjoy liquor,
I could buy her that.

323
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,708
But I don't know what
brand she likes.

324
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,041
Should I go with you?

325
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,208
Huh?!

326
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,916
I could help you select
a present for her.

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,583
[SHIRLEY gasps]

328
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,708
[SHIRLEY]
Y-You would?! Seriously?!

329
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,291
[LELOUCH]
Sure. You ready to go?

330
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,833
[SHIRLEY]
Yeah! Mm-hm!

331
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,333
All right! Now I've got
my scoop! Thank you, guys!

332
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,500
[C.C.] Since you're unable
to control your Geass,

333
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,000
this is for your protection.

334
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,750
[LELOUCH] It only has
to block optical data,

335
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,625
so a normal color contact
lens would work fine,

336
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,750
Don't try to probe
for information.

337
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,583
As you've already guessed,
you're holding a special lens.

338
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,000
Although...

339
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,458
Should your Geass grow stronger
than what you have now--

340
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,166
Well, we'll just have
to end this game...

341
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,541
...before that happens.

342
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,625
[LELOUCH gasps]

343
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,750
Are you're going out?

344

order to carry out my plan!

518
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,583
Somehow, I have to save them.

519
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,791
But at the moment,

520
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:07,750
my phony brother Rolo
is my main obstacle.

521
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,041
It's only logical that

522
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,541
they would assign a
Geass-user to observe me.

523
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,666
But that power of his...

524
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,625
No...

525
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,583
There's a breach I can exploit.

526
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:21,208
For the sake of everyone whose
memories were rewritten, I must!
