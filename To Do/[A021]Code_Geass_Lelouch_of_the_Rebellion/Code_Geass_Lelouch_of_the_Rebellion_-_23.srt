00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,208
[EUPHEMIA] I, Euphemia li
Britannia, bid all of you

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,916
within the sound of my voice
to heed the following command!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Seek out any Japanese
you can find...

4
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,250
And please kill them!

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,958
Leave not a single
one of them alive!

6
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,916
Euphemia has betrayed us here!

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,333
All units, descend
upon the stadium!

8
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,250
Grind the Britannians to dust!

9
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,375
Damn you, Euphemia!
You deceived us!

10
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,291
[SOLDIER 1]
Damn Elevens!

11
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,458
Now I see.

12
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,458
You were planning
this all along!

13
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,125
[chattering, screaming]

14
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,083
[MAN 2]
Crush the Britannians!

15
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,500
[SUZAKU]
Euphy!

16
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,250
Euphy, where are you?!

17
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,666
[SUZAKU]
Get away from me...

18
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,708
I don't have time
to waste on you!

19
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,625
[LLOYD] Oh my, this is
turning into a mess.

20
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,416
How dare you... trampling over
the hopes of our people...!

21
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,458
Euphemia...!

22
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,500
[screaming]

23
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,583
[KALLEN]
Stop it!

24
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,416
[EUPHEMIA yelps]
Are you Japanese?!

25
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,208
You dare raise a hand against
Euphemia li Britannia?!

26
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,250
Huh?

27
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,250
A-ha, so there you are...

28
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,375
...you ridiculous royal puppet.

29
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,833
[EUPHEMIA] Oh! You were on
that island, weren't you?

30
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:18,875
[KALLEN]
Yeah.

31
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,875
Now suffer the hand
of vengeance--

32
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,333
--[ZERO] Wait.
--[KALLEN gasps]

33
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,083
[ZERO]
I'll deal with her.

34
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,041
You defiant Japanese!

35
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,375
[KALLEN]
Now what, Zero?

36
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,708
Do we take her prisoner?

37
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,791
There's no point.

38
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,083
Leave her.

39
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,833
I have to kill them all!

40
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,875
These Japanese people,
they have to die!

41
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,666
It jammed up! I have to--

42
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,750
Hurry!

43
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,333
I think it goes... in here.

44
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,041
[EUPHEMIA] Oh! I thought
you were one of them.

45
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,000
So, I was thinking we could run

46
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,416
the specially administrated
zone of Japan together...

47
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,916
Oh wait... Japan?

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,791
[ZERO]
Yes...

49
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,708
I would have liked that...

50
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,333
You and I, together.

51
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,541
[SUZAKU gasps]

52
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,083
Euphy...

53
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,250
[SUZAKU gasps]

54
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,625
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

55
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,250
Lelouch...

56
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,875
Why...?

57
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,791
[LELOUCH]
Farewell, Euphy.

58
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,041
You may have been the
first girl I ever loved.

59
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,791
[SUZAKU]
No...!

60
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,375
--[ZERO] Suzaku?!
--Why now of all times?!

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,041
[SUZAKU grunts] I'm no match
for that Hadron Cannon!

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,583
I will never allow
you to kill Lelouch!

63
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,791
--Suzaku!
--Get outta my way!

64
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,708
Ahh, dammit!

65
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,208
--[LLOYD grunts]
--[CECILE gasps]

66
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,000
[SUZAKU]
Please...

67
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,708
You have to save Euphy...

68
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,083
Do something! You
mustn't let her die!

69
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,875
[CORNELIA] You still haven't
made contact with Darlton?!

70
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,958
[SOLDIER]
No, Your Highness.

71
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,458
There was a report
he'd been injured,

72
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,833
but nothing beyond that.

73
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:35,833
[GUILFORD]
Viceroy!

74
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,708
Emergency message
from the Avalon!

75
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,916
[CORNELIA]
From the Avalon?

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,416
[GUILFORD]
Yes.

77
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,958
The special zone at Fuji has
fallen to the Black Knights.

78
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,291
What was that?!

79
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,958
[GUILFORD] They're moving
to intercept our forces.

80
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,916
Also...

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,708
Princess Euphemia...

82
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,458
[TAMAKI]
"Equality"?!

83
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,500
You can shove that straight
up your administrative ass!

84
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,541
You lured us into a death trap!

85
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,125
You just made the biggest
mistake of your lives!

86
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,541
You got that?!

87
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,833
--[MOB 1] That's right!
--[MOB 2] Let Britannia burn!

88
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,625
[MOB 3]
Don't screw with the Japanese!

89
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,166
[RAKSHATA]
Lucked out, didn't we?

90
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,333
I can't believe they left

91
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,375
all this footage
and equipment behind.

92
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,041
[DIETHARD]
Yes, once we're done editing,

93
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,125
we can throw it on the net
for the entire world to see.

94
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,708
It's pretty clear which
side justice is on.

95
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,166
[RAKSHATA]
How curious...

96
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,125
You don't feel any loyalty
toward Britannia, do you?

97
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,125
[DIETHARD]
Loyalty?

98
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,333
[RAKSHATA]
Mm-hm.

99
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,541
Btitannia's glory has
ripened on the vine.

100
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,625
My talents are
wasted serving them.

101
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,000
[giggles] You're
more of an honest man

102
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,416
than I thought you were.

103
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,000
[DIETHARD]
And what will you do now?

104
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,250
Hard to say...

105
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,875
The only reason I came
here was to gather data.

106
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,208
But I'd feel bad
abandoning you all.

107
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:50,250
And I find Zero so... amusing.

108
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,916
How wonderful to
finally meet you!

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
[ZERO]
This girl...

110
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,208
...she's a relative of Suzaku's.

111
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,666
Zero...

112
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,750
Are you prepared to work
beside us in what's to come?

113
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,250
--[ZERO] The opposite!
--[KIRIHARA, OHGI gasp]

114
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,750
[ZERO]
From this point on,

115
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,791
the six houses of Kyoto
will be under my control.

116
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,916
I won't hear any objections.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,791
All other paths of
survival for you...

118
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:11,833
[KIRIHARA gasps]

119
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,708
[ZERO]
...have now vanished!

120
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,083
We should inform
Viceroy Cornelia...

121
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,250
Don't worry, I'll be
taking care of that.

122
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,000
Will she last until
we reach the bureau?

123
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,583
[DOCTOR]
I'm afraid not.

124
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,958
I'll contact Prince
Schneizel, then.

125
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,208
Excuse me.

126
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,500

I have to know...

131
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,875
Why did you issue that
order at the stadium?

132
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,250
Order...?

133
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,625
What are you talking about?

135
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,958
Never mind that...

137
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,833
You're Japanese, aren't you...?

138
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,583
[SUZAKU]
Y-Yeah...?

--[EUPHEMIA] No...
--Huh?

[EUPHEMIA]
I mustn't...

think such a thing!

Yes, Euphy?

147
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,791
Did it go all right?

Long have I waited...

All through the struggles
against Britannia's injustices,

156
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,625
I've waited for them to
come to their senses!

157
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,791
But that hope was betrayed...

158
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,833
...by an act of barbarism that
can only be called genocide!

that was there?

How was the ceremony?

Do you think I did... okay?

168
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,041
I hope that bitch burns in hell!

00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,875
Maybe the homeland can help us!

354
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,125
They'll never make it in time!

355
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,375
Then we should evacuate
this area right away--

356
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,583
[CORNELIA]
Don't panic!

357
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,875
--[STAFF] Huh?
--[GUILFORD gasps]

358
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,208
P-Princess Cornelia!

359
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,875
[CORNELIA] I've put the
Glaston Knights on standby.

360
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,708
Place all our forces on
the outskirts of Tokyo!

361
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,416
We can end this!

362
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,333
We just need to take down Zero!

363
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,041
[ZERO] Kill Cornelia,
and the day will be ours!

364
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,750
You all have your orders.

365
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,125
Now be ready!

366
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,333
[ZERO] Diethard, have
Tohdoh handle the front line.

367
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,166
I'm leaving you in charge here.

368
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,666
Yes, very well, Zero.

369
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,000
[ZERO]
You're Sumeragi's--

370
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,291
Thank goodness,
I made it in time!

371
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,750
That was so mean of you,

372
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,333
the way you headed off
to battle without me.

373
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:53,375
I've been a huge fan of yours
ever since your big debut!

374
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,291
I was hoping that I'd
finally get to talk to you.

375
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,666
Wow! You're really
tall, aren't you?

376
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,958
Don't worry though!

377
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,500
I'll catch up with
you pretty soon!

378
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,208
L-Lady Kaguya...

379
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,500
I thought the heads of the
Six Houses remained in Fuji.

380
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,958
I followed after you!

381
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,250
So I could watch my
future husband fight.

382
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,208
[DIETHARD, C.C.]
Huh?

383
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,708
[ZERO]
Don't joke around.

384
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,250
Well, once you win this battle,

385
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,458
you'll eventually need
a wife, won't you?

386
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,416
I mean, I know your identity
is a big secret and all,

387
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,291
but you're gonna need somebody
as your public face, right?

388
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,500
[ZERO]
Really?

389
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,333
You believe we're going
to win this battle?

390
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,458
Of course!

391
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,583
I am the goddess of
victory after all!

392
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,791
[ZERO] I'd be lucky
to have you then.

393
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,625
Unfortunately, I've already
made a contract with the devil.

394
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,666
Huh?

395
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,666
[ZERO] I have no room in my
life for deities right now.

396
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,625
Hurry! We have to get
this experimental subject

397
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,916
back to the Homeland!

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,916
[RESEARCHER C]
The pressure!

399
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,750
The internal pressure is rising!

400
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,875
[RESEARCHER C, BARTLEY scream]

401
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,166
And now of all times...

402
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,416
Good morning to you, it was.

403
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,708
[ZERO]
Hear me, Britannia!

404
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,416
This is Zero!

405
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,041
A rebel against oppressors
who abuse their power!

406
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,791
We will wait until midnight.

407
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,125
You have till then
to surrender to me.

408
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,666
This is your only warning.

409
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,875
Heed it.

410
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,583
Twelve midnight, not
a single second later.

411
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,000
[DALTON groaning]

412
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,041
[T4 PILOT]
General Dalton,

413
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,541
you're in no
condition to do this!

414
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,250
I don't care, I have to be...
at her Highness's side...!

415
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,750
Your little bluff is
meaningless, Zero.

416
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,000
The Tokyo settlement is
an impenetrable fortress.

417
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,333
[C.C.] You can still
turn back, you know.

418
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,958
Your actions here will affect
more than just Area 11.

419
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:56,416
You... and this entire world...
will be steeped in war.

420
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,125
I'm aware of that.

421
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,375
And yet, all the same--

422
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,208
[phone rings]

423
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,208
[LELOUCH gasps]

424
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,958
Euphy? How could
that be possible?!

425
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,750
[LELOUCH]
No, it must be an imposter.

426
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,750
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch, it's me.

427
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,458
Suzaku.

428
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,000
Why are you calling me now?

429
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,166
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch...

430
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,500
Are you at the school?

431
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,041
[LELOUCH]
No, but I will be soon.

432
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,416
[SUZAKU]
I see.

433
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,041
I called because
there's something

434
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,041
I want you to tell
everyone for me.

435
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,083
[LELOUCH]
Yes, and what would that be?

436
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,375
[SUZAKU]
The sky...

437
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,333
Make sure no one
looks up at the sky.

438
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,833
[LELOUCH]
What?

439
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,916
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch...

440
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,083
Is there anyone you
could ever hate so much

441
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,000
that you'd actually
want to kill them?

442
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,041
There is, yes.

443
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,666
I used to feel that sort of
thinking was unacceptable.

444
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,916
That unless you
followed the rules,

445
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,916
killing someone was just murder.

446
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,458
But now...

447
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,458
It's hatred that's guiding me.

448
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,666
I'm fighting to kill someone.

449
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,916
[SUZAKU] I'm going to become a
murderer in the skies of Tokyo.

450
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,166
So please--

451
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,666
--[LELOUCH] Embrace your hate.
--[SUZAKU gasps]

452
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,208
Just think of Euphy.

453
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,875
I made my own mind up long ago.

454
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,500
I have no intention
of turning back.

455
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,791
[SUZAKU]
For Nunnally, you mean?

456
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,458
Yes...

457
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,416
I have to go now.

458
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,833
[SUZAKU]
Thank you, Lelouch.

459
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,208
Forget about it.

460
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,000
I mean, you and I
are friends after all.

461
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,791
[SUZAKU]
For the last seven years.

462
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,958
Right. See ya, then.

463
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,041
[SUZAKU]
Yeah. Later.

464
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,166
What the hell?!

465
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,708
These hands of mine
have been dirty

466
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,791
for a long time now, Suzaku.

467
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,708
You're coming to face me
now doesn't matter at all.

468
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,541
Hell, I welcome it even.

469
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,375
I mean, of course,
you and I are friends.

470
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,541
[chuckles]

471
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:10,875
[laughing]

472
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,291
Perhaps this is what
I've longed for...

473
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,375
...ever since that day.

474
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:19,291
The destruction and
loss of everything.

475
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,666
That's right.

476
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,541
Destruction always
comes before creation.

477
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:28,000
And for that goal, even my own
conscience must be cast aside.

478
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,708
The only path left to me
is straight ahead.

479
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,708
Now then...

480
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,000
[LELOUCH]
That's right.

481
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:10,583
Only by pushing forward
will I find atonement.

482
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,875
Even if my enemy is the
greatest empire on the planet,

483
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,458
there's no turning
back for me now!

484
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,500
Everything is in place...

485
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,583
The time has come to overthrow
the old world order!
