1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,791
[C.C.]
The Japan Liberation Front:

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,916
the largest insurgent
group in Area 11.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,250
Viceroy Cornelia was
determined to crush them.

4
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,541
She encircled the
Narita mountains where

5
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,916
her proud Britannian legions
applied overwhelming force,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,791
sure their "inferior enemy"
was vanquished.

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,166
Then, the Black Knights
made their move.

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,208
Using the Guren Mk-II's
radiant wave surger,

9
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,958
they caused the water veins of
the summit to explode at once.

10
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,958
The mountain collapsed.

11
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,291
Both the Japan Liberation
Front and the main

12
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,333
Britannian forces were engulfed
in mud and rushing water.

13
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:56,375
Cornelia was isolated;
most of her forces lost.

14
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,708
Seeking an unprecedented
reversal, Zero commanded

15
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,541
the Black Knights to
hunt down Cornelia.

16
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,625
[C.C.] In their hearts, everyone
has faith in their own existence

17
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,708
and ultimate triumph.

18
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,083
However, when time
and destiny unfold,

19
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:19,666
this faith turns out to be
quite fleeting and pointless.

20
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,666
[DARLTON]
What are our losses?!

21
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,833
[SOLDIER 1] I've only got signal
from 20 percent of our forces.

22
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,041
[DARLTON]
20 percent?!

23
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,916
Our command structure
can't sustain this!

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,250
[FEMALE SOLDIER]
This is the Marceau unit!

25
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,916
I can't raise General Alex!

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,416
It looks like the second
division's been wiped out!

27
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,791
Lloyd, what's going on?

28
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,958
[LLOYD]
Hmm... It's very unnatural.

29
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,125
Unnatural?

30
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,500
There seems to be
an unconfirmed report

31
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,333
that the Black Knights
have appeared.

32
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,375
--Zero!
--[LLOYD] Congratulations!

33
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,625
This is our chance.

34
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,541
Lloyd!

35
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,375
You're so rash.

36
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,208
[LLOYD]
Huh? Why's that?

37
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,208
Would you like a
detailed explanation?

38
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,250
Uh, no, I'll pass.

39
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,666
Anyway, while the High Command's
still gathering data,

40
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,208
all we can do is
play it by ear, right?

41
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,625
[STAFF OFFICER A]
Is the Viceroy safe?

42
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,375
[STAFF OFFICER B] Yes,
she was outside the mud flow.

43
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,125
But the units guarding
her flank are lost.

44
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,083
That means she's
totally isolated.

45
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,583
What the hell are
those Purebloods doing?!

46
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,833
[KEWELL gasps]

47
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,791
Come on, move!

48
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,583
I can't lose to Elevens!
I am a Brittanian!

49
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:58,500
Lord Kewell!

50
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,625
[LELOUCH]
All right!

51
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,166
Guren MK-II, move to
the planned point!

52
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,833
We'll break through the last
of their line and take Cornelia!

53
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:04,916
--[KALLEN] Right!
--[OHGI] Got it!

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,250
[SUGIYAMA]
Let's pull this off!

55
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,666
[VILLETTA]
Fight to the death!

56
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,125
[SUGIYAMA yells]

57
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,875
[TAMAKI]
Sugiyama! You okay?!

58
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,125
[SUGIYAMA]
Y-Yeah...

59
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,833
[grunts]

60
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:16,708
[BOTH scream]

61
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,125
[squeals]

62
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,250
[BLACK KNIGHT 1]
Get them!

63
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,291
[LELOUCH]
That's right, move swiftly.

64
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,791
If you survive this battle,

65
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,791
you can call yourself
a true warrior.

66
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,291
And afterward...

67
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,333
[STAFF OFFICER A] The Purebloods
are holding their ground?

68
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,208
[SOLDIER 2] Yes, sir!
Under Lady Viletta's command!

69
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,500
[STAFF OFFICER B]
Then use the moment

70
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,916
for the Viceroy to retreat!
Send air cover!

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,166
No, wait!

72
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,166
Something's approaching
the Viceroy from behind!

73
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,000
[TOHDOH]
All units, are you ready?

74
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,291
[HOLY SWORDS]
Yes, sir!

75
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,041
[TOHDOH] All right.
Deploy the custom Burais.

76
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,500
[HOLY SWORDS]
Deploying!

77
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,541
[TOHDOH]
Listen carefully!

78
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,166
If this landslide was manmade,

79
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,541
it should allow us to hit
Cornelia from behind.

80
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,583
Capture Cornelia now!

81
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,041
Take revenge for what
happened seven years ago!

82
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,125
[HOLY SWORDS]
Yes, sir!

83
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,291
By the honor of
the Four Holy Swords!

84
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,125
[CORNELIA]
What?!

85
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,666
[GUILFORD]
Protect Her Highness!

86
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,166
[TOHDOH]
Surround them!

87
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,208
The Japan Liberation Front?!

88
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,333
[TOHDOH]
Slash and encircle!

89
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,791
[HOLY SWORDS]
Right!

90
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,458
These are not just any Burais.

91
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,625
This reminds me
of seven years ago.

92
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,250
But it's different now.

93
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,500
This time we have
Knightmares as well!

94
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,333
Your Highness, leave them to us!

95
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,291
Please, you have
to withdraw for now!

96
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,500
[CORNELIA] Very well, I know
a way to turn this around.

97
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,125
Guilford!

98
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,666
[GUILFORD]
Yes!

99
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,666
After you've driven them back,
meet me over at point nine!

100
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,250
Nine?

101
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,375
I understand!

102
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,708
[SENBA, URABE]
Cornelia!

103
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,041
[CORNELIA]
You weaklings!

104
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,875
[CORNELIA] All right!
Keep this up and crush Zero!

105
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,625
[TAMAKI] Maybe we should
get Kallen over here.

106
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,916
[LELOUCH]
No!

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,416
If we break formation now,
our plan is ruined!

108
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,916
[LELOUCH]
This is turning grim.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If it goes on, we'll be
fighting her royal guard next.

110
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,500
[INOUE] Zero! Cornelia's
under attack down below!

111
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,666
What's that?
Which team made the move?

112
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,916
[INOUE] It's not our people!
Looks like the JLF!

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,666
[LELOUCH] Someone else
understands my intent?

114
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,750
How excellent.

115
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,208
They'll hold off
the royal guard,

116
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,208
which is just what we need.

117
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,541
I'm sorry for the
late arrival, General!

118
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,583
Tohdoh! We've been waiting!

119
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,791
[TOHDOH] General, please
send all remaining units

120
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,791
to join me here.

121
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,583
[KATASE]
Can you beat them?

122
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,125
[TOHDOH] Yes, but only if we
can hold off their main force!

123
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,833
We have a chance now to
turn the entire war around!

124
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,625
[GUILFORD] I've heard Area 11
has a formidable commander.

125
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,208
Their "shining knight."

126
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,916
Is this him? Tohdoh?!

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,041
Fine! Let him try me!

128
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,041
Urgh! At a time like this?!

129
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:42,875
[SOLDIER 3]
What do we do?

130
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,291
[DARLTON]
Fall back!

131
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,583
We have to find a way to link up
with Viceroy Cornelia.

132
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,333
[SOLDIER 3] But sir, their main
base is right in front of us!

133
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,625
And if we're hit from behind,
we'll be wiped out!

134
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,916
You fool!

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If Princess Cornelia's
taken by these Elevens,

136
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,625
this entire battle is lost!

137
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,250
[SOLDIER 3]
Y-Yes sir! [screams]

138
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,708
[STAFF OFFICER A] Sub-Viceroy
Euphemia,

139
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,666
you must act now
to prevent a disaster.

140
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,833
Send in the G1!

141
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,250
[EUPHEMIA]
No!

142
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,375
[STAFF OFFICER B] But Commander
Guilford is completely

143
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,708
pinned down;
he can't get to Cornelia.

144
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,958
Her life is at stake here!

145
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,291
We can't!

146
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,541
There's a field hospital
right here! And civilians!

147
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,750
They've been evacuated
from all over the area

148
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,750
and brought to this point!

149
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,250
Besides, the G1 base
is our command center!

150
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,000
The Viceroy ordered me not
to move it, no matter what!

151
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,041
That's why...
I just can't...!

152
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,458
[gasps]

153
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:30,458
Well, hello there, the ASEEC's
crew reporting for duty.

154
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,541
[STAFF OFFICER A]
Insolence!

155
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,708
[STAFF OFFICER B]
You're irregulars!

156
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,458
Your orders are to
keep silent and observe!

157
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,041
Um, yes sir,
normally we would, but...

158
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,875
But all of this waiting
around is boring.

159
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,166
[gasps]

160
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,875
[SUZAKU]
Sub-Viceroy Euphemia...

161
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,875
I beseech you, please
order us into the battle!

162
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,250
[STAFF OFFICER B]
How transparent!

163
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,500
You just want the glory
of rescuing the Viceroy!

164
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,125
[STAFF OFFICER A]
Our whole army is out there!

165
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,208
You think one unit is
going to change things?!

166
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,666
With an Eleven pilot!

167
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,291
[LLOYD] Right, right, but
what's the harm in trying?

168
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,000
Since it's just one unit,
it won't look bad for you

169
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,208
if we lose, right?

170
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,125
[gasps]

171
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,375
[LLOYD]
Are you listening?

172
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,666
[EUPHEMIA]
Euphie!

173
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,958
Yes, I understand.
Please do it!

174
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:08,833
We got it!

175
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,291
Thank you very much!

176
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,416
Right! I won't fail!

177
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,333
Dammit! He's fierce!

178
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,833
[TOHDOH]
Scatter!

179
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,500
[URABE] Lt. Colonel!
What about Cornelia?

180
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,416
If Zero's the man I think he is,

181
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,291
he's moving into
position right now!

182
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,416
We've got to trust him.

183
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,333
[GUILFORD]
What? Zero's on the move?!

184
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,625
[VILLETTA]
Right.

185
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,833
We'll keep going and
come over and back you up!

186
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,875
Never mind that now,
just track Zero!

187
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,125
[VILLETTA]
Y-Yes, sir!

188
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,166
This is his projected course.

189
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,000
[GUILFORD gasps] The Princess
was trying to trap Tohdoh;

190
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,416
now there's a Knightmare
waiting for her!

191
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,083
Princess Cornelia!

192
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,000
[CORNELIA]
I got the message, Guilford.

193
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,666
[CECILE] Advanced weapon
system Z-01 Lancelot,

194
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,250
utilize sand panels
to climb liquefied slope

195
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,708
at max combat speed
and rescue the Viceroy!

196
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,541
[SUZAKU]
Yes, my lord.

197
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,875
[LLOYD] Suzaku, there's
one thing I want to ask you.

198
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,333
[SUZAKU]
What's that?

199
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,166
[LLOYD] More than anything,
you hate when people die,

200
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,750
yet, you're in the military.
Why is that?

201
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,291
I'm in the military to stop
people from dying.

202
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,583
And that self-contradiction
will get you killed someday!

203
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,750
Ugh! Sorry about that!

204
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,875
Lancelot, now launching.

205
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,125
Cornelia!

206
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,583
[CORNELIA]
Lowborn scum!

207
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,208
[KALLEN gasps]

208
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,375
What's this?!

209
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,250
That's not just
a customized unit!

210
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,666
[receiver beeps]

211
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,250
Can you hear me, Cornelia?

212
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,708
This is checkmate.

213
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,958
[CORNELIA]
Zero!

214
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,583
[LELOUCH] Yes. Should we
celebrate our reunion?

215
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,333
Of course, you'll have
to surrender to us first.

216
00:09:56,416 --> 00:10:00,416
And after that, there are a few
questions I wanna ask you.

217
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,041
And in case you're wondering,

218
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,791
your reinforcements
won't get here in time.

219
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,666
I win, Cornelia.

220
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,708
[CORNELIA]
You're a fool, Zero!

221
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,166
This one!

222
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,750
If I take this one out,
I'm free and clear!

223
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,166
You've got some moves!

224
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,375
[KALLEN growls]

225
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,833
[gasps]

226
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,625
[grunts]

227
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,583
[CORNELIA]
Coward! Attacking from behind!

228
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,125
Really?

229
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,041
And your own attack methods
don't show acts of cowardice?

230
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,000
[DARLTON] They launched a pincer
assault before we could regroup!

231
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,875
I'll never be able to
reach the Princess now!

232
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,500
[screams]

233
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,708
[SENBA]
Lt. Colonel,

234
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,125
we've crushed the
enemy reinforcements!

235
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,291
[TOHDOH]
Right!

236
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,416
Switch to spinning
life-or-death formation!

237
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,875
[HOLY SWORDS]
Yes, sir!

238
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,750
[GUILFORD] If this goes on,
Princess Cornelia will be....

239
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,625
[CORNELIA]
Guilford...

240
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:09,625
Guilford, my knight.
You and Darlton protect Euphie.

241
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,875
[GUILFORD]
Your Highness!

242
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,958
[CORNELIA]
I won't surrender.

243
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,875
As an imperial princess,
I'll fight to the last!

244
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:19,791
[GUILFORD gasps]

245
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,750
[GUILFORD]
Princess Cornelia!

246
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,541
Huh. She's so predictable.

247
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,500
[gasps]

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,166
Oh my.

249
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,083
As reckless as ever, eh?
He's used the V.A.R.I.S.

250
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,333
to clear the obstacles
in his path.

251
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,750
[SUZAKU]
Viceroy, are you all right?

252
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,416
I came to help, Your Highness!

253
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,791
[CORNELIA] Special Corps?
Who authorized you?

254
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,916
He can get her out of there
if it's the Lancelot unit.

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,625
[TAMAKI]
Hey, isn't that Knightmare--

256
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:57,041
[OHGI] Yeah. The one from
Shinjuku and Lake Kawaguchi.

257
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,291
Again?! It's him again?!

258
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,416
MK-II, destroy that
unit immediately!

259
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,083
It's interfered with us enough!

260
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,541
Right!

261
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,750
[gasps]

262
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,791
You handle that thing!
I'll take out Zero!

263
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,750
Now you'll pay for Shinjuku!

264
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,500
[gasps] It's as fast
as the Lancelot?!

265
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,208
If I can take it down...

266
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,583
Is that all you've got?!

267
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,041
[growls]

268
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,916
Blocked!

269
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,750
[screams]

270
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,916
Hey! Are you okay?!

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,375
[KALLEN]
I am...

272
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,416
--[LELOUCH] Ohgi!
--Yes.

273
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,791
[LELOUCH]
How's the Guren MK-II?!

274
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,791
[OHGI] The right hand's wrecked.
We've gotta fix it.

275
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,333
[growls] Retreat!

276
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,833
All Black Knights,
move to your escape points!

277
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,791
This has become a war
of attrition. Retreat!

278
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,000
[SUZAKU]
Viceroy!

279
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,416
Go after Zero!

280
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,291
[SUZAKU]
But--

281
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,250
My energy filler's just drained!

282
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,083
Go!

283
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,541
[SUZAKU]
Right!

284
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,500
[TAMAKI] Ugh, I'm hating
this retreat thing.

285
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,958
[OHGI] We thrashed 'em,
but if we keep pushing...

286
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,791
Face it, we left the JLF there
as bait while we ran away.

287
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,250
I hate when you say it
like that, but...

288
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:50,166
Yeah, but people aren't
just pieces in a chess game.

289
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,000
Zero wouldn't think like that.

290
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,916
If he did, he'd end up
using us as pawns, too.

291
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,833
I don't believe he'd do that.

292
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,166
His rage is real.

293
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,791
He hates Britannia
as much as we do.

294
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,833
And I think a person who
knows rage also knows sorrow.

295
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,583

297
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,166
Found Zero.
Going in for capture.

298
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,625
[SUZAKU]
Zero, I owe you; I know that.

299
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,583
You've saved a lot of people.

300
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,000
I know there are lots of Elevens
supporting you from the shadows.

301
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,500
However, your methods are...

302
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,916
...very wrong.

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,041

[SUZAKU gasps]
Th-That's...

306
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,791
Is it the girl from the
capsule in Shinjuku?!

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Stop now!

308
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,916
Don't even think
about hurting him!

309
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,916
[ZERO]
C.C...

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,458
She's working with Zero?

311
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,333
[ZERO]
Wait! What are you doing?

312
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,583
You're challenging
a Knightmare?!

313
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,958
It's a problem if you die.

314
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,041
It'll be indirect contact,
but it's worth a try.

315

Father... You're dead!

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,375
That's impossible!

319
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,500
No! I didn't mean to!

320
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,208
No, I... I just...!

321
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,583
[ZERO] Hey! Are you
using Geass on him?

322
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,291
[C.C.] I'm just feeding him
some shock images.

323
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,541
I can't tell what
he's seeing though.

324
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,000
Anyway, you've got time
to get away now.

325
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,000
[ZERO]
What about you?

326
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,666
[C.C.]
I can't move yet.

327
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,500
You go first!

328
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,750
[ZERO]
Don't be foolish.

329
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,833
I can't keep owing you favors--

00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,333
[gasps]

349
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,791
[ZERO gasps]

350
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,125
[ZERO]
What's happening to him?!

351
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,666
[C.C.]
Idiot! Get away now!

352
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,958
[gasps]

353
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,416
[ZERO]
C.C.!

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,791
[C.C. grunts]
Hurry! [screams]

355
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,125
[CHIBA]
Damn you!

356
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,416
[TOHDOH]
Don't follow!

357
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,708
I have no idea what
Zero is trying to do now.

358
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,875
Our only course of action
is to get to the General

359
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,958
and get him out of here.

360
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,041
Your Highness!
I'll be right there!

361
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,958
[CORNELIA] Guilford, relay
this message to all units:

362
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:35,958
Prepare to retreat.

363
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,250
[gasps]

364
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,708
[CORNELIA] There's no reason
to waste the lives

365
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,000
of any more of my men.

366
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,125
Stay in formation and
fall back cautiouslly.

367
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:49,375
We have to face facts.
We've been defeated this time.

368
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:53,250
[BLACK KNIGHTS cheering]

369
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,958
You see? Britannia
sure had its hands full

370
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,125
just dealing with the
Liberation Front!

371
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,416
Yeah.

372
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,958
That gave us the chance
we needed to escape.

373
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,000
[KALLEN]
Hey, where's Zero?

374
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,208
I can't raise his Burai.

375
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,708
You don't think he's been
captured, do you...?

376
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,291
[LELOUCH] This girl,
she can't be human.

377
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,166
She recovers from wounds in
ways that are beyond normal.

378
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,291
She was shot in the head
in Shinjuku, and yet...

379
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,041
Clovis confined her for
his private experiments,

380
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,625
so she's not connected
with Britannia.

381
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,958
Her vital signs are
at human levels.

382
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,833
I'd better analyze
a blood sample later

383
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,083
and photograph the wounds.

384
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:33,833
[gasps]

385
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,291
[whimpers]

386
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,541
[LELOUCH]
What?

387
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,541
[gasps]

388
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,666
You finally called me...
by my real name.

389
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,500
[CORNELIA]
So Zero escaped again.

390
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,458
[GUILFORD] The Japan Liberation
Front hammered our defenses

391
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,833
and he slipped away
in the confusion.

392
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,166
Despicable. Using someone
else to cover his movements.

393
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,250
Oh, what about Kururugi?

394
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,500
[GUILFORD]
He's safe now.

395
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,166
We had to wait till his
energy filler ran out

396
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,041
to finally stop him.

397
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,000
[CORNELIA]
Stop him from what?

398
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,833
Was there a problem
with his unit?

399
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,625
[GUILFORD] Apparently.
It was going berserk.

400
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:23,458
[CORNELIA] A failure unworthy
of my older brother's forces.

401
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,416
[LELOUCH] I removed the shrapnel
and cleaned the wound.

402
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,041
[C.C.]
That wasn't necessary.

403
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,458
[LELOUCH]
Apparently not.

404
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,208
[C.C.] So, there was no point
in protecting me at all.

405
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,958
Your pride always
gets in the way

406
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,958
at the most ridiculous moments.

407
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,708
But then I learned
something from it.

408
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,875
Hmph.

409
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,291
[water drop echoes]

410
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,458
[gasps]

411
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,416
[LELOUCH]
That's your name, isn't it?

412
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,791
You have a bad habit
of eavesdropping.

413
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,666
[LELOUCH]
Well, it's a good name.

414
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,875
It's a lot more
human than C.C...

415
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,625
[C.C.]
Oh, that's a joke.

416
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,541
As if I want to be more human.

417
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,541
After all,  I've-- I...

418
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,833
[C.C.]
I've forgotten everything.

419
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:14,375
Every single thing...
So what's the use of it?

420
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,833
A name? But why?

421
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,916
It's a good time
to say this. Yes...

422
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,708
You saved me today.

423
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,875
[LELOUCH]
You did that before

424
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:37,166
and gave me Geass. That's why
I'll only say this once...

425
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,708
[LELOUCH]
Thank you.

426
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:47,250
No one's ever...
thanked me before.

427
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,458
Well then, can you
show your appreciation?

428
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,458
Say it again,
like you did before.

429
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,125
[LELOUCH]
Uh? Oh, you mean the name.

430
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,291
[C.C.] Just this once,
with tenderness,

431
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,875
like you treasure
it in your heart.

432
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,666
Very well then...

433
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,416
[inaudible]

434
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,500
[LELOUCH]
How was that?

435
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,875
[C.C.] It was bad.
It was completely bad.

436
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:24,000
It wasn't tender. There was
no honesty or sympathy in it.

437
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,750
You spoke it oddly.
And worst of all, it was cold.

438
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,708
You're a picky girl.

439
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:32,458
Exactly. That's why
I go by the name C.C.

440
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,166
Ugh. Another soldier.

441
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,791
[RESEARCHER A] No wonder
our battalions fell apart!

442
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:47,500
[horn honking]

443
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,541
I swear I'm not Orange.

444
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,750
ZERO!

445
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,791
[KALLEN grunts]

446
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,250
[ZERO]
Looks like our ride's here.

447
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,333
[KALLEN]
Zero! Are you okay?

448
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,916
The others went on
ahead, and--

449
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,875
Who's that?!

450
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,083
[ZERO]
Oh, you needn't worry.

451
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,416
She's a very important friend.

452
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,250
[C.C. gasps]

453
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,541
[KALLEN]
Huh...?

454
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,666
[ZERO] C.C., I don't know
why snow is white,

455
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,791
but I still think
snow is beautiful.

456
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,250
I don't hate it.

457
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,958
I see.

458
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,416
[growls]

459
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,958
[LELOUCH]
Still not enough!

460
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,541
I need something more
to checkmate Cornelia.

461
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,666
And I have a feeling that
what's missing is inside of me.

462
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,416
Something I have
to face and overcome.

463
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,375
Then, I can lead the
Black Knights to the next stage.

464
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,458
Yes.

465
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,333
And if necessary, I'll even...
