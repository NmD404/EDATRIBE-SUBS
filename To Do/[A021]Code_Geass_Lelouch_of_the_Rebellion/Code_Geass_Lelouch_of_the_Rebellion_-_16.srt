1
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:22,250
[C.C.] In this world, evil can
arise from the best intentions.

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,958
And there is good, which can
come from evil intentions.

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,583
How then should Lelouch's
actions be taken?

4
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,791
Every man has his day of
judgment, does he not?

5
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,958
[C.C.]
Geass...

6
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:40,333
He who uses this inhuman power
will find his heart isolated,

7
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,125
whether he wants
it that way or not.

8
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:48,291
Thus, he plummets into the abyss
that lies between good and evil.

9
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,166
But if a man can climb out
of that abyss into the light,

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,916
then that man has
the soul of a king.

11
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,583
Yes, that's right. The training
for the post-refit Guren MK-II

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,666
is proceeding on schedule.

13
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,458
Kyoto and the Military
District of India

14
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,958
have finally come to terms.

15
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,583
So, we're just waiting for
Rakshata and her team to arrive.

16
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,625
And the organization's
changeover to a

17
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:00,791
cell-based structure
is now 92% complete.

18
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,750
The members have also
been ranked into 14 tiers.

19
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,583
As you directed,
we've infiltrated

20
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,666
all Britannian warehouses.

21
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,416
Within the Kanto block,
combat personnel have been

22
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,333
dispersed to 564
separate locations.

23
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,875
Thirty-two of our positions
have been uncovered.

24
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,000
Eleven of those were dummies.

25
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,041
Fourty-seven members
have been apprehended...

26
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,083
But since information
is now fire-walled

27
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,791
above class 8 members,
the Britannians aren't

28
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,708
getting anything out of them.

29
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,708
And now that we have
the unreserved support

30
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,458
of the Kyoto Group, we're
seeing almost no more cases

31
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,333
of citizens tipping
off the authorities.

32
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,541
On that list of
Britannian supporters...

33
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,291
Yes, it's the group you
made arrangements with.

34
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,458
Oh! And we're still
looking for information

35
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,750
about Tohdoh and
the Four Holy Swords.

36
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,125
--[PA] A176 to the Chinese
--Understood.

37
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,375
--Federation is now
--Continue with the work,

38
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,416
--boarding.
--all right?

39
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,916
Are you sure you want
me to be the messenger?

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,791
If you look humble
they'll look down on you.

41
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,000
That's how it works in
the Chinese Federation.

42
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,166
I don't know about that,

43
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,583
but unlike you, I do
have some humility.

44
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,625
Good, now you can put it to use.

45
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,625
How's your passport?

46
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,833
[C.C.]
Not a bad forgery.

47
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,083
I'm all set.

48
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,666
[NUNNALLY]
Where we going?

49
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,083
Are we getting moved to
another place again?

50
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,458
It's one of the
Kururugi's homes.

51
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,458
This time it's the
main house, okay?

52
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,500
Keep on walking, Suzaku.

53
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,416
[SUZAKU]
But...

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,250
[LELOUCH]
Keep walking!

55
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,083
Where are we?

56
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,708
It smells really bad here.

57
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,666
We're going by a garbage
dump, right, Suzaku?

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,583
[NUNNALLY]
What's wrong, Suzaku?

59
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,583
[SUZAKU]
I... I...

60
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,166
[sobs]

61
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,666
Nunnally...

62
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,333
My mother taught me that a
warm touch is good for tears.

63
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,958
Do you think it's true?

64
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,750
[LELOUCH]
I will overcome this.

65
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,458
[bell chimes]

66
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,541
[SUZAKU panting]

67
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,166
Hey! Lelouch!

68
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,791
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

69
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:24,958
What's up?

70
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,041
You know, they're
going to hold you back

71
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,291
if you don't start
coming to class.

72
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,791
I could say the same
about you, right?

73
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,375
I have work to do.

74
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,625
It's just that the Black Knights

75
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,250
have really been
on the move lately.

76
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,208
Hey, I thought you
were in engineering.

77
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,375
[SUZAKU]
Uh...

78
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,416
We're shorthanded so
they move me around.

79
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,833
[LELOUCH]
Hm.

80
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,000
Still, how about dropping
by for dinner more often?

81
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,250
Nunnally misses you.

82
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,916
Are you free this evening?

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,125
Yeah, I could come tonight,
but are you sure it's okay?

84
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,958
--I don't wanna cause any-- Ah!
--[tires screech]

85
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,625
[RIVALZ]
Hey! Lelouch!

86
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,666
What's wrong?

87
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,625
[RIVALZ]
I heard the President's out

88
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,125
doing a blind date thing again!

89
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,291
Yeah. Today.

90
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,916
Today?! Why didn't
you tell me about it?!

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,166
Because it'd make you cry.

92
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,500
Boys don't cry!

93
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,750
It's okay; I didn't
know about it either.

94
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,916
Don't give me your emo routine!

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,250
Emo?

96
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,750
I guess compassion is
not in fashion these days.

97
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,208
So anyways, are we on for
dinner tonight with Nunnaly?

98
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,083
[SUZAKU]
Sure!

99
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:14,958
What about school?!

100
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,041
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

101
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,750
I'm just gonna go
tell her about it!

102
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,708
[RIVALZ] My life is over and
he's worried about dinner.

103
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,000
--[NUNNALLY giggles]
--[door opens]

104
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,375
--[NUNNALLY] Uh?
--[footsteps]

105
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,416
My classes don't start
till second period, Sayoko.

106
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,583
--[NUNNALLY] Huh?
--[clapping]

107
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,458
[clapping continues]

108
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,458
[MAO]
Heh.

109
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,791
Are you surprised?

110
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:34,875
[MILLY]
Uh...

111
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,875
[LLOYD]
Matchmaking dates are usually

112
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,583
in hotels or restaurants.

113
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,458
[MILLY laughs nervously]
I suppose that's true.

114
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,583
But I'd heard you were a very
unique person, Lord Asplund.

115
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,791
[LLOYD]
Unique!

116
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,708
What a delightfully
artful way to put it!

117
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,541
[MILLY] I'm surprised
you're interested in a girl

118
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,958
from the downgraded Ashford
family after it lost its rank.

119
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,458
Oh-ho! But I couldn't care
less about loss of rank.

120
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,708
[CECILE]
Excuse me.

121
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,208
I'm sorry to trouble you.

122
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,416
Not at all, take your time.

123
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,416
[LLOYD]
No need for that.

124
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,375
Why draw it out?
Let's get married.

125
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,750
[MILLY]
Huh? That's it?!

126
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,458
Getting cold feet?

127
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,458
Nunnally! Suzaku's gonna--

128
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,083
[footsteps]

129
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,166

[ringing continues]

133
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,416
[LELOUCH]
Yes?

134
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
[NUNNALLY]
Lelouch!

135
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,958
Nunnally! Where are
you right now?!

136
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,458
[NUNNALLY] I don't know...
But I can't move!

137
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,625
[LELOUCH]
Nunnally!

138
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,958
[MAO]
It's me, Lulu!

139
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,875
[LELOUCH gasps]

140
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,958
It can't be!

141
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,250
[MAO]
You dropped your guard, Lelouch.

142
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,125
Just 'cause you
thought I was dead?

143
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,291
[LELOUCH]
Mao, listen!

144
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,958
C.C. isn't here right now!

145
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,375
[MAO]
That's why I came.

146
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,416
Someone immune to my Geass
would be troublesome now.

147
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll save my encounter
with her for a later date.

148
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,625
First, I'm going to pay you back

149
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,500
for that little
session the other day.

150
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,958
[LELOUCH] You're somewhere
within 500 meters of me.

151
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,000
[MAO]
Of course.

152
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,375
Want to try and find me?

153
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,416
[LELOUCH growls]

154
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,458
[MAO]
Your time limit is 5 hours.

155
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,833
Oh, by the way, since the game
is just between you and me,

156
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,458
no using the cops
as pawns this time.

157
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,791
I don't really want
to get shot up again.

158
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,375
Although Britannian
medical science is amazing.

159
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,000
You can thank them
for my return!

160
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,875
[laughs]

161
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,916
You know, Lulu, when you used
your Geass on those cops,

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,416
you should have told them to
kill me, not just shoot me.

163
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,041
You left off the
finishing touch,

164
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,125
and now your
sister's in a "bind."

165
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,625
What a quandry! What a
quagmire! What a crunch!

166
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,666
[LELOUCH] Nunnally has
nothing to do with this!

167
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,750
[NUNNALLY] It's not a very nice
way to play a game, you know.

168
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,166
[MAO]
Hmm?

169
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,125
[NUNNALLY] If you do something
to make my brother sad,

170
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,416
I'll never forgive you!

171
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,833
[MAO laughs]
What a pair you are!

172
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,625
I love this brother
sister thing!

173
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,375

00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,541
[GIRL A]
Hi, everyone!

175
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,083
It's lunch time! Are
you all eating well?

176
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,375
A fight? Shirley and Lelouch?

177
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,541
Right, she's pretending
she doesn't know him,

178
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,916
and the President said
we're supposed to play along

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,125
Oh... Right! What's up
with her blind date?!

180
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,333
Never mind that, if Shirley
and Lelouch are fighting--

181
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,541
Leave 'em alone. It's just a
little lovers' spat, that's all.

182
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,041
[SUZAKU]
Uh... But you...

183
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,125
Don't even think that way;
I've got nothing to do with him.

184
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,708
[RIVALZ] So, he hasn't
taken the plunge yet, huh?

185
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,958
The plunge?

186
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,208
[RIVALZ] Well, Lelouch
is good with theories,

187
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,000
but he's not so good
with the real thing.

188
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,291
Real thing?

189
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,291
[RIVALZ] I mean, he
doesn't have "experience."

190
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,416
Experience?!

191
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,583
--[SUZAKU] Ah!
--[BOTH] Huh?

192
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,833
--[SUZAKU groaning]
--[ARTHUR growling]

193
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,958
What's the matter?
Don't you like your food?

194
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,125
Arthur, why do you
always do this?!

195
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,625
[LELOUCH panting]

196
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,083
Hey, Lelouch, what happened
with you and Shirley, huh?

197
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,458
[LELOUCH]
Huh? What?

198
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,708
[RIVALZ]
Just give her some flowers.

199
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,166
And what about your classes?

200
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,291
You'd better go to-- Uh...

201
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,750
[LELOUCH]
Excuse me.

202
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,750
Oh, and I'll talk to
you later about dinner.

203
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,000
You think he's going
gambling again, huh, Arthur?

204
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:39,750
Huh?

205
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,083
[phone beeps]

206
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,333
[MAO] Lulu, if you do a
handstand while searching

207
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,458
for me, I'll extend your
time limit an hour!

208
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,250
[LELOUCH grunts]

209
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,708
He anticipated this!

210
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,458
He wants to see me squirm.

211
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,000
But what do I do?

212
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,500
He must be within 500 meters
if he's readin' my mind, but...

213
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,041
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch!

214
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,083
[LELOUCH gasps]

215
00:09:59,041 --> 00:09:59,583
[SUZAKU]
That's...!

216
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,958
[LELOUCH gasps]

217
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,791
I thought so... Something's
happened to Nunnally!

218
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,541
[locks clicking]

219
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,208
[VILETTA]
Welcome back!

220
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,208
[OHGI]
Uh... R-Right.

221
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,291
Good timing!
The meal's almost ready.

222
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,541
[OHGI]
Meal?

223
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,416
You mean-- Did you go
out shopping somewhere?

224
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,083
[chuckles] No, I just
used what you had around.

225
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,208
Some people here are afraid
of Britannians, so...

226
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,416
Have you been able to
remember anything yet?

227
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Sorry, nothing at all yet.

228
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,583
[OHGI]
That's okay.

229
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't push it.

230
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,416
You're still healing.

231
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,125
It's all right if it
takes time to remember.

232
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,458
--[dishes clink]
--[VILETTA] Okay, it's ready.

233
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,500
I sure hope you like it.

234
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,791
Uh...

235
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,416
[SUZAKU]
Who kidnapped Nunnally?

236
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,333
It can't be a Brittanian or
someone from the royal family.

237
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,166
[LELOUCH] No, this has nothing
to do with our bloodline.

238
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,250
Just a psychopath who wants
to keep a girl all to himself.

239
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,541
[SUZAKU]
So, he's threatening you?

240
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,708
[LELOUCH]
Yes.

241
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,583
An investigation could
reveal who we are.

242
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,708
That's why I can't go to
the army or the police.

243
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,208
[SUZAKU] 
Then there's no choice.

244
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,916
We'll have to do it on our own.

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,666
This isn't about your
gambling though--

246
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,625
[LELOUCH] It has
nothing to do with that!

247
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,750
[SUZAKU]
Okay.

248
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,583
Do you have any leads?

249
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,125
[LELOUCH]
Just this photo,

250
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,791
and I know that he's somewhere
very close by, watching me.

251
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,333
[gasps]
And now that I think of it,

252
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,125
I heard the sound of
running water, too!

253
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,333
Water...

254
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,333
The circulation system!

255
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,291
[LELOUCH]
The lower levels!

256
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,041
[SUZAKU]
Something's still off though.

257
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,375
[LELOUCH]
What?

258
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,208
[SUZAKU] Normally, you'd
hone right in on that.

259
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,000
[LELOUCH growls]

260
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,083
[SUZAKU]
What is it?

261
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,375
[LELOUCH]
He changed the codes.

262
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,125
We'll have to hack
into the system.

263
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,416
[SUZAKU]
But that's against school rules.

264
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,958
[LELOUCH]
I'll change it back later.

265
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,458
[SUZAKU] 
Then let me do it.

266
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,125
[LELOUCH]
Too late; I got it.

267
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,375
[SUZAKU]
That was fast.

268
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,708
You're a little
too good at that.

269
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,708
[LELOUCH]
The student council

270
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,083
has partial access
to these areas.

271
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,083
Lelouch, I see, this
is how you've been

272
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,666
getting off campus, isn't it?
Your little escape route.

273
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,916
Huh?

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,791
Uh, yeah... Sometimes.

275
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,708
How's it look?

276
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,583
You were right,
the door's guarded.

277
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,541
There's a machine gun linked
to the security camera.

278
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:04,041
The lag on these systems is
tight: point zero five seconds.

279
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,000
That means we can't
access it this way.

280
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,916
We'll have to head back up
and disable the main--

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,291
[gasps] Wait!

282
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,333
[LELOUCH]
Of all the reckless moves!

283
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,833
Come on, let's go!

284
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,166
Nunnally's waiting for us!

285
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,541
[MAO chuckles]

286
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,916
[LELOUCH, SUZAKU]
Nunnally!

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,833
[NUNNALLY gasps]
Lelouch and Suzaku, is that you?

288
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,083
[LELOUCH]
I'm so sorry!

289
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,166
--I'll cut you loose--
--[SUZAKU] Wait! Wait!

290
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,291
Up there!

291
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,166
A bomb.

292
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,500
[MAO]
That's right, Lulu!

293
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,375
I'll play along since
Kururugi came on his own.

294
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,208
Can't wait to see how
you two deal with this!

295
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,541
[LELOUCH grunts]

296
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,666
[SUZAKU] Nunnally, we're
going to diffuse the bomb.

297
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,750
It's okay, don't worry.

298
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,375
Lelouch and I can do anything
together, you know that?

299
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,750
[NUNNALLY gasps]
That's right!

300
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,708
[MAO laughs]

301
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,458
[LELOUCH]
It's motion sensitive.

302
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,416
A solenoid inside
supplies energy

303
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,333
that keeps it constantly moving.

304
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,083
If an external force
interferes with the motion,

305
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:15,958
then the bomb...

306
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,250
[SUZAKU]
...explodes.

307
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,625
Moving Nunnally even
an inch will trigger it.

308
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,625
That's the way it's set up.

309
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,166
[LELOUCH]
Can you calculate its range?

310
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,333
[SUZAKU]
It'd wipe out everything

311
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,416
within five or six
hundred meters, minimum.

312
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,750
[LELOUCH]
Now what?

313
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,166
We're beyond the
reach of his Geass.

314
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,958
Is he trying to mislead me?

315
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,708
Do you know how to disarm it?

316
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,541
Theoretically.

317
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,208
The power line to the detonator
would need to be severed.

318
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,583
Since he's not a pro at this,

319
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,833
I'm sure I could figure out
which lines are dummies.

320
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,958
Still, we need to find
another way to do it.

321
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:46,833
[SUZAKU]
Why?

322
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,250
I-If we choose the right one--

323
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,708
Because you'd have
to cut the line

324
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,166
without disrupting the
motion... which is impossible.

325
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,708
I'll do it; there's no choice.

326
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,458
No, Suzaku! We don't have enough
information to pull it off!

327
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,500
There's a time limit here!
We can't afford to play it safe!

328
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,791
As for information, it's
staring you right in the face...

329
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,375
I'm a soldier, Lelouch, can
you use that information?

330
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,625
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

331
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:18,208
[SAYOKO humming]

332
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,500
We still have toilet tissue...

333
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,750
[phone rings]

334
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,416
[SAYOKO]
Hm?

335
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,291
[ringing continues]

336
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:23,958
Huh?

337
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:34,541
[overlapping voices]

338
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,208
[MAO]
Stuck up little brats!

339
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,333
No wonder I hate school so much.

340
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,541
Huh?

341
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,833
[LELOUCH]
What now?

342
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,083
What's he got
planned for me next?

343
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,416
That camera trained on
Nunnally's transmitting to Mao.

344
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,750
Is he here?

345
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,083
I can't believe he'd still
be here at the school.

346
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,000
What a whack-job.

347
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,416
I told Suzaku to
stay with Nunnally,

348
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,916
but that leaves me
with only one option.

349
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,333
Well, if it isn't Cassanova!

350
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,250
[MAO] No weapons, no strategy,
you didn't diffuse the bomb,

351
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,041
didn't deploy the Black
Knights, or your friend.

352
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,041
What's wrong, Lulu?

353
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,708
I'm not explaining
anything to you.

354
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,750
The final game,
is it ready?

355
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,541
[MAO]
Hm. Let's put an end to this...

356
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,458
...with your specialty.

357
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,500
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

358
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,333
[CORNELIA]
It's been a while

359
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,416
since we could
spend time like this.

360
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,083
There've been so many unexpected
events since we came here.

361
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,291
[EUPHEMIA giggles]

362
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,000
All of that desk work--
it's making you fat.

363
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,041
Hey, cut it out.
That's not funny!

364
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,083
[BOTH laugh]

365
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,458
Cornelia, don't you think
this garden looks familiar?

366
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,750
It's like Lady Marianne's.

367
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,375
Now that you mention it...

368
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,625
[EUPHEMIA]
I heard Clovis ordered

369
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,541
them to build it like this.

370
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,791
[CORNELIA] I'm surprised he
liked her villa that much.

371
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,958
Since he was always fighting
with her son, Lelouch, there.

372
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,083
He must have thought
of Lelouch as his rival.

373
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,125
[CORNELIA] Even though
Lelouch was younger?

374
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,291
[EUPHEMIA] Well, he kept
paintings of Lelouch

375
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,166
and the others; we found
them after he was killed.

376
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,291
[CORNELIA]
I see...

377
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:12,291
We need to stabilize this
area and capture Zero, fast.

378
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:16,666
To avenge Clovis... as well
as Lelouch and Nunnally.

379
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,666
This land has taken the lives
of three of our siblings.

380
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,083
It's soaked in our
family's blood.

381
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,083
[MAO] You see, the scale
is the bomb's detonator

382
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,875
and it's cancellation switch.

383
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,833
The chess pieces we
capture will go here.

384
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,041
If the needle swings
all the way towards me,

385
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,833
the bomb goes off.

386
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,458
If it swings towards you,
the bomb will be disarmed.

387
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,333
In short, if you win the game,

388
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,125
your sister's life
will be saved.

389
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,166
Your mind is twisted;
no wonder C.C. left you.

390
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,166
[MAO]
Provoking me won't work.

391
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,250
I can read your thoughts, so I
know what you're trying to do.

392
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,708
[MAO] I'm afraid you're
not the type of person

393
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,375
who can keep your mind empty.

394
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,000
[MAO] There's a part
of you that's a critic,

395
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,083
constantly watching
your own moves,

396
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,458
and then there's another part

397
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,958
that's an observer, watching
the critic watching you.

398
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,000
You're that kind of person.

399
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,583
[chuckles] But I know
all your thoughts,

400
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,166
so I'm always a step ahead.

401
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,791
You can't win.

402
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,708
[LELOUCH grunts]

403
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,958
Bravo!

404
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,000
Your plan is to think
of seven things at once

405
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,333
to confuse me and trip me up.

406
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,625
But you see, if I focus
my Geass directly on you,

407
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,583
it's easy to tell which
one is your true thought.

408
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,791
[LELOUCH grunts]

409
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,875
[MAO] Aah, your last
plan is failing as well.

410
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,208
You underestimated me;
that's why your sister is...

411
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,791
[LELOUCH gasping]

412
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,500
"What do I do?"

413
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,833
"I'm out of strategies.
I can't call for back up

414
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,875
as long as Nunnally's
being held hostage!"

415
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,916
[LELOUCH gasps]

416
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,250
[MAO]
Sorry, sorry, I dropped it.

417
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,916
[LELOUCH sighs]

418
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,500
[grunts]

419
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,750
[MAO]
Your turn.

420
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,833
Better hurry.

421
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,416
Lookie, lookie,
time is running out.

422
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,916
Your little sister's
not going to make it.

423
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,500
Ah, is that the right move?

424
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,625
Are you sure you
want to do that?

425
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,583
[LELOUCH gasps, sighs]

426
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,916
Isn't this enough?

427
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,958
[MAO]
Huh?

428
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,541
Please stop it, Mao.

429
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,583
[MAO]
I can't hear you very well.

430
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,833
You got everything you wanted!

431
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,125
Let Nunnally go!

432
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,833
Huh?

433
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,708
I admit it...

434
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,166
You have beaten me.

435
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:42,208
[MAO laughs]

436
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,916
Very well said!

437
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,666
You're finally
speaking the thoughts

438
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,875
from the deepest part
of your soul, huh?

439
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,000
That feels great! Fantastic!

440
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:52,958
[MAO]
But no.

441
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,125
[LELOUCH gasps]

442
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,000
[MAO] ]
This is...

443
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,375
[LELOUCH gasps]

444
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,416
Checkmate!

445
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,750
[LELOUCH yells]
No!

446
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,708
[LELOUCH gasps]
Nunnally...

447
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,958
[MAO] Hm... Let me se if
she's burst into little pieces.

448
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:12,625
Huh?

449
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,666
[gasps]

450
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,791
What? Why is she...?

451
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,833
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

452
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,625
[MAO gasps]
How did you--?!

453
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,541
You kept me focused on you!

454
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,541
[MAO groans]

455
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,583
[grunts]

456
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,666
I am Warrant Officer
Suzaku Kururagi

457
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,833
of the Britannian military,
and you are under arrest!

458
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,083
Suzaku.

459
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,708
You disarmed the bomb?!

460
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,250
Impossible! You'd have to match
your speed to the pendulum!

461
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,458
[SUZAKU]
That's right.

462
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,208
After Lelouch showed
me which line to cut.

463
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,958
[LELOUCH]
I showed you?

464
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,000
What are you saying?

465
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,500
It was your plan.

466
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,750
Cut the line, then bust in
here when I heard you scream.

467
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,000
My plan?

468
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,041
[gasps]

469
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,166
So that's it.

470
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,416
Right...

471
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,750
Mao, it seems that
it's my checkmate.

472
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,583
[MAO] Lelouch, don't
tell me that you--

473
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,083
[LELOUCH]
Yes...

474
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,666
I gave Suzaku his instructions,
then used Geass on myself

475
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,208
to forget, so you
couldn't find out.

476
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,083
You believed that if you
know a person's thoughts,

477
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,458
you know everything.

478
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,875
That's why you
narrowed your range

479
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,416
and focused all your
power on my mind.

480
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,541
That was your mistake.

481
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,625
That's ridiculous!

482
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,583
You bet everything
on one friend?!

483
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,833
What if he'd failed you?!

484
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,333
[LELOUCH]
Good point.

485
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,541
To execute this plan, I had
to trust Suzaku completely.

486
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,958
Sayoko, everything's fine now.

487
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,416
Right, go ahead.

488
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,458
Sayoko?

489
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,458
I'll have you free in a second.

490
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,291
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

491
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,708
You think you beat me, huh?!

492
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,875
[SUZAKU]
Stop it!

493
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,541
Get your hands off
of me, father killer!

494
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,250
[SUZAKU gasps]

495
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,291
[LELOUCH gasps]

496
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,541
[MAO] You killed your own
father seven years ago!

497
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,625
Hmph!

498
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,625
He called for
do-or-die resistance,

499
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,250
and you thought stopping
him would end the war.

500
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,250
What a childish idea!

501
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,041
The fact is, you're a murderer.

502
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,416
[SUZAKU]
That's not true! I just-- I--

503
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,875
[MAO] How lucky for you
that no one ever found out.

504
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,333
All the adults lied
to protect you.

505
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,958
But all the reports
said his suicide

506
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,000
was a protest against
the military actions--

507
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,416
[MAO]
A big, fat lie, all of it.

508
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,208
A lie?

509
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,416
I didn't have any choice!

510
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,708
If I didn't, Japan would have--

511
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,875
[MAO] That's how you
justify it in retrospect?

512
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,791
Well, it explains
your deathwish!

513
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,666
[SUZAKU gasps]

514
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,875
You want to save people's lives?

515
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,541
It's your own wretched soul,
you're trying to save!

516
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,500
That's why you're always
charging into danger!

517
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,416
Placing yourself on
the edge of death!

518
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,208
[SUZAKU gasps]

519
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,250
[screams]

520
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,666
[MAO]
You're no hero.

521
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,791
You're just trying to wash
the blood off your hands.

522
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,166
A little brat begging
to be punished!

523
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:44,750
[LELOUCH]
Mao!

524
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,791
[MAO gasps]

525
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,500
Never speak again!

526
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,541
[MAO]
Huh? No!

527
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:58,166
[MAO choking]

528
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,458
Mao!

529
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,708
I did love you, Mao.

530
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,166
[MAO choking]

531
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,250
Mao, I want you to go and
wait for me... in C's world.

532
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,750
--[gunshot]
--[MAO groans]

533
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:33,666
I just... I just...

534
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,666
[LELOUCH]
I'm a fool.

535
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,125
In the end, I never
asked the terms

536
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,500
of the contract
she made with Mao.

537
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,208
And Suzaku...

538
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,708
When we were reunited,
why didn't I-- No!

539
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,375
He's been trying to tell
me for a long time now.

540
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,833
I should have confronted
him right from the start.
