1
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,958
We hereby declare
the resurrection of Japan

2
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:32,125
as a lawful independent
and sovereign nation!

3
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,333
Atsushi Sawasaki,
leader of the forces

4
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,916
that have occupied
the Fukuoka military base,

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,833
was Chief Cabinet Minister
of the Kururugi Administration

6
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,666
in the former nation of Japan.

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,541
After the war, he fled
to the Chinese Federation,

8
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,250
but is apparently
making his move now

9
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,166
in response to the recent
civil unrest caused by Zero.

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,750
Whether the Black Knights
have played a role

11
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,166
in these unfolding events
is still under investigation.

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,625
[TAMAKI]
We're not part of it!

13
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,208
[OHGI]
What does Kyoto say about it?

14
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,791
They didn't know
this was coming.

15
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,333
They were just notified
about his unilateral claims

16
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,125
over the Sakuradite
mining rights.

17
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,833
Zero, it's our move.

18
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,125
What are we gonna do?

19
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,416
[NEWSCASTER] Sawasaki's group
was working in conjunction

20
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,666
with a terrorist
organization in Kyushu.

21
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,708
After cutting off vehicle
access from Honshu and Shikoku,

22
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,125
and with support from
Chinese Federation forces

23
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,166
from the Liaodong
Military District,

24
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,666
they are expanding
their occupation

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,625
around Fukuoka,
Nagasaki, and Oita.

26
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,125
According to General Tsao,

27
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,458
the Chinese Federation is
providing humanitarian support,

28
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,583
and is not...

29
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,791
[LLOYD]
So how's Suzaku doing?

30
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,208
He says that he'll do
whatever the mission demands.

31
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,333
[LLOYD]
I see.

32
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,625
And what about
Prince Schneizel?

33
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,625
Where is he?

34
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,166
In the Tokyo Settlement.

35
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,458
Got there after
his run-in with Suzaku.

36
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,583
Avalon doesn't have
its commander right now,

37
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,958
but we have to finish this up

38
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,916
if we want to counter
the Gefjun Disturber.

39
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,875
[SUZAKU]
I've dishonored you.

40
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,791
I'm not worthy
to be your knight.

41
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,833
If this is about
your disobeying orders,

42
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,791
my brother Schneizel said
it was an unusual situation,

43
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,500
and you shouldn't
be blamed for it.

44
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,416
[SUZAKU]
I can't forgive myself.

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,541
Please...

46
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,750
Has knighthood become
a burden for you?

47
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,166
Something that troubles you?

48
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,958
[SUZAKU]
No, I'm grateful for it.

49
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,375
Then why?

50
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,250
[SUZAKU]
I've remembered something.

51
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,583
[SUZAKU]
I... I killed my own father.

52
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,416
I was never punished for it.

53
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,791
I just lived on
like nothing happened.

54
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,666
And right now I'm
being protected again!

55
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,500
While soldiers die and
Elevens suffer, I'm unscathed.

56
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,541
A person like me
doesn't deserve this!

57
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,375
You don't deserve it?

58
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,916
Then I don't either.

59
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,541
[GUILFORD] Princess Cornelia,
we're taking too many losses!

60
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,208
This tempest is preventing us
from using our air power!

61
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,958
We'll have to delay
the landing operation

62
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,500
until the weather changes.

63
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,625
[CORNELIA growls]

64
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,541
It's a stroke of good
fortune that this storm hit.

65
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,041
We must use it to
tighten our grip on Kyushu.

66
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,333
You see, Gen. Tsao?

67
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,916
Heaven is on our side.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're going to prevail
in this battle with ease.

69
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,916
[SCHNEIZEL] Martial law
is not necessary.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,791
Such measures would only
upset and frighten people.

71
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,375
Contact E.U. Foreign
Minister Gandolphi.

72
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,500
Oh, and put a call in to
the Toromo Agency in Cambodia.

73
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,541
Prince Schneizel,

74
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,750
using the Toromo agency
could be a--

75
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,250
Prime Minister!

76
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes, Euphy. Something wrong?

77
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,833
[EUPHEMIA] Is there
anything I can do to help?

78
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:02,500
I'm the sub-viceroy of Area 11,
I should be assisting you.

79
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,791
Thank you.

80
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,583
Just your offer to help me
is more than enough.

81
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,750
But I...

82
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,166
[DARLTON] The viceroy
gave strict orders

83
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,500
that you not be entangled
in this matter, Princess.

84
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,916
[EUPHEMIA]
She did?

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,166
Just because I chose my
knight without her consent...

86
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,416
Oh, uh no,
that's not correct.

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,291
I think even the
Kururugi matter--

88
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,125
Please understand, Euphy.

89
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,000
Cornelia can't
take any chances now;

90
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,375
the situation
is too treacherous.

91
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,958
[EUPHEMIA]
You mean...

92
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,708
[SCHNEIZEL] Darlton, concerning
the matter we were discussing,

93
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,666
I know someone who
has a way in with them.

94
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,083
So, I will ask for help.

95
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,458
[DARLTON]
Yes, Your Highness.

96
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,583
[SHIRLEY] After all our
hard work getting ready,

97
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,333
it looks like they're going
to cancel the school festival.

98
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,041
[RIVALZ] That's hardly
a huge consideration

99
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,041
since we're at war.

100
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,208
[NINA]
Did you say war?

101
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,750
They're using this
government in exile

102
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,041
as a smokescreen,

103
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,333
but this is a war with
the Chinese Federation!

104
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,291
[NINA]
Oh, I see...

105
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,666
Nina, what about the booths

106
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,833
we were planning to borrow
from the art museum?

107
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,916
Uh, I'm going there today.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,625
If I have some extra time,

109
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,000
I'd also like to drop
into the science department.

110
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,583
[MILLY] Are you talking
about that present of yours?

111
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,833
Huh? What present is that?

112
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,958
Professor Asplund
said that I should ask him

113
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,208
if there was something
special that I wanted.

114
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,541
You mean Lloyd?!

115
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,041
That philandering playboy?!

116
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,083
That's enough!

117
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,583
Could you get
a little work done?

118
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,708
Easy for you to say;
this is work for three people!

119
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,416
Suzaku's in the army,
Kallen's in the hospital,

120
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,458
and that other fool's
nowhere to be found.

121
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,291
There's something's really
weird about Lelouch lately.

122
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,958
[SHIRLEY]
I was so shocked.

123
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm still confused about it.

124
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,125
How can Lelouch be Zero?!

125
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,250
"I still haven't told anyone.

126
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,833
I want to meet you
first and ask you face to face."

127
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,583
[SHIRLEY]
Did I really write that letter?

128
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,458
How is it possible?

129
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,833
Why did I forget that Nunna's
big brother is Zero?

130
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,833
[TECH A]
Z-01, float attachment, contact.

131
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,708
Control line, established.

132
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,000
[CECILE]
That's really amazing.

133
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,208
You got a perfect rating
on the float simulator.

134
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,916
[SUZAKU]
Thank you.

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,666
Tell me, why did you want to
give up being a knight, Suzaku?

136
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,875
Well, because...

137
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:12,208
Princess Euphemia still
approves of me even as I am now.

138
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,333
So if I caused her
any trouble,

139
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,916
if I brought her
dishonor or shame,

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,541
I had a feeling that she
would end up hating herself.

141
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,125
[EUPHEMIA]
A figurehead.

142
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,625
That's all I was from
the start; I knew that.

143
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,458
But I thought if
I gave my best effort,

144
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,208
maybe I could make
some difference.

145
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,958
Forgive me, Clovis.

146
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:37,416
I met Zero face to face,
but I didn't avenge your death.

147
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,833
I have to think of some way
to save Lelouch and Nunnally,

148
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,666
but how?

149
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,750
I don't have the kind
of power that my sister has;

150
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,208
I'm not like her or Schneizel.

151
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,416
No matter where I go,

152
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,875
I'm just a burden
and I act selfishly

153
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,125
though I don't mean to.

154
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,125
I chose my knight against
my sister's advice.

155
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,083
And now he's resigned.

156
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,958
[GUARD] Oh yeah,
they told me about you.

157
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,166
You need to have the documents
signed today, right?

158
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,166
But a member of the royal family
is viewing the art right now.

159
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,333
Huh? Which member is it?

160
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,291
[TAMAKI]
Uh, so you're saying...?

161
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,000
[ZERO] We aren't going
to collaborate with Sawasaki.

162
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,458
He's not independent.

163
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,583
He's a puppet of
the Chinese Federation.

164
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,375
[URABE] But he says
he's fighting for Japan!

165
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,333
[ZERO] We'd get a
new name and a new master,

166
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,958
but nothing would change.

167
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,208
His Japan is a sham.

168
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,625
Yeah, so what you're
really saying is...?

169
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,416
When Britannia strikes back,
we play dead?

170
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
[DIETHARD] Zero, perhaps
you'd better clarify

171
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,416
what our overall mission is.

172
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,541
Yeah, he's right.

173
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,500
Even leaving aside
the Sawasaki matter,

174
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,291
what's our mid-term
goal on this?

175
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,000
[ZERO] To make Tokyo
an independent nation!

176
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:49,791
Independent?!

177
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,750
A nation?!

178
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,833
[KNIGHT A]
Are you serious?!

179
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:52,833
[KNIGHT B]
You mean us?

180
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,958
[KNIGHT C]
A country?

181
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,875
[KNIGHTS muttering]

182
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,000
I thought so.

183
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,750
He's really going all the way!

184
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,166
Wait a minute!

185
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,333
No matter how much the
Black Knights have expanded...

186
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,625
Our enemy is an empire

187
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,458
that controls
one third of the world!

188
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,125
We can't pull that off alone!

189
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,625
[ZERO]
Then answer this!

190
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,000
Are you just going to sit back
and wait for someone else

191
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,500
to defeat Britannia?

192
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,500
Who?

193
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,750
You think if you
wait long enough,

194
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,458
someday the right chance
will finally come?

195
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,125
Don't be naïve!

196
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,041
If we don't stand up
and do it ourselves,

197
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,291
that "someday"
will never come!

198
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,958
[NINA]
Princess Euphemia!

199
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,250
[GUARD]
Secure the perimeter!

200
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,708
Code Delta!
We have a Code Delta!

201
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,833
[NINA]
Please!

202
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,750
I just want to thank
Princess Euphemia!

203
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,458
To get one look at her!

204
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,000
[GUARD] Repeat, lock down all
gates leading into the building!

205
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,083
[EUPHEMIA]
From the hotel!

206
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,125
[GUARD]
We've caught a suspicious girl

207
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,458
at the building perimeter!

208
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,416
Watch for any
unidentified vehicles!

209
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Stop it!

210
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,375
That girl is a
personal friend of mine!

211
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,500
[NINA gasps]

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,791
[CORNELIA]
Good. It's cleared up.

213
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,333
[GUILFORD] Now we can resume
the landing operation.

214
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,125
And we'll try to put Prince
Schneizel's plan into action.

215
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,500
You think the Special Corps
can break through their line?

216
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,000
[GUILFORD]
With Kururugi, it's possible.

217
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,083
[CORNELIA] Using him
can also mean trouble.

218
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,333
[GUILFORD] But there's no
commander on the Avalon now.

219
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,083
Earl Asplund isn't capable.

220
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,250
[RADIO]
Incoming missiles!

221
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,250
Launch point appears
to be Fukuoka base!

222
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,250
One minute,
five seconds to impact!

223
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,583
Not bad!

224
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,375
They're well prepared
against air raids as well.

225
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,541
Are we sending up
a barrage?

226
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,416
[CECILE] We'll be fine
in this position.

227
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,250
[RADIO]
Direct hit confirmed!

228
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,166
The Avalon is destroyed.

229
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,916
Hmph! Even if it is
state-of-the-art,

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,416
a single ship
can't possibly hurt us!

231
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,125
Hm? What the...?!

232
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,250
Lancelot's shield
was already proven

233
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,500
on the battlefield.

234
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,500
Major Kururugi,
I'm laying out the mission plan

235
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,166
for final verification.

236
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,958
This ship will breach
the enemy's front line

237
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,083
from high altitude and move
directly to the launch point.

238
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,625
The advanced weapon
system Z-01 Lancelot,

239
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,083
using the float unit,

240
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,000
will attack the enemy
headquarters at Fukuoka base.

241
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,166
The float unit
consumes energy fast,

242
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,583
so pay attention
to your operation time!

243
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,458
[SUZAKU]
Yes, my lord.

244
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,500
[SUZAKU]
M.E. boost...

245
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,708
Lancelot unit, now launching!

246
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,000
[SUZAKU]
...launch!

247
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,250
[RADIO] The enemy ship seems
to have launched a bomber,

248
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,458
but it's moving faster
than a fighter plane!

249
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,791
[RADIO]
I have picture!

250
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,291
[ALL exclaiming]

251
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,416
[SAWASAKI]
A Knightmare!

252
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,708
[TSAO]
It's not being transported,

253
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,375
it's just flying on its own!

254
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,875
That weapons report we got...
could this be it?

255
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,583
You mean that novelty weapon?!

256
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,541
[SAWASAKI]
But then, the pilot is...

257
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,833
[LLOYD] The military force
that's trying to occupy

258
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,166
the Kyushu block

259
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,833
is fighting under
ex-minister Atsushi Sawasaki.

260
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,333
If they lose him,

261
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,541
the new Japanese government
will collapse very quickly.

262
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,416
In that case,
the Chinese Federation

263
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,541
will lose their excuse for being
here, and have to withdraw.

264
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,750
[SUZAKU] There it is.
The enemy headquarters.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,375
[SUZAKU]
An open channel?

266
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,125
[SAWASAKI]
This is Minister Sawasaki.

267
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,166
Is that Prime Minister
Kururugi's son

268
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,250
in the pilot seat?

269
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,291
[SAWASAKI] I see. I didn't know
he had a son like you.

270
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,500
[NINA] And then when you
saved me, Princess Euphemia,

271
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,083
I'll never forget it...

272
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,250
You looked like
some kind of goddess,

273
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,041
like you were bathed
in radiant light.

274
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,708
Oh! Forgive me!

275
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,791
I should have thanked you

276
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,083
for these change
of clothes you gave me!

277
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,916
Oh, don't worry
about that, Nina.

278
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,416
Besides, I'm not all
the wonderful person

279
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,875
you think I am.

280
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,375
I'm no good compared
to my brother and sister...

281
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,666
No, that's not true!

282
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,208
How can you say that
about yourself?

283
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,875
There's not one
good thing about me.

284
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,583
Really, nothing at all.

285
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,958
My parents are ordinary,
I'm not the least bit pretty,

286
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,583
and there's just
nothing special about me...

287
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,916
[EUPHEMIA]
That's wrong, Nina.

288
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,791
I think you're a very cute girl.

289
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:35,958
[NINA gasps]

290
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,750
Oh, no, I'm not really
good for anything.

291
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,125
Not at all.

292
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,708
[EUPHEMIA]
She hates herself.

293
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,875
But, so do I...

294
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,750
[NINA] I guess I understand,
but Suzaku makes me uneasy...

295
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,500
[EUPHEMIA] That's it.
Suzaku feels badly too!

296
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,083
So please, oh please,

297
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,041
don't say that you're no good,
Princess Euphemia, I beg of you!

298
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,583
Because...

299
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:05,625
Because I need you.
I need your goodness.

300
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,625
Thank you so much, Nina.

301
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,708
I'm glad I got to know you.

302
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,791
[NINA gasps]

303
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,583
You've really
helped me understand!

304
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,583
[SUZAKU] This has nothing
to do with my father.

305
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,750
I came here to put
an end to this fighting.

306
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,541
I will accept
your surrender.

307
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,000
[SAWASAKI] You want to rob
Japan of its dream of freedom?

308
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,166
[SUZAKU] Freedom has to come
the right way, not like this.

309
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,458
[SAWASAKI]
You'll act out of selfishness?

310
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,541
It's justice without ideology.

311
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,625
No, you're wrong!

312
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,541
That's not what I--
[grunts]

313
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,791
My V.A.R.I.S!

314
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,208
[SUZAKU] Those are Chinese
Federation Gang Lous.

315
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,750
[chuckles] He allowed me
to distract him.

316
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,875
He still has much to learn!

317
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,208
Euphy?

318
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,583
Schneizel!

319
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,166
May I have access to a
private communication line?

320
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,833
My energy filler!

321
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,416
Are you kidding?!
They blasted off the float?!

322
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,125
[CECILE] The Avalon
has to strike at the base!

323
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,625
No, the shield doesn't
completely surround us!

324
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,166
One direct hit and we'll
go down in flames!

325
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,375
Suzaku!

326
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,041
Reroute all power to
combat and com-systems!

327
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,041
[SUZAKU]
Got it!

328
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,750
You had better
surrender, Suzaku.

329
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,750
Since you're Prime
Minister Kururugi's son,

330
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,458
I guarantee that you'll
be very well treated, my boy.

331
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,041
I decline.

332
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,125
If I used my father's name for
this, I'd never forgive myself.

333
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,875
This is between you and me.

334
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,458
[SAWASAKI] I see. You're very
much your father's son,

335
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,000
as foolish and
stubborn as he was!

336
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,125
[EUPHEMIA]
Suzaku Kururugi!

337
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,125
[SUZAKU]
Princess Euphemia!

338
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,208
Suzaku!

339
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,000
The truth is,
you and I uh, that is...

340
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,708
[SUZAKU]
Sorry, but right now...

341
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,000
[EUPHEMIA]
You see...

342
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,708
I hereby command you
to love me!

343
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,041
Right!

344
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:51,541
[CECILE]
Huh?

345
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,833
What?! What is it?!

346
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,416
Uh, sorry,
but this is private.

347
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,625
[EUPHEMIA] And in return,
I will love you!

348
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,666
Forever!

349
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,250
Princess Euphemia...

350
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,166
Suzaku, I love your
stubborness and your kindness

351
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,250
and your strength.

352
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,958
Your sad eyes, your clumsiness,

353
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,708
and the way you
have trouble with cats.

354
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,875
I love everything about you!

355
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,208
So please,
don't hate yourself!

356
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,250
[SUZAKU gasps]

357
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,916
I see that I've made
you even more worried

358
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,583
than I did before.

359
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,833
You really are--

360
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,875
Everything you do is impulsive!

361
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,166
When we first met,

362
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,958
when you told me
you were a princess,

363
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,583
when you selected my school,

364
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,125
when you made me
a knight... Always!

365
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,875
Yes, they were all sudden.

366
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,333
That's because
I suddenly realized...

367
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,916
But then it's that
spur of the moment feeling

368
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,333
that's opened
so many doors for me.

369
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,541
Thank you!

370
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,750
What are you doing?!

371
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,416
Stop him now!

372
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,291
[SUZAKU] Princess,
can I make one final request?

373
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,708
[EUPHEMIA]
Final?

374
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,875
[SUZAKU] If something happens
to me, whatever it is,

375
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,750
please don't blame yourself.

376
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,458
Destroy all the records
and erase every trace

377
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,416
so no one knows
what happened to me.

378
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,458
[SUZAKU] I don't want
my friends to be sad.

379
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,875
Just tell them I transferred
schools or make up some story.

380
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,833
[EUPHEMIA]
Suzaku, don't tell me you're...!

381
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,625
[SUZAKU] Yes, the Knightmare's
out of energy.

382
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,541
Oh, and please, say goodbye
to Miss Cecile and Lloyd

383
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,416
and to Prince Schneizel for me.

384
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,416
[SUZAKU] I was stubborn
all the way to the end.

385
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,166
Don't die, Suzaku!

386
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
You've got to live!

387
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,500
[SUZAKU]
Wh-What the...?

388
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,333
And fire!

389
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,041
--Huh?!
--[RADIO] What was that?!

390
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,916
[RADIO] Something just
appeared on the radar!

391
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,041
A stealth system!

392
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,416
[RADIO]
We've got picture!

393
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,166
[SUZAKU]
That's...!

394
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,333
I see. So the famous white
Knightmare is named Lancelot.

395
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,791
And he's fighting
as recklessly as ever.

396
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,541
[LELOUCH] Yes, but
this time he seems to be

397
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,416
following someone else's plan.

398
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,875
They sent a single fighter in to
try to disrupt the main force.

399
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,958
Even if he fails,
Cornelia can move right in.

400
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,541
[LELOUCH] Schneizel...
Is he behind this idea?

401
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,958
These people are in my way!

402
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,541
I thought the hadron cannon
was still in development.

403
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,583
They made the beams converge?!

404
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,958
But I wanted to be the
one to perfect that system!

405
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,875
[RAKSHATA] Hmm, looks like
integrating the Gefjun Disturber

406
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,250
has worked.

407
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,916
But that float system
is more advanced than mine.

408
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,291
So my opponent
is the Earl of Pudding,

409
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,458
I guess.

410
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,708
We were collaborating
inadvertently.

411
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,750
Oh, how distasteful.

412
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,000
[ZERO] Kururugi, is the
Lancelot still operational?

413
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,041
[SUZAKU]
Zero. I thought so.

414
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:40,958
It's Zero?

415
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,041
Is that an open channel?!

416
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,541
[RADIO]
Yes!

417
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,583
Then stay with that source
and find out what he's after!

418
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,625
An energy filler?

419
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,208
[ZERO] I'm going to take out
the enemy command center.

420
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,083
What will you do?

421
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,666
[SAWASAKI]
What?!

422
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:06,208
[SUZAKU] Sorry Zero, but you're
not going to get your wish.

423
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,333
I'm going to hit
them first... my way.

424
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,458
Resume attack!

425
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,375
Stop them!

426
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,500
Stop Kururugi and Zero!

427
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,916
[SAWASAKI]
Zero!

428
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,666
Shouldn't we be fighting
together as comrades?

429
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,291
Don't you care about Japan?

430
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,166
The Black Knights
stand against anyone

431
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,291
who uses violence unjustly
for their own selfish ends!

432
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,083
[SAWASAKI]
Selfish?!

433
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,958
I'm doing this for Japan!

434
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:40,916
Sawasaki!

435
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,250
If this is for Japan,

436
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,375
why did you run away
to the Chinese Federation?!

437
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,625
[SUZAKU] You should have stayed,
for everyone's sake!

438
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,500
You're still a child!

439
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,041
[RAKSHATA]
A joint operation... Gawain!

440
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,916
[LLOYD]
Lancelot.

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,750
So Suzaku and Lelouch are...!

442
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,416
[CORNELIA]
What?! Zero?!

443
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,541
[GUILFORD]
Yes, he saved Kururugi.

444
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,708
Fighting on our side?

445
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,833
What the hell is he thinking?!

446
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,416
[DIETHARD] So his tactic was
to bring the Gawain in alone

447
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,916
to get past the Britannians.

448
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,041
That was brilliant.

449
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,583
Maybe, but the Guren MK-II

450
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,916
could have acted
as a shield for them.

451
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,083
It's not like I can go home
or back to school at this point.

452
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,291
After all our battles,

453
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,083
to be working with
the Lancelot is just...

454
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,166
[DIETHARD] What's necessary
here is not victory.

455
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,375
The Black Knights'
participation in this battle

456
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,041
is an undeniable truth.

457
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,000
Of course, it will never
be officially reported,

458
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,208
but the rumors will spread

459
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,083
and everyone will know
what happened here.

460
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,000
As Zero said,
this will show the world

461
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,416
exactly where we stand.

462
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,666
Protecting the nation
is our first commitment.

463
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,125
[SAWASAKI] What's wrong with
going to another country,

464
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,291
then waiting for the
right moment to strike?

465
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,458
That's an effective
strategy, isn't it?

466
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,500
We can set up a new
line of defense at Kagoshima.

467
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,458
Right. I appreciate your help.

468
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,416
Huh? Huh?!

469
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,541
[SUZAKU]
Sawasaki!

470
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,583
[ZERO]
That's far enough.

471
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,625
[SAWASAKI]
I-Impossible!

472
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,166
They took the largest
fortress in all of Kyushu

473
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,083
with hardly any effort!

474
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,916
The terrorism
in the Kyushu block

475
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,958
led by an anti-government
group was stopped

476
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,333
by Princess Cornelia's
sudden attack.

477
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,333
Atsushi Sawasaki
and four members

478
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,708
of the former Japanese
government were arrested.

479
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:28,166
Over half the Chinese Federation
troops were captured as well.

480
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,500
In response to this incident,

481
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,500
Chinese Federation
leaders are asserting

482
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,166
this was an unauthorized
action by General Tsao

483
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,833
of the Liaodong District,
and they are requesting

484
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,166
all POWs be released
in accordance

485
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,000
with the Tibet Convention.

486
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,250
Warrant Officer Kururugi,
reporting for duty.

487
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,375
Welcome back home, Suzaku.

488
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,208
--[SUZAKU] Uh... I...
--[EUPHEMIA] I...

489
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,166
[giggles]

490
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,166
[laughs]

491
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,375
Suzaku, I finally
understand my heart.

492
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,333
It's not that I
expect an ideal country

493
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,583
or perfect justice or anything
complicated like that.

494
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:19,083
I just want to see
people smiling, that's all.

495
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,625
The smiles of
the people I love now

496
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,333
and the people I loved
before as well.

497
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,083
Will you help me?

498
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,166
Will you be my knight?

499
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,916
I will, Your Highness.

500
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,208
[LELOUCH] Now that
Sawasaki's been stopped,

501
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,375
we have to make
our next move quickly!

502
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:11,416
Also I need to build a place
where Nunnally can be happy.

503
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,958
And for that,
I need to create a nation

504
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,916
that can drive a wedge
into the world.

505
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,458
Things are proceeding
well towards destruction.

506
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,958
And when the time comes,

507
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,833
I'll deal with Cornelia and
Schneizel at the same time!
