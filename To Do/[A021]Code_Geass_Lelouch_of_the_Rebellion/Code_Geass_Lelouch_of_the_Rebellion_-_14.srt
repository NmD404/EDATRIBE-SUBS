1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,541
[C.C.]
The actions one takes are

2
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:23,625
answered by consequences
waiting at their conclusion.

3
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,208
There are no exceptions,

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:29,041
and even Lelouch's power
cannot change this.

5
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,833
Despite his absolute ability
to make anyone obey him,

6
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,541
there is no escaping
the inevitable.

7
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,583
[C.C.] Lelouch has acted to
avenge his mother's death,

8
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,291
and to create a world where
his younger sister, Nunnally,

9
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,166
can find happiness.

10
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,750
[C.C.] Now he is confronted
by the results of his acts;

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,916
consequences he never imagined.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,291
And there are more to come.

13
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,958
If these unintended consequences
help to create new worlds,

14
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,875
who will bear the blame for
the sins that are committed?

15
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,791
Who will take the punishment?

16
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,458
And who will measure it out?

17
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,041
[RADIO A] 
Command to 4-0-1!

18
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,750

00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,541
Intercept now!

[RADIO B]
Underwater red leader...

25
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,083
No wait!

00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,375
[DALTON]
Do not pursue!

27
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,583
Protecting the viceroy
has top priority!

28
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,500
[OHGI]
Zero! Come in!

29
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,125
Zero!

30
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,500
[C.C.]
Ohgi? Is that you? It's C.C.

31
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,125
Yes. How's Zero doing?

32
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,958
[C.C.] He's okay,
but he can't move now.

33
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,208
Order a retreat.

34
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,375
If we drag this out,
we'll be slaughtered.

35
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,875
Uh, yes. I understand. Got it.

36
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:18,916
[DIETHARD]
Hm?

37
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:20,958
[C.C.]
Is that what you wanted?

38
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,833
[LELOUCH]
Uh. Yes...

39
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,208
This is pathetic.

40
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,458
You're so shook up,
you can't even issue orders.

41
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,541
And Cornelia will--

42
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,958
Listen to me!
My handgun is missing!

43
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,958
Whoever has it now must
have taken it from me

44
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,500
when I was unconscious.

45
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,791
If that's true...
It means they saw your face.

46
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,125
There were at least two of them.

47
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,500
One who fired and
one who got shot...

48
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,625
Two.

49
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:49,958
[SHIRLEY sobbing]

50
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,666
[SOPHIE]
Shirley?

51
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,750
What are you doing
up so early?

52
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,291
Is that a letter?

53
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,666
I-It's uh...
Oh, it's nothing.

54
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,958
I bet it's a love letter, huh?

55
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,625
Something special for Lelouch?

56
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,875
[SHIRLEY gasps]

57
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,583
Mm... In a way...

58
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,125
[SUZAKU] You want to
meet Princess Euphemia?

59
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,666
To thank her!

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,291
I just wanted to thank her...

61
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,500
[MILLY]
She risked her life

62
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,000
to protect Nina during
the hotel hijacking!

63
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,208
She stood right up
and said, "I'm Euphemia!"

64
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,625
--Right?
--Really?

65
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,916
I want to meet her, too!

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,291
Why is that?

67
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,291
She's a real princess!
I could marry into royalty!

68
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,875
I'm sure that you
will never meet her

69
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,541
with such impure motives.

70
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,041
Impure?

71
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,375
[NINA gasps]

72
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,041
[RIVALZ] That's a little
harsh, isn't it, Nunnally?

73
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,833
You're on my side,
aren't you, Madame Pre--

74
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,791
Don't kiss up to me just because
Lelouch isn't hanging around.

75
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,750
Nunnally saw right
through you and so do I.

76
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,000
[NUNNALLY giggles]

77
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,583
Anyway, I'd like to meet
Princess Euphemia, too,

78
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,500
if I could.

00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,208
[MILLY]
Huh?

81
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,958
Oh... What's the matter, Suzaku?

82
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,291
Uh... It's just she's a member
of the royal family and--

83
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,291
[phone rings]

84
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,750
[SUZAKU] Hello, Ashford
Academy student council.

00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:01,916

Huh?

00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,041
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku?

87
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,041
Lelouch?

00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,291
[NUNNALLY gasps]

89
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,291
[LELOUCH] Is there...
anything unusual there?

90
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,208
Yeah, there is...

91
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,083
[LELOUCH gasps]

92
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,041
You're not here.

93
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,416
[LELOUCH]
Oh, right...

94
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,833
[SUZAKU] Shirley didn't
show up either, by the way.

95
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,416
[SUZAKU]
You know, Lelouch,

96
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,750
you've been cutting
classes lately.

97
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,583
You need to take school
more seriously!

98
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,041
[LELOUCH]
Right, "Mister honor student."

99
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,875
Can you give
Nunnally a message?

100
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,666
Tell her I'll be late tonight?

101
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,041
Did you say "tonight"?
More like every night.

102
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,250
What's the point in going to the
same school if I never see you?

103
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:32,833
[ARTHUR meows]

104
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,791
[SUZAKU screams]

105
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,875
[LELOUCH]
Hm? What's going on?

106
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:35,750
[SUZAKU]
Uh, nothing!

107
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,458
Uh... Hey! Arthur! Ar-- Ow!

00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,958
--[clicks]
--[dial tone]

109
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,250
[LELOUCH] I wonder what's
going on over there? Hm.

110
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,458
[C.C.]
So then it seems like--

111
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,500
Right. It appears he
doesn't know about me.

112
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,375
That eliminates one group--

113
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,625
The military.

114
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,666
[C.C.] Aside from them
and the Black Knights,

115
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,541
I can't think of anyone else
who would have been there.

116
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,458
[LELOUCH] Someone from
the Japan Liberation Front

117
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,666
could have survived.

118
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,625
And they only stole your gun?

119
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,625
I think I'll have Ohgi check
out the black market then.

120
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,041
And the blood?

121
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,416
It'll take time to analyze.

122
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,333
There's something else...

123
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,583
I thought I saw Shirley there.

124
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,500
[C.C.]
Oh, the girl who kissed you?

125
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,541
[LELOUCH grunts]

126
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,166
Give it a rest, will ya?!

127
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,291
[C.C.] Just making sure I got
the right girl, lover boy.

128
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,000
But if she was there,
then there's something

129
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,541
we need to know, and we
better find out fast.

130
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,375
[DALTON] In this last
operation and also at Narita,

131
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,125
they were specifically
targeting you, Your Highness.

132
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,666
Eliminating the leader's
a standard tactic.

133
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,750
[GUILFORD] They also
eliminated Prince Clovis.

134
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,791
Zero is not merely
fighting Britannia...

135
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,083
He has a deep hatred
for the royal family,

136
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,458
and he wants blood.

137
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,625
Hatred?

138
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,625
[ZERO]
Euphemia...

139
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,791
You were willing to sacrifice

140
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:46,958
You haven't changed.

141
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,625
[CORNELIA]
Careful, Euphy.

142
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,125
[EUPHEMIA]
Huh?

143
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,458
[CORNELIA] I don't want another
crisis like at the hotel.

144
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,458
[GUILFORD]
Why not assign a knight to her?

145
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,833
A knight?

146
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,541
Yes. If we assign one knight
as a permanent sentinel,

147
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,000
then we can build a complete
royal guard unit around him.

148
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,500
As sub-viceroy,

149
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,583
Princess Euphemia has the
right to a personal champion.

150
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,458
[CECILE] This thing about
"saving people's lives,"

151
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,583
at first I thought he was
just, y'know, sensitive,

152
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,041
but now, I mean it's more
like an obsession, isn't it?

153
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,041
[LLOYD] His performance
data is still solid, right?

154
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,375
Is this a good time to put that
new thing to a test with him?

155
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,083
But we're still fine-tuning.

156
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,875
What I'm saying is, treating
Suzaku like he's just another

157
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,333
part of the machine could
have serious consequences.

158
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,541
We better deal with the
human issue here first.

159
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,750
Pardon me, but really,
aren't you taking care of him

160
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,000
in place of someone else?

161
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,916

I'm not sure about that, but...

out here by yourself?

I need to wait till they
finish disinfecting my room.

Why should I have to go rifling

through some girl's underwear?

This is going to cost you!

It always does.

Hmph!

You could do this solo,
and she'd be thrilled to know

175
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,625
the man she loves went
searching through--

176
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,041
[LELOUCH]
That's my business.

177
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,958
[C.C.] Once again, making
a big deal out of nothing.

178
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,041
Well, there's no sign
of that gun in here.

179
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,833
And her diary only
goes up to the 14th.

180
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:17,958
[LELOUCH]
Fourteenth?

181
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,166
[C.C.]
Yeah.

182
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,250
But that's the day that
her father had died.

183
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,291
[gasps]

184
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,166
What?

185
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,916
They're a bunch
of photos of you.

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,083
[LELOUCH]
Of me?

187
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,458
[C.C.] How could our
suspect be so sweet?

188
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,208
Ah, just can the
sarcasm, would ya?

189
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,750
[LELOUCH]
Narita?

190
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,375
[SHIRLEY]
Lulu, how could you do this?

191
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,500
[MAO]
Yes, how could he?

192
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,541
[SHIRLEY gasps]

193
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,500
A fine very memorial.

194
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,708
Isn't that right,
Miss Shirley Fenette?

195
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,958
[SHIRLEY]
Wh-Who...?

196
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,625
[TAMAKI] Man, it was so close!
We had her right there!

197
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,833
[KALLEN] Next time, I'll
beat that white Knightmare.

198
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,125
[MINAMI]
Aw, don't sweat it.

199
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,458
Yeah, Tamaki got thrashed
in the first minute.

200
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,958
[GROUP laughs]

201
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,750
The JLF war ship...

202
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:22,583
[KALLEN]
Huh?

203
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,791
[OHGI]
Why'd it blow up?

204
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,208
It self-destructed.

205
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,666
We did contact them and
say we would help, right?

206
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,791
Yo, that's why Zero took action.

207
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,500
I know! They wanted
to see his face!

208
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,666
[laughs]

209
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,708
You're not doubting
Zero again, are you?

210
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,875
Well, it's just that--

211
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,333
[DIETHARD]
Yes...

212
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,333
It's just that the timing
was too convenient, right?

213
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,750
So what are you going to do if
you find out Zero was behind it?

214
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,208
What are you trying to say?!

215
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,416
Yeah, Diethard!

216
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,791
I heard you got
wussy and ran away!

217
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,083
A gutless Brit's
got a lot of kahunas

218
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,666
talking trash to his
superiors like that!

219
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,416
I was making an assessment;
that's my new job here.

220
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,958
Ohgi, you agreed to
it, too, didn't you?

221
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,041
--[KALLEN] Huh?
--[OHGI] Uh...

222
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,791
That's right.
And Zero did approve it.

223
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,041
[C.C.]
So, do you love her?

224
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,250
This girl called, "Shirley"?

225
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,458
[LELOUCH]
Don't know.

226
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,208
[C.C.]
Do you hate her?

227
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,375
[LELOUCH]
Don't know.

228
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,500
Then why are we
going to Narita?

229
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,916
You know the reason why.

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,458
'Cause she may have
discovered who I am.

231
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,250
[C.C.]
What if she really does know?

232
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,291
Are you going to kill her?

233
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,500
[LELOUCH gasps]

234
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,541
If you have someone
you don't want to lose,

235
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,375
you should keep
them at a distance.

236
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,625
So is that... from experience?

237
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,125
No. It's a way of life.

238
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,958
[MAO]
He's a cruel man, isn't he?

239
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,125
Lelouch?

240
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,000
[SHIRLEY]
H-How do you know about Lulu?

241
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,583
[MAO]
Aw, he deceived you.

242
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,208
Never told you he's Zero.

243
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,791
[SHIRLEY gasps]
Who are you?! What do you want?!

244
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,541
[MAO] The same mouth that
ordered your father's death

245
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,333
stole a kiss from
your tender lips.

246
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,083
He's a very bad man,
and you like it!

247
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,250
[SHIRLEY gasps]

248
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,458
[MAO]
Punishment must be measured out.

249
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,625
To him...

250
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,833
...and to you.

251
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:01,708
To me?

252
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,666
[MAO]
I know everything.

253
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,958
All that happened that night...

254
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,833
[SHIRLEY panting]

255
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,041
[VILETTA]
Is that Zero?!

256
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,083
[SHIRLEY gasps]

257
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,416
[VILETTA]
Well, well, what a shocker.

258
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,125
The student is Zero himself!

259
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,625
A Britannian.

260
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,291
[chuckles]

261
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,625
[laughs]

262
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,583
When I bring him to
Viceroy Cornelia,

263
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,000
she'll make me a noble--

264
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,291
not just a Knight of
Honor, real nobility!

265
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,166
And he's still alive, too!

266
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,166
What kind of grand execution
will they have in store for him?

267
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,958
Of course, you'll
be rewarded, too.

268
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,833
--[gasps]
--[SHIRLEY whimpering]

269
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,041
Stupid of me! He's your
boyfriend, isn't he?!

270
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,125
--[SHIRLEY] Lulu!
--[gunshot]

271
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,958
[MAO]
So you're a killer, too.

272
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,416
Just like Zero.

273
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,000
[SHIRLEY gasps]
No! That's not true, I just--

274
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,375
And you actually used
your father's death

275
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,666
for your own gain!

276
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,708
[SHIRLEY gasps]

277
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:06,750
No! I just... I just...!

278
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,333
Cunning little woman!

279
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,458
You knew he'd feel sorry
for you, didn't you?

280
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,375
So you played it for
all it was worth.

281
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,708
No! You're wrong!

282
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,250
[MAO] Did his sympathy
make you all tingly?

283
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,416
Stop it!

284
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,833
[MAO] Playing the
tragic heroine again?

285
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,791
No! I'm not doing that!

286
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,875
[MAO] A girl who kills and then
goes fishing for attention?

287
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,375
Only evil witches do that.

288
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,250
I didn't-- I never meant--

289
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,125
You knew there was another
girl who liked Lelouch,

290
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,916
and you wanted to get
him away from her.

291
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,083
[SHIRLEY gasps]

292
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,625
Now you have to pay
the price, Shirley.

293
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:43,541
[SHIRLEY sobs]

294
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,583
[MAO] Do you want to carry
these feelings around

295
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,708
for the rest of your life?
All by yourself?

296
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,458
Unless you atone and
completely free your heart,

297
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,833
you and Lelouch will
both be lost in your sins.

298
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,458
Forever.

299
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,833
[LELOUCH sighs]

300
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,375
I thought she'd be here.

301
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,291
[C.C.] We'll have to split
up and look for her.

302
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,208
[LELOUCH] Do you even know
what Shirley looks like?

303
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,708
[C.C.]
What's with you now?

304
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,875
[LELOUCH] The chance is so
slim, I doubt she's even here.

305
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,666
What if she really does know?

306
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,166
Are you going to kill her?

307
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,000
[LELOUCH] No, wait.
There was someone else here.

308
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,166
Where'd they go?

309
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,125
And what were they
doing with Shirley?

310
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,291
Calm down.

311
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,958
--Work from the beginning.
--[phone rings]

312
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,208
--[gasps]
--[ringing continues]

313
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,583
It's Shirley!

314
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,625
I'm here.

315
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,958
Where're you calling from?

316
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,958
[MAO chuckles]
Where indeed?

317
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,083
[LELOUCH]
Who are you?!

318
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,291
You scum!

319
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,958
What have you done
with Shirley?!

320
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,291
Ooh, I like it! The scary face!

321
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,166
The face of a man whose
woman was stolen away!

322
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,833
What the hell did
you do with her?!

323
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,125
You want to know?

324
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,708
Then you'll have to
accept my challenge.

325
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,708
You specialize in this.

326
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't you?

327
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,083
[C.C.] Are you familiar
with Balinese art?

328
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,291
I don't have a photo, but I can
paint her in Batuan style.

329
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,083
What, I'm supposed to wait
around here while you do that?

330
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,333
I don't think so.

331
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,083
Why don't you go ask the
police or the soldiers?

332
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,666
I'd like to avoid that
kind of dull crisis.

333
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,500
Then why don't you climb up on
something tall and look around?

334
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,541
Very well, nevermind.

335
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,500
[C.C.]
Hm?

336
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,083
What's Lelouch up to?

337
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,125
Huh?

338
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,041
[C.C.]
It can't be! Mao!

339
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,541
[LELOUCH]
Is he the one?

340
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,916
Our other eye-witness?

341
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,583
I'm sure this chess
game is just a ploy.

342
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:51,500
[LELOUCH] His real goal is to
lure me to an isolated place.

343
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,875
You know, I've never actually

344
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,625
played this game
before, don't you?

345
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,708
[LELOUCH] Calling on my mobile,
was he just being theatrical?

346
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,291
No... He didn't know
what I look like!

347
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,083
That means he didn't
see me that night,

348
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,541
and he didn't have time
to find a photo of me.

349
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,958
He hasn't planned this out.

350
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,958
He's wingin' it. Which means--

351
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,625
There's an opening you can use?

352
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,125
[LELOUCH gasps]

353
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,333
[MAO] Shouldn't you be thinking
about the game a bit more?

354
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,125
You could lose.

355
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,291
[LELOUCH grunts]

356
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,791
You liar, you have
played this game before!

357
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,666
[C.C.]
Lelouch, even you...

358
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,083
No, because it's you,
you can never beat Mao!

359
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,416
[LELOUCH grunting]

360
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,833
[LELOUCH]
Impossible.

361
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,416
He's got me trapped?!

362
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,125
[MAO chuckles]

363
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,083
So, can we just call it my game?

364
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,333
Hm?

365
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,166
[LELOUCH] How could he
predict every move I made?!

366
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,583
Who is this guy?!

367
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,583
[MAO]
Didn't C.C. tell you about me?

368
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,333
[LELOUCH gasps]

369
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,583
Well done!

370
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,958
In one lightning moment,

371
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,416
you came up with 14
possible identities for me.

372
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,791
And one of them is
precisely correct.

373
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,458
[LELOUCH gasps]
He has Geass, too!

374
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,500
Let's see now, for your Geass,

375
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,083
you have to look directly
into someone's eyes.

376
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, I know all of the rules
for your little gift.

377
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,458
You can read minds!

378
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,791
You could call my Geass
"mind reading."

379
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,458
What the hell did
you do to Shirley?!

380
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,500
Tell me! What did
you do, kill her?!

381
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,000
Of course not.

382
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,291
[LELOUCH gasps]
It's Shirley!

383
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:25,166
So now then, let the vital
punishment games begin.

384
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,750
[OHGI]
Zero...

385
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,000
You weren't yourself yesterday.

386
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,208
Why do I have this feeling?

387
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,250
[OHGI gasps]

388
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,625
[OHGI]
Are you all right?!

389
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,708
Talk to me!

390
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,708
Hey!

391
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,291
C'mon!

392
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,458
[VILETTA groans]

393
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,750
You're alive!

394
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,875
So... it's you...! Zero!

395
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:50,916
[OHGI gasps]

396
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,083
[LELOUCH]
Shirley, that gun is...

397
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,583
Yes. It's Zero's.

398
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,208
Your gun, Lulu.

399
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,291
[LELOUCH grunts]

400
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,333
[MAO]
Why don't you use your Geass?

401
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,833
[LELOUCH gasps]

402
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,000
[MAO] I'm pretty sure you
haven't used it on her, right?

403
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,458
[LELOUCH growls]

404
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,500
[MAO] Of course if you do,
I'll just shoot you, myself.

405
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,583
[gun cocks]

406
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,208
[LELOUCH]
Can he read any thoughts?

407
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,000
Or only those on the surface?

408
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,000
Are there conditions
to his Geass?

409
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,291
A time lag? Time limit?

410
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,791
And what's he after?!

411
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,291
If he plans to kill me, then...

412
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,833
Keep thinking about it.

413
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,583
That's your strong-point, right?

414
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,333
Thoughts spinning round
and round and round--

415
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,916
[LELOUCH]
Shut up!

416
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,375
This is a fitting death, poetic
justice for a thief like you.

417
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,250
[LELOUCH]
Huh...?

418
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,250
[SHIRLEY]
Lulu, die.

419
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,458
[LELOUCH gasps]

420
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,125
We'll atone for our sins.

421
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,125
We have to!
I'll die with you!

422
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,000
W-What?

423
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,875
She's already killed one time.

424
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,166
She shot the person
who saw your face.

425
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,333
All to protect
your little secret.

426
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,041
Then, that blood was...

427
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,875
It's time to end
this together, Lulu.

428
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,541
Yes, yes, sinners
must be punished.

429
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,875
You put her up to all of this!

430
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,333
[LELOUCH]
I see. He reads her mind,

431
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,791
and then it's easy for him
to confuse and control her.

432
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,833
Yes! That's right!

433
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,208
No, don't let him trick you!

434
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,375
Shirley, he's just--

435
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,333
Come now, are you
actually saying this?

436
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,958
The guy who lied to
her from the start?

437
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,500
No! Stop it!

438
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,166
If murder's a sin, then this
absolutely increases the sin!

439
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,750
Oh, I like the rhetoric!
Very pithy!

440
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,958
Shirley, did you
really kill somebody?!

441
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,708
And if you did kill, was he the
one who was controlling you?!

442
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,000
Shirley pulled the
trigger and she knows it.

443
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,666
When you hide away your
sins, it only get worse.

444
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,416
He's trying to
confuse you, Shirley!

445
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,958
Why don't you just shut up?!

446
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,250
[LELOUCH groans]

447
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,958
[SHIRLEY gasps]

448
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:51,208
[SHIRLEY sobs]

449
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,375
[MAO]
What are you hesitating for?

450
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,333
He's the one who
killed your father!

451
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,250
Don't you know he's
a sinner? Kill him now!

452
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,166
[SHIRLEY]
But...

453
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,333
[LELOUCH]
Shirley!

454
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,916
[SHIRLEY]
I just... I don't...

455
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,750
What the heck's
up with this girl?

456
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,875
Her thoughts are
just a jumble now.

457
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,958
I'll just have to do it--

458
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,291
[SHIRLEY]
Stop it!

459
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,500
Just stop it!

460
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,583
Fine, consider it stopped.

461
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,250
You two just do
whatever it is you want.

462
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,750
[SHIRLEY sighs]

463
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,125
Shirley!

464
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,208
[LELOUCH grunts]

465
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,291
What a pain.

466
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,541
It was so dramatic and juicy...

467
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,041
Now I'll have kill them
the old boring way--

468
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,916
[grunts]

469
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,750
Who did that?! Why didn't
I sense them there?!

470
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,500
It couldn't be--

471
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,833
C.C.!

472
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,708
I just knew it!

473
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,416
We finally meet again!

474
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,958
It's you! It's really you!

475
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,375
[C.C.]
Are you awake, Mao?

476
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,583
Forgive me, Mao.

477
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,750
Thank the way.
See, Mao? You can do it!

478
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,291
Thank you, Mao.

479
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,708
[MAO laughs] You look beautiful,
C.C.! I love that new look.

480
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,458
C.C.! I'll come to see
you as soon as I can!

481
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,666
I promise. I promise!

482
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,791
[C.C.]
Mao...

483
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,000
I never thought you would
come out among people.

484
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,541
[LELOUCH]
It's all right now.

485
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,791
It's over.

486
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,375
Lulu, I really
did kill someone.

487
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,333
That's why I...

488
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,708
[LELOUCH]
It's because of me.

489
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,541
It's not your fault.

490
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,833
And I shot you with your gun.

491
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,416
I'm still alive.

492
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,833
But... I did it!

493
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:34,041
[LELOUCH] Shirley, any sin
you committed is mine to bear.

494
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,250
[SHIRLEY]
I wanted you to be kind to me...

495
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,875
[LELOUCH]
What's wrong with that?

496
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,041
[SHIRLEY]
Even though my father died...

497
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,666
[LELOUCH]
Don't worry, it's time to forget

498
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,250
all the bad things that
have happened to you.

499
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,375
[SHIRLEY]
I can't!

500
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,333
Yes, you can!

501
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,583
[SHIRLEY gasps]

502
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,125
[LELOUCH] I'll help
you forget all of this.

503
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,375
Impossible.

504
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,666
[LELOUCH] Shirley, I'm
sorry about your father.

505
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,583
If I could be reborn into
a new life... I would.

506
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,750
Lulu... No, don't!

507
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,708
Oh, hello.

508
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,791
Um, did you lose someone
in your family, too?

509
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,416
No, not someone
from my family.

510
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,083
It was a friend.

511
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:23,458
Someone, well, very...
important.

512
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,041
I understand.

513
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,625
But I didn't know...

514
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,875
I didn't know until
after I lost her.

515
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,875
Then I realized how
much she meant to me.

516
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,541
How her smile saved me.

517
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,500
And how I'll never be
able to argue or laugh

518
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,083
with her like that again.

519
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,875
[SHIRLEY] I see.
You loved her, didn't you?

520
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,583
You must feel terrible.

521
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,916
Right now, I don't know anymore.

522
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,791
Well, the morning
always comes again.

523
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:53,750
What?

524
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,083
I have to say, it's funny.

525
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,083
I know that I came out
here for some reason,

526
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,000
but I can't remember
exactly what it was now.

527
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,541
Maybe it's because I already
put the whole thing behind me,

528
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,791
something I wanted to let go of.

529
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,458
Maybe it was something I
thought I couldn't forget.

530
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,916
Maybe I was full of sadness.

531
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,541
But morning still comes, right?

532
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,666
That's why you shouldn't try to

533
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,000
hold back your
thoughts like that.

534
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,666
Yes, you're right.

535
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,250
I feel the same way now.

536
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,750
Thanks a lot...

537
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,416
...for everything.

538
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,625
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

539
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,291
[LELOUCH]
Maybe I was too soft.

540
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,416
Maybe it would have been
better to just kill Shirley.

541
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,333
But...

542
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,416
Geass, the power of the king,

543
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,000
will condemn you to
a life of solitude.

544
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,708
So I need to harden
my heart even more.

545
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,250
Then, it's me and Mao.

546
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,625
Payback!
