1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,458
[C.C.] Lelouch, a young,
outcast prince of Britannia,

2
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,791
possesses two great powers:

3
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,333
One of them is the
absolute ability to compel

4
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,833
any person to do
whatever he commands.

5
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:32,166
The other is the Black Knights,
his military force assembled

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,833
with the intent of destroying
the Britannian Empire

7
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,541
ruled by his father.

8
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,833
Veiling his true identity behind
a mask and the code name Zero,

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,958
Lelouch has made his move
to avenge his mother's murder

10
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,750
and to create a world in which
his younger sister Nunnally

11
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,500
can find happiness.

12
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,375
What will be the final
outcome of these actions?

13
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,500
At this point,
no one can predict.

14
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,625
[VICE MINISTER]
The Japan Liberation Front

15
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,791
was nearly wiped out by your
Narita operation, Viceroy.

16
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,708
Now we're hunting down
the survivors one by one.

17
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,291
[CORNELIA]
Are you being sarcastic?

18
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,333
We're barely pulling our forces
back together after that fiasco.

19
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,166
[VICE MINISTER]
No! I-I didn't mean to--

20
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,541
[GUILFORD]
The occupation government

21
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,333
is responsible for this!

22
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,958
They've done nothing about
Area Eleven's subways

23
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,666
and mining railways!

24
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,958
In the ghettos, they falsify the
registries and property deeds,

25
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,458
as the rebellion
spreads unchallenged!

26
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,833
Uhh, the subway tunnels
stretch over the whole country.

27
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,750
We can't just fill them all in.
We don't have the budget.

28
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,375
[GUILFORD]
The terrorists are using them

29
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,458
as their strike bases
and escape routes!

30
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,125
[VICE MINISTER]
P-Prince Clovis instructed us--

31
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,041
[grunts]

32
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,625
Uh, he said...

33
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,583
...forcing them would
fuel the rebellion,

34
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,791
giving the Chinese Federation
an excuse to attack.

35
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,250
They've already
got their excuse!

36
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,416
Zero's growing stronger
and bolder every day!

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,750
[DARLTON] Vice-minister,
Internal Affairs has appointed

38
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,708
a special group of
Elevens to self-govern

39
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,375
this area, isn't that right?

40
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,458
A group who are
called the N.A.C.

41
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,708
[gasping]

42
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,500
When we stormed Narita,
we looked for evidence

43
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,416
of the N.A.C.'s conspiracies.

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,583
But it was buried
in the landslide...

45
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:44,708
Still our suspicions remain
high. If we supress them now...

46
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,791
[CORNELIA]
Hm...

47
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,250
A group of blue bloods
and plutocrats.

48
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,291
Relics of their dismal past.

49
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,916
[VICE MINISTER]
W-Wait, please!

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,333
These are just rumors; there's
no evidence of that at all!

51
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,958
I-If you suppress them,
then the Elevens' economy

52
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,791
will certainly collapse!

53
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,541
That means no tax revenue
to send to the homeland!

54
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,958
Also it's a prime directive
of the empire

55
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,583
that Numbers should take
care of their own kind!

56
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,000
And what have you done
to find the Black Knights?!

57
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,916
[VICE MINISTER] We unearthed
a shield machine they left

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,916
showing Zero was behind
the Narita operation.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
B-But that's all we've got;
you can't squeeze information

60
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,625
out of corpses.

61
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,125
[CORNELIA]
So you can't catch Zero

62
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,583
and you don't want
us to hit Kyoto.

63
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,166
Do you know the word
"incompetent," minister?

64
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,000
It's for people who
can't get results.

65
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,625
[KIRIHARA]
So, the Britannian viceroy

66
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,041
has gone this far already.

67
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,083
[MUNAKATA] With the
Liberation Front smashed,

68
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,750
the last embers of Japan
have died away.

69
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,916
[OSAKABE]
No!

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,833
He may be on the run, but Toudou
is still strong, still fighting!

71
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,625
[KUBOIN]
Even if that's so,

72
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:47,500
I heard he lost his custom
Burais, so there's no hope--

73
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,791
[KAGUYA]
There IS hope.

74
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,125
[KIRIHARA]
Hm?

75
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,458
The Black Knights?
You've been enfatuated with Zero

76
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,750
since he rescued
Suzaku Kururugi.

77
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,416
We even sent him
the Guren MK-II.

78
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,000
[TEACHER] And after the defeat
at Trafalgar, Elizabeth the 3rd

79
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:06,416
found herself surrounded by
revolutionaries in Edinburgh.

80
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,875
--Oh, father...
--However, with the help

81
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,708
of Lord Britannia, she fled
to the American colonies,

82
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,916
now known as our
homeland, Britannia.

83
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,208
[SHIRLEY]
Hmm...

84
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,083
[SHIRLEY groans]

85
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,750
[groaning continues]

86
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,333
[SHIRLEY sighs]

87
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,333
Huh?

88
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,416
Okay, what's got you so worried?

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,458
Constipated? Your monthly?

90
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,166
[SHIRLEY]

91
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,541
Uh?! T-That's not it!

92
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,250
Ah. You're lonely 'cause
Lelouch is gone, aren't you?

93
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,750
We-eh...

94
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,250
It's more like, Kallen's
absent the same day he is.

95
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,666
Again...

96
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, so carefree while the
rest of the world grapples

97
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,041
with what happened at Narita.

98
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,250
Suzaku's been out for two days
because of that, too.

99
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,625
[SHIRLEY]
I know that!

100
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,958
But Lulu and Kallen?
Gone on the same day together?

101
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:51,916
That's serious!

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,458
[giggles]

103
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,333
[MILLY] I envy you, Shirley.
That's what I love about you!

104
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,333
[gasps]

105
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,916
[SHIRLEY]
Don't make fun of me!

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,291
[ARTHUR meows]

107
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,958
Then just tell him already!

108
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,500
Three little words:
"I like you!"

109
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,750
U-Uh... I couldn't!
I just couldn't!

110
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,250
I mean, what if--

111
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,291
[MILLY]
"What if he rejects me?!

112
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,833
It could ruin our
great friendship!"

113
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,875
[laughs]

114
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,875
You don't have to laugh
that hard, you know?

115
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,666
[MILLY]
It's comfortable, isn't it?

116
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,000
This place now.
The way we are together.

117
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,625
[SHIRLEY]
That's true.

118
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,291
[MILLY] Still, we should
prepare ourselves a bit.

119
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,291
The fact is, nothing stays
the same forever, you know.

120
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,666
[sighs]

121
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,916
Oh, forget it! Please don't
take me too seriously.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,125
If it's bothering you,

123
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,583
why not just ask him
the next chance you get?

124
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,541
So, how do you feel
about it from your side?

125
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,416
[gasps]

126
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,958
[SHIRLEY] L-Lulu!
I thought you were absent!

127
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,333
Nunnally had a little
fever this morning.

128
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,791
And Sayoko was busy,
so I stayed home to help.

129
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,833
Oh, really? You don't say...

130
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,000
So is Nunna feeling better now?

131
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,125
[LELOUCH]
A bit.

132
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,791
Madame President, those papers?

133
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,375
Oh, right.

134
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,750
Make sure you organize all of
them by year and class, okay?

135
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,000
[LELOUCH]
Yeah, I will.

136
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,250
You have a talent for
ordering people around.

137
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,666
[MILLY]
And you're a great subordinate!

138
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,166
[LELOUCH] Subordinate?
I guess that's what I am.

139
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,083
Oh, Madame President!

140
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,041
You nearly gave me a
heart attack doing that!

141
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,375
Huh? Where's my tickets...?

142
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,291
Ah?!

143
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,791
Lulu!

144
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,375
[LELOUCH]
What is it?

145
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:30,041
[SHIRLEY] Um, is my dad's letter
mixed up with that paperwork?

146
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,208
[LELOUCH]
Hmm? Oh, sorry...

147
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,708
What's wrong?

148
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,458
Ah, Lulu!

149
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,458
Shirley?

150
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,916
Huh?

151
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,666
Stop being so suspicious.

152
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,750
That's hardly the case.

153
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,833
To me, he's nothing
more than a...

154
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,250
[SHIRLEY panting]

155
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,000
I did it!
I actually really did it!

156
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,583
So now what happens?
He'll come, right?!

157
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,833
I mean, he didn't say no.

158
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,125
Then again--uh-uh,
he's just coming with me

159
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,666
to little a concert...

160
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,083
So it's no big thing.
But, still, it's a chance!

161
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,500
[sighs]
Thank you, Father.

162
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:29,041
[phone rings]

163
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,625
[OHGI] Kyoto praised us for
using the Guren MK-II so well.

164
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,500
I thought that was encouraging.

165
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,875
[KALLEN]
But there was the White Armor--

166
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,500
[TAMAKI] Don't sweat it!
It was a tie, right? A tie!

167
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,875
[TAMAKI laughs]

168
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,833
[LELOUCH] Why would Shirley
just out of the blue...

169
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,083
My dad works a
long way from here,

170
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,958
but he likes to send me
great stuff like this

171
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,125
to keep my spirits up, y'know?

172
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,250
So, I was just wondering...

173
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,000
[OHGI]
Here.

174
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,416
[ZERO]
Hm? What's this?

175
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,625
[OHGI]
A love letter.

176
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,250
[ZERO]
Oh? From you?

177
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,750
[laughs] And they say
you have no sense of humor!

178
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,833
--[laughs]
--You laugh too much.

179
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,750
[OHGI] It's an official
letter from Kyoto.

180
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,375
They urgently request a meeting.

181
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,916
[ZERO] Is this really
such a big deal?

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,500
A big deal? It's Kyoto!

183
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,166
If they accept us,
it means funding and support.

184
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,125
It could solve
our financial crisis.

185
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,708
--[ZERO] Crisis?
--[OHGI gasps]

186
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,333
[ZERO]
There shouldn't be any problem

187
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,583
if you're following
the budget I laid out.

188
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,500
Well, uh...

189
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,291
Hey, it's not my fault!

190
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,541
We're turning into
a big organization now!

191
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,333
That means new
expenses, y'know.

192
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,500
Like fancy dinners for the new
recruits so you can show off?

193
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,041
Hey, you--

194
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,833
[KALLEN] I know where you've
been taking them, "big spender!"

195
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,208
You know about it?

196
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,666
[ZERO sighs]

197
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,000
[ZERO] We'll put Ohgi in charge
of the treasury for now.

198
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,333
Hold it right there! I'm the one
that's in charge of the cash!

199
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,375
That's my job!

200
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,541
[ZERO]
If you want me to trust you,

201
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,083
then show me some results.

202
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,750
Did you actually
just say "trust"?!

203
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,500
A guy who hides his face
from his own partners?!

204
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,000
How about it, Zero? Huh?!

205
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,625
Hold on, that's, uh...

206
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,208
[KALLEN]
Zero's not the problem here!

207
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,791
Who cares who he is?!

208
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,916
He had the skill to outwit
Cornelia, didn't he?

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,416
That's why he's the leader
of the Black Knights!

210
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,291
Do you really need
to know more?

211
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,750
[TAMAKI growls]

212
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,041
[NUNNALLY]
Nina is that you?

213
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,791
If you're not
feeling well, then...

214
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,500
[NINA]
Oh, no. It's nothing.

215
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,666
Don't worry about it.

216
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,333
[TAMAKI sighs]
So what do we do?

217
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,500
I don't know...

218
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,625
[MINAMI]
We were in Naoto's unit.

219
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,416
[SUGIYAMA] I don't mind about
his kid-sister Kallen, but...

220
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,625
[TAMAKI] You were next
in line to be leader!

221
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,708
No one said that at Narita.

222
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,000
'Cause Zero
practically forced us.

223
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,416
[YOSHIDA]
We're the senior commanders,

224
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,791
and he keeps secrets from us!

225
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,125
[OHGI sighs]

226
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,083
[LELOUCH] I've narrowed it
down to 12 possibilites.

227
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,583
Now let's see
which bets pay off.

228
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,583
For that, I'll have to
meet them face to face.

229
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,041
--[knocking at door]
--[gasps]

230
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,458
[LELOUCH]
Who is it?

231
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,041
[KALLEN]
It's me.

232
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:10,000
Um, I'm sorry if I was out of
line when I spoke up back there.

233
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,833
Kallen, tell me, do you wanna
know my identity as well?

234
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,291
[KALLEN grunts]

235
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,458
[KALLEN]
That girl knows, doesn't she?

236
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,375
[KALLEN]
No. Sorry to bother you.

237
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,541
[NUNNALLY]
Lelouch?

238
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,458
[LELOUCH]
Looks like your fever's gone.

239
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,958
Maybe I was just a little moody.

240
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,666
[LELOUCH]
Moody?

241
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,375
It just seems to me, lately,
that you've become

242
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,500
a little distant, like
you have other things

243
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,083
weighing on your mind.

244
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,666
[giggles]

245
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,500
Perhaps my body just did this on
its own to get your attention.

246
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,708
[LELOUCH]
You're wrong. I haven't changed.

247
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:08,000
No matter what, I'll always
be at your side, Nunnally.

248
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,166
So, then, can I be
a little selfish now?

249
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,000
Please hold my hand
just a little bit longer.

250
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,958
If I fall asleep alone...

251
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,833
I'm afraid, I'll have
that dream again.

252
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,000
[C.C.] You're serious?
You're asking me for a favor?

253
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,875
Yes. I got the idea from
something that you said.

254
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,541
No matter what Kyoto's
intentions are,

255
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,125
I want their power.

256
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,291
Is that what you
truly wish for?

257
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,750
If it's at the very core
of your reason for living,

258
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,125
then I'll try to help you.

259
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,875
Then do it.
C.C., I need you.

260
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,083
I understand. By the way,
you forgot something.

261
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,333
[LELOUCH grunts]

262
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,916
I didn't forget.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,583
I don't know when
I'll be back tonight,

264
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,375
so I was planning to
call her and cancel.

265
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,041
Stick to your contract--

00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,583

267
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,333
It's me.

268
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,250
Oh, good timing.
I wanted to call.

--Y'see--
--[SHIRLEY] Um, listen, Lulu...

Hmm?

271
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,916
[SHIRLEY] I-I know I made a date
with you, but I may be late.

272
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,458
Sorry, but, anyway I'm
sure it'll be fine, really!

273
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,541
But I promise you
that I'll be there.

274
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,208
Please bring your
command staff along,

275
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,250
as per my master's
instruction, understood?

276

perimeter in case

277
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,125
of any unpleasant contingencies.

278
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,291
I'll call them soon.
However, before I do...

279
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,708
[DISASTER BROADCASTER]
Severely damaged corpses

280
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,125
should be brought to tent 2.
I.D. all personal items.

281
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,291
Bring remains with identifiable
faces to tent 1.

282

report to tent 2!

00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,791
[SUZAKU] Was it really her?
Did I really see here there?

287
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,250
And then...

288
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,958
[SUZAKU]
Just forget it!

289
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,875
She doesn't show up
in any of the data!

290
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,708
[LLOYD] Dug enough bodies
out of the landslide yet?

291
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,000
[SUZAKU] I'd like to continue
with recovery operations.

292
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,375
If that's possible,

293
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,125
Be my guest till
it's out of your system.

294
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,375
Consider it Princess Cornelia's
pleasure to indulge you.

00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,958
[SUZAKU sighs]

296
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,708
Ah, Lloyd, Zero and
the Black Knights,

297
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,541
what are they trying to do?

298
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,750
What do they hope to achieve
by sacrificing all these lives?

299
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,333
[LLOYD] They're "Nights for
Justice," haven't you heard?

300
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,875
[SUZAKU]
Is this "justice"?!

301
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,500
[LLOYD] Hey, hey, I hope you're
not going to start spouting

302
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,666
some embarassing theory
about the nature of justice.

303
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,916
We're soldiers, after all.

All set!

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,708
I replaced the

00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,416
I checked the units,
including the Purebloods'.

Yes. A radiant surge.

work with our enemies.

This is... the Fuji mines?!

That is not possible!
There's no way we could be here!

329
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,208
It has to be Mt. Fuji! There's
only one mountain like this.

330
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,541
[TAMAKI] That means the
Sakuradite is right below us?!

caused this whole war!

do to intruders here?

Execute them!

all the way out to here?

00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,583
a reflection of
what Japan has become.

343
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,583
It pains me so.

344
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,375
[KIRIHARA] I apologize
for not showing my face.

345
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,833
But, Zero, your face
is hidden as well.

346
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,708
Unfortunately,
I cannot allow this.

347
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,083
To trust you, I must
know who you are.

348
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,666
Therefore, you will
show me your face!

349
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,416
[gasps]

350
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,791
Please wait! Zero has
given us power and victory!

351
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,750
--That should--
--[KIRIHARA] Silence!

352
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,291
Now, which of you is Ohgi?

353
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,583
[OHGI]
Uh, that's me!

354
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,208
[KIRIHARA]
You will remove Zero's mask!

355
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,666
[gasps]

356
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,208
[KALLEN]
Ohgi!

357
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,875
I'm sorry, Zero,
but we need a reason

358
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,166
to put our faith in you, too.

359
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,458
So help us...

360
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,333
...to put our trust in you!

361
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,666
[TAMAKI, OHGI gasp]

362
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,750
[TAMAKI]
A woman?!

363
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,000
[OHGI]
It can't be!

364
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,458
[KALLEN]
It's not!

365
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,208
This isn't Zero!
I saw her before.

366
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,416
She was with Zero after Narita!

367
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,416
[KIRIHARA]
You there, girl, Is this true?

368
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,625
It is.

369
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,958
[KIRIHARA]
So, you are not Japanese?

370
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,166
Correct, clan-chief of Kyoto...

371
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,000
...Taizou Kirihara.

372
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,083
[GUARDS gasp]

373
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,541
Anyone who can
identify him must die!

374
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,291
Especially one
who is not Japanese!

375
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,000
Hey! Hold on!
I'm not part of this!

376
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,666
[ZERO]
You're soft!

377
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,458
And your methods and
thinking are outdated!

378
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,541
[KIRIHARA growls]

379
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,125
[ZERO]
That is why you'll never win!

380
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,083
Zero?

381
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,375
Wh-When did you--

382
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,250
Hold on! He can fire
at us with that remote!

383
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,666
Everyone, stay back!
Don't make a move!

384
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,833
[ZERO]
Taizou Kirihara.

385
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,791
Founder of Kirihara Industries
which has a monopoly

386
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,541
on Sakuradite mining.

387
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,875
Formerly a key backer
of the Kururugi regime.

388
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,458
However, when Japan fell,
you dodged the tribunals

389
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,041
by collaborating with
the colonial rulers.

390
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,291
Commonly known as
"Kirihara the Traitor."

391
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,666
In reality, you are
one of the leaders

392
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,625
of the "Six Houses of Kyoto,"

393
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,125
who support resistance
groups throughout Japan.

394
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,291
A double-agent. How cliché...

395
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,166
[MIB A]
Show some respect, you swine!

396
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,333
[KIRIHARA]
Stop!

397
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,833
[ZERO chuckles]

398
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:05,916
[ZERO] It's as you guessed
though. I... am not Japanese!

399
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,250
[ALL gasp]

400
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,750
Is he serious?!

401
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,125
No wonder he never
showed his face.

402
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,916
[KIRIHARA]
If you are not Japanese,

403
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,208
why do you fight for Japan?
What is it you want?!

404
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,166
[ZERO]
The destruction of Britannia.

405
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,291
[KIRIHARA] And so do you
believe that this is possible?

406
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,666
That you can do it?

407
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,000
[ZERO] I can, because I must.

408
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,666
I have reasons which
compel me inexorably!

409
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,208
[chuckles] I'm glad
I'm dealing with you.

410
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,208
[KIRIHARA gasps]
You!

411
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,958
It's been a long time.
Lord Kirihara.

412
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,916
[KIRIHARA]
Is it really you?

413
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,458
It's 8 years since that family
received you as a hostage.

414
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,666
[LELOUCH]
Yes.

415
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,333
And I appreciate you
taking care of me then.

416
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,083
[KIRIHARA]
If I hadn't come tonight,

417
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,583
were you planning to take
a messenger as hostage?

418
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,125
[LELOUCH]
Not at all.

419
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:56,375
I came to ask for your help;
that's all I'm seeking from you.

420
00:19:56,458 --> 00:20:00,541
So, the flower planted
8 years ago has finally bloomed.

421
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,791
[laughs]

422
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,791
[TAMAKI]
Oh, I can't see 'im!

423
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,708
[KIRIHARA]
Ohgi!

424
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,375
Yes?

425
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,000
[KIRIHARA] This man is a
true mortal enemy of Britannia.

426
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,166
His face must remain
hidden for vital reasons.

427
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,000
I urge you to follow Zero,
and I guarantee that if you do,

428
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,750
we will assist you generously

429
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,666
with intelligence and
strategic support.

430
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,333
[TAMAKI sighs]

431
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,291
We thank you!

432
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,958
[LELOUCH]
I am grateful, Lord Kirihara.

433
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,916
Are you embarking
on the path of blood?

434
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,333
Indeed. If that is my destiny.

435
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,791

Second, fifth, seventh,

436

eighth, and ninth platoons,
please continue confirmation...

437
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,500
Yes, the spelling of
Fenette matches this one.

438
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,291
I'm afraid this is him.

439
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,291
I'm sorry you had to
learn about it like this.

440
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,541
It's all right...

441
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,708
[SOLDIER] Can you
please identify the body?

[receiver rings]

443
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,125
Of course it's
too late all ready.

444
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,333
[LELOUCH] Anyway, things
are finally moving forward.

445
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,625
Now, the Black Knights
will operate as I envisioned.

446
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,083
[LELOUCH gasps]

447
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,916
[LELOUCH]
Ah, I'm sorry I was late.

448
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,416
I thought you'd already
be back home by now.

449
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,750
[LELOUCH]
Anyway, never mind that.

450
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,500
Come on, let's go someplace
to get out of the rain now.

Lulu, tell me...

00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,416
Zero, he fights for
the weak, doesn't he?

453
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
[LELOUCH]
Wha...?

454
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,708
Yeah, well, that's what he says.

455
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,041

why did he kill my father?

457
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,916
You know, my father...
was so gentle...

He never, ever hurt me...

00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,750
He didn't do anything wrong!

00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:05,708
But he was buried alive...
He couldn't... breathe...

462
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,875
Why...?

463
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,500
Why did my father have to die?!

[SHIRLEY]
Help me...

469

[LELOUCH] Yes, I understand
my actions have consequences.

470
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,125
I know that now, so why?

471
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,208
It'd be so easy to
vanish from the stage.

472
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,208
Just stop being Zero.

473
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,416
If I can keep Kirihara quiet,

474
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
I can go back to being
merely Lelouch Lamperouge.

475
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,791
But, even so...
