1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:22,583
[C.C.] In this world, evil can
arise from the best intentions.

2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:26,291
And there is good, which can
come from evil intentions.

3
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,916
How then should Lelouch's
actions be taken?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,125
Every man has his day of
judgment, does he not?

5
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,291
[C.C.]
Geass...

6
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:40,666
He who uses this inhuman power
will find his heart isolated,

7
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,458
whether he wants
it that way or not.

8
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:48,625
Thus, he plummets into the abyss
that lies between good and evil.

9
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:52,500
But if a man can climb out
of that abyss into the light,

10
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:56,250
then that man has
the soul of a king.

11
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,416
[LELOUCH] All right, first,
I just want to confirm this:

12
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,458
Are you my enemy or my ally?

13
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,041
Where's this coming from?

14
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,625
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

15
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,666
[LELOUCH] Mao's Geass lets him
get right into someone's head

16
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,958
and hear what they're
thinking and planning.

17
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,541
I've got that right, don't I?

18
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,958
[C.C.]
Yes.

19
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,791
The way Geass manifests is
different for each person.

20
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,375
If Mao concentrates,

21
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,416
he can hear thoughts
up to 500 meters away.

22
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,833
And he can read clear
down to your subconscious

23
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,125
if he wants to.

24
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,333
For someone like you
who fights with his head,

25
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,666
he's the worst possible enemy.

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,833
[LELOUCH]
Five hundred meters...

27
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,208
Well, it doesn't really
come as a surprise to me.

28
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,041
I knew there must be others
who had the power of Geass.

29
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,833
Did you make a
contract with him?

30
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,041
[C.C.]
Eleven years ago.

31
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,291
[LELOUCH]
So, he's my predecessor.

32
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,625
Is there some reason that this
forerunner is also my enemy?

33
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,083
[C.C.]
Mao's after me.

34
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,666
He may be your enemy,
but he's not targeting you.

35
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,375
Yeah, well I can see that.

36
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,125
He could have revealed
my true identity

37
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,916
and told the police or
the military who I am,

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,166
but the only one he
told was Shirley.

39
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,458
Are there limits to his powers?

40
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,750
Mao's Geass is very potent.

41
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,875
He can use it as many
times as he wants,

42
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,625
and he doesn't need direct
eye contact like you do.

43
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,041
[LELOUCH]
Does he have any weakness?

44
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,333
If you press me,

45
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,708
I guess it's that he
can't turn his power off.

46
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,708
In a crowd, he hears
all the minds

47
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:54,500
roiling and writhing around him,
whether he wants to or not.

48
00:03:54,583 --> 00:04:02,416
[overlapping voices]

49
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:12,500
--[more overlapping voices]
--[MAO gasping, panting]

50
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:18,750
--[more overlapping voices]
--[MAO gasping, panting]

51
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,083
[C.C.]
I understand, Mao.

52
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,125
Don't worry, Mao.
I'm not going to die.

53
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,750
Mao! Mao!

54
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,791
Are you awake, Mao?
Oh, Mao, how silly of you!

55
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,875
C.C., I can't live without you.

56
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:30,750
[C.C]
See, Mao?

57
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,958
Wait for me, I'm coming to you!

58
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,916
[LELOUCH] If Mao read my
mind, then he already knows

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,708
my weak points, and that's
where he'll strike.

60
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,833
It's been a long time since we
spent time by ourselves, huh?

61
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,458
You know, even Sayoko needs a
little time off now and again.

62
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:51,000
Starting today, I'll be
staying home for a while.

63
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,916
[NUNNALLY] Lately you've been
out of the house so much,

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,875
I was curious, have you
found some really fun game

65
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:56,958
to play or something?

66
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,250
Sort of.

67
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,625
My current opponent's
pretty hard to beat.

68
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:01,583
[NUNNALLY giggles]

69
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,750
That's funny.

70
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,375
Only our big brother Schneizel

71
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,875
would ever make you say
something like that.

72
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,625
[WEAPONS DEALER]
Sorry, but I can't sell you one

73
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,333
without a permit...
It's illegal.

74
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,750
Besides, you're from the
Chinese Federation, aren't you?

75
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,750
[MAO] Uh... true. But you sell
them to the Black Knights.

76
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,166
--[WEAPONS DEALER gasps]
--[MAO] Last Tuesday,

77
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,708
twenty-three hundred hours.

78
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,875
Your contact was named "Wolf."
An alias, of course.

79
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,750
Who are you?!

80
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,166
You will kindly accommodate me.

81
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,666
Won't you now?

82
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,125
[LELOUCH]
And?

83
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,166
I know that you want to
protect your sister and all,

84
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,791
but you can't just sit around
here and wait for him!

85
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,250
I've got the Black Knights
hunting for him.

86
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,250
[C.C.] What if he's not in
the ghetto like you think?

87
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,416
What if he's right here
in the Tokyo Settlement?

88
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,291
Then you'll have wasted
all that precious time

89
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,750
when you could just
use me as bait.

90
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,791
I'm Mao's target,
so I should be--

91
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,708
Tell me, if I keep
using my Geass,

92
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,250
will I become like him?

93
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,750
[C.C. gasps]

94
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,166
Or did he end up the way he
is because he didn't fulfill

95
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,083
his contract with you?

96
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,500
The more you use your Geass,
the more powerful it becomes.

97
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,125
Those who cannot
control the power

98
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,875
are ultimately ravaged
and consumed by it.

99
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,666
And even though you knew
everything about that,

100
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,208
you still offered
these contracts?!

101
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:10,791
To me?!

102
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,750
And to Mao?!

103
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,791
That's right.

104
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,333
[LELOUCH]
You're a cruel girl.

105
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,666
I don't know why anyone
would chase after you.

106
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,125
Mao couldn't fulfill
his contract with you,

107
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,750
so you cut him loose.

108
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,166
What were the terms
of the contract?

109
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,916
You're a monster!

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,416
[C.C. gasps]

111
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,583
[LELOUCH] Why didn't you finish
it when you cut him off?!

112
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,250
You should have taken his
power back, or taken his life!

113
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,791
Because you left things
half-finished, Shirley was--!

114
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,000
[C.C.] We should split up
while we're dealing with Mao.

115
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,583
Starting today, I'll
stay in the next hall.

116
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,041
You can't.

117
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,208
The student council and the
culture clubs meet there.

118
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,750
[C.C.]
I don't care about that.

119
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,250
You work it out.

120
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,083
[SUZAKU]
A medical check up?

121
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,291
[CECILE]
Just regulations.

122
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,125
It's required for
all Knightmare pilots.

123
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,458
I understand.

124
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,833
Good. Tomorrow then,
after your school gets out.

125
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:05,958
[SUZAKU]
Right. Thanks.

126
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,458
Oh, Miss Cecile...

127
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,000
Do know of any way I can get
in to see Princess Euphemia?

128
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,833
[CECILE]
Huh? You want to meet her?

129
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,000
Forget it.

130
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,458
You have to be at least
a Knight of Honor

131
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,875
to get an audience with her.

132
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,666
But an earl could arrange it,
if he really wanted to.

133
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,625
Who? Me?

134
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,666
[CECILE]
Yes.

135
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,916
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,166
Lloyd, you're an earl?!
You never told me that!

137
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,375
[LLOYD laughs]
Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

138
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,000
[CECILE]
The prodigal son of nobles...

139
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,083
He can't really
separate work from play.

140
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,458
Wow...

141
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,666
[LELOUCH] You know, it would
be just for a few days.

142
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,625
If you can keep the
clubhouse off limits,

143
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,958
that would really help out.

144
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,416
[MILLY] Well, it's not
like I can't do it, but...

145
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,708
Say, did someone find
out you're a prince?

146
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,833
[LELOUCH] Hopefully, that
secret's still safe.

147
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,291
Only the Ashford family knows

148
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,250
that I'm still here
and still alive.

149
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,458
[MILLY]
The all-knowing Ashfords...

150
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,958
Is something wrong?

151
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,916
Oh, Lelouch, they've got another
blind date set up for me.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,375
I may not be able to
wriggle out of this one.

153
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,083
What do you think I
should do about it?

154
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,250
Well... That is...

155
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,250
[SHIRLEY]
Madame President!

156
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,708
--[MILLY] Hm?
--[LELOUCH gasps]

157
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,875
[MILLY]
Shirley!

158
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,625
Were you back at
morning practice?

159
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,166
[SHIRLEY] Yeah, it just
started again today.

160
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,541
You can't stay sad forever!

161
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,958
[MILLY chuckles]

162
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,958
I should take lessons from
you on positive thinking!

163
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,458
[SHIRLEY laughs]
What are you talking about?

164
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,416
You're way more...

165
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,625
Huh?

166
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,541
Aren't you're the boy from...

167
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,000
You go to school here, too?

168
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,416
Are you putting me on?

169
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,791
We're in the same classes.

170
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,791
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?!

171
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,750
No! I don't think we are!

172
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,416
Hm... Are we?

173
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,708
Please, that's enough now.

174
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,208
Shirley, we're ready to start!

175
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,375
I'll be right there!

176
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,000
See you later, Prez!

177
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,291
[MILLY]
Mm-hm...

178
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,791
What was that about?

179
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,583
[LELOUCH]
We... had a little fight.

180
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:47,916
So she's playing strangers?
Oh, that is so cute.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,041
Sorry, but could you
play along with us?

182
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,708
Until she gets over it, y'know.

183
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,625
[MILLY chuckles]
I guess I could.

184
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,750
Think it'll take long?

185
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,000
[LELOUCH]
Yes, I'm afraid so.

186
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,416
[PUNK groans]

187
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,791
[C.C.] I'm not looking
for a refrain dealer!

188
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,875
I said, a Chinese guy
named Mao, did you hear me?!

189
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,750
[PUNK]
Believe me, I have no idea.

190
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,291
The only Chinese around here
are pushers or gang labor!

191
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,208
Go ask the cops or something!

192
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,583
[C.C.]
I don't like cops!

193
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,083
[PUNK groans] Then ask
the Black Knights about him!

194
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,458
They're all over
the underground;

195
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,500
they're wired into the
settlement and the ghettos.

196
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,541
Everyone tells me
the same thing!

197
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,125
[PUNK] 
'Cause it's obvious!

198
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,458
[SHIRLEY]
Huh? That's strange!

199
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,875
Where is it?

200
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,333
What's the matter Shirley?
what are you looking for?

201
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:36,125
My diary. It's gone.
I can't find it anywhere.

202
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,333
[SOPHIE]
Huh? Did you take it somewhere?

203
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,291
[SHIRLEY laughs]
'Course not!

204
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,083
[INOUE]
Right. I'm sorry, Zero.

205
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,166
We haven't found
this Mao guy yet.

206
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,541
[LELOUCH]
I see.

207
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,375
Should we check our contacts
in the Kyoto network?

208
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,583
[LELOUCH] No, just stay
with the Kanto block.

209
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,875
If you come up with
any leads, let me know.

210
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,041
Yes, will do.

211
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,125
[LELOUCH]
All right, I'll get back to you.

212
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,333
[LELOUCH] If I get
within 500 meters of Mao,

213
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,125
he can read my mind.

214
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,666
That's what he wants.

215
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,333
But knowing that, I should be
able to guess his next move.

216
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,833
[LELOUCH growls]

217
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,750
I could put him in check,
if I just had one--

218
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,791
[C.C.]
Missing piece?

219
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:19,250
You and I are thinking
exactly the same thing.

220
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,791
So it seems.

221
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,916
Then we should work together
on this, don't you agree?

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,750
--[LELOUCH] I do. Hm?
--[phone rings]

223
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:30,083
[ringing continues]

224
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,250
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

225
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,625
Yes?

226
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,833
[MAO]
It's me, Lulu!

227
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,041
C.C.'s there too, isn't she?

228
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,083
I want to talk to her
alone. Put her on.

229
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,375
[VILETTA groans]

230
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,791
Are you waking up now?

231
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,666
[VILETTA]
Yes...

232
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,958
What were you doing in that
place? Passed out like that?

233
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,291
What's your name?

234
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,666
I, uh... My name is...?

235
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,000
[OHGI gasps]

236
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,750
[VILETTA]
What is my name?

237
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,833
You don't remember?!

238
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,291
What about Zero? You were
talking about him before!

239
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,125
[VILETTA]
Who's Zero?

240
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,625
[OHGI gasps, groans]

241
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,958
What am I doing?! I practically
betray him, and why?!

242
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,000
But I don't know anything...

243
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,000
[gasps]

244
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,375
...nothing at all.

245
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,625
Uh... Sorry.

246
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,166
I was able to undress
you with my eyes closed,

247
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,166
but getting your clothes
back on wasn't so...

248
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,500
But I turned up the heat, so
I thought you'd be all right.

249
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,583
[VILETTA]
Mm. Thank goodness.

250
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,750
[OHGI]
Uh?

251
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,250
Anyone could have
picked me up out there,

252
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,875
but I got someone nice.

253
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,125
[OHGI] Huh?

254
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,666
[VILETTA chuckles]

255
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,833
[phone beeps]

256
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,458
You should be happy
about this, Lelouch.

257
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,208
We're finally going
our separate ways.

258
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,083
[LELOUCH gasps]

259
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,291
[C.C.]
I made up with Mao.

260
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,500
You're betraying me?

261
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,875
Are you actually saying that?

262
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,208
When were you my friend? Never.

263
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,458
We were just
co-conspirators that's all.

264
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,208
[LELOUCH]
Wait!

265
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,125
[C.C.]
Well, here's a surprise.

266
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,166
You sound just like Mao.

267
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,041
[LELOUCH]
C.C...

268
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,375
You know way too
much about me now.

269
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,833
I can't let you walk
away like this.

270
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,250
[LELOUCH]
Don't go!

271
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,083
C.C.! Stay here with me!

272
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,041
[LELOUCH chuckles]

273
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,041
Geass does not work on me.

274
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,208
Didn't I mention that?

275
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,083
[LELOUCH grunts]

276
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,666
[C.C.] Don't worry, I won't
tell anyone about you.

277
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,791
You can keep your Geass, too.

278
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,875
And Mao won't
bother you anymore.

279
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,833
He'll never cross your path...

280
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,375
So all your obstacles are
gone: Congratulations.

281
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,000
And farewell.

282
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,291
The test results came out fine.

283
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,458
Though you seem to pay
extreme attention to

284
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,250
discipline and to weighing
the value of human life.

285
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,291
Is that going to cause problems?

286
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,083
[DOCTOR] These are positive
traits for a soldier.

287
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,458
Do you think subconsciously,

288
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,125
you're comparing
yourself to your father?

289
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,541
[BOTH gasp]

290
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,541
That may be the underlying
cause of your insecurity.

291
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,208
It's quite common in the
children of famous people.

292
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:11,250
Your father. Genbu Kururugi, the
former prime minister of Japan--

293
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,041
He was a great man.

294
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,875
[CHIBA]
Urabe and the others are late.

295
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,458
Well, this sure is an ironic
meeting place, isn't it?

296
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,750
The grave of Prime
Minister Kururugi.

297
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,875
The traitor who told us
to fight to the end,

298
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,958
then committed suicide himself.

299
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,125
Enough.

300
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,333
General Katase also
committed suicide,

301
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,375
and he was a true patriot.

302
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,833
[SCOUT]
Fugitive Tohdoh, identified.

303
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,833
All units, prepare to move in.

304
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,500
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, my lord.

305
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,791
Yes, I've read through
your proposal for

306
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,125
reorganizing the Black Knights.

307
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,541
[LELOUCH]
I've got a few changes,

308
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,000
but overall, I like where
you're going with this.

309
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,375
I'll run it by Ohgi tomorrow.

310
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,250
Thanks, I appreciate that.

311
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,208
[LELOUCH] Next draft, I'd
like you to insert a chart

312
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,958
that forecasts how the
cell-based structure

313
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,291
will be implemented.

314
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,541
That's all.

315
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,416
So that was the final
test; I guess I passed.

316
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,416
[LELOUCH] Diethard...
Though he's Britannian,

317
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,041
he's proving even more
useful than I'd hoped.

318
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:11,166
Still, he could be a spy;
I can't rule that out yet.

319
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,333
Hm?

320
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,375
Right...

321
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,833
It recorded them.

322
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,291
[MAO]
C.C.!

323
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,416
Your mind is so quiet!

324
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,375
It's the only one I can't read!

325
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,958
You really are
the best there is!

326
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,916
As childish as ever, I see.

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
[MAO] I'm a prince
on a white stallion!

328
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,291
And a prince has to
rescue the princess!

329
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,208
[laughs]

330
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,666
Does that make you happy, C.C.?

331
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,166
Mao, we talked
about this before.

332
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,208
I told you that you and I--

333
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,208
[MAO]
Those were all lies... Lies!

334
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,541
C.C., you love me, and
this is how I know...

335
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,000
[C.C.]
Thank you, Mao.

336
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,750
Mao... Mao.

337
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,666
Stop it!

338
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,500
[MAO]
Be quiet!

339
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,166
[C.C.]
Don't listen to them.

340
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,083
Just listen to the
sound of my voice.

341
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,708
That's it...

342
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,666
Since my mind is the
only one you can't read,

343
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,333
and you can only be happy
when you're with me...

344
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:26,083
I will stay with you always.

345
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,041
Yes... I'm right here.

346
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,500
So you don't need to worry.

347
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,708
[MAO]
C.C., you're the only one!

348
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,250
The only one I want, forever!

349
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,083
Lelouch doesn't matter at all.

350
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,333
If you just come with me--

351
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,041
Stop it!

352
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,083
[MAO gasps]

353
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,833
I should have done this
a long, long time ago!

[MAO]
It's me, C.C.

357
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,750
[C.C.]
Mao.

358
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,250
[MAO] I'll be at
Clovisland. Come alone.

359
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,125
[C.C.] Ugh, You're as
selfish as ever, I see.

360
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,625
[MAO]
If you don't come,

361
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,208
I'll just have to tell the
police who Lelouch really is.

362
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,166
I can have him eliminated
any time I want.

363
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,166
You should be happy
about this, Lelouch.

364
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,000
We're finally going
our separate ways.

365
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,458
[LELOUCH] She comes and
goes like the wind.

366
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,708
I can't read her.

367
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,583
I can't fathom how such
a twisted girl thinks.

368
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,125
Idiot!

369
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,458
[C.C. groans]

370
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,125
I knew it! I knew you
couldn't pull the trigger!

371
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,375
That's 'cause you
really love me, C.C.!

372
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,666
[laughs]

373
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,416
You're wrong! I was just using
you right from the start!

374
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,583
[MAO gasps]

375
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,083
What are you saying?

376
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,708
You shouldn't tell lies like
that, you really shouldn't.

377
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:36,916
[C.C. groans]

378
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,875

Lies are very, very wicked!

379
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,833

382
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,291
I understand!

[C.C. groans]

384
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,791
C.C., you must listen to me.

385
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,541
I've built a big, brand
new house in Australia.

386
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:56,083
A very quiet, white,
immaculate special house.

387
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,750
[C.C. groans]

388
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,500
But to get to Australia,
you'll need to take an airplane,

389
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,708
and there isn't very much room.

390
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:03,916
The thing is, C.C.,

391
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,666
you're a little too
big to bring on plane.

392
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,083
[C.C. gasps]

393
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,125
So, that's why...

394
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,541
I'm going to make you compact!

395
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,416
It'll take no time at all!

396
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,000
Is this your revenge?

397
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,291
You're punishing me?

398
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,250
Oh, no. I'm not.

399
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,041
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,
I'm not at all!

400
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm showing you my gratitude!

401
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,666
[LELOUCH]
So this is the place you picked.

402
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,083
A place where there'd be no one
else's thoughts to bother you.

403
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,208
That narrowed it way down.

404
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,000
[MAO]
Lelouch!

405
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,500
[C.C. gasps]

406
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,916
Since your Geass has a total
maximum range of 500 meters,

407
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,250
it can't reach me
here at Tokyo Tower.

408
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,375
[MAO laughs]
That's true, that's very true!

409
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,750
But what can you do
from so far away, hm?

410
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,541
After taking all that trouble
to hack into the system,

411
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,166
what's your grand plan?

412
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,916
A remote control attack with
some battery-operated toys?

413
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,083
Or a tongue lashing to
lecture me into submission?

414
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,791
Aah, cat got your tongue now.

415
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,958
If you want C.C., then
you're gonna have to come--

416
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,750
Mao, think! You don't believe
C.C. is her real name, do you?

417
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,666
She never even
whispers it to anyone.

419
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,166
Huh...?

420
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,125
But I know it, though.
She told me her true name.

421
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,291
Is that right, C.C.?

422
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,666
You never told me, ever, ever!

423
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,541
But you told it to him?!

424
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,041
[LELOUCH]
You know why?

425
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,333
Because C.C. is mine.

426
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,583
C.C. belongs to me,
in every possible way.

427
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,416
No! She doesn't!

428
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,166
She doesn't, she doesn't,
she doesn't!

429
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,166
She was mine long
before she met you!

430
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,041
I have gained every
single thing from her,

431
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,875
including all of the parts
that you have never seen.

look into your mind!

It can't be!

never resorted to cunning.

You predicted every
one of my answers?!

Zero...

489
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,375
[C.C.]
Mao was only 6 years old

490
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,500
when I made my
contract with him.

491
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,666
He was an orphan

492
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,291
who'd never known
the love of a parent.

493
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,625
He couldn't read or write.

494
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,583
And he knew nothing
of good and evil.

495
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,041
This is Echo-3.

496
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,333
I've released the hostage
into the ghetto as ordered.

497
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,250
[RADIO] What? Your orders were
to take her to the hospital!

498
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:33,208
[C.C.] When I gave the Geass
power to Mao, it isolated him.

499
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:37,625
In his mind, I became his
only friend and his lover,

500
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:41,208
though I was still
a perfect stranger.

501
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,541
I'm the only one he even
thought of as human.

502
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,583
I was Mao's entire world.

503
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,833
[LELOUCH]
C.C...

504
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:53,000
Listen to me, I won't
let Geass destroy me.

505
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,208
I will conquer its power
and bend it to my will...

506
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,875
And use it to change the world.

507
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,583
I'll fulfill your
desire and my own.

508
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:06,333
And I will complete the contract
that he couldn't achieve.

509
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,166
So, please...

510
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,250
[C.C.]
Lelouch, tell me.

511
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,375
[LELOUCH gasps]

512
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,208

Are you trying to comfort me?

00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,750
Pity me?

514
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,458
Or is this part
of your obsession?

515
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,125
It's a contract.

00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:23,083
This time, it's from me to you.

517
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:27,291
Very well, then.
I accept your contract.

518
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,791
[LELOUCH] Now is the
time to move forward!

519
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,375
To smash Cornelia
and get the truth!

520
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,000
And to make a place for
Nunnally in this world.

521
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,750
These tiny battlefields
are meaningless now!

522
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,000
We're taking over
the Tokyo Settlement!

523
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,750
We'll expand our military
might and extend our contacts.

524
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,083
I'll use every
piece in the game.
