1
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:18,916
[LELOUCH]
Acting at the request

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,208
of the United Federation of
Nations resolution number one

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,333
for the liberation of Japan,

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,875
the Black Knights
sent a landing force

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,458
into the Britannian Empire
colony known as Area 11.

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,958
Targeting the troops commanded
by Bismarck Waldstein,

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,458
the Knight of One, encamped
on the Kyushu coast,

8
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,083
the main force struck, led by
General Commander Li Xing-ke.

9
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,541
Using this as a diversion,

10
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,208
a separate detachment
of Black Knights

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,250
staged a lethal assault
on the Tokyo settlement...

12
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,166
But Schneizel, Prince of
Britannia, was waiting for them

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,583
with a secret weapon of mass
destruction called F.L.E.I.J.A.

14
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,291
At that moment, to Zero
and the Black Knights,

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,500
the very existence of
this weapon was unknown.

16
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,791
New orders. Black
Knights, Ikaruga fleet.

17
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,291
Gefjun Disturbers have
immobilized all utilities,

18
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,583
communications, and pre-fifth
generation Knightmares

19
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,291
throughout the Tokyo settlement.

20
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,083
The enemy's military might
has been cut in half.

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,291
Hit all major facilities

22
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,541
and eliminate their
ability to strike back.

23
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,625
We must achieve these goals
before the main forces

24
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,000
under Schneizel's
command arrive here.

25
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,875
By establishing
our defense line,

26
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,833
we'll isolate the
Government Bureau.

27
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,833
If we can seize
Viceroy Nunnally,

28
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,791
then victory will be ours!

29
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,291
Viceroy Nunnally. It's Zero!

30
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,916
Zero is leading an assault!

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,583
[NUNALLY gasps]

32
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,500
[NUNNALLY]
Zero.

33
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,833
Zero's on his way?!

34
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,166
[GINO]
Look at that smile.

35
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,916
Now that's more like
the real you, Kallen.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,416
It's too bad. Your wish
won't come true.

37
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,833
Because I and my Tristan
fight for Britannia.

38
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,500
[SCHNEIZEL]
Our first priority

39
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,250
is to eliminate the
Gefjun Disturbers

40
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,750
along the railway's
circular routes.

41
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,250
Can we dispatch
the Lancelot for that?

42
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,541
That'll depend upon the current
state of Sir Kururugi's mindset.

43
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,833
[SCHNEIZEL chuckles]

44
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,125
The battlefield's not the place

45
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,583
for him to work out
his self-esteem issues.

46
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,875
[CECILE] Nina, you don't
know what you're doing!

47
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,041
[NINA]
If we don't act,

48
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,625
Zero will capture
the Tokyo settlement!

49
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,958
[LLOYD]
But you're not a devicer!

50
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,291
You may have
designed the system,

51
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,000
but you have no battle skills!

52
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,083
With the F.C.C., I can at least
defend the Government Bureau!

53
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,583
[SUZAKU] But are you prepared to
actually fire the F.L.E.I.J.A.?

54
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,333
And more importantly, are
you prepared to not fire it?

55
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,583
[ZERO]
Tohdoh.

56
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,750
Have Asahina, and Chiba
establish air supremacy.

57
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,833
[TOHDOH]
Roger!

58
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,500
That should cover everything
except their newer Knightmares,

59
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,583
sixth-generation and above.

60
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,625
Rolo!

61
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,625
How is the infiltration
proceeding?

62
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,166
Sayoko and her group
have gone on ahead of us.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,666
We will rendezvous with them
shortly. It's all arranged.

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,666
[LELOUCH] Good. Be sure
you take Nunnally alive.

65
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,583
[LELOUCH]
So, you've come, Suzaku.

66
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,666
[SUZAKU] I'm the only one
who can make Lelouch,

67
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,000
make Zero, atone
for what he's done.

68
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,041
Listen up, Zero.
Call off your attack!

69
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,916
This unit is equipped with
a high-yield tactical warhead.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,458
If I unleash it,

71
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,625
it will inflict catastrophic
damage beyond all known limits.

72
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:43,416
As if I'd believe anything
that you'd say! Jeremiah!

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,708
Yes, Your Majesty!

74
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,958
[SUZAKU] Lord Jeremiah,
is that you?! Why?!

75
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,291
[JEREMIAH] Suzaku Kururugi,
I owe you a debt.

76
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,583
I sympathize with you.
I respect you.

77
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,375
However, in this situation...

78
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,250
Loyalty trumps all!

79
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,958
[SUZAKU]
The Siegfried's?!

80
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,208
[JEREMIAH] Take this!
The storm of my loyalty!

81
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,083
You picked a bad time for piety.

82
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,291
Now!

83
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,041
[JEREMIAH]
Hmph.

84
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,625
[YUSK] The Sutherland Sieg
seems to be effective.

85
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,833
[RAKSHATA]
Yes, but...

86
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,208
[YUSK]
Huh?

87
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,750
[RAKSHATA] We can never
mass-produce a one-off unit

88
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,500
that uses the
Siegfried's system,

89
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,208
that's understood, right?

90
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,666
What I'd really like to know is
why Jeremiah's on our side now;

91
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,750
he's not just some
knight, you know...

92
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,583
That also goes for
the man once called

93
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,875
"the Spearhead of the Empire."

94
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,291
What's going on?

95
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,958
Why? Why am I fighting against
Royal Britannian forces?

96
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:37,625
[ZERO]
Guilford!

97
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,500
[gasps]

98
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,958
Assist Jeremiah.

99
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,750
Slay Suzaku Kururugi!

100
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,958
[GUILFORD]
But Princess, Kururugi is--!

101
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,833
There's no time to
explain! It's urgent!

102
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,000
You must trust me
and kill Kururugi!

103
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,375
[OFFICE WORKERS yelling]

104
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,208
Lord Jeremiah,
the reason I'm here

105
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,041
is to put an end to this battle!

106
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,958
Are you saying you can do it?

107
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,250
Are you able to dissipate
my lord's torment?

108
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,666
[SUZAKU] But, it shouldn't
involve the people!

109
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,750
Lord Guilford, too?!

110
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,250
Kururugi! We each serve our
royal lords! It's not personal!

111
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,166
[NINA]
Suzaku!

112
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,541
Fire the F.L.E.I.J.A.!

113
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,458
You can kill Zero now!

114
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,375
I'm sorry, Nina.
I won't unleash it.

115
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,166
But--!

116
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,541
I swear. I will stop Zero!

117
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,666
Excellent. Once
Suzaku's finished off,

118
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,916
there'll be nothing left to stop
me from taking back Nunnally.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,958
Uh!

120
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,208
No one can defeat a
Knight of the Round.

121
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,291
No one!

122
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,083
Gino, thank you.

123
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,208
Can't you look a bit happier
when someone saves your life?

124
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,750
Hm? Lord Jeremiah?

125
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,375
So, what they said about
Orange was true, huh?

126
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,916
Orange, you say?

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,791
[chuckles]

128
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,750
That is the name of my loyalty.

129
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,541
[CITIZENS yelling]

130
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,166
This onslaught.
It's all from Schneizel

131
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,208
Did he anticipate my moves?

132
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,541
[LELOUCH]
That's right.

133
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,416
I'll be rendezvousing with you
a little later than I expected.

134
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,916
[ROLO]
Yes, I understand.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
We have just cleared
all interferences

136
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,083
up to the 13th floor.

137
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,375
Don't worry. I promise,
I'll find Nunnally.

138
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,666
[LELOUCH]
Right. I'm counting on you.

139
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,666
[LELOUCH] And once
you bring back Nunnally,

140
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,500
I'll have no further
need for you, Rolo.

141
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,791
[ROLO]
Big brother.

142
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,666
I promised you I'd find
Nunnally and I will.

143
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,458
And when I do, I'll kill
her with my own hands.

144
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,958
I'm the only family you need.

145
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,458
[SAYOKO]
Master Rolo!

146
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:40,000
Emergency report from group two,
moving toward the hangars.

147
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,291
They say that they've
sighted priority item three.

148
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,750
[NUNNALLY] I won't!
I refuse to flee this way!

149
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,333
[LOHMEYER] The Prime Minister
has personally ordered it.

150
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,833
[NUNNALLY]
My brother Schneizel?

151
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,541
[LOHMEYER] The others
cannot leave you behind,

152
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,458
so if you stay,
all must stay and die.

153
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,791
[gasps]

154
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,458
Ha! You're no match
for my Gareth!

155
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,250
Keep dreaming! We've got
full air superiority!

156
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,375
We won't yield!

157
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,791
Oh, no... Tohdoh...

158
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,458
[CHIBA]
I owe you deeply, Asahina.

159
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,875
You've got future plans
in the works, right?

160
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,250
Uh, so what's our next move?

161
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,041
Zero ordered us not to
attack the bureau itself

162
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,875
until Viceroy Nunnally
has been captured alive.

163
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,291
[ASAHINA]
Zero, huh...

164
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,958
[KALLEN] They're all... They're
all fighting, while I'm...!

165
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,208
We'll defend it! No matter what!

166
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,083
Lord Guilford has
lost his sanity,

167
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,333
but so long as we Glaston
Knights still perform

168
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,500
with courage and valor,

169
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,083
we uphold Princess
Cornelia's honor!

170
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,625
[SUZAKU]
Answer me, Zero!

171
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,375
If you started this
battle because of me,

172
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,000
then let me explain...

173
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,083
[ZERO]
Filled with conceit as ever.

174
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,416
You betrayed your
father and all Japan.

175
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,000
'Course you betray your friends,
too. That's who you are.

176
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,875
Uh. What's this?

177
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,250
Anya? Wait!

178
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,625
[GINO]
Suzaku, leave Zero to Anya.

179
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,833
Which one do you
think is stronger?

180
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,083
Your shield or my
Stark Hadron cannon?

181
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,500
[gasps]

182
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,458
Even this shield can't
withstand this for very long.

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,416
Contact lost with the Shinkiro!

184
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,958
[OHGI]
Zero?

185
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,958
Apparently he's engaging in
combat with the Knight of Six!

186
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,458
What're your orders
for Hashimoto?

187
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,583
And we also have
to defend Kujuukuri.

188
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,583
Uh... well, I, uh...

189
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,458
Patch Hashimoto
over here to me.

190
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,458
[OHGI] Sugiyama, do we have any
units we can send to help Zero?!

191
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,833
Uh... just Tamaki.

192
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,333
[LOHMEYER]
Yes,

193
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,666
Viceroy Nunnally is being
put aboard the escape craft.

194
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,166
But until the Gefjun Disturbers
have all been deactivated...

195
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,291
[LOHMEYER]
Right. We can't use a Knightmare

196
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,416
without being targeted
by the enemy.

197
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,458
Yes. Understood.

198
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,083
Who's going to execute
Kallen Kozuki?

199
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,958
[UNDERLING]
Sir George.

200
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,041
But are you sure about this?
Viceroy Nunnally didn't--

201
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,458
It's for her own good,

202
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,375
despite her feeble
attempts to assert herself.

203
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:13,708
[gasps]

204
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,583
[groaning]

205
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,666
Sayoko!

206
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,250
You're looking well.

207
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,250
Master Rolo has gone on
to secure Miss Nunnally.

208
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,333
We came to give you a present,
Miss Kallen. It should fit.

209
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,708
I think Miss Milly's former
fiancé was behind the changes.

210
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,041
There seems to be a draft
instruction manual with it.

211
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,333
[SAYOKO]
Shall we try to get it working?

212
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,875
It's different, somehow...

213
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,083
We can't stretch our
battle lines any further.

214
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,541
We're already at the
breaking point now.

215
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,333
[SOLDIER] All Gefjun
Disturbers in Ikebukuro

216
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,875
and Sugamo have been destroyed.

217
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,250
[KANNON] Now we
can reinforce our lines

218
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,416
with 5th-generation
Knightmares and older.

219
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,958
We're also bringing
the Government Bureau's

220
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,500
defense system back on line.

221
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,291
[SCHNEIZEL] The momentum
has shifted in our favor.

222
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:05,875
[CHIBA]
The lights!

223
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,125
[ASAHINA]
We're out of time!

224
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,166
Kinoshita, haven't you
found the viceroy yet?!

225
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,291
The commanders have freed
Captain Kozuki, but-- Uh!

226
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,500
Kinoshita!

227
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,416
[ASAHINA]
Hey! Are you okay?!

228
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,333
I sent the data...
on Zero... from my system.

229
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,666
That's all I can... do.

230
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,750
[TAMAKI] What the hell?!
I can't find him!

231
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,916
Where's this battle
Zero is fighting?!

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,791
He's my best bud!

233
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,750
Just a little more.

234
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,791
[gasps]

235
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,208
[ANYA]
Again? Something is--!

236
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,666
The Mordred just-- Uh!

237
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,000
[LUCIANO]
Zero.

238
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,416
Face it, your Black Rebellion
is doomed to fail.

239
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,125
They sent another
Knight of the Round?

240
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,791
[LUCIANO]
Here's a question:

241
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,458
What do people
value most? Answer...

242
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,458
Their life of course!

243
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,375
The basic system's the same?

244
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,625
[SAYOKO]
We're still trying to determine

245
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,541
Master Zero's current position.

246
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,416
Shall I transfer
the I.F.F. data?

247
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,041
[KALLEN]
Yes, please.

248
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,041
Let's see... Guren S.E.I.T.E.N.

249
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,958
Eight. It could be.

250
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,333
[KALLEN]
Confirm activation.

251
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,250
[SAYOKO]
Activation, confirmed.

252
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,750
[SAYOKO]
You're good to go.

253
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,916
Once the Guren is launched,
we'll return to our mission.

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,208
[KALLEN] Right. You take care
of the viceroy. I'll help Zero.

255
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,541
[SAYOKO]
Agreed. Well, then...

256
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,625
Guren!

257
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,875
[SAYOKO]
S.E.I.T.E.N. Eight Elements...

258
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:02,750
Launching!

259
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,083
[KALLEN]
Now launch!

260
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,375
[DAVID]
What the--?! Huh?

261
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,458
[KALLEN yells]

262
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,458
Father, I let you
down. Forgive me!

263
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,291
[CLAUDIO]
David!

264
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,250
Was that Kozuki?

265
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,291
But, that unit she's flying...

266
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,541
At this rate...

267
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,750
This shield's the only good
thing about your Knightmare.

268
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,666
Valkyrie squadron, don't
let him go, no matter what!

269
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,791
[VALKYRIES]
Yes, my lord!

270
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,041
[LELOUCH]
I'm in trouble!

271
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,916
I used up too much energy
with the Mordred!

272
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,916
[FUTABA]
Zero. Do you read me, Zero?!

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,500
Where are my reinforcements?!

274
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,083
[FUTABA]
Tamaki will be there soon.

275
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,416
But a picked up a fleet
over the Pacific.

276
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,125
[ZERO]
What about it?

277
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,541
[OHGI]
Zero, it's me!

278
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,250
It seems to be the Britannian
Emperor's flagship.

279
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,125
[ZERO]
What?!

280
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,458
He's coming to Area 11 as well?!

281
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,750
[SCHNEIZEL]
No.

282
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,791
His Majesty is not coming
to the battlefield.

283
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,708
What makes you
so certain of that?

284
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,541
Do you think he cares about
those mundane things?

285
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,208
The day we call "today"?

286
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,833
He doesn't.

287
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,125
[TAMAKI]
Let Zero go!

288
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:21,333
Or you'll have to deal with me,
Shinichiro Tamaki, his best bud!

289
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,291
Dammit! This always
happens to me!

290
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,250
[LELOUCH]
Yes! Now's my chance!

291
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,458
[gasps]

292
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,000
[LUCIANO] Just what
I was waiting for, Zero!

293
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,625
To go into attack mode,
you dropped your shield.

294
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,708
Now, I will take what you
value most and blow it away!

295
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,625
In this position,
I can't--! Nunnally!

296
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,750
[LUCIANO]
Hm?

297
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,916
Huh? They got me?

298
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,125
Kewell!

299
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,000
[KALLEN] Be careful what you
wish for, Vampire of Britannia.

300
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,291
Really?

301
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,916
Is that Kallen?

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,708
[KALLEN]
Zero. I'm here.

303
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,916
You're elite guard,

304
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,333
Kallen Kozoki, is back
on the battle line!

305
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,250
You thieves!
That's mine! All mine!

306
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,166
Not quite. I did some of
the upgrades, remember?

307
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,666
Oh, right.

308
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,291
It's actually a collaboration.
What am I talking about?!

309
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,125
With a capable devicer,
even at 60% output,

310
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,583
that unit can cut the other
Knightmares to ribbons!

311
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,958
[RAKSHATA] That's the
Earl of Pudding's work

312
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,708
and Cecile's energy
wings! How dare they?!

313
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,166
Altering my Guren
without my permission!

314
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,458
Still, now that we've got Kallen
back in the combat zone...

315
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,500
It will even up the battle.

316
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,333
[RADIO GUY 1]
Sir Bradley,

317
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,458
you have permission
to destroy the Guren.

318
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,791
[LUCIANO]
Irrelevant!

319
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,833
Killing is all one should
do on the battlefield!

320
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,958
[LUCIANO]
Ah, ah, ah!

321
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,666
[LUCIANO]
Eleven.

322
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,291
Do you know the prime
truth of the battlefield?

323
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,916
Kill a man off the field,
and you're a criminal.

324
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,125
But kill him on it,
and you're a big hero.

325
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,708
So.

326
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,458
The Vampire of Britannia wants
to be a hero now, is that it?

327
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,000
[LUCIANO]
No, not at all.

328
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,958
War officially allows me to
take what people value most:

329
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,291
their lives.

330
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,833
[KALLEN] Some knight.
You're barely a scoundrel.

331
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,333
[LUCIANO]
And now...

332
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,916
[KALLEN]
And now what?

333
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,291
That's not gonna work.

334
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,208
Ah, but now I've got
you in close range.

335
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,916
[LUCIANO]
What?

336
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,125
[KALLEN] Question: What do
you value the most?

337
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,625
Your own pitiful life?

338
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,666
[LUCIANO] You think an
Eleven can threaten me?!

339
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,541
Send a postcard.

340
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,000
My life! My life is taken...

341
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,708
...by a lowly Eleven?!

342
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,375
[LUCIANO screams]

343
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,083
[ZERO]
Good work, Kallen!

344
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,000
Now get back to the Government
Bureau and get Nunnally!

345
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,875
[SUZAKU]
I won't let you!

346
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,083
[GUILFORD]
Suzaku Kururugi!

347
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,583
[GINO]
Easy now!

348
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,375
[SUZAKU]
Kallen! Stand aside!

349
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,666
[KALLEN]
Forget it, Suzaku!

350
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,333
No! Deflected?!
The Hadron blaster?

351
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,833
[GINO]
Kallen.

352
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,625
So in the end, you chose the
name Kozuki over Stadtfelt.

353
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,833
[KALLEN]
That's right,

354
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,000
which means you and
I do battle once again.

355
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,291
So, should I be happy
or sad about that Gino?

356
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,333
[GINO chuckles]

357
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,416
[GINO]
Why don't we just enjoy it?

358
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,833
[GINO]
Suzaku.

359
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,833
Let me settle things
with Kallen, okay?

360
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,125
[KALLEN]
It won't be easy.

361
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,250
[SUZAKU]
I'm sorry, Gino.

362
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,916
This pilot isn't
the kind of opponent

363
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,791
you can mess around with.

364
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,291
[MINASE] Tohdoh's forces
have broken through

365
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,583
to the enemy's command ship!

366
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,125
[TOHDOH yelling]

367
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,833
Impossible! My Gareth!

368
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,666
Raise all the shields
in Area Four!

369
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,500
[TOHDOH] We're just after
Schneizel's head!

370
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,083
Assume Slash and
Encircle Formation!

371
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,500
Tohdoh.

372
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,750
I'm sending you some testimony
that Kinoshita gathered.

373
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,375
[TOHDOH]
This is hardly the time!

374
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,166
Listen to it and
you'll understand.

375
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,041
We can't trust Commander Zero.

376
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,291
[TOHDOH]
Huh?

377
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,333
[ASAHINA] I'm going into
the government bureau

378
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,250
to capture Rolo.

379
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:16,000
[HINATA] Explosion detected
in section 4-I of the ship!

380
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,666
[OHGI]
Could it be... Chigusa?

381
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,875
I need to bring this
battle into close range.

382
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,958
Suzaku! Kallen's not the one
you need to fight! Hit Zero!

383
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,250
[RADIO GUY 1] Your escape route
is towards the Ikebukuro front.

384
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,541
[RADIO GUY 2] But there
are still Black Knights

385
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,875
in your fight path.

386
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,458
Wait till we've mopped
them up before you launch.

387
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,791
[SAYOKO] Master Zero,
we've found the viceroy!

388
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,416
I see! Excellent work!

389
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,000
[SAYOKO] Master Rolo
will escort us out of here

390
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,541
as soon as he
steals a Knightmare.

391
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,791
He'll have it in a moment.

392
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,708
Understood! Victory is
within our reach.

393
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,083
Kallen! Finish off Suzaku now!

394
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,791
He's the only thing
standing in our way!

395
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:54,583
Right!

396
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,125
Get out of there, Suzaku!

397
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,791
You can't beat that Guren!

398
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,041
[SUZAKU]
But, Zero--!

399
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,000
Ohhh!

400
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,541
Self-centered brat!

401
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,083
It's... It's too great.

402
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,166
The difference in
unit performance.

403
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,916
[KANNON]
At this rate,

404
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,500
we're going to lose Sir Kururugi
as well as Sir Bradley.

405
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,000
Fire it, Suzaku!
Use the F.L.E.I.J.A.!

406
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,583
No, Nina, power
is in the threat.

407
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,541
If we actually use it...

408
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,375
I can't win...

409
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,916
[KALLEN]
Goodbye, Suzaku.

410
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,208
Miss Nunnally!

411
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,583
Kill Suzaku! Do it!

412
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,125
Unleash the F.L.E.I.J.A.!
You can still save yourself!

413
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:47,833
But... if I do that...
Even if it costs me my life...

414
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,458
That's right.
This is redemption...

415
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,541
[SUZAKU]
I have to accept it.

416
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,416
This is where I'm
going to... to...

417
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,208
[LELOUCH]
Live!

418
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,000
I... must... live!

419
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,791
Is this... F.L.E.I.J.A.?

420
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,666
[CLAUDIO]
Fall back! All units, retreat!

421
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,625
[CHIBA]
Why are the Britannians running?

422
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,666
We have to retreat, too!
Asahina, are you reading me?!

423
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,708
Get out of the Government
Bureau! Asahina!

424
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,875
[MINAMI]
Something's wrong!

425
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,166
Pull the Ikaruga back
at maximum speed!

426
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,833
[RADIO GUY 3] You in the
Sutherland, what are you doing?

427
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,875
They've fired the F.L.E.I.J.A.

428
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,416
Fired the F.L.E.I.J.A.?

429
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,833
[LELOUCH] Could that be the
weapon Suzaku was talking about?

430
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,458
Nunnally!

431
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,750
General Tohdoh,
I tried to warn you!

432
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,458
Why did they use
the F.L.E.I.J.A. here?!

433
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:10,458
[GUILFORD] Princess,
save yourself! Princess!

434
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:18,166
Princess, you must
live! Please live!

435
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,541
[ALL yelping]

436
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,791
[LELOUCH]
Rolo...

437
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,375
[ROLO]
Yes, big brother?

438
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,833
[LELOUCH] Could you please
let me speak with Nunnally?

439
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,208
[ROLO]
Um. Well...

440
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,000
I can't reach Sayoko.

441
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,666
[ROLO] Listen. Big brother.
We weren't in time.

442
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,125
Nunnally was caught
in that flash of light.

443
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,708
I'm not asking you about
anything like that now.

444
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,458
I just wanna talk to
Nunnally, that's all.

445
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:01,291
[ROLO]
But... Nunnally is dead!

446
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,750
She's dead, big brother!

447
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,333
Don't lie to me!

448
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,916
[LELOUCH]
Please, Rolo.

449
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,166
Could you, just for a moment...

450
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,916
Please... let me
speak with Nunnally.
