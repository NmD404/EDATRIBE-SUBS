1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,833
[LELOUCH]
The world continues moving on,

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,958
thanks to miracles
which Zero has performed.

3
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,791
The world is being reborn,

4
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:28,083
thanks to actions
which Zero has taken.

5
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,166
Yes... the world is
moving to the next stage,

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,000
as it should.

7
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,958
Against conflicting emotions,
Zero must carry on,

8
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,833
for the hands which mark time
cannot be stopped.

9
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,708
[GUILFORD]
I came alone, as I promised.

10
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,666
Now, what's the meaning
of this, Jeremiah?

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,291
If you have information on
Princess Cornelia's whereabouts,

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,125
then why do you need to
tell it only to me in secret?

13
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,291
[RADIO] The Black Knights are
approaching the Kagoshima coast.

14
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,375
But rest assured,
there's no need to worry.

15
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,000
Under the command
of Lord Waldstein,

16
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,583
the Knight of One,
we Britannians shall--

17
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,250
[COMMANDER 1] This is already
Britannian territory!

18
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,583
Don't let a
single soldier land here!

19
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,916
[XING-KE] The enemy
has fallen for our plan!

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,541
They'll be
shorthanded in the south,

21
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,791
so dispatch our
landing forces ashore!

22
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,375
[COMMANDER 2]
Enemy headed for Yamaguchi!

23
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,083
[COMMANDER 3]
Garcia team wiped out!

24
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,333
[OFFICER 1]
Damn the Black Knights!

25
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,708
How did they amass
this strength?!

26
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,291
[OFFICER 2]
We thought we could hold

27
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,750
our territorial defense line,
but after what Xing-ke did to us

28
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,375
in the Battle
of the East China Sea--

29
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,083
All right, don't panic!

30
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,500
As long as we're
able to defend Area 11,

31
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,916
all the imperial armies
led by Prince Odysseus

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,458
and the other
royal family members

33
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,958
can rush into the
U.F.N. territories.

34
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,291
The remaining Knights
of the Round

35
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,416
are deployed on the
front line, as well.

36
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,875
[KAGUYA]
Or, to put it another way,

37
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,666
if Japan is liberated, the other
colony areas of Britannia

38
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,791
will spring into action
one after another,

39
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,750
which would redefine
the map of the world!

40
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,083
In summation...

41
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,000
...it's the decisive battle.

42
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,666
[LELOUCH] Has it really
been eight years?

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,791
Eight years since Nunnally
and I were left on our own

44
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,458
at the Kururugi shrine.

45
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,791
And there...

46
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,791
[SUZAKU] How do you
like that, you stupid Brit?!

47
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,000
[LELOUCH] That was
where we first met Suzaku.

48
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,375
[SUZAKU] I don't need a reason
to save who I want to save

49
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,541
or do what I want to do!

50
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,583
[LELOUCH]
You always were stubborn.

51
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,708
But of course...
that was the reason.

52
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:15,458
The reason you became the first
and only real friend I ever had.

53
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,250
[LELOUCH]
And that's why...

54
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,125
Why I think I'll take
a chance on you, Suzaku.

55
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,875
If you can accept me,
then perhaps...

56
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,750
[laughing]

57
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,041
This will hardly do for me!
Why such meager offerings?

58
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,125
[PILOT 1]
The Vampire of Britannia!

59
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,541
[PILOT 2] Let's hit him
at the same time!

60
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,541
[PILOT 3]
Right!

61
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,375
[PILOT 4]
Six-Way Charge attack!

62
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,500
[LUCIANO]
Hah!

63
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,708
Wha--What the--?!

64
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,958
[LUCIANO] Question:
"What do people value most?"

65
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,666
Stop it! Please!

66
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,583
[LUCIANO]
That's right! Your own life!

67
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,916
Please, no...!

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,541
[laughing]

69
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,375
Our left wing is crumbling,
Master Xing-ke!

70
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,125
It's one Knightmare
with unique breakthrough power.

71
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,375
Dispatch Indira's
team for support.

72
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,458
Have left-wing
teams fall back at once.

73
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,333
Decoy and isolate enemy unit!

74
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,083
[XIANG-LIN]
Roger!

75
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,333
As far as I'm aware,

76
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,166
Prince Schneizel
ought to be staying in Tokyo.

77
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,458
[SCHNEIZEL]
There's nothing to fear.

78
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,541
The Knight of One,
the strongest in the empire,

79
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,083
is in Kyushu.

80
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,083
If we can just ride this out
and remain anchored in Tokyo,

81
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,375
this will only look like minor
trouble to foreign countries.

82
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,125
[ALL]
Yes, Your Highness!

83
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,458
[SCHNEIZEL]
It'll be all right, Nunna.

84
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,916
I expect this war
will be over soon.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,125
I have a knack for
reading these situations.

86
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,333
[SPEAKER]
The Savage Valkyrie Squadron

87
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,708
repelled the ambush
troops from Nagasaki.

88
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,000
[SPEAKER 2] Now dispatching

89
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,916
[SPEAKER 3] Send Sir Morrey
to the front as back-up.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,291
[SPEAKER 4]
Sir Karim, fall back,

91
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,500
rendezvous with Sir Lasceaux...

92
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,833
It looks as if
the enemy offensive

93
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,916
is losing steam,
and if you join the battle,

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,708
you'll surely finish this
with one blow, Lord Waldstein!

95
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,833
You think so?

96
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:03,958
[MECHANIC]
Huh?

97
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,875
[BISMARCK]
This attack is far too weak

98
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,250
for one of Zero's
trademark strategies.

99
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,500
[ATC]
Prepare to launch.

100
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,583
Special equipment unit one,
provide support.

101
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,291
Galahad, launch!

102
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,000
[SUZAKU]
You came alone?

103
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,583
[LELOUCH]
I promised I would.

104
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,541
[SUZAKU] You have a lot
of nerve coming here.

105
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,500
[LELOUCH] According to
this particular situation,

106
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,375
there are 31 routes I can take.

107
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,291
Especially with
Britannia being so loose

108
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,333
with the routes relating
to the royal family--

109
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,833
[SUZAKU] That's not
what I meant, Lelouch.

110
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,250
Showing your face
in front of me,

111
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,458
that's what took nerves.

112
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,041
Not your own daring.

113
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,708
But you promised?

114
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,791
I have no reason to believe any
of your promises at this point.

115
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,958
[LELOUCH]
Then explain to me.

116
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,791
Why did you come here
alone as well?

117
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,458
After what you did?

118
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,958
[SUZAKU]
You want to know?

119
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,583
I'm fed up with lying.

120
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:58,333
I've had to lie to Nunnally.
Just the way you have.

121
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,666
That's the worst thing.

122
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,208
Some friend you were.

123
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,500
You've been
betraying me all along!

124
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,708
Not just me, either,

125
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,583
but everyone on the
student council, too.

126
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,583
And even Nunnally.

127
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,541
And don't forget Euphy!

128
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,333
[ASAHINA] Are you sure
about this, Tohdoh?

129
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,666
We just wait here?

130
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,791
[TOHDOH] We still haven't
received word from Zero.

131
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,125
[CHIBA] But now that
the Knights of the Round

132
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,333
have joined the battle,

133
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,666
even General Commander
Xing-ke is no match.

134
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,916
Have faith in Zero.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,625
How can we,
after he brought Orange

136
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,125
and that Rolo person
into our ranks

137
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,708
without conferring
with us first?

138
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,916
Don't you feel
that he's keeping

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,625
too many secrets from us?

140
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,916
Like when he took Kinoshita
on that secret mission!

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,416
We need Zero's abilities
now more than ever.

142
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,875
Haven't we already discussed
this many times with Ohgi

143
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,208
as well as the others?

144
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,541
[ASAHINA] So...
what if Japan is liberated?

145
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,666
[CHIBA]
Right. What happens then?

146
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,416
[TOHDOH] Rakshata,
where are Ohgi and Diethard?

147
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,791
[RAKSHATA]
Don't know.

148
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,041
[OHGI] All right, just what
are you trying to achieve

149
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,041
by threatening me, Diethard?

150
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,625
[DIETHARD]
Threaten you? Oh, no.

151
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,625
I'm simply asking you
to continue working

152
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,333
as a member of the
Black Knights as you have been.

153
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,916
[OHGI]
What do you mean by that?

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,875
[DIETHARD] Look, I'm only saying
that I don't want you

155
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,791
to be any trouble
to Zero, that's all.

156
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,333
[OHGI] Why? There are plenty
of people who can replace me.

157
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,791
[DIETHARD] You're valuable
for the simple reason

158
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,000
that you're a man
of ordinary character.

159
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,625
[OHGI]
Hm?

160
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,833
[DIETHARD] Organizations need
more than brilliant leadership

161
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,541
and star players
in order to succeed.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,250
[SUZAKU]
I need to know.

163
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,416
Did you use your Geass
power on Euphy? Be honest.

164
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,750
Yes.

165
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,500
[SUZAKU] You caused her
to massacre the Japanese?

166
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,208
I ordered her to do it.

167
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,708
[SUZAKU] Why would you
use your Geass like that?!

168
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,375
Answer me!

169
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,375
[LELOUCH]
To motivate the Japanese people.

170
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,416
If the Specially
Administrated Zone of Japan

171
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,625
had been established,

172
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,416
the Black Knights
would have collapsed.

173
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,250
[SUZAKU]
And Shirley's death?

174
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,958
[LELOUCH]
Also my fault.

175
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,625
You aren't even human,
you know that?

176
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,791
Shirley and Euphy...

177
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,000
Were both of them nothing more
than pawns for your ambitions?

178
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,166
Yes, that's right.

179
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,291
So all the sin is
mine alone to shoulder.

180
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,708
My little sister
had nothing to do with it!

181
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,833
Why, you coward!

182
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,000
How could you use
Nunnally like that?!

183
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,083
Suzaku... I'm sorry.

184
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,916
And he always
played Santa Claus for me.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,416
Big brother would
dress up like him

186
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,166
and even stuff
pillows under his shirt.

187
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,708
[KALLEN] The face of
the kind older brother

188
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,375
and the mask of Zero...

189
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,250
Which is the real Lelouch?

190
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,041
[GINO]
Huh? He isn't here, either?

191
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,500
[GINO] By any chance,
have you seen Suzaku?

192
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,416
[KALLEN]
No. I doubt he'd come here.

193
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,791
[XING-KE] Send Hong's unit
into the right wing,

194
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,791
and get ready
for the second charge!

195
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,125
You are the commander,
are you not, sir?

196
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,500
Came to crush the head
of the snake, have you?!

197
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,333
[XING-KE]
It's a basic tactic.

198
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:56,958
[BISMARCK]
Hmph.

199
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,416
[BISMARCK]
Behold, Excalibur!

200
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,125
The holy sword
bestowed upon me

201
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,541
by His Majesty himself!

202
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,041
[LELOUCH]
For the first time in my life,

203
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,166
I'm bowing down
to another person.

204
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,583
Shame and honor
mean nothing to me.

205
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:27,208
All I want is this,
and my Geass be damned!

206
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,666
Just please!
You have to save Nunnally!

207
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,916
I beg of you--

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,291
[LELOUCH groans]

209
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,541
After everything you've done,

210
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,291
you really think
this is sufficient?!

211
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,875
You believe that
some bowing and begging

212
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,833
is enough to get me
to forgive you?!

213
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,041
[LELOUCH] No, of course I don't,
but it's all I've got!

214
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,958
I have nothing else
left to offer!

215
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,125
And you're the
only person in the world

216
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,625
who can save my sister now!

217
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,208
So you believe...

218
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,750
...that I'll just ignore
the past and forgive you?

219
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,250
That everyone is
going to forgive you?!

220
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,750
The people you've tricked?

221
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,958
The people who died
thanks to you?

222
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,333
And what about Euphy?!

223
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,041
You want to apologize?!

224
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,041
Then bring Euphy
back to life! Right now!

225
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,875
I want to see you save
the world with all your malice!

226
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,833
[SUZAKU]
Right now!

227
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,750
You're Zero,
the miracle worker, aren't you?!

228
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,541
[LELOUCH]
I've performed no miracles.

229
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,041
It's all been calculation
and stage production.

230
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,000
The mask they call Zero
is a symbol!

231
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,000
Just a device
that lets me tell lies!

232
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,458
[SUZAKU]
A device?

233
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,375
You don't really expect me
to buy that excuse, do you?!

234
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,416
If you're going to tell a lie,

235
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,166
then keep it up
till the very end!

236
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,666
I can't go back to the past!

237
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not a choice!

238
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,208
You know I can't undo
what's already been done!

239
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,958
Lelouch, you will answer me!

240
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,458
[SUZAKU] Why did you
use your Geass on me

241
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,125
to make me want to live?

242
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,500
[SUZAKU]
Why?!

243
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,208
[SUZAKU] The Geass you used
on me that drives me to live

244
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,625
has corrupted my convictions.

245
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,708
Why would you
put such a curse me?!

246
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,458
[LELOUCH] I only did it
because I wanted to survive.

247
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,291
[SUZAKU] And why did you
save me when I was accused

248
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,333
of Prince Clovis' murder?

249
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,125
[LELOUCH] I wanted to make the
Japanese trust me, that's all.

250
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,916
[SUZAKU] Why did you save
the student council members

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,541
from the hotel jacking?!

252
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,916
[LELOUCH]
Because I thought it presented

253
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,875
an ideal opportunity
for the Black Knights' debut.

254
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,625
[SUZAKU]
The look in his eyes...

255
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,333
I know that look.

256
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:24,375
The look of torment that
comes from bottling up a lie.

257
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,000
That's why I joined
the Britannian army.

258
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,708
For redemption.

259
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,208
So that the tragedy
wouldn't repeat itself.

260
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,750
[SUZAKU]
You're lying, aren't you?

261
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,166
Lelouch...

262
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,875
There's only one way to
redeem yourself for those lies.

263
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,875
Turn your falsehoods
into the truth.

264
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:43,833
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

265
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,291
[SUZAKU]
You told the world a lie

266
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,583
when you proclaimed that you
were a knight for justice.

267
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,958
Why don't you
live up to that lie

268
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,416
by trying to become
a true knight for justice?

269
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,375
Then you'll have
to keep the lie going.

270
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,041
To the very end.

271
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,375
But how... how could I do that?

272
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,708
By putting an end to this war.

273
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,458
You are Zero.

274
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,916
This job--only Zero can do it.

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,541
It's within your power.

276
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,916
Bring peace and happiness
to the world.

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,333
If you do that,
I'll save Nunnally.

278
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,291
You will? You'll save her?

279
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,416
[SUZAKU]
But we'll work together.

280
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,625
One more time, for her sake.

281
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,708
I'm grateful.

282
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,250
The two of us together...

283
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,000
We can accomplish anything.

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,500
[SUZAKU]
Wh-What the...?!

285
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,000
[CLAUDIO]
Hold it right there, Zero!

286
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,583
We've already uncovered
your true identity!

287
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,791
[BRIT 1] Are you
all right, Sir Kururugi?!

288
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,000
[BRIT 2]
Please step back!

289
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,083
Suzaku...!

290
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,625
You set me up from the start!

291
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,333
No, wait!

292
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,375
You've done a great
deed here, Sir Kururugi.

293
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,833
Excellent work.

294
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,291
You've managed to
bring this war to an end.

295
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,375
[LELOUCH]
I see...

296
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,000
You planned to
sell me out again!

297
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,375
You betrayed me, Suzaku...

298
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,750
You betrayed me!

299
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,458
[GINO] It's because Suzaku's
been acting so weird lately.

300
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,125
I thought this might help
to take his mind off things

301
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,833
for a while.

302
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,666
[KALLEN] This was in
the student council room?

303
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,750
[GINO]
Yeah.

304
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,833
I found it hidden
deep in a locker,

305
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,500
like it was something valuable.

306
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,250
There are a few photos missing
here and there, though.

307
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,583
Ones of you, too.

308
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,000
But I suppose he
couldn't leave evidence

309
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,666
that shows him palling
around with a terrorist!

310
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,500
Yet everyone appears... well...

311
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,500
[KALLEN]
That's right. He...

312
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,166
[GINO]
He can look like that too, huh?

313
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,416
[KALLEN]
Huh?

314
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,000
[GINO] I've never seen
Suzaku smile like that.

315
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,375
He's so happy.

316
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,791
[KALLEN]
Good for him.

317
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,583
Hey, look.

318
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,500
[KALLEN]
What?

319
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,583
I understand that you're a

320
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,416
Britannian-Eleven
half-breed, right?

321
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,833
[GINO] If you chose the name
Stadtfelt instead of Kouzuki,

322
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,958
you could very well have
a good life, couldn't you?

323
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,666
Even become one of
the Knights of the Round

324
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,291
if you have such ambitions.

325
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,916
[KALLEN]
Is this going somewhere?

326
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,166
What I mean, is wouldn't
you like to come back

327
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,791
over to our side, Kallen?

328
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,625
[PILOT]
Sir Bradley, please stop!

329
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,416
[LUCIANO]
Oh, buck up!

330
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,583
You've taken so many hits,

331
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,708
you're only going
to crash anyway.

332
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,416
So, in light of that,
I, Luciano,

333
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,708
will use your plight
to our advantage!

334
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,833
And settle it in one blow!

335
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,541
[XIANG-LIN] He's using one of
his own ships as a weapon?!

336
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,791
Fall back at
full speed while firing!

337
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,000
[OPERATOR] It's no use!
We'll never make it!

338
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,625
[BISMARCK] Where do you
think you're going?

339
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,541
Ah... You show skill!

340
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,291
[XING-KE]
Good! From this position...!

341
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,916
[BISMARCK]
Nicely done. Good form.

342
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,291
You parried my sword thrust

343
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,708
then swiftly attacked
in the follow-through.

344
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,375
You, the one named Xing-ke.

345
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,208
The rumors of your prowess
are evidently true.

346
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,833
General Commander Xing-ke
appears to be wounded!

347
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,250
[FUTABA]
Da Long Dan, withdrawing!

348
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,625
Chief of staff Zhou Xiang-Lin

349
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,541
now assuming
operational command.

350
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,875
Zero, what's taking so long?!

351
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,416
I can't believe Zero's identity
is that of a student!

352
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,416
[LELOUCH]
Guilford!

353
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,041
[SCHNEIZEL]
How sad.

354
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,083
Zero, killer of royalty.

355
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,333
It's tragic that
it would turn out to be you.

356
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,041
My own younger brother.

357
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,583
Your brother...!

358
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,958
[SCHNEIZEL] However, Lelouch,
I'm willing to intercede

359
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,291
with His Majesty on your behalf.

360
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,875
You realize, of course,

361
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,000
that you can't simply be excused
for the crimes you've committed,

362
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,166
but your life may yet be spared.

363
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,666
[LELOUCH] So you think
you can take pity on me?!

364
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,791
[SUZAKU]
Y-You mean...

365
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,208
[KANON]
Yes.

366
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,500
This was all done under orders
from Prince Schneizel.

367
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,791
[KANON]
He figured that following you

368
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,583
would ultimately
lead us to Zero.

369
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,458
You see, His Highness
was well aware

370
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:32,250
of the fact that you and Zero
shared an unusual relationship.

371
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,500
[SCHNEIZEL]
Lelouch, even now,

372
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,958
I do still consider
myself your brother.

373
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,416
I carry no grudge.

374
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,166
Can you believe me
when I say this?

375
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,708
And why should I?

376
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,041
[SCHNEIZEL]
You should trust your brother.

377
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,875
I would love to
be able to, brother.

378
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,041
Unfortunately, I'm done with
trusting anyone or anything.

379
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,916
Because friendship
only leads to betrayal.

380
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,708
[LELOUCH]
Lord Guilford.

381
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,791
Identify yourself!
You're not Orange!

382
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,083
[LELOUCH] Wait. I just have
a request to ask of you.

383
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,708
Yes, all right, then.

384
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,666
What is it you want
me to do for you?

385
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,875
[LELOUCH]
Oh, it's quite simple, really.

386
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,625
Whenever you see me
assume this pose...

387
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,291
You will recognize
and acknowledge me

388
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,750
as Princess Cornelia.

389
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,875
And then...

390
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,250
P-Princess Cornelia!

391
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,500
Is that you?!

392
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,500
Guilford, my knight, it is I!

393
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,166
You must rescue me!

394
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,250
[GUILFORD]
Yes... Your Highness!

395
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,083
Very good, Guilford.
I'm pleased that you noticed it!

396
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,083
Stop it, Lord Guilford!
What are you doing?!

397
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,291
[GUILFORD]
Have you gone mad?!

398
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,541
How dare you hold
her captive like that?!

399
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,000
Even Lord Guilford
has been affected.

400
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,000
Now I suppose I have no choice
but to believe in this power.

401
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,125
[GUILFORD] Princess,
we need to withdraw for now!

402
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,625
Lelouch, no!

403
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,833
[LELOUCH] I bid you farewell,
my first and last friend.

404
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,875
Lelouch! Come back!

405
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,375
[CECILE]
Lloyd! I can't believe it!

406
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,541
Lord Guilford has
turned into a traitor!

407
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,416
[NINA]
Is it true?!

408
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,625
[NINA]
We're just standing by?

409
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,000
[LLOYD]
Mm-hmm.

410
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,958
Prince Schneizel ordered us to,
so we're complying.

411
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,083
[NINA] I had heard that
Zero made an appearance, but...

412
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,875
[CECILE] We haven't
been told anything yet.

413
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,750
But something critical
was disclosed is my suspicion.

414
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,125
[SUZAKU]
I need to know.

415
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,208
Did you use your
Geass power on Euphy?

416
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,750
Be honest.

417
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,458
Sir Kururugi,
would you happen to know

418
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,833
the reason why Lord Guilford

419
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,166
would suddenly
betray us like this?

420
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,208
As well as why you
behaved the way you did

421
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,416
on Kamine Island that time?

422
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,875
Shouldn't we be pursuing
Zero right now, sir?

423
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,708
There's some
important information we need

424
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,000
before we can pursue him.

425
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,083
Information that only
you know, Sir Kururugi.

426
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,125
[OPERATOR 1]
Wired C response, confirmed.

427
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,500
[OPERATOR 2]
Synchronization, achieved.

428
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,708
[OPERATOR 3]
Ragnarok backup, reinitializing.

429
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,708
Guilford,
we'll proceed on course

430
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,250
to the Tokyo settlement.

431
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,625
[GUILFORD]
Yes, Your Highness.

432
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,333
[SCHNEIZEL]
Suzaku Kururugi!

433
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,541
Who are you? A Japanese?

434
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,041
An honorary Britannian?
A Knight of Seven?

435
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,625
Or are you the son
of a Prime Minister?

436
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,291
The son of Genbu Kururugi?

437
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,250
Lelouch's friend?

438
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,875
Euphemia's knight?

439
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,208
Unless you tell us right now
what we need to know,

440
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,666
there are going to be
more unnecessary casualties

441
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,916
and destruction
before it's over.

442
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,625
Just how long?

443
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,333
How long will you allow this sad
chain of events to continue?

444
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,625
[CAPTAIN]
Don't worry.

445
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,000
The modifications to
the settlement's structure

446
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,500
are complete.

447
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,708
Zero won't be able to collapse
it the way he did before.

448
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,416
[COMMANDER]
We have word. It's Zero.

449
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,250
[CAPTAIN]
So, the fool has come.

450
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,583
[CAPTAIN]
Prepare to attack!

451
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,833
You're cleared to shoot
down the Vincent as well!

452
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,333
[LELOUCH] Don't assume
that I was portraying

453
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,875
the role of a student in the
settlement without reason!

454
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,541
Tokyo settlement, I'll bring
you to a halt right now!

455
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,250
[BRIT CAPTAIN]
Fire!

456
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,375
[BRIT CAPTAIN]
What?!

457
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,208
My... My energy filler!

458
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,750
[BRIT SOLDIER B]
A Gefijun Disturber?!

459
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,166
And so, that situation
will lead us to--Hm?

460
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:12,916
[MILLY gasps]

461
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,041
[MILLY]
Sorry, viewers,

462
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,208
but it seems that
the power's gone out

463
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,583
here in the studio.

464
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,750
Um, are we still broadcasting?

465
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,000
[LELOUCH] All tasks
at hand have been cleared.

466
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,333
Tohdoh!

467
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,708
Acknowledged! Now
commencing Seventh Operation!

468
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,916
Raise the Ikaruga!

469
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,458
[HINATA]
Ikaruga surfacing!

470
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,000
[FUTABA] All fleet units,
surface at will!

471
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,833
Ohgi, right now, you realize--

472
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,291
Yes, I'm aware!

473
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,625
[TOHDOH] The main fleet
will stay on course

474
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,791
through Tokyo Bay,

475
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,375
break through into
the Tokyo settlement,

476
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,833
and rendezvous with Zero!

477
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,791
[MINASE]
All hands, battle stations!

478
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,500
All right, let's do this!

479
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,291
This battle...

480
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,875
...will be ours!

481
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,958
[JEREMIAH]
Now I shall prove my loyalty!

482
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,416
For Prince Lelouch
and Princess Nunnally!

483
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,958
[BISMARCK] What? The Black
Knights are in Tokyo Bay?!

484
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,041
Lord Waldstein,
I request that you dispatch

485
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,333
me and my
Savage Valkyrie Squadron!

486
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,458
You mean to the
Tokyo settlement?

487
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,166
Do you really want to
burnish your record that badly?

488
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,541
[LUCIANO]
No.

489
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,750
I merely take uncommon
pleasure in destroying them.

490
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,791
[LELOUCH] Rolo,
how are things on your end?

491
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:13,875
Fine.

492
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,541
We're beginning
the operation right now.

493
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,708
We'll make our way
to Nunnally first thing.

494
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,000
[LELOUCH]
Good. I'm counting on you, Rolo.

495
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,750
[LELOUCH]
That's right.

496
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,541
I was grossly mistaken.

497
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,250
I was wrong to think that
I could depend on sympathy.

498
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,458
Cold and callous,
that's the prescription.

499
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,083
Unless I keep myself perfectly
in this frame of mind,

500
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,708
I won't be able
to take Nunnally back!

501
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,000
[SCHNEIZEL]
Lelouch...

502
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,625
I thought something
strange had been going on

503
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,375
ever since our brother
Clovis was killed.

504
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,083
But now I understand.

505
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,208
I understand everything.

506
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,250
But now...

507
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,250
I'm the one
controlling the game.

508
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,541
[KANON]
That's right, Suzaku.

509
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,833
If you had only informed Prince
Schneizel from the very start,

510
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,625
we could have
avoided this battle.

511
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,666
Being that you're one
of the Knights of the Round,

512
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,416
you won't be subjected
to disciplinary action.

513
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,166
However, you'll have to answer
to the sins of your own heart.

514
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,000
[SUZAKU]
What should I do?

515
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,375
[KANON]
Be realistic.

516
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,416
The world won't become
a kinder place only for you.

517
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,666
[SUZAKU]
Do I have to pilot it?

518
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,083
The Lancelot armed with
the F.L.E.I.J.A. device?

519
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,875
Will I have to use it...
on Lelouch?

520
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,416
[LELOUCH] How dare you
have done this to me!

521
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,458
You who sneered at me,
trampled me, looked down on me!

522
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,208
I swear to you, I'll win!

523
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,916
I have to win against
Schneizel and Suzaku!

524
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,958
I realize now that
I'm the one you're after.

525
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,083
I'm the target.

526
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,083
Very well! Have at me, then!

527
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,333
Take your best shot!

528
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,875
I'll destroy you!
I'll show you despair!

529
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,250
And to top it off,
I'll steal Nunnally back!

530
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,041
I'll rescue Kallen!

531
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,083
In the end,
I'll have the last laugh!
