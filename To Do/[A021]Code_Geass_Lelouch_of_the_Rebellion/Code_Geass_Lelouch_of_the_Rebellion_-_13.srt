1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,833
[C.C.] The actions
one takes are answered

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:23,416
by consequences waiting
at their conclusion.

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,041
There are no exceptions,

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,791
and even Lelouch's power
cannot change this.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,375
Despite his absolute
ability to make anyone

6
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:36,416
obey him, there is no
escaping the inevitable.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,041
Lelouch has acted to avenge

8
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,458
his mother's death,
and to create a world

9
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,000
where his younger sister,
Nunnally, can find happiness.

10
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,583
Now, he is confronted by
the results of his acts;

11
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,708
consequences he never imagined.

12
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,083
And there are more to come.

13
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,250
If these unintended
consequences help

14
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,166
to create new worlds,
who will bear the blame

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,708
for the sins that are committed?

16
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,500
Who will take the punishment?

17
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,875
And who will measure it out?

18
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,416
[PRIEST]
He was a pious soul,

19
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,583
who always looked
to God in his life.

20
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,958
And a friend to us all.

21
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,000
To his wife, he was
a devoted husband.

22
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,958
To his child, a loving father.

23
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,625
[SHIRLEY]
Father...

24
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,000
May he rest in peace,
forever cradled

25
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,250
in the bosom of our lord.

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,833
[SHIRLEY'S MOM]
No! Stop!

27
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,083
[MOURNERS gasp]

28
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,416
[SHIRLEY'S MOM]
Don't bury him again, please!

29
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,625
He's suffered enough!
Oh god, don't leave me...

30
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,375
Mom, he's gone already.

31
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,041
Please, Mom.

32
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,708
Guess what, Papa!

33
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,916
Some day, when I grow up,
I'm gonna be your wife!

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,291
[SHIRLEY'S DAD] Oh, that's
very sweet of you, honey.

35
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,541
But your teacher
told you, didn't she?

36
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,750
Huh?

37
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,750
[SHIRLEY'S DAD]
Someday, you'll meet the man

38
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,375
you really love.

39
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,041
More than I do you?

40
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,458
[SHIRLEY'S DAD]
Hm... It's hard to explain.

41
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,958
Well, if you truly
love that person,

42
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,833
and he cares for
you just as much...

43
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:56,500
It would make me the
happiest father on earth.

44
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,375
Shirley... I'm so
sorry this happened...

45
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,166
[SHIRLEY] Oh, stop. What've
you to apologize for?

46
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,625
[gasps]

47
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,791
[RIVALZ]
We feel awful!

48
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:05,708
Huh?

49
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,250
It's just that...

50
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,541
When we were all watching
the hotel jacking on TV...

51
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,541
I thought the Black Knights
were, ya know, heroes.

52
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,125
I mean, the news was
handling it all wrong!

53
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,041
Anyway, I was posting online

54
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,708
how I thought what
happened in Narita

55
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,166
was kinda cool and
I'm-- Forgive me!

56
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,916
Come on, don't be silly.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,708
That has absoloutely nothing
to do with this at all.

58
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,583
I mean even I was
saying Narita wa--

59
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,000
Shirley, stop.

60
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,666
Seriously, I'm starting
to worry about you here.

61
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,041
Have you cried yet?

62
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,916
If you simply hold it in,
it's only gonna be

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,250
harder for you later on.

64
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,291
You don't have to worry.

65
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,875
Really, I'm fine.

66
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,833
I've cried a lot...

67
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,791
--[SUZAKU] Cowards!
--Huh?

68
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,333
Zero and his people,

69
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,333
their methods are just cowardly!

70
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,291
He doesn't even get
his hands dirty.

71
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,125
He stirs people into a frenzy,
tips the world into chaos,

72
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,666
and then sits back and
congratulates himself!

73
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,083
It's not going to
change a thing!

74
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,125
Anything gained through
his kind of tactics

75
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,375
is just meaningless!

76
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,833
Huh?

77
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:11,416
Well, anyway, I think it's time
we headed back, everyone.

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,625
Shirley, we'll be
waiting for you.

79
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,625
Back in the old
student council room.

80
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,291
Same as ever.

81
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,208
C'mon, guys, let's go.

82
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,500
Hey, uh, Lelouch...

83
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,458
What? Wha'd I do?

84
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,666
Lulu... Forgive me.

85
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,875
What?

86
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,791
It wasn't fair,
kissing you like that.

87
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,666
It wasn't fair of me at all.

88
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,416
It was just...
something I did...

89
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Forget about it, okay?

90
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:11,000
I shouldn't have put you
on the spot like that.

91
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,583
I'm sorry. It was
totally stupid of me.

92
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:19,541
I mean, you finally kissed me,
and I can't even be happy!

93
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,958
Wait, I--! Shirley!

94
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:41,166
[phone vibrating]

95
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,625
[C.C.]
Do you regret it?

96
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,208
That your friend's father
was caught up in all this?

97
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,416
[gasps]

98
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,208
[C.C.]
You were just accusing Kirihara

99
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,000
of being too soft.

100
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,291
What happened to
the path of blood?

101
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,583
[LELOUCH]
Shut up.

102
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,291
[C.C.] But it turns out
you're the soft one.

103
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,708
Did you think was
all just a game?

104
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,750
You've already killed
your fair share of people.

105
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:07,416
By hand. Or words,
more often than not.

106
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,958
Just shut up.

107
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,166
All of them left
behind a family.

108
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,000
All had lovers and friends.

109
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,458
Are you really telling me
you hadn't grasped that yet?

110
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,500
I would've thought you
to be better prepared.

111
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,958
Just shut up! I am prepared!

112
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,375
I have been from the
moment I killed Clovis!

113
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,250
[C.C.]
Then why this hesitation?

114
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,375
Has she shaken you so badly?

115
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,375
One kiss and you go
to pieces then, huh?

116
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,583
[grunts]

117
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,708
Hm. So, for all your
preening and posturing,

118
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,666
you're really just
a spoiled little boy

119
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,416
with a swollen head
and a big fat mouth.

120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,875
You're in way too deep
to be turning back now.

121
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,000
You've past the
point of no return.

122
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,458
You need a reason
for living, don't you?

123
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,708
You're not going to
disappoint me, are you?

124
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,125
[gasps]

125
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,166
[sputtering]

126
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,875
Yes!

127
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,500
That is why people discriminate
against one another.

128
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,708
So is that the reason why
you killed my brother?!

129
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,083
[SUZAKU] And any ends gained
through contemptible means

130
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,666
aren't worth anything.

131
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,333
[OHGI] Are you really
going through with this?

132
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,875
[KALLEN] That's easy
enough to say, isn't it?!

133
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,708
[CLOVIS] You can't! We may
have different mothers,

134
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,416
but you and I are still blood!

135
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,416
It's nothing but
self-satisfying gratification!

136
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,291
[C.C.]
And to have this utopia you'd...

137
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,750
[LELOUCH grunts]

138
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,500
I wish the world
was a gentler place.

139
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,416
[C.C.] You appear to
have a reason for living

140
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,625
And I've come back
to change everything.

141
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,083
Are you embarking
on the path of blood?

142
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,833
[LELOUCH grunts]

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,458
[LELOUCH]
Ohgi... It's me. Zero.

Protocol established.

00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,000
[LLOYD]
I have some bad news, Suzaku!

150
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,125
We just got word from
Cornelia's Royal Guard!

151
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,375
We're on deck for
the next operation!

152
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,541
Huh?

153
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,500
[LLOYD] Are they
acknowledging your skill,

154
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,125
or do they need another decoy?

155
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,250
[CECILE]
Oh, Lloyd?

156
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,458
Huh?

157
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,541
Care for a lesson in
proper social etiquette?

158
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,500
You look like you have
some time to kill.

159
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,291
I'll have to take
a pass on that.

160
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,500
Now then, I believe we were
talking about your mission...

161
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,666
[OHGI sighs]
W-Wait a second, Zero!

162
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,041
I realize this is a
request from Kyoto.

163
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,500
I think we could
definitely handle it.

164
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,916
And, I'm pretty sure the
Japan Liberation Front

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,708
would rather join
with us than flee

166
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,083
to foreign soil and all, but--

167
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,291
[ZERO]
You're the one who brought us

168
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,125
this information...
Diethard, wasn't it?

169
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,458
That's right.

170
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,500
It is an honor that you'd
meet me like this, Zero.

171
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,458
[ZERO] So, Princess
Cornelia is going to deploy

172
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,583
the royal marines on Gen. Katase

173
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,000
of the Japan Liberation
Front. Is that correct?

174
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,041
[DIETHARD] Yes, the Network
is already poised

175
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,083
to broadcast a
special report on it.

176
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,041
[ZERO] Lt. Col. Toudou
will never make it

177
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,291
to Katase in time. Which means

178
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,958
the Japan Liberation
Front has no

179
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,958
military strength right now.

180
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,750
Their only chance of escape
is the liquid Sakuradite

181
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,958
they're carrying.

182
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,708
Which is why we should
help General Katase

183
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,083
escape instead of
going after Cornelia!

184
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,791
[ZERO]
Ohgi! Who are we?

185
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,000
W-We're the Black
Knights, Zero...

186
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,000
[ZERO]
Then we have but one task!

187
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,833
We will destroy Cornelia's
troops, and in doing so,

188
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,208
rescue the remnants of the JLF.

189
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,458
Tonight, we regain what
was lost to us at Narita!

190
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,875
[OHGI]
What're our chances?

191
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,000
[ZERO]
Need you ask?

192
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,416
Understood.

193
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,791
[DIETHARD]
Hm.

194
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,625
[ZERO]
Begin preparations.

195
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,250
You all have your
orders to carry out.

196
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,750
[KALLEN]
Uh--! Zero!

197
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,708
[ZERO]
I have something to attend to.

198
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,333
Whatever it is,
save it for later.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,291
[DALTON]
Just so you know...

200
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,708
The viceroy has her reservations
about using Numbers.

201
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,416
But use every able
body, I always say.

202
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,166
Even if it's the son of
the former prime minister.

203
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,166
[SUZAKU grunts]

204
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,208
Our target is Katase.

205
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,333
Take him out and

206
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,541
the Japan Liberation
Front is finished.

207
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,916
We're sending in
the Royal Marines.

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,916
Your job'll be to
provide supporting fire

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,666
from the shore until the
marines have Katase...

210
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,750
...as well as annihilating
any stragglers left over.

211
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,875
[gasps] I'm to
annihilate them, sir?

212
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,875
Nobody but the
target is to survive,

213
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:45,791
is that clear?

214
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,708
[gasps]

215
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,416
[DALTON]
Warrant Officer Kururugi,

216
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,250
show your loyalty to the crown.

217
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:55,083
This your chance to get
ahead in the world, soldier.

218
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,916
Understood... my lord.

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,041
Onward, Christian soldiers.
Conflicting morals, right?

220
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,041
[SUZAKU grunts]

221
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,333
[SHIRLEY]
No, Lulu...

222
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,083
It can't be true...

223
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,166
He would never get tangled up
with someone like that...

224
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,500
[VILETTA] There is a
possibility that this boy

225
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,708
is linked to
the Black Knights.

226
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,291
What're you saying--
he's involved?

227
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,333
In terrorism.

228
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,458
I don't belive you!

229
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,666
He can't be...
It has to be a lie.

230
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,333
[SHIRLEY]
Lulu...

231
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,791
I'm so sorry to be doubting
you like this... But...

232
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,541
[SHIRLEY]
Please, I wanna believe in you!

233
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,375
[VILETTA]
Dammit, she lost him.

234
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,916
If she had just called me
sooner, I could've had him!

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,583
I should've grabbed him
when I had the chance.

236
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,625
No, I need proof.

237
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,958
If he talks to her, I can learn
what his role is in all this.

238
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,333
Which is all the more important

239
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,875
if he can manipulate
memory somehow.

240
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,166
[VILETTA]
I won't have to die,

241
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,125
stripped of my position
and honor, like Jeremiah.

242
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,958
Hell, this is my chance
to move back up again.

243
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,416
So, I have to find
a link to Zero...

244
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,458
It has to be me!

245
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,541
[door clangs]

246
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,875
[LELOUCH gasps]
Who's there?!

247
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,166
Ah! I-I'm sorry! I'll go...

248
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,541
[LELOUCH]
Second thoughts?

249
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,958
[gasps]

250
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,208
I thought the goal was justice.

251
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,875
The only reason I've
fought until now

252
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,958
is because I thought it
was the right thing to do.

253
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,666
So I could live with
the killing. But now...

254
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,458
Tell me is this real?!

255
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,000
Is what we're all
doing here really

256
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,125
going to change the
world for the better?!

257
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,500
[LELOUCH]
Yes, it will.

258
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,416
Or rather, it must
change the world.

259
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
[KALLEN]
But...!

260
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,958
[LELOUCH]
Will there be sacrifices?

261
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,000
Not only just soldiers,
but the innocent as well.

262
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,291
[gasps]

263
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,125
[LELOUCH] And yet, because
of all these things,

264
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,791
we've no choice but
to continue on...

265
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,583
...no matter the cost.

266
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,958
Even if people see
us as cowards...

267
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,041
We have to prevail!

268
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,916
If that means more
blood will be shed,

269
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,916
so be it. We've spilled
so much to get here,

270
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,416
we can't let it be in vain...

271
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,750
But I won't force you, Kallen.

272
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,666
If you wish to turn back,
now is the time.

273
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,833
[gasps]

274
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:47,458
I've made my choice. I'll
follow you to the very end.

275
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,208
I'm grateful, Kallen.

276
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,791
[gasps]

277
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,041
[LELOUCH]
Yes. You saved me today.

278
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,375
Thank you.

279
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,875
C.C., I need you. I do.

280
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,208
What am I doing?

281
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,625
I just can't afford to
make the same mistake here

282
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,333
all over again here.

283
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,750
[DALTON]
It's time.

284
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,416
Commence with the operation!

285
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,291
[MARINE A] All underwater
units, hit the water!

286
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,333
Dive, dive, dive!

287
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,625
[MARINE B]
Supression Team, you are cleared

288
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,833
for cartegory C weaponry.

289
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:30,916
[MARINE OFFICER]
Our unit'll be covering them

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,791
from the shore. Careful though,

291
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,375
we want that tanker
in one piece.

292
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,833
Understood, my lord.

293
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,916
[MARINE D] Once torpedo
attack is confirmed,

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
all units go to weapons free.
Repeat. Weapons free.

295
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,875
Oh my god! Terrorists?!

296
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,583
It looks like it's starting.

297
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,416
Zero...

298
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,125
You wanna move out or what?

299
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,666
Hey! Do you read me?

300
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,958
They're closing in
on the JLF! Come in!

301
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,958
[ZERO]
We have to hold.

302
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,208
Huh?

303
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,875
[ZERO] Cornelia moved
faster than expected.

304
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,708
If we go now, we'll
die along with them.

305
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,083
[MARINE OFFICER]
Commence support fire.

306
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,500
All units restricted to
micro round ordinance only.

307
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,416
Be careful not to set off
that liquid Sakuradite!

308
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,041
[ITAGAKI]
Damn those Britannians!

309
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,791
When the hell did
they get here?!

310
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,333
Enemy units! They're
coming from the water!

311
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,500
Itagaki!

312
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,916
[MARINE A]
Two-oh-two! Five-oh-three!

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,791
Focus fire at nine o'clock!

314
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,416
This isn't battle. This is
wholesale slaughter!

315
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,541
[CECILE]
Officer Kururugi.

316
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,791
Go ahead.

317
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,291
I certainly know this
must be hard for you,

318
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,500
but you're a soldier,
remember that.

319
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,000
[SUZAKU]
Right. I understand.

320
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,958
How could they have
found us?! Where's Tohdoh?!

321
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,083
[JLF SOLDIER D]
We can't locate him!

322
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,500
Or the Holy Swords!

323
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,000
[KATASE]
What about Kyoto?!

324
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,541
They said they would send help!

325
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,125
[JLF SOLDIER D]
Yes, sir, but we have no way

326
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,708
of contacting them now!

327
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,916
So they're just gonna sit back
and watch us die here?!

328
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,833
[JLF SOLDIER E] We surrender!
Please, cease fire!

329
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,458
This is the
Japan Liberation Front!

330
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,416
I reapeat! We surrender!

331
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,208
Sir, they're issuing a surrender
over an open channel!

332
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:11,916
[MARINE OFFICER]
Ignore it.

333
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,208
Yes, but, sir!

334
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,208
[MARINE OFFICER]
You see?

335
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,125
They were just buying time.
Now, carry out your orders.

336
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,458
Lulu just couldn't be a member
of the Black Knights, could he?

337
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,333
[OHGI] Ugh! Dammit!
It'll be too late soon!

338
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,000
When does Zero plan to move?!

339
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,791
I just hope that he
isn't just doing all this

340
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,375
to honor some childish
notion of justice.

341
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,875
[SOLDIERS gasp]

342
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,166
[OHGI] The Knightmares
are boarding the ship!

343
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,333
[ZERO]
I see.

344
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,000
That leaves only one way out.

345
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,750
They have to be careful around
that precious Sakuradite.

346
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,583
[OHGI]
Zero! If we don't hurry...

347
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,041
Very well then. Go ahead...

348
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,541
What the hell is going on?!

349
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,541
[CORNELIA]
I can't believe this idiocy!

350
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,375
They blew up the
liquid Sakuradite?!

351
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,750
[ZERO] Just what you'd
expect of the JLF.

352
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,583
Choosing to take the
Britanians out with them!

353
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,875
Suicide? But they
never mentioned--!

354
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,791
[ZERO] We're going to
rush Cornelia's position

355
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,875
head on!

356
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,750
Forget about everything else!

357
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,166
All that matters is
achieving our goal!

358
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,125
If you want to avenge the JLF,
then capture Cornelia

359
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,250
and show them our
strength and determination!

360
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,458
Right...!

361
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,625
[OHGI] This is like
Narita all over again!

362
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,000
[DIETHARD]
It's outstanding!

363
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,416
[OHGI]
Hey! Get back here!

364
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,125
[DIETHARD]
The JLF was just bait!

365
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,000
Their command is wide open now.

366
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,083
Heh. One of the oldest
tricks in the book...

367
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,208
Where're you going?! Hey!

368
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,416
[DIETHARD]
It makes perfect sense!

369
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,416
He wanted to cripple
his enemy's defenses,

370
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,416
using the Liberation Front
as a living trap!

371
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,666
He's excellent
material, this Zero.

372
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,250
He's chaos incarnate! More...
Show me more of your genius!

373
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,666
Let your ego engulf the world!

374
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,166
[laughing]

375
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,166
[MARINE A]
E-Enemy attack?!

376
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,125
[MARINE B]
Two-zero-four, signal lost!

377
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,000
Erickson, form up
with three-zero-eight!

378
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,125
Provide support!

379
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,041
[MARINE C]
All units, status report!

380
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,291
I repeat, what is your status?!

381
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,125
Why would the
general kill himself?

382
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,666
It doesn't make any sense...

383
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,583
[SUZAKU gasps]
The main force...!

384
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,583
Could they have used
the tanker as a decoy?!

385
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,625
[DALTON] Mount up now and
form a defensive line,

386
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,708
on the double!

387
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,083
How did they know we were here?!

388
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,250
Your Highness!

389
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,458
[ZERO] Knock their
Knightmares into the sea

390
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,375
before the pilots can mount!

391
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,916
Guren Mark-Two, you're with me!

392
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,250
Yes, sir!

393
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,375
[GUILFORD] Your Highness!
We can handle this!

394
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,625
Quiet!

395
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,791
How many times do you
think I'll allow them

396
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,166
to mock me?!

397
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,375
I haven't even powered on!

398
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,833
Do you think you can best
me in Knightmare combat?!

399
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,166
[CORNELIA]
That new model again?!

400
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,916
[ZERO] I'll smash your
hatch and drag you out...

401
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,375
Cornelia!

402
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,791
[ZERO grunts]

403
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,958
[LELOUCH gasps]
Shirley?!

404
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,833
Zero!

405
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,958
Your methods are not
going to change anything!

406
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,666
You're focused on goals,

407
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,166
and don't understand
the pain of others!

408
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,250
Zero!

409
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,666
[CORNELIA]
This is payback for Narita!

410
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,041
[ZERO] Well, if it isn't
the knight in shining armor!

411
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,458
These are people's lives
you're playing with!

412
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,125
You're nothing but a murderer!

413
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,458
[ZERO grunts]

414
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,375
[LELOUCH]
Why?!

415
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,000
Why do you keep
getting in my way?!

416
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,875
Why do you keep
spilling people's blood

417
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:11,958
without meaning?!

418
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,875
[LELOUCH]
If it wasn't for you...!

419
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,916
Because of you...!

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,666
[ZERO groaning]

421
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,291
Zero... This is the end result.

422
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,125
[CORNELIA]
Lancelot, behind you!

423
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,250
[gasps]

424
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,250
Get the hell away from him!

425
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,083
[gasps]

426
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:13,083
[SHIRLEY]
Is this Zero's? So...

427
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,041
...then, with this...

428
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,833
I'll repay you... for my father!

429
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,041
[ZERO grunts]

430
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,625
[gasps]

431
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,041
[LELOUCH] The best laid
plans often fall apart.

432
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,833
Doubts can arise at any time.

433
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,500
My heart grows heavier,
little by little...

434
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,833
Is this the foundation
for the future?

435
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,833
Or merely stumbling
blocks from the past?

436
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,000
The answers that I seek...

437
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,625
...lie within me.
