1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,875
[C.C.] Three great
powers control the world.

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,958
Two of them, the Holy
Britannian Empire

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,750
and the Chinese Federation

4
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,791
are trying to become one
through a political marriage.

5
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,125
This would be the
ultimate threat

6
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,458
to the United States of Japan.

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,916
That is why Zero has
acted by kidnapping

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,208
the Chinese Federation's
young empress,

9
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,083
the symbol of her nation.

10
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,500
Can dreams cut a
path through destiny?

11
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,916
Can passion triumph over fate?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,916
Or are such things ephemeral,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,208
like flower petals
fluttering in the breeze.

14
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,625
[GUESTS screaming]

15
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,458
[CHINA COMM] Lady Xiang-Lin,
the guests are fleeing

16
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,083
the reception hall
just as we predicted,

17
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,500
but we have reports that
Zero has shown up as well.

18
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,750
Zero! Section 3,

19
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,416
report your break-in status.

20
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,250
Master Xing-ke needs
back up at once.

21
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,500
[XIANG-LIN]
Could it be?

22
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,875
Is Zero using our plan
for his own purposes?

23
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,250
Xing-ke!

24
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,458
[grunts]

25
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,000
Zero! Will you release
Her Majesty or not?!

26
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,458
[ZERO] Xing-ke, do you
think you're able to free

27
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,583
the empress alone?
You're mistaken.

28
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,666
[ALL grunting]

29
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,833
[XING-KE] You even had a
Knightmare prepared for this?

30
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,541
[TOHDOH] Hmph. I never thought
the Zangetsu's first mission

31
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,625
would be to steal a
bride from a wedding.

32
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,250
[ZERO]
Tohdoh! Get Schneizel!

33
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,291
Right.

34
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,041
I'm on it.

35
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,625
He's already here.

36
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,208
Hands off the prince!

37
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,583
[TOHDOH]
Suzaku.

38
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,791
[SUZAKU]
It can't be! Master Tohdoh?!

39
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,458
Flee while you can,
Your Highness!

40
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,791
I guess it can't
be helped, brother?

41
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes, I think we should.

42
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,291
[LELOUCH gasps]
Schneizel!

43
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,333
We should go too;
leave it to the soldiers.

44
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,541
Yes.

45
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,208
[CHIBA] Zero! The operation's
on schedule.

46
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,541
[ZERO]
Good! Enter phase three!

47
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,375
We're on our way.

48
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,208
[BOTH panting]

49
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,666
Xing-ke!

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,916
Dammit!

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,125
[GUARDS yell]

52
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,250
[KALLEN, KAGUYA panting]

53
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,333
Yes! Now!

54
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,541
The same system
as the Guren?

55
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,375
So, it does work.

56
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,625
With this Zangetsu,

57
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,833
I can take on a class
one warrior like Suzaku.

58
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,208
[SUZAKU]
So be it. I'll blow you aw--

59
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,375
[TOHDOH]
Think!

60
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,500
[TOHDOH] Will you shoot
at me in this position?

61
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,250
[gasps]

62
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,625
The Forbidden City!

64
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,875

[gasps]

66
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,458
[TOHDOH] Suzaku Kururugi,
taste defeat!

67
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,458
Kyoshiro Tohdoh! Not yet!

68
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,458
[TOHDOH]
Shadow Longsword!

69
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,416
He got my float unit!

70
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,541
[grunts] You can still
launch a direct attack?

71
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,458
[ZERO]
Tohdoh! Return to your unit.

72
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,375
You destroyed the
Lancelot's float unit,

73
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,250
so he can't pursue us.
That's enough for now.

74
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,208
We need you here.

75
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,708
[TOHDOH]
Understood.

76
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,583
Your Majesty, you'll soon be
outside the Forbidden City.

77
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,125
Huh?

78
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,791
[XING-KE grunts] Deploy the
Dragon Cavalry to pursue them.

79
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,541
[ZHAO HAO]
That is now our task;

80
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,125
you are relieved of duty!

[huffs]

82
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,500
[XIA WANG] Are they trying
to escape through a gap

83
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,916
in our radar
surveillance network?

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,208
Absurd. How could
they know that?

85
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,666
It's barely ten days
since they arived here,

86
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,208
there's no way for
them to find that out.

87
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,250
General Tohdoh,
we'll begin resupplying

88
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,875
Knightmares from
Chiba's Akatsuki.

89
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,750
[TOHDOH] Good.
Then resupply the Zangetsu

90
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,208
and Guren after we
return to the Ikaruga.

91
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,500
Okay, take the next left turn.

92
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,625
Is that correct?

93
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,583
[TAMAKI]
Whops, my mistake!

94
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,208

Are you all right,

00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,833
Are we outside

98
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,333
Yes.

I'm sorry, I didn't expect
that your dream would come true

100
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,458
in such a violent
way like this, but...

101
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,208
[gasps] You remembered
about my dream, too!

102
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,625
You both did!

know when to quit!

Now, take the next right.

106
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,458
No, we go straight here.

107
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,750
What? You know how to get there?

Long ago, there's something I...

[ZERO] Our nation, the United
States of Japan, should be

has already promised support.

116
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,625
Mongolia and Burma will
probably move with them.

[ZERO]
This Union of United States

118
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,083
will form an axis
to oppose Britannia.

119
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,875
But, our nation's already
a federated system...

120
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,833
[ZERO]
All systems are limited!

121
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,208
That's why the high eunuchs
sold you to Britannia,

00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:20,750
for their own ambition!
That is unforgivable!

understand this but...

Well, I-I told him I wanted
to go outside six years ago.

It was that long ago?
He must be destined for you!

That's great!

Are you sure you want
to leave her to Kaguya?

136
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,125

have you come up with some
kind of position for me, yet?

I'm wide open, man.

Maybe you can post me as finance
minister or head of banking.

How 'bout Grand
Minister of Partying.

Come on, we're old
buddies, right?

No, wait! The empress!

[ASAHINA] Okay, let's try
out these new weapons.

165
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,333
[ZHAO HAO]
How did you know that?

166
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,833
[XING-KE]
If I were in their place.

167
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,833
I'd hang back and stage an
ambush at the Shen Chun ravine.

168
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,333
[CHENG ZHONG]
And then?

169
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,916
[XING-KE] Then I'd join up
with my main force in Shao Pei.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,166
Hmm.

if you can bring
back our empress.

00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,250
[SCHNEIZEL] He seems to
have calmed down at last.

177
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,500
He's resting.

178
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,250
[SUZAKU] Then once we've
replaced my float unit,

179
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,666
I can go after the empress.

180
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,750
No, we can't go there
unless requested

181
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,291
by the Chinese Federation.

182
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,708
I understand, but we're
missing our chance.

183
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,583
[ZERO] That went more
smoothly than I'd hoped.

184
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,875
Perhaps I should thank Xing-ke

185
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,250
for setting his
own plan in motion.

186
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,750
He's a talented strategist.

187
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,625
So, how did you find
out he was planning

188
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,625
a coup d'etat at the ceremony?

189
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,125
[KALLEN]
Hm?

190
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,750
[ZERO]
I was working on the same thing.

191
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,166
[C.C.] Including the
E.C.M. and the ambush?

192
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,291
[ZERO] Yes. While we
were setting our traps,

193
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,666
we found some of Xing-ke's
men setting theirs,

194
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,125
on the same escape route.

195
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,041
I see. Then you got them
to tell you their plan.

196
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,541
Did you have to
use a truth serum?

197
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,583
[ZERO]
Yes. It's called "Geass."

198
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,625
[C.C. sighs]

199
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,750
[ZERO] Is there news
from Horai Island?

200
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,125
[DIETHARD]
Reinforcements from India

201
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,125
have already arrived there.

202
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,375
[OHGI] We just have to return
and rendezvous with them.

203
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,500
How are things with the empress?

204
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,708
[CREW gasps]

205
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,958
An attack?!

206
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,333
Our forward Knightmare
unit is being wiped out!

207
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,625
Stop! All units, come to a halt!

208
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,666
[LELOUCH] Strange. We should
have had at least an hour

209
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,125
before we encountered
enemy forces.

210
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,958
Unless someone is guessing
our moves in advance.

211
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,750
[gasps]
A Knightmare?

212
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,416
Zoom in! Hurry!

213
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,833
[RAKSHATA]
Hm?

214
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,041
[gasps]

215
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,958
[LELOUCH]
What is it?

216
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,791
Why's it equipped with the
same flight system we use?

217
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,583
[CREW gasps]

218
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,625
[KALLEN gasps]

219
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,750
[XING-KE]
Knightmare Frame Shen Hu.

220
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,541
And it's only running at
forty percent of full output.

221
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,208
How could the high
eunuchs have built it?!

222
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,208
[PILOT -A]
Flight Enabled or not,

223
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,416
it's only one unit! Surround it!

224
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,916
No, hold on!

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,500
[XING-KE] You underestimate
the Shen Hu at your peril.

226
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,125
[PILOT A grunts]
I'm caught!

227
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,291
[PILOT B grunting]

228
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,333
[XING-KE yells]

229
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,833
[CHIBA]
How dare you!

230
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,125
Hmph.

231
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,625
[XING-KE] Silence!
You people have no say here!

232
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,625
[CHIBA grunts]

233
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,083
[XING-KE]
Can you hear me, Zero?

234
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,166
[ZERO]
It can't be! Xing-ke?!

235
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,625
Zero! You shall not pass!

236
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,750
That's exactly why I'm calling:

237
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,958
I want to know why
we've stopped here.

238
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,791
[gasps]
Oh, I see.

239
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,625
Yes it's completely
soundproof in here. But...

240
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,875
[XING-KE]
Now, return the empress!

241
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,166
Do it and I spare your lives.

242
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,708
[KALLEN]
Xing-ke!

243
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,125
[XING-KE]
A flight-enabled Guren!

244
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:57,958
Kallen Kozuki!

245
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,250
[KALLEN growls]

246
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,250
[XING-KE] Even so,
the Shen Hu will crush you!

247
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,708
[TOHDOH]
Can we deploy the Zangetsu?

248
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,458
Well, we just detached
the float unit, so, uh...

249
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,375
[grunts]

250
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,625
[TAMAKI yells]
Get him, Kallen!

251
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,750
But... It isn't recharged.

252
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,333
Relax, buddy!
She fought off

253
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:16,458
the Knights of the Round before
with the guren just like this!

254
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,083
[KALLEN]
Scatter shot!

255
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,916
Not bad.

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,166
But I'm... a Black Knight Ace!

257
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,958
Show me, Shen Hu!
Show me your power!

258
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,250
Oh, no! That's...!

259
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,583
[ZERO]
You know what it is?

260
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,250
Well, you see...

261
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,500
He knows because
our team built it.

262
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,041
What are you saying?

263
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,791
[RAKSHATA] We developed it at
the same time as the Guren,

264
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,125
but it was too
high-spec to handle.

265
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,291
A one-of-a-kind Knightmare

266
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,583
that no pilot
could master. Until now.

267
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,458
[grunts]

268
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,750
[KALLEN]
Eat this!

269
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,375
[XING-KE]
Try this!

270
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,250
[EMPRESS gasps]

271
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,125
It's all right! We're going
to be all right!

272
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,958
The Heavenly
Particle Shocking Cannon.

273
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,541
It's just as powerful...

274
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,875
As powerful as the
radiant wave surger!

275
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,333
[ZERO] But how did our
enemies obtain it?

276
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,208
The Solidarity of Indian forces
might be split against us.

277
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,750
That old man, Maharaja!

278
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,375
[OHGI]
Does it have a weakness?

279
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,291
[RAKSHATA] It's based on
a different design concept

280
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,416
than the Guren.

281
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,166
There's no radiant wave system.

282
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,541
And piloting it takes skills
that are almost beyond human.

283
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,958
[OHGI] Well there's a human
piloting it now, isn't there!

284
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,208
[RAKSHATA]
Quite so.

285
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,000
[XING-KE] I have you!
Your fate is sealed!

286
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,333
That's right,
and so is yours.

287
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,791
What?!

288
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,875
[KALLEN] You can't get
away from me now.

289
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,708
And this is when
I take you apart!

290
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,041
[XING-KE] Really?
Then I have no choice.

291
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,416
I'm going to
have to crush you.

292
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,208
[KALLEN]
Let's see you try!

293
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,416
My power supply!

294
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,666
Kallen!

295
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,166
I said that she should
of recharged first!

296
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,958
[ASAHINA] The cockpit
block's wrapped up!

297
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,500
She can't eject!

298
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,291
We can cut the cables
with a pincer move!

299
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,000
Roger!

00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,875

301
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,750
[XING-KE] I didn't choose
this course, you did.

302
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,666
I have only one objective...

303
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,625
To release the empress!
Release her at once!

304
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,333
[coughs] Dammit!

305
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,000
[XING-KE]
Now of all times?!

306
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,208
Can I fight like this? Huh?

307
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,583
[CHIBA]
What?!

308
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,291
[HINATA] Chinese Federation
behind us! A huge force!

309
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,750
Anti-aircraft barrage!
Cover Master Xing-ke!

310
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,208
[XING-KE]
Thank you Xiang-Lin!

311
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,083

K-Kallen, no!

00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,666
The Chinese Federation?

315
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,875
[LELOUCH] She's their
prisoner?! Impossible!

316
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,916

radio working?!

317
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,833
[KALLEN]
S-Sorry I failed you.

318
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:45,958

Forget about that!

I promise, I'll save you!
Am I clear?! No hasty moves!

323
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,958
Uh, right!

324
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,500
I understand. I won't give up!
I'll do what you--

[gasps]

327
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,791
Hurry, bring the Ikaruga
around immediately!

328
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,000
I respectfully
suggest we withdraw.

329
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,333
What?! We have to
get Kallen back!

330
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,916
Kallen Kozuki is a
single combat loss.

331
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,708
[OHGI gasps]

332
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,083
So, just leave her?!

333
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,541
[DIETHARD]
Mr. Minami, consider our choice.

334
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,000
You don't take on an enemy
like the Chinese Federation

335
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,583
over a single life,
no matter who it is.

336
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,500
We must preserve
our military strength

337
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:24,375
and hold out until we rendezvous
with the Indian forces.

338
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,500
Zero, it's your decision!

339
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,000
You gave special comfort

340
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,000
to Captain Kozuki before.
If you show her favoritism now,

341
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,375
it could put our entire
operation at risk.

342
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,083
It could ruin us.

343
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,416
[LELOUCH]
But...

344
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,916
You must put aside
your personal feelings.

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,041
Grand plans require sacrifice.

346
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,666
I'm waiting, Lelouch.

347
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,541

348
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,583
[gasps]

349
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,583
Uh, Knight of the Round.

350
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,916
[ZERO]
I've made my decision!

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,083
We're going in now!

352
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,083
But why?! If we lose,
we'll be crushed!

353
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,500
[ZERO]
If the Indians betray us,

354
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,625
we'll also be crushed.

355
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,500
Yes, but...

356
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,958
[gasps]

357
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,250
[ZERO] Chiba and Asahina,
use a crane wing formation!

358
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,500
We'll teach Xing-ke

359
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,250
the difference between
strategy and tactics!

360
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,083
Right! Yes sir.

361
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,916
Thank you, Zero!

362
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,875
We've been told to stand-by
here and wait for orders.

363
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,791
Oh. Say, Suzaku,
did you see these?

364
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,583
Show him those photos,
Lady Alstreim.

365
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,083
Uh, what are they?

366
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,458
[ANYA]
Here.

367
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,500
[SUZAKU] Oh, from my
welcome home party.

368
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:34,375
Ah. That one's an invasion
of privacy. Oh, Lelouch.

369
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,666
Huh? Lelouch?

370
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,916
If Shirley saw that,
she'd be really mad.

371
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,875
Uh huh.

372
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,375
Oh, that's right.

373
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,083
We have to contact Ashford,
but I need permission first.

374
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,583
[MILLY]
I see. Well, it can't be helped.

375
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,708
Lelouch and the others
must be so worried about us.

376
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,041
[ANYA]
Is this also Lelouch?

377
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,625
[ZERO] Black Knights!
Prepare for battle!

378
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,333
The terrain offers little cover

379
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,375
and there's no
geographic advantage.

380
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,541
[XING-KE] The enemy forces
is an improvised one.

381
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,958
Their chain of command
is all focused on Zero.

382
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,791
However, their Knightmare Frames
give them an advantage...

383
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,458
[ZERO] So the Chinese Federation
battle plan will be...

384
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,166
[XING-KE] To put the Shen
Hu on the front line and

385
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:11,958
break through...

386
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,541
[ZERO]
Our center!

387
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,791
[TOHDOH] I'll stop the
Shen Hu... with my Zangetsu!

388
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,208
Dragon Cavalry 3!

389
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,583
Our range is superior, so keep
firing as you advance!

390
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,375
[ZERO] We've blocked Xing-ke!
Akatsuki team, fire!

391
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,458
[HONG] It's true that
Xing-ke's pinned down,

392
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,291
but so is Tohdoh! Therefore...
The battle will be

393
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,333
decided by the skill
of the warriors!

394
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,750
[XING-KE]
Hit the enemy force head on

395
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,083
and hammer their
advance units!

396
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,250
Ignore their left
and right flanks!

397
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,250
Without Kozuki, we're one
move behind in this game!

398
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,750
They've broken
through our center!

399
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,916
Where's their main force?

400
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,125
[FUTABA]
On our forward line!

401
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,583
[ZERO] Right! All tasks
at hand are cleared!

402
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,875
Begin counterattack!

403
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,208
Chiba, right flank!

404
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,833
Asahina, left flank!

405
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,791
Use attack pattern sigma!
Prepare for rearward fire!

406
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,208
Focus barrage on main enemy
force! Hit the forward units!

407
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,083
Once the Shen Hu's
power's used up

408
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,416
and Xing-ke's neutralized,
the battle is ours.

409
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,750
[XING-KE]
Advance!

410
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,916
If we get bogged down here,
we'll be wiped out!

411
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,791
We're taking Kallen back!

412
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,541
Hit 'em hard!

413
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,708
Perpare fo hand-to-hand combat!
Draw swords!

414
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,250
There's more?!

415
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,291
You've deployed all your forces
to try and finish us, Zero?

416
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,541
Such wild risks!

417
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,041
His whole battle plan
hinges on the Shen Hu?

418
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,166
What a reckless daredevil!

419
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,166
[XIANG-LIN]
No.

420
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,166
He's drawing Zero into his net.

421
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,583
The true purpose of
this formation is...

422
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,125
[ZERO laughs]
Xing-ke,

423
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,833
your plan was to rip down
the bank of the waterway.

424
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,416
But I lowered the water
levels before the battle!

425
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,791
You think there isn't
enough to trap you.

426
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,666
That, Zero, is why you've lost.

427
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,083
Agh! What the...?!

428
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:56,916
[ZERO gasps]

429
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,375
[CHIBA]
I can't pull out!

430
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,916
Wait, isn't this...?

431
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,916
[XIANG-LIN]
Correct.

432
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,875
It's all reclaimed
irrigation land.

433
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,875
Even Zero didn't know
about the corruption

434
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,833
and shoddy construction.
The inferior materials

435
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,208
that would melt and
give way beneath their feet.

436
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,083
Xing-ke lead the way alone,

437
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,041
and then drew them back
into the position he wanted.

438
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,791
[LELOUCH]
He anticipated my moves!

439
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,250
He knew I'd
challenge him directly,

440
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,958
then deploy my forces in
this exact formation?!

441
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,083
[XING-KE] It is the
very land of our nation

442
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,833
that is giving us this victory!

443
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,000
Zero You've lost!

444
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,750
[ZERO]
Xing-ke!

445
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,583
[TOHDOH]
This battle is far from over!

446
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,208
Tohdoh the Miracle Maker!

447
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,250
Well done. But the enemy
main force is stopped!

448
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,000
All forces, advance!

449
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,500
Acknowledged!

450
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,375
[XING-KE] We'll take care of
their Knightmares later.

451
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,958
Concentrate fire on the
enemy ship's engine room!

452
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,250
Their barrier-shields
won't hold out forever!

453
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,333
Victory is at hand!

454
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,791
[LELOUCH] I've never been
out-maneuvered like this!

455
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,708
[gasps] What a disgrace!

456
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,958
Zero! I gave you my opinion.
I told you to withdraw!

457
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,291
[ZERO]
Then do it!

458
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,500
Protect the engine room
and pull back all forces!

459
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,250
Even if we return
to Horai Island...

460
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,333
[ZERO]
I know!

461
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,041
Ohgi, what about
the other place?

462
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,375
Uh! Right.

463
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,791
We finished a preliminary
recon and survey, but--

464
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,458
--[booming]
--[CREW gasps]

465
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,583
[ZERO] You've earned
your victory Xing-ke.

466
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,375
I should have killed you first.

467
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,208
You're as good a
tactician as I am

468
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,500
and as strong a
warrior as Suzaku.

469
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,541
One could say the heavens
blessed you twice.

470
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,166
Yes, but the heavens didn't
give him enough time to live.

471
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,333
[TOHDOH yells]

472
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,375
I have to hold on!
Just a little longer!

473
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,750
[HINATA] Bow-mounted
hadron scatter cannon, set!

474
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,666
[FUTABA]
Gefjun control synch, locked in!

475
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,833
[MINASE] Target lined up.
Ready to fire!

476
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,541
[ZERO] Right! Aim at
both enemy flanks!

477
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,791
Fire!

478
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,958
Impressive, Zero. So you
still had a hand to play.

479
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,375
Dragon Cavalry, spread out!
They're targeting battle groups!

480
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,875
[ZERO]
Tohdoh,

481
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,791
get the troops out of that
trap and back on solid ground.

482
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,625
The Ikaruga will lead
the enemy away!

483
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,125
Meet up with us at
rendezvous point 4!

484
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,375
I can't find any news reports
on the Chinese Federation.

485
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,541
Recovery of all remaining
Knightmares is now confirmed.

486
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,958
[RAKSHATA] I see. We're going
to be holing up in the

487
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,791
Mausoleum of
Eighty-Eight Emperors?

488
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,833
[DIETHARD] The enemy will
think twice about attacking us.

489
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,833
The greatest emperors from
Chinese history are buried here.

490
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,250
[C.C.] And they can only
approach us from straight on...

491
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,833
[OHGI] That way, we can fire the
bow-mounted hadron cannon.

492
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,375
[MINASE] Remember,
it's a single fire blast.

493
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,000
Now we just wait
for the Indian forces.

494
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,291
[CHIBA]
I doubt they're coming.

495
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,541
Besieged with no reinforcements.

496
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,916
[HINATA]
In that case,

497
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,541
there could have still
been room for negotiations.

498
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,916
[MINAMI] I never
believed the high eunuchs

499
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,375
would take that option.

500
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,333
[XING-KE grunts]

501
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,750
[ZHAO HAO] I thought
we told you not to move.

502
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,125
[CHENG ZHONG] Did you
really think we'd forgive you

503
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,833
after you plotted against us!

504
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,833
This is not the
time for revenge.

505
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,833
Or perhaps you don't really care
about rescuing the empress.

506
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,625
You've become obsolete.

507
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,875
We have more powerful
forces to serve us now.

508
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,791
We never anticipated
the Knights of the Round

509
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,250
getting into this fight.

510
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,791
You fools!

511
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,875
Bringing the forces of
a foreign empire

512
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,708
into our territory?
Aid from Britannia?

513
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,166
From the Avalon?!

514
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,875
Don't the high eunuchs know
who they're dealing with?!

515
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,458
Who do they think
conquered half of the E.U.!

516
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,875
It's Schneizel!
Second imperial prince.

517
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,750
[C.C.] Well, it seems
that the high eunuchs

518
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,583
are intent on wiping out
Xing-ke along with us.

519
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,791
[ZERO] Diethard, get our
little trick ready.

520
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,625
[DIETHARD]
What?! You mean here?

521
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,208
[ZERO]
Everything is in place.

522
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,791
And this will make a
most excellent stage.

523
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,625
[LELOUCH] I have
to strive for victory!

524
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,750
Even in this hopeless situation!

525
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,083
[REPORTER]
And we have a new report

526
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,666
from the Chinese Federation.

527
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,583
Taking advantage of
an attempted coup,

528
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,291
Zero appeared and kidnapped
the young Chinese empress.

529
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,166
Oh, really?!

530
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,958
You're okay then, madam Prez?!

531
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,041
[ALL gasp]

532
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,500
[MILLY] I'm with
Suzaku and the others.

533
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,750
What's the news saying there?

534
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,208
The TV and radio's just
talking about Zero now.

535
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,875
Thank God!
Madam Prez is alright!

536
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,333
[LELOUCH giggles]

537
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,916
And so it seems that Zero,
the empire's greatest enemy,

538
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,916
is about to meet his
end across the sea

539
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,833
in the Chinese Federation.

540
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,750
[LELOUCH] They've done it.
They've really done it.

541
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,791
Now, even if I use my
Geass on the empress

542
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,250
and make her my servant,
it'll be pointless!

543
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,916
The high eunuchs are
in complete control

544
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,250
and they're poised to
eliminate Xing-ke next.

545
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,458
In the end, we've been
cornered with no way out.

546
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,291
Even with Tohdoh
and the others here,

547
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,583
Suzaku is bound to join
the battle eventually.

548
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,416
There's almost no
chance for victory...

549
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,541
No, we're not finished yet!

550
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,833
I'll turn this tactical
battle upside down.

551
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,666
It's not going
to end here!

552
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,333
I won't let it!
