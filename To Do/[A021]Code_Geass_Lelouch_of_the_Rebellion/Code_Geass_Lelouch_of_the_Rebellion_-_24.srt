1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,750
[JEREMIAH]
Code R... I see.

2
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,750
You've given me an abnormally
high active electric potential

3
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,958
and boosted my neurofilaments.

4
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,916
Oh, how understanding
is such a happiness.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,125
You want me experimented

6
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,916
in order to recreate
it, didn't you?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,125
This affliction of hers.

8
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,291
Stop it! Code R
is not an invalid!

9
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,208
Regardless, won't you
just please calm down?!

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,500
Your brain cells were destroyed

11
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,166
past the Circle of
Willis arteries, so--

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,708
[JEREMIAH]
Spare me excuses!

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,541
You're the one who
gave me like this

14
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,833
because you hated me for sending
you back to the Homeland!

15
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,083
Look, I promise I'll hear
anything you have to say,

16
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,791
but first, let's return
to the Homeland!

17
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,958
We can't carry on a proper
conversation in this situation!

18
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,666
[ZERO]
Hear me, Britannia!

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,250
--This is Zero!
--Zero?

20
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,583
[ZERO]
A rebel against oppressors

21
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,958
who abuse their power!

22
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,708
We will wait until midnight!

23
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,625
You have till then
to surrender to me!

24
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,291
Through the entire settlement?!

25
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,208
[RESEARCHER A] He's on
every communication channel.

26
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,875
Do we have any communication
to the outside?

27
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,583
[CORNELIA]
Use this opportunity to confirm

28
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:12,875
the enemy's formation.

29
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,708
[SOLDIER]
Yes, Your Highness.

30
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,083
I'll have vengeance for
my sister Euphemia,

31
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,708
and I'll take it right
here and now, Zero!

32
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,916
Fairly, out in the open,
and face-to-face.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,583
A rebel against oppressors
who abuse their power.

34
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,333
We will wait until midnight!

35
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,458
You have till then
to surrender to me!

36
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,458
Surrender at midnight!

37
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,416
Hand over the whole
settlement to them...

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,041
Hey! Wh-What are you doing?!

39
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,125
Stop it!

40
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,958
You know what'll happen
if you do that?!

41
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,500
[OPERATOR A]
Would you please not interfere?

42
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,083
This is no time to
be screwing around!

43
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,666
--If you don't stop it--
--[gunshot]

44
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,708
[CORNELIA] Are you ready
to commence the air raid?

45
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,250
[SOLDIER]
Strike is synchronized.

46
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,083
[CORNELIA]
Good.

47
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,916
Assume the position to fire!

48
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,166
Cornelia, I'm afraid
a direct confrontation

49
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,791
with me in battle
will be your undoing.

50
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,375
[CORNELIA]
What?!

51
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,916
--[RIVALZ gasps]
--An earthquake?!

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,166
[MILLY, NUNNALLY gasp]

53
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,541
[ZERO]
A layered structure,

54
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,666
built to be
earthquake resistant.

55
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,416
But if you demolish all of the
floor sections simultaneously,

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,791
you won't find anything
to be more fragile.

57
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,541
By lining up at the
city's perimeter

58
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,000
to engage the Black Knights,
you sealed your fate!

59
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,625
I'm not beaten yet!

60
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,416
Damn, you really are
one amazing dude, Zero!

61
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,083
[KAGUYA gasps] Wow! Did they
destroy entire settlement?

62
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,291
I heard only the outer
perimeter was affected.

63
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,458
There are some facilities in it
that we're going to need later.

64
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,291
[DIETHARD] Still... How were
Zero's underground collaborators

65
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,291
able to pull this off?
I'm guessing that Villetta's

66
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,250
and Jeremiah's theories
must have been true.

67
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,541
Heh, then this is magnificent!

68
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:14,541
Yes... The world is a game,
and people are mere pawns!

69
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,250
[ZERO laughing]

70
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,416
This will do.

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,541
Once we broadcast
images to the world

72
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,750
of their government
bureau falling to us,

73
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,708
along with our declaration
of independence,

74
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,458
he'll be forced to face me.

75
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,041
And if I can get him...

76
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,291
Get the Britannian emperor
to meet me one on one,

77
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,083
then all the pieces
will fall into my hands.

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,125
[TOHDOH] How does the
enemy's air power look?

79
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,708
Our allied groups
are concentrating

80
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,541
on striking them
hard in each sector.

81
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,333
The rest are around the Izu
areas, Sado, and Awaji islands.

82
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,541
Then the time is right.
Now's our chance!

83
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,708
Attack!

84
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,958
[TOHDOH] Third Squad,
take the media sector!

85
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,500
Sixth Squad, take the harbor!

86
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,916
Special forces,
suppress the lower levels!

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,750
All remaining, push
in from the front!

88
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,583
Gather intelligence on the
enemy forces that are left!

89
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,625
[CORNELIA]
All forces, hear me!

90
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,250
Fall back to the Britannian
government bureau!

91
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,916
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, Your Highness!

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
[CORNELIA]
What's wrong?

93
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:42,958
If you're having
trouble controlling it,

94
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,625
just attach the cockpit block.

95
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,000
No, Princess Cornelia, forget
about me and get to the bureau!

96
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,333
[TOHDOH] Cornelia's been
found! Surround her!

97
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,375
[CORNELIA grunts]

98
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,291
[CORNELIA growls]

99
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,750
Meet your fate!

100
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,083
[CORNELIA]
Tohdoh! You phantom!

101
00:05:59,166 --> 00:05:59,958
[GUILFORD]
No, Princess!

102
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,333
Stand aside! Leave him to me!

103
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,333
[CORNELIA gasps]
Guilford!

104
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,875
Well, it's the one from Narita!

105
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,625
Get away while
you can, Princess!

106
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,708
Do you expect me to simply
abandon my men and run away?!

107
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,416
[GUILFORD] Your Highness,
you must survive!

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,250
For Princess Euphemia's
honor, as well!

109
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,250
[CORNELIA gasps]

110
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,750
[GUILFORD]
Go now!

111
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,041
Because, m'lady, I am the knight
you chose to champion you!

112
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,125
That sword's the same
one as the Lancelot's!

113
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,875
[GUILFORD] Therefore, I must be
the one who stays and fights!

114
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,708
So be it.

115
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,041
Then, Guilford, your orders are
to come back alive, my knight.

116
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,083
Yes, Your Highness,
I will return.

117
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,916
[ZERO]
The school area is a priority

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
for the special force and
the Zero Squad to take over.

119
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,125
We'll use one of the buildings
for a command center.

120
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,083
What? At the school?

121
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,041
[ZERO] Ohgi, you stand
by out there, as well.

122
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:46,916
Ohgi!

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,958
Uh... Right. Understood, Zero.

--[phone rings]

You're planning to go

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,500
to the Tokyo settlement,
aren't you?

127
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,958
However... You can't have it!

128
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,041
The A.S.E.E.C. exists for
research and development.

129
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,500
It appears our duties here
have wound to an end.

130
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,333
And we haven't been
ordered by the viceroy

131
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,958
to go out there, either.

132
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,541
Leaving would be a
violation of orders, right?

how you feel, but...

[SENBA] Lt. Colonel,
should we pursue?

[TOHDOH]
Where are the other units?

They're approaching, climbing
up from the side-- Hm?

The Glaston Knights!

147

[GLASTON 2]
Lord Guilford,

148
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,541
we're holding a position
just ahead of here.

149
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,708
Please head back.

150
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,833
I appreciate that. I'm grateful.

151
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,333
[GLASTON 3]
Think nothing of it, sir.

152
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,000
Originally, we were
all subordinates

153
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,291
under General Darlton's command.

154
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,333
We still don't know
if he's alive or dead.

155
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,208
But our duty to Viceroy
Cornelia comes first!

156
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,625
[GUILFORD]
Do you know the situation?

157
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,958
The enemy's frontal
assault is a diversion.

158
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,166
But if we beat them here, the
rest are simply militia forces.

159
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,333
I mean... They're just rabble.

160
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,291
Diethard! Enemy air
power's been taken care of!

161
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,875
Kaguya will command the G1.

00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,958
Move to your assigned
location immediately!

163
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:30,833

Yes, sir!

Rakshata's status?

She's on the move!

168
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,833

group with back-up!

169

Right!

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,833
Tohdoh, you know what to
do if you see the target.

171
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:41,708
[TOHDOH]
Understood.

172
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,958
Okay...

173
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,916
Now, what's the name of
the collaborator, Ohgi?

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,583
[OHGI] Uh... I have it
as Sayoko Shinozaki.

175
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,166
[LELOUCH gasps]

176
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,791
[SPEAKER 1] Contact's been lost
with the Hiroshima settlement!

177
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,000
[SPEAKER 2 ]
Uprisings have broken out

178
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,416
in the Sapporo
settlement as well!

179
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,000
[SPEAKER 3] And Chinese
Federation naval fleets

180
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,458
are massing in the
East China Sea!

181
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,583
The Chinese Federation, too?!

182
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,416
That's all we need with His
Majesty still not present!

183
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,791
[SCHNEIZEL]
He must be there again.

184
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,958
Lord Odysseus, our
troops are standing by,

185
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,041
ready for deployment.

186
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,958
You need to choose
a commander, now!

187
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,416
We mustn't be too
hasty here, gentlemen.

188
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,958
What Euphemia did was
clearly an abominable blunder.

189
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,541
Handle this rashly, and it
may spread to every Area.

190
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,208
My lord! We must go to
help Princess Cornelia!

191
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,375
Brother, why don't
I go? Send me there.

192
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,375
Y-You're serious?! Would
you really go there?!

193
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,750
[SCHNEIZEL]
Doesn't it sadden you to see

194
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,583
those people killing each other?

195
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:35,041
Super electromagnetic
shrapnel cannon, fire!

196
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,583
[MINAMI]
First special forces, move in!

197
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,750
[C.C.]
They only seem to be defending

198
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,333
the government bureau right now.

199
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,625
[LELOUCH] As expected, they're
trying not to scatter themselves

200
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,500
while waiting for
reinforcements.

201
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,833
[SUGIYAMA] Don't move!
We're the Black Knights!

202
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,791
We've taken over this building!

203
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,083
Do exactly as we tell you to!

204
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,833
No...! It can't be!

205
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,750
Hello, Chief. I brought
you an exclusive.

206
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,583
Shall we transmit
this to the world?

207
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,500
The moment when Zero changes
everything in our lives?

208
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,916
Now that's a scoop.

209
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,083
[CHIEF]
R-Right!

210
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,375
We'll give the public
a spectacular show

211
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,625
that'll exceed whatever
they hoped to see!

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,166
[RIVALZ]
Huh?

213
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,000
That was it-- the last
broadcasting station.

214
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,291
They're all down!

215
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,291
[ALL gasp]

216
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,791
[TAMAKI]
Hands up and turn around!

217
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,458
The Black Knights
control the school!

218
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,916
All of you are now our hostages!

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,500
[RIVALZ grunts]
Lower your guns!

220
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,208
[TAMAKI] Huh? That's a hell of a
thing to say in this situation!

221
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,666
[ARTHUR hisses]

222
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,708
Rivalz!

223
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,875
C'mon, lemme be cool
for once, okay?

224
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,333
I'll protect everyone!

225
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,833
--Is that a fact?
--[MILLY gasps]

226
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,250
--[RIVALZ grunts]
--[ZERO] Stop!

227
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,833
[ALL gasp]

228
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,583
[ZERO] I expressly told
you to avoid violence.

229
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,041
Yeah, but you also told us

230
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,833
this was gonna be our
command center, didn't you?

231
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,375
--Your command center?!
--[RIVALZ] Huh?

232
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,125
[KALLEN] Why does it have to
be Ashford, of all places?!

233
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,166
[ZERO] Your academy
is strategically useful

234
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,500
for our purposes,

235
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,750
therefore, we're turning
it into a command center.

236
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,791
We're in no position
to refuse you.

237
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,958
[ZERO] I guarantee none
of you will be harmed.

238
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,333
[LELOUCH]
Nunnally...

239
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,958
Until the fighting has
ended, you'll be safe here,

240
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,666
protected by the Black Knights.

241
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,000
So please...

242
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,208
[RIVALZ]
Like we can believe you?!

243
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,166
You guys are at war
with us Britannians!

244
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,750
We're enemies, remember?!

245
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,875
[KALLEN]
Please, Rivalz, don't argue.

246
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,541
Do what he says.

247
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,208
--[GROUP gasps]
--[SHIRLEY] Kallen!

248
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,666
Well, well... There's a
surprise around every corner.

249
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,833
Do I have your word
that no one gets hurt?

250
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,375
Not only us, but any of
the student body, faculty,

251
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,166
or staff anywhere on the campus!

252
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,125
[KALLEN] As long as nobody
tries to leave the dorms

253
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,750
or administration offices,
they ought to be fine.

254
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,333
I want-- I want to know
what you did to me!

255
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,458
[KALLEN]
Huh?

256
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,916
I was so terrified!
You have no idea!

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,666
Both of you did
something to me.

258
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,541
Tell me the truth! Didn't you?!

259
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,708
[KALLEN]
Huh?

260
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,208
[SHIRLEY]
How could you?! How could you?!

261
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,041
[OHGI]
Zero! It's the Lancelot!

262
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,750
[ZERO]
I knew he'd come!

263
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,083
[SUZAKU]
Out of my way!

264
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:27,875
[YOSHIDA screams]

265
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,666
When I find you, Zero,
I'm going to kill you!

266
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,083
Geass?

267
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,166
That's correct. Zero possesses
a supernatural power.

268
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,208
[SUZAKU]
Impossible.

269
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,500
Then how do you explain

270
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,125
Princess Euphemia's
sudden and drastic change?

271
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,208
What about you?

272
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,250
The one who always
follows the rules.

273
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,166
How do you account for your
actions on Shikine Island?

274
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,750
In short...

275
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,333
[VILLETTA] The power to control
people and erase their memories!

276
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,416
When you think about it,
it makes sense and explains

277
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,541
everything that's
happened till now.

278
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,541
And as a result of
its aftereffects,

279
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,958
I fell in love with
a damned Eleven!

280
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,708
That student...
Lelouch Lamperouge!

281
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,791
He's responsible for all of it!

282
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,291
[KALLEN]
Suzaku!

283
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,375
[SUZAKU]
Kallen?!

284
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,750
[KALLEN]
We meet in battle once again!

285
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,375
I'm sorry, but this time,
you're going to die!

286
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,625
[SUZAKU]
You're all fools!

287
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,416
You, the Japanese,
he's lying to all of you!

288
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,250
I can't put up with that
kind of ignorant drivel!

289
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,708
And what do you even
know about Zero anyway?!

290
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,958
Well, tell me what you
know about him then!

291
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,166
Tell me where Zero is now!

292
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,291
[KALLEN grunts]

293
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,166
[KALLEN grunts]

294
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,333
Come on! Answer me!

295
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,583
Where's Zero?!

296
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,083
Like I'd tell that to a
filthy traitor like you!

297
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,666
[SUZAKU]
Then let's finish this here!

298
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,208
[KALLEN] Don't think you have
the edge because you can fly!

299
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,250
[SUZAKU grunts]

300
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,416
[KALLEN]
Now I gotcha!

301
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,458
Die!

302
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:11,958
[KALLEN screams]

303
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,583
[SUZAKU]
Tell me! Where is Zero?!

304
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,375
[KALLEN] You know, I
really hate pushy guys.

305
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay... Then die here.

306
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,416
[SUZAKU] If you have any
last words, say them now.

307
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,541
[ZERO]
Wait!

308
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,208
[SUZAKU gasps]

309
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,416
[KALLEN gasps]

310
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,083
[ZERO]
Suzaku Kururugi,

311
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,166
my belief that you and I
could be allies was incorrect.

312
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,750
I'm no longer gullible about
our would-be partnership,

313
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,208
let's resolve this one-on-one.

314
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,416
Works for me! Let's do it!

315
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,416
[ASAHINA]
Colonel?

316
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,250
[TOHDOH]
Asahina. What about Urabe?

317
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,458
He's moving on the energy filler
repository right now, sir.

318
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,125
All right, then let's go
rendezvous with Senba and Chiba.

319
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,416
Once we recharge, we'll
surround the government bureau,

320
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000
then we, as the main force,
will push in from the front!

321
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,166
[ASAHINA]
Roger!

322
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,541
[CORNELIA]
Order Lord Crane to fall back.

323
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,875
Set up a defense line on
the railway station grounds.

324
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,541
Yes, right away, Your Highness.

325
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,000
[GUILFORD]
Princess Cornelia.

326
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,541
We've completed our formation.

327
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,416
What about a line of
defense around the bureau?

328
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,208
You're to hold your
position, Guilford.

329
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,708
If we can just drag
this battle out,

330
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,083
it'll only go badly
for the Black Knights.

331
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,500
[GUILFORD]
Yes, Your Highness.

332
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,541
[CORNELIA] Well? What did
my older brother say?

333
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,291
He said the Pacific
fleet should arrive

334
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,125
in approximately 75 hours.

335
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,375
Also, the Sado and Tori
Island air divisions

336
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,000
have already been
deployed within Area 11.

337
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,500
[CORNELIA] Meaning that
they should be here

338
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,250
in about 30 minutes.

339
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,625
Leak this information
to the Black Knights!

340
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,125
[GLASTON 1]
Huh?

341
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,000
After that, you'll join Lord
Guilford in the defense line

342
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,333
protecting the
government bureau.

343
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,791
[GLASTON 2]
And you, my lady?

344
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,041
Oh, I'll be preparing the party.

345
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,375
[JEREMIAH]
Zero!

346
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,666
[BARTLEY]
Can't you calm him down?!

347
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,333
I can't his resistance
is too strong!

348
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,916
[RESEARCHER A]
We've mounted the radiator fins!

349
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,708
[DARLTON groans]

350
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,166
[OHGI] T4s headed for
the government bureau?

351
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,916
Are the enemy air
divisions here already?

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,875
No, only one unit so far.

353
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,791
[OHGI] Well, it shouldn't
affect too many of us, then.

354
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,041
We're holding the school,

355
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,500
and Diethard's group is
holding the media area.

356
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,291
Miss Kaguya's forces are
standing by at our rear.

357
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,458
All we need to do is push
in on them from behind,

358
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,916
and we've won.

359
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,041
We have to for Yoshida and
all the others who died.

360
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,333
[STAFF] Deputy-commander,
we've captured someone.

361
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,250
Is it one of the students?
Don't worry, let him go.

362
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,333
We haven't got a reason
to hold him here.

363
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,500
[STAFF]
No, this one was caught

364
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,333
sneaking in through
the rear gate.

365
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,208
[OHGI]
Sneaking in?

366
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,250
[gasps]

367
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,083
[OHGI]
Chigusa!

368
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,625
[OHGI] Sh-she's a collaborator
who reports directly to me.

369
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,333
Take her into one of
the unoccupied rooms,

370
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,458
and I'll hear her report there.

371
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,708
[MILLY]
Poor Nina.

372
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,791
I wonder if she's still
in the Ganymede hangar.

373
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,958
[RIVALZ] And Kallen's
part of this whole thing?

374
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,208
Man, this sucks!
What're we gonna do?

375
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,250
[SHIRLEY]
It's all right.

376
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,208
--[RIVALZ] Huh?
--[MILLY] Hm?

377
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,125
[SHIRLEY]
The Black Knights...

378
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,083
Or Zero, rather...

379
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,000
They absolutely won't
do anything to harm us.

380
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,208
But how can you be
so sure of that?

381
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,500
--[SUZAKU] Coward!
--[RIVALZ gasps]

382
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,416
[NUNNALLY whimpers]

383
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,208
--[MILLY] Huh?!
--[RIVALZ] Hm?

384
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,666
You've taken them
as your hostages?!

385
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,208
Some one-on-one fight this is!

386
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,541
You brought this all on yourself

387
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,458
when you rejected my bids
to join me as my ally.

388
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,125
Now you'll regret these foolish
moral standards you cling to!

389
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,916
Hey, isn't that the
black Knightmare

390
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,500
that's been all over
the news lately?

391
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,125
No way! Zero's not targeting
this building, is he?!

392
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,416
He can't be! He can't!
Because if he does...!

393
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,333
[SUZAKU] If I can get
close enough to him

394
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,625
to use the Harkens...

395
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,625
Zero!

396
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,208
Now!

397
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,666
What the--?!

398
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,750
[RAKSHATA giggles]

399
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,916
I anticipated they
wouldn't have adequate time

400
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,791
to come up with a
countermeasure for this.

401
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,916
Zero, remember your promise.

402
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,416
[ZERO] Yes, you may do with
the machine as you wish.

403
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,833
Zero!

404
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,000
You deceive the people who
trust you to the very end!

405
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,083
You betrayer!

406
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,625
Hmph.

407
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,583
I've no time to argue which
of us is the bigger hypocrite.

408
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,000
Farewell, Suzaku Kururugi.

409
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,750
[SUZAKU]
Damn you!

410
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,416
Their defenses are
strong, as expected.

411
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,083
Should you really be
treating this so casually?

412
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,125
Enemy reinforcements
are arriving.

413
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,250
If they start bombing
us, it's all over.

414
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,791
Huh. But we have a replenished
energy filler, haven't we?

415
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,458
[ZERO]
Tohdoh, I'm going to move in

416
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,375
on the government
bureau from above.

417
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,875
[TOHDOH]
Hm?

418
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,083
Isn't it risky to rely on the
abilities of that machine?

419
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,250
[ZERO]
I know that.

420
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,416
I'm just going to
create some confusion.

421
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,125
It appears to be...

422
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,041
[C.C.]
Yes. Aries Villa.

423
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,666
What?! How do you know that?!

424
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,541
[C.C.]
I'll tell you some day...

425
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,166
...when the time is right.

426
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,791
[CORNELIA]
Welcome, Zero.

427
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,958
[LELOUCH gasps]

428
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,208
[CORNELIA]
I figured you would show up here

429
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,041
as soon as you learned
about the air raid.

430
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:28,000
Now... Join us for
your welcome soirée!

431
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,625
Care for a dance?

432
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,458
[OHGI]
Chigusa.

433
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,166
Why did you come to
this battlefield?!

434
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,125
We need to find some
place safe for you.

435
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,625
Stay with me for now.

436
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,875
Uh... Huh..?

437
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,000
[sighs]

438
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,791
Look... I'm sorry
I hid this from you.

439
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,333
But everything I'm doing
is for the sake of peace!

440
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,291
If Zero succeeds in freeing
Japan from Britannia,

441
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,166
then we can finally be together!

442
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,958
Oh, stop before I puke!

443
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,125
[OHGI gasps]

444
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,250
Me together with
an Eleven like you?

445
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,000
What a horrible thought. Heh.

446
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:05,916
My name is Villetta Nu, and I am
a Knight of Honor of Britannia.

447
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,083
[OHGI groans]

448
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,333
So I see, Chigusa...

449
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,208
You've gotten your...
memory back...

450
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,875
Is it true?! Ohgi's been shot?!

451
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,708
[STAFF 2]
Yeah, the medic's with him now.

452
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,125
And was it that
woman who did it?!

453
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,500
[STAFF 2] We're still
not sure. We're searching

454
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,791
for her as we speak!

455
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,875
Wait!

456
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:27,875
Huh?

457
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,750
Don't tell anybody
else about Ohgi.

458
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,291
The news would
only rattle people.

459
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,208
Just find the girl and
bring her back here!

460
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,291
[STAFF 2]
Yes sir!

461
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,916

even got Suzaku!

[footsteps continue]

464
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,083
I wonder what's
going on out there.

00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,083
[NUNNALLY]
Now's your chance, please go!

466
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,291
[GROUP]
Huh?

467
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,583
Suzaku needs your help!
Go to him, please!

468
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,541
And we need his help.
He's the best hope we've got.

[STAFF A]
It's pitch black.

470
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,833
You'd never know if the
culprit was hiding in here.

00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,333

Where's the light switch?

What's wrong, Zero?!

00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,958
The specs on this thing
are far superior to hers!

You're just a weakling!

480
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,541
I have you!

00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,333
I have you right
where I want you!

Why, Darlton, why?

Don't be afraid.

00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,958
I haven't come to
kill you, my lady.

Well, he made it.

you to Zero, Your Highness.

Thank you, Darlton.

Hello?

Oh, who's there?

502
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,375
Is that you, C.C.?

503
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,791
No, it's not.

Hm? But...

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,583
Nunnally...

506
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,708
I've come to take you with me.

507
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,333
[LELOUCH] Cornelia, the
second princess of the empire,

508
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,333
has fallen into my hands.

509
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,583
After I've questioned her about

510
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,250
the identity of my
mother's killer,

511
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,875
I only need to hold her
hostage, and I've won.

512
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,333
At last, for Nunnally's
sake as well,

513
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,791
I will obliterate Britannia!

514
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,458

abandoned us both!
