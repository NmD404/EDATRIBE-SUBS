1
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,458
[CORNELIA]
I see...

2
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,458
So you were Zero...

3
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,500
...the entire time.

4
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,541
[CORNELIA]
Darlton was right.

5
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,083
He said it was
someone with a grudge

6
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,875
against the Britannian
imperial family.

7
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,708
Y-You did this... for Nunnally?

8
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,291
[LELOUCH]
Correct.

9
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,875
I will demolish
the present world,

10
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,583
then build a new and
better one in its place.

11
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,958
[CORNELIA] You killed them all
for the sake of that madness?!

12
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,083
Clovis?

13
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,833
Even Euphy?!

14
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,708
You're one to talk,
my dear sister,

15
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,708
considering how you idolized
my mother, Marianne the Flash.

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,875
It would seem... that
talking with you further...

17
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,583
...will prove to be
utterly pointless.

18
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,791
Indeed.

19
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,083
Well then...

20
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,166
Lelouch vi Britannia
orders you to answer him!

21
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,041
Go on.

22
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,958
[LELOUCH] Sister, are you
the one who killed my mother?

23
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,125
I'm not.

24
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,666
[LELOUCH]
Then who was it?

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,708
I don't know.

26
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,083
[LELOUCH gasps]

27
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,041
But you were put in charge
of her personal guard,

28
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,416
were you not?!

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,666
[CORNELIA]
Yes.

30
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,000
[LELOUCH] Then why did
you withdraw her escort?

31
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,333
[CORNELIA]
I was asked to.

32
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:34,416
[LELOUCH]
By whom?!

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,083
[CORNELIA]
Lady Marianne.

34
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,458
[LELOUCH gasps]
Mother did?!

35
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,958
That's impossible!

36
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,625
My mother knew she would
be attacked that day?!

37
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,333
No... That can't be!

38
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,333
If she did, she would have
gotten us out of there!

39
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,208
What really happened back then?!

40
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,250
Who killed her?!

41
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,000
Who killed my mother, dammit?!

42
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,041
[CORNELIA]
Uh...

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,375
[LELOUCH]
You don't know the truth?!

44
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,583
Then who does?!

45
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,375
Someone must know!

46
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,750
You, yourself, investigated
what occurred that day!

47
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,833
[CORNELIA] I remember
His Majesty the Emperor

48
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,833
ordered Schneizel to transport
the body out of there.

49
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:10,833
[LELOUCH]
The body?

50
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:11,958
You mean Mother's?!

51
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,666
Then... what was in that coffin?

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,708
[C.C. gasps]
Hey, get back in here!

53
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,583
[LELOUCH] I know! The government
bureau's defense forces

54
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,833
will be here soon.

55
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,291
[C.C.] No! Your little
sister's been kidnapped!

56
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,416
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,291
C.C., this is not
the time for jokes!

58
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,958
We'll take Cornelia back to the
command center as our hostage.

59
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,250
She's been taken!

60
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,416
I just know because
she's the reason you live!

61
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,375
She's on Kamine Island!

62
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,833
[LELOUCH]
Kamine Island?

63
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:39,583
[JEREMIAH]
All hail Britannia!

64
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,166
Mr. Zero?! Can it really be?!

65
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,333
What?! Oh, what luck! What fate!

66
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,541
What evil fortune!

67
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,416
[ZERO]
Is that you, Orange Boy?

68
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,666
Oh! Ohh! I beseech you!

69
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,375
I'm begging you, please die!

70
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,875
[LELOUCH]
Damn! Get Cornelia!

71
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,083
I'm already on it!

72
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,750
[CORNELIA groans]

73
00:02:58,833 --> 00:02:59,791
[ZERO groans]

74
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,125
[JEREMIAH]
Zero!

75
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,250
I...

76
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,833
...must rid the world
of the empire's enemies!

77
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,875
Yes! And so...

78
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,125
All hail Britannia!

79
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,833
It's a damn disgrace!

80
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,375
If we report to the prince
what happened here...

81
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,416
[RESEARCHER A] It's only
his emotions running wild.

82
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,458
His behavior's too hard
to predict right now!

83
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,041
[BARTLEY] I wish we could
communicate with him!

84
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,333
Get through to him somehow!

85
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,041
[growls] Out of the way!

86
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,625
[JEREMIAH]
Zero!

87
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,125
[COMM] Currently passing
through Ozuite Area...

88
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,500
[CECILE]
Why did you try to stop Suzaku?

89
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,125
[LLOYD]
I'm a military contractor.

90
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,750
[CECILE] You didn't want
him killed, did you?

91
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,250
[LLOYD]
Why should I care?

92
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,083
You know as well as I do...

93
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,166
[CECILE]
Uh?

94
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,625
[LLOYD]
The biggest human flaw is that

95
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,750
we're so pitifully fragile--
in our bodies, our hearts,

96
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,916
and our relationships
with each other.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,791
[CECILE] Nevertheless,
you can't bend the world

98
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,833
or people any
which way you want.

99
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,916
[LLOYD] I want every
part in my mechanisms

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,750
to function exactly as I wish.

101
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:35,166
If we lose Kururugi, we'll just
have to find another Devicer.

102
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,000
Be careful, please!

103
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,583
Any Knightmare
entering the field

104
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,333
will shut down immediately.

105
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,000
[BURAI PILOT]
Understood.

106
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,833
[SUZAKU gasps, growls]

107
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:46,625
[JEREMIAH]
Hmph!

108
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,666
He's very good.

109
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,083
Ohgi, it's Zero.

110
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,375
[MINAMI]
Zero! Thank god!

111
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,833
[LELOUCH]
Hm? What?

112
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,083
Minami, where's Ohgi?

113
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,291
Someone shot him!

114
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,041
We're treating him,
but he's unconscious.

115
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,333
And the culprit who
shot him is still--

116
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,916
[LELOUCH]
All right, you'll do.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,083
The girl in the wheelchair-- do
you know where she is right now?

118
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,541
[MINAMI]
Uh... Isn't Ohgi more important?

119
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,500
[LELOUCH] I'll arrange
for his replacement later!

120
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,375
The girl in the
wheelchair comes first!

121
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,500
His replacement?!

122
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,250
[LELOUCH]
Confirm her location! Hurry!

123
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,375
All of the students we had
confined alone have disappeared.

124
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,958
In the confusion
when Ohgi was shot--

125
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,166
[STAFF]
Bring as many as you can.

126
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,083

Is Nunnally there with you?

130
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,458
[RIVALZ]
No, she's in the clubhouse.

131
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,458
We're just a
short distance away.

132
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,500

Understood!

--[RIVALZ] No! Wait!

Damn, I can't get through
to Nunnally or even Sayoko!

137
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,250
Lelouch, you know I'm here
with you as your accomplice.

138
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,416
But also as your ally.

139
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,875
[LELOUCH]
So I should trust you?

140
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,916
Take the word of a woman who
won't give me any reasons?

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,791
Look, I don't want you to die.

142
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,166
At least that's true.

143
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,083
[LELOUCH] Hmph. That's just
a one-sided convenience!

You're wrong, Orange Boy.

You're being hit right now.

What do you want us
to do with them?

Should we lock
them in the dorms

or the gym with
the other students?

00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,666
I guarantee you that
Zero wants us to be safe!

178
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,291
If not, something's wrong!
He's trying to guard us!

179
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,333
Aw, shut up!

180
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,500
Zero and me, we're tight,

181
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,375
and I know the man
better than anybody!

182
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,333
And he's not gonna
hesitate to shoot anyone

183
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,250
at a time like this!

184
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,375
--[SUZAKU] Stop!
--[TAMAKI] Huh?

185
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,875
[TAMAKI]
Ho! What's this?

186
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,250
The Japanese knight comes
out to help the Brits, huh?

187
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,500
Suzaku...

188
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,875
That white Knightmare is
all we came here to get.

189
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,166
A dirty traitor like you
can die right there!

190
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,041
--[ARTHUR screeches]
--[TAMAKI screams]

191
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,166
[ARTHUR hisses]

192
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,541
Arthur!

193
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,750
Stupid ass cat! Screw this,
just kill all of 'em!

194
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,750
[All gasp]

195
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,833
[LLOYD]
Good evening, everyone!

196
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:36,875
[SUZAKU]
Huh?!

197
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,041
[STAFF T2]
Retreat! Let's pull out!

198
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,625
[RAKSHATA gasps]
You're kidding!

199
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,583
That Earl of Pudding actually
came out to the front lines?!

200
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,625
[LLOYD] Rakshata...
I thought it was you.

201
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,083
--C'mon!
--[SHIRLEY, RIVALZ] Huh?

202
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,416
[TAMAKI]
Halt! You--!

203
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,625
[LLOYD]
Well, Miss Cecile?

204
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,625
How are the test
parts working out?

205
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,666
They're ready to be
practically applied.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,958
It's back on!

207
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,416
Unlock your fuel hatch.

208
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,083
We'll replace
your energy filler.

209
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,333
Right.

210
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,041
But why did you come out
here, too, Miss Cecile?

211
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,208
[CECILE] Good question.
Why did we, Lloyd?

212
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,250
Why else? To recover
the Lancelot!

213
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,250
And to do a few
other things, as well.

214
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,500
It's a Sutherland arm,
is it showing contact?

215
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,375
[SUZAKU] They've cleared
the compatibility check.

216
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,375
[CECILE] Good. Now leave
this place to us.

217
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,583
You go after Zero!

218
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,916
[SUZAKU gasps]

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,375
Thanks to you, I will.

220
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,291
Please protect Ashford
Academy and everyone here!

221
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,291
[LLOYD] Yes. After all,
my fiancée is here, too.

222
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,708
--[beeping]
--[SUZAKU] Hm?

223
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,041
Royal private channel?

224
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,750
[CORNELIA]
K-Kururugi...?

225
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,333
[SUZAKU]
Viceroy Cornelia!

226
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,416
Damn their tenacity! I'd expect
that of Cornelia's elite!

227
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,250
[ZERO]
Tohdoh!

228
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,541
[TOHDOH]
Hm?

229
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,625
[ZERO] From here on,
I'm leaving all operations

230
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,708
in your hands!

231
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,916
Ohgi's been wounded.

232
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,458
Have Diethard assume his duties!

233
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,583
Hold on a second!

234
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,916
What do you mean,
leaving them to me?!

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,458
[ZERO] I'm afraid there's
another urgent matter

236
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,250
that requires my attention!

237
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,458
I won't respond to any further
communications from you!

238
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,708
W-Wait!

239
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,250
What else could be more
urgent than this, Zero?!

240
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,625
[COMM 7]
Seventh Squad wiped out!

241
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,666
What?!

242
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,458
[MILLY]
Remain calm!

243
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,208
You're safe, so wait your turn!

244
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,208
Youngest students go first!

245
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,583
[BLACK KNIGHT 1]
We've gotta fall back!

246
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,125
[BLACK KNIGHT 2] Destroy
any records you can't take!

247
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,125
[BLACK KNIGHT 3]
Hurry! Hurry!

248
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,375
[OHGI groans]

249
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,125
[CORNELIA]
This battle situation...

250
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,541
...bodes victory for my forces.

251
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,291
Am I clear?

252
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,666
Do all you can to hide the
fact that I've been wounded.

253
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,458
It'll only upset them...

254
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,458
Guilford...
the Glaston knights...

255
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,750
You're the only one...

256
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,458
...I can tell...

257
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,208
[SUZAKU]
Don't try to talk any more.

258
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,250
Kamine Island... that's
where Zero's headed.

259
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,625
[SUZAKU gasps]

260
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,458
[CORNELIA]
Any more than that...

261
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,500
It's no use... I
can't remember...

262
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,833
Geass!

263
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,791
Y-You're Euphy's
knight, aren't you?

264
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,541
Then you must go and
clear her dishonored name!

265
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,333
[SUZAKU gasps]
Yes!

266
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,416
I know... this is
a bit informal...

267
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,625
But I dub thee Knight
of Honor of Britannia.

268
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,000
You are now a knight in
both name and station.

269
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,541
Go, Suzaku Kururugi!

270
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,583
Yes, Your Highness!

271
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,000
What?! Does this mean
that Zero's disappeared?

272
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,875
[DIETHARD] Not at all, he
simply transferred command

273
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,250
to us on-site here.

274
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,958
--Right.
--[beep]

275
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,833
[DIETHARD]
Why? Why now, of all times?!

276
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,791
[TAMAKI] I wanna know
why Ohgi was shot!

277
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,125
And where the hell is Zero?!

278
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,333
[MINAMI]
I said I don't know!

279
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,333
Can't someone get
a hold of him?!

280
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,666
It makes no sense.

281
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,666
He had no reason to run away.

282
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,375
In spite of Tohdoh's experience,

283
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,083
if he doesn't see
the entire picture...

284
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,291
Zero... I don't know
what to do next.

285

Kallen...

287
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,291
Ohgi! Are you all right?!

288
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,291
Yeah...

289
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,333
Kallen, listen to me...

290
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,625
Go after Zero!

291
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,083
[KALLEN]
Hm?

292
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,250
[OHGI]
There's must be...

293
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,833
...a reason... he's
acting this way...

294
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,208
Save him...

295
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,666
Zero...

296
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,791
The one who will realize...

297
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,000
...Naoto's dream.

298
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,250
[KALLEN]
But-- How do I find him?!

299
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,250
[OHGI]
You should see it soon...

300
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,416
[KALLEN gasps]

301
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,708
That's... the Lancelot!

302
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,500
What would be drawing
him away from here?

303
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,875
Rakshata... put a
transmitter... on it.

304
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,916
[KALLEN]
Understood.

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,125
Supply corps!

306
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,125
Send a captured air
transport to me ASAP!

307
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,791
It's top priority!

308
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,291
Dammit!

309
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,833
Can't we at least
hold this place?!

310
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,791
It will only be until all the
students have boarded the ship.

311
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,625
Hang in there.

312
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,916
Yes I will.

313
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,208
[gasps]

314
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,291
Why am I reading a thermal
reaction in there?!

315
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,791
A Knightmare!

316
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,541
What in the world is
that antique doing here?

317
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,875

That goes for you,
too, Black Knights!

321
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,541
Huh?

322
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,625
[LLOYD]
Call a temporary truce!

323
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,208
We can't fire on that!

324
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,000
Listen, everyone, do as he says!

325
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,708
Hold your fire!

326
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,875
[RAHSHATA] If it's got Lloyd
that panicked, then...

[LLOYD sighs]

328
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,958
[LLOYD]
Nina, did you complete it?

329
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,166
[NINA] There wasn't
enough time to test it.

330
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,291
I don't know if it'll explode.

331
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,833
Still... I'll try to.

332
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,083
[MILLY] Nina! What did
you mean by "explode"?

333
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,125
[CECILE]
It's dangerous! Stay back!

334
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,000
You see, if her
theory is correct,

335
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,083
that thing may destroy the
entire Tokyo settlement.

337
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,916
--But that isn't possi--
--[RAKSHATA] Believe it!

338
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,083

She's even using Sakuradite!

00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,625
Tell me where he is!

342
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,250

will be avenged!

00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,208
Where is Zero?!

[LELOUCH]
If I've lost Nunnally,

345
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,041
then what have I been
fighting for till now?

346
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,416
What's the point of this
war of independence?!

347
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,541
Why did Euphy have
to be sacrificed?!

348
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,083
[C.C.]
Kamine Island in sight.

349

00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,541
No matter who tries to stop me!

352
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,125
It figures it would be here.

353
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,750
Do you have some sort of
connection to this place?

354
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,041
Not this one.

355
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,416
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

356
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,416
Meaning there are other
places similar to this one.

357
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,708
Does Nunnally's abductor
have a Geass power?

358
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,000
[C.C.]
I don't know that much.

359
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,166
[LELOUCH grunts]

360
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,541
[C.C.]
It's the truth.

361
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,791
I don't doubt it.

362
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,875
We're still accomplices,
so at the very least,

363
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,875
I should give you the
benefit of believing you.

364
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,791
Thank you.

365
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,041
--[C.C. gasps]
--[LELOUCH] What's the matter?!

366
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,791
I see! This is--

367
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,500
--[gasps]
--[LELOUCH] What?!

368
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,833
[C.C.]
Calm down!

369
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,750
We're caught in a trap
that was set for intruders.

370
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,000
The one who activated it--

371
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:07,958
[C.C. gasps]

372
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,291
[LELOUCH groans]

373
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,666
[LELOUCH]
What is this?

374
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,791
The past?

375
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,791
C.C.!

376
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,166
No!

377
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,000
But...

378
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,875
[SOLDIER]
Hold it right there?!

379
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,791
[C.C. gasps]

380
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,541
[screams]

381
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,208
[LELOUCH]
Stop it...

382
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,291
Stop it!

383
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,083
C.C., these... visions...

384
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,708
...are these of your...

385
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,333
[C.C.]
All I have left are my memories

386
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,708
from when I was a witch.

387
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,125
Other than that,

388
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,083
I don't even know if I was
ever human to begin with.

389
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,000
Every person who
has ever hated me,

390
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,958
and each and every one that
has shown me any kindness...

391
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,333
are gone... forever.

392
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,166
They've vanished into
the current of time.

393
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,500
Always existing with the
endless flow of eternity...

394
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,875
...I am utterly alone.

395
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,458
You are not alone!

396
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,208
[C.C.]
Huh?!

397
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,208
We're each other's accomplice.

398
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,375
Therefore, if you're
supposed to be a witch,

399
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,208
then perhaps I
should be a demon.

400
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,333
[C.C. chuckles]

401
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,500
Odd thing to say at
a time like this.

402
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,708
C.C., you okay?

403
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,916
Don't you know who
you're talking to?

404
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,791
[C.C. gasps]

405
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,041
[JEREMIAH]
Zero! It is I!

406
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,416
Repent is now!

407
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,541
Stubborn ass!

408
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,916
The section Cornelia
damaged before!

409
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,125
There's one shot left
in the Hadron canon!

410
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,041
It's time for my
wonderful vindication!

411
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,083
[JEREMIAH]
Insidious isolation impudence!

412
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,583
[C.C.]
I'll handle this lunatic!

413
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,041
You go after Nunnally!

414
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,958
[LELOUCH]
But... we're out of energy!

415
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,875
[C.C.]
I'll be all right!

416
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,041
[C.C. sighs]

417
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,541
Well... I am nervous.

418
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,833
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

419
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,166
You have to prevail,

420
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,875
over your own past,

421
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,625
and over the outcome
of your own action.

422
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,583
[LELOUCH]
C.C., don't die.

423
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,000
Who are you talking to?

424
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,708
[LELOUCH chuckles]

425
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,125
You have a point.

426
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,458
[JEREMIAH]
I've found him!

427
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:48,750
You're not my first pick to
commit suicide with, but--

428
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,458
[JEREMIAH screams]

429
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,333
Hold your ground!

430
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,791
Victory's within
our reach! Be strong!

431
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,250
[CHIBA]
Dammit, we can't hold out!

432
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,333
[ASAHINA] Enemy reinforcements
will be here soon!

433
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,875
[SUGIYAMA]
What should we do?!

434
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,166
[INOUE gasps]

435
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,375
Inoue...?

436
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,083
Where the hell is he?!

437
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,750
Zero!

438
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,125
All forces, charge!

439
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,708
We'll smash these filthy
rebels with one blow!

440
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,208
[TOHDOH]
Fight till your last breath!

441
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,250
Stop at nothing!

442
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,541
Because if they
break through here,

443
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,458
our forces will
collapse completely!

444
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,541
[DIETHARD]
It's not that Tohdoh isn't

445
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,458
a brilliant military leader...

446
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:31,041
He simply lacks the incredible
charisma Zero possesses!

447
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,750
We need him! He can't
run out on us, not now!

448
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,791
[KAGUYA] Oh Zero, have
you really abandoned us?

449
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,583
Have you abandoned Japan?!

450
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,208
[LELOUCH]
That trap at the entrance

451
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,458
was designed to buy them time.

452
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,791
Was I the intended target?

453
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,708
Or was it C.C.?

454
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,250
No matter.

455
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,500
The first thing to do is make
sure Nunnally is all right.

456
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,708
[gunshot]

457
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,125
Turn and face me... very slowly.

458
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,041
[LELOUCH]
Dammit! Why now?!

459
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,958
[SUZAKU]
Didn't you hear me... Zero?

460
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:20,083
I said turn and face
me... very slowly.

461
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,458
[ZERO]
Euphemia randomly murdered

462
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,166
throngs of innocent
Japanese people.

463
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,666
You'd fight for a woman like--

464
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,125
[SUZAKU] Your Geass power
is quite convenient, isn't it?

465
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,208
[LELOUCH gasps]

466
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,708
[SUZAKU]
You get to hide in the shadows

467
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,708
while others take all the blame
for doing your dirty work.

468
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,750
You're just an arrogant coward.

469
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,625
That's your true nature,
the "real you."

470
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,291
Kallen!

471
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,791
[KALLEN gasps]

472
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,833
[SUZAKU] Don't you want to know
Zero's true identity, too?

473
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,166
[KALLEN]
What are you saying?!

474
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,375
[SUZAKU] You have a
right to bear witness.

475
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,916
[KALLEN gasps]
No, wait!

476
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,333
[KALLEN]
But how...?!

477
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,958
How could you?!

478
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,250
[SUZAKU gasps]

479
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,083
I didn't want it... to be you.

480
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,625
L-Lelouch is...?

481
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,583
[LELOUCH]
Yes.

482
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,000
I am Zero.

483
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,125
The man who leads
the Black Knights,

484
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,000
who challenges the
Holy Britannian Empire,

485
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,541
the one who holds the
entire world in his hand.

486
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,333
[KALLEN whimpers, sobs]

487
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,625
[KALLEN] You used us,
the Japanese people?!

488
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,916
You used me?!

489
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,416
[LELOUCH] And as a result,
Japan will be freed.

490
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,791
You certainly can't
complain about that.

491
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,833
[KALLEN gasps]

492
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,375
I should have arrested you
when I had the chance.

493
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,208
[LELOUCH]
You knew it was me?

494
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,833
I wasn't sure at first.

495
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,291
So I convinced myself
that it wasn't true.

496
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,875
I really wanted
to believe in you.

497
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,208
But you were lying
to us, to me...

498
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,083
...your sister, Euphy...

499
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,083
...and Nunnally!

500
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,125
[LELOUCH]
Yes.

501
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,208
And now, Nunnally's
been kidnapped!

502
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,750
[SUZAKU gasps]

503
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,083
[LELOUCH] Please, Suzaku, can't
we call a temporary truce?!

504
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,250
I need your help!

505
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,916
Together, we'll be able
to save Nunnally!

506
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,958
There's nothing in the world

507
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,041
that you and I
can't do together!

508
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,125
I'm done with that.

509
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,291
[LELOUCH gasps]

510
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,958
Had you only joined
up with Euphy first,

511
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,083
we wouldn't be here!

512
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,791
If you and she had
combined forces,

513
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,125
things would be different!

514
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,125
The world could have--

515
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:35,833
[LELOUCH]
That's all in the past!

516
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,958
Over and done.

517
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,291
[SUZAKU]
Past?!

518
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,125
[LELOUCH] You killed your
own father, didn't you?!

519
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,583
Wallow in remorse when
you have time for it!

520
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,083
N-No! You're hopeless!

521
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,625
[LELOUCH]
What?

522
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,375
I know you! In the very end,
you'd betray the entire world!

523
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,541
The way that it's betrayed you!

524
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,333
I'm not going to let your sick,
twisted dream be realized!

525
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,583
[LELOUCH]
You fool!

526
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,541
You think ideals alone
can change the world?!

527
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,333
Fine! Then go right ahead
and shoot me! Come on!

528
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,250
Set your aim on this
liquid Sakuradite!

529
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,666
[KALLEN gasps]

530
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,458
[LELOUCH] If my hearts stops,
this vial will explode!

531
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,708
You'll both die with me!

532
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,000
[SUZAKU]
Damn you!

533
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,916
[LELOUCH] Listen, I'll
make a deal with you.

534
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,083
I want to know who
told you about Geass.

535
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,458
Did they abduct Nunnally?!

536
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,541
Nothing that happens now...
is any of your concern!

537
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,708
[LELOUCH gasps]

538
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,708
[SUZAKU] Your very
existence is a mistake!

539
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,083
You need to be erased from
the face of the earth!

540
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,750
I'll take care of Nunnally!

541
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:25,708
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku!

542
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,333
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch!

543
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,208
[gunshot]
