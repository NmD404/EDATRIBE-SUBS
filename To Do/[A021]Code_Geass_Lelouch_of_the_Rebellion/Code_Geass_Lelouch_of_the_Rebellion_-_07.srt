1
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,750
[PALACE GUARD] Announcing
Prince Lelouch vi Britannia!

2
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,791
Seventeenth heir to the Royal
Britannian Imperial throne!

3
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,291
[NOBLEMAN A]
I heard Empress Marianna

4
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,708
was killed inside of
the Britannian palace.

5
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,208
[NOBLEMAN B]
There's no way terrorists

6
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,750
could've gotten in there.

7
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,541
[NOBLEMAN C] Which means that
the real assassins must've--

8
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,708
[NOBLEMAN D]
Sh! Beware, my friend.

9
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,916
You'll regret it if anyone
hears that kind of talk

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,958
around the palace.

11
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,500
[NOBLEMAN E]
And yet the boy remains.

12
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,041
Even though his mother is dead.

13
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,541
[NOBLEMAN G]
It's over.

14
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,250
And the Ashford family who
stood behind them is finished,

15
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,500
as well.

16
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:55,916
[NOBLEWOMAN H]
And his sister, the princess?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,041
[NOBLEMAN A] I understand
she was shot in the legs.

18
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,916
[NOBLEMAN C]
And that she lost her sight.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,166
[NOBLEMAN D] Blindness caused
by trauma, though, isn't it?

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,583
[NOBLEMAN F]
No difference.

21
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,625
Now, she can't even be
married off for political gain.

22
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,875
Hail, Your Majesty! My mother,
the empress, is dead!

23
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,541
Old news. What of it?

24
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,083
What of it?!

25
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,625
[EMPEROR]
You sought an audience

26
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,708
with the emperor of Britannia
simply to inform me of that?

27
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,166
Send the next one in.

28
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,375
I have no time for
these childish games.

29
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,416
[LELOUCH]
Father!

30
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,875
[GUARDS]
Yes, Your Majesty!

31
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,583
Why didn't you keep
mother out of harm's way?!

32
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:29,916
You're the emperor!

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,291
The greatest man in this
nation, if not the world!

34
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,500
You should've protected her!

35
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,458
And now you don't
even visit Nunnally!

36
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,750
I've no use for that weakling.

37
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,083
That weakling?

38
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,208
[EMPEROR] That is what
it means to be royalty.

39
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,958
Then I don't wanna
be your heir.

40
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,916
I give up my claim
to the throne!

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,541
[CROWD gasping]

42
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,250
I'm sick of the
fighting and scheming

43
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,833
over who will succeed you,
Father! I've had enough!

44
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,750
[EMPEROR]
You are dead.

45
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,333
You have always
been dead to me,

46
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,083
dead from the moment
you were born.

47
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,000
Who gave you the
fine clothes you wear,

48
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,166
a comfortable home, the food
you eat, and your very life?

49
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,708
All of those,
I have given to you!

50
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,333
In short, you are nothing to me
because you have never existed.

51
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,291
Yet you dare to speak
such foolishness to me!

52
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,791
[squeals]

53
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,333
[EMPEROR]
Lelouch!

54
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,666
You are dead, therefore you
are not entitled to any rights.

55
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,291
I am sending you
and Nunnally to Japan.

56
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,541
As prince and princess, you will
serve well as bargaining tools.

57
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,125
[LLOYD] It's a 7th-generation
Knightmare Frame,

58
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,666
making its abilities
far greater than normal.

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,583
[CORNELIA] I understand that the
Lancelot's pilot is an Eleven.

60
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,916
That's correct, an
honorary Britannian.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,416
However--

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,250
I'm promoting this man from
private to warrant officer.

63
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,083
That should satisfy him.

64
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,958
I'm trying to win without having
to rely too much on the numbers.

65
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,291
[EUPHEMIA] Those who risk
their lives on the battlefield

66
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,458
are the ones who
deserve to rule.

67
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:31,500
I understand the theory,
Sister. But still...

68
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,708
[SUZAKU] Sorry you have to sit
here watching me do my homework.

69
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,958
[CECILE]
Oh, don't worry about it.

70
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,000
You've never attended
a regular school before,

71
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,541
so it can't be avoided.

72
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,625
[SUZAKU] The guys on the student
council are helping me, too,

73
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,041
but... it's still hard.

74
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,625
[CECILE giggles]

75
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,041
To be perfectly honest with you,
I've been a little bit worried.

76
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,750
It's supposed to be
a liberal school,

77
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,875
but I was afraid you
weren't fitting in well.

78
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,708
Me too, I was expecting that.

79
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,458
But I happened to run
into an old friend there,

80
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,458
and he smoothed
everything out for me.

81
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,833
Be sure you never take
that friend for granted.

82
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,208
If your friendship continues,

83
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,916
your reunion won't
have been coincidence,

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,541
it will have been predestined.

85
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,416
Okay.

86
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,291
Anyway, please try one of these.

87
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,333
Uh. Thank you, I will.

88
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,583
[CECILE]
I'd like your opinion of them.

89
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,958
There's jam?

90
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,083
Yes, I just happened to get
some lovely blueberries.

91
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,500
[LLOYD] All right, everyone!
Pack it up! Pack it up!

92
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,458
We're done today!
Don't do anymore!

93
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,416
Hip-hip-hoo-rayyyy!

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,416
That's all, folks!

95
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,083
[SUZAKU]
Uh... umm...

96
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,125
[CECILE chuckles]

97
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,625
[CECILE]
Go to school.

98
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,375
Classes might be over for
the day, but it's important

99
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,916
to meet your friends and
have a social life, too.

100
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,625
[SHIRLEY] Say, can I ask
you something important?

101
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,875
[KALLEN]
Hm? Sure, what is it?

102
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,666
[SHIRLEY] Kallen, are you
hiding something from us?

103
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,833
[KALLEN]
Huh?

104
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,166
[SHIRLEY] If it's
something too personal.

105
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,791
[KALLEN]
No. What're you talking about?

106
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,291
You can tell me. I promise
I won't be shocked or upset.

107
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,708
Well, the thing is, I
happened to see you before.

108
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,125
[KALLEN grunts]

109
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,083
You're going out
with Lulu, right?!

110
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,125
Lulu?

111
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,333
The other day.
I saw you outside!

112
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,958
[KALLEN]
Oh! No, no, no!

113
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,166
That was all his doing!

114
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,166
His doing?!

115
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,791
No, wait, it wasn't like that...

116
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,833
I don't get it. You were trying
so hard to catch the cat before.

117
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,083
No, that wasn't it.

118
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,750
Besides, it's not like
we kissed or anything.

119
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,500
Or anything?! Then you
stopped short of doing it?!

120
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,875
Will you quit imagining things!

121
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,833
You don't understand the
circumstances one bit!

122
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,416
[MILLY] But an arranged
marriage is so...

123
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,958
I understand how
much you want to

124
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,416
re-establish the
Ashford family.

125
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
But, Mother, it's just that--

126
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,375
[NINA]
Ah! I've divided it!

127
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,333
[DARLTON] The Saitama ghetto
is now completely surrounded.

128
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,541
The Yamato Alliance's hideout
is located somewhere in here.

129
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,791
Half the people in
this neighborhood

130
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,458
are cooperating with them.

131
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,791
So, if we proceed now--

132
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,666
What'll be the effect
on production?

133
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,000
[DARLTON] Primary sector output
should decrease by 0.2%.

134
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,916
Within expectations,
you mean. All right.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,708
All of you here participated
in the Shinjuku disaster,

136
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,041
is that correct?

137
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,958
Yes, and we're indebted
to you, Princess Cornelia,

138
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,083
for your mercy--

139
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,750
[CORNELIA]
That's not what I'm asking!

140
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,541
Do you think the
conditions are similar?

141
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,458
[FORMER OFFICER 1]
Huh?

142
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,958
To those in Shinkjuku.

143
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,500
Military authorities report
that they have surrounded

144
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,750
the Saitama ghetto, a known
hiding place for terrorists.

145
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,083
Viceroy Cornelia is
also on the scene,

146
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,625
and entry to that
area is restricted.

147
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,083
[C.C. chuckles]

148
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:30,291
Oh? Well, what has
you looking so serious?

149
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,083
It appears that a
full-scale assault

150
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,833
will be launched in two hours.

151
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,416
Consequently, power
will be shut off...

152
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,250
News is one thing, but why are
we broadcasting the start time?

153
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,250
Because they're trying
to provoke Zero.

154
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,625
[CORNELIA] Zero is a criminal
with a flair for the theatrical.

155
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,375
I've recreated
the same conditions

156
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,375
that existed in Shinjuku
in order to draw him out.

157
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,916
If he's the overconfident type,

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,375
I predict he'll come
here to try and kill me.

159
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,041
[FORMER OFFICER 1]
Viceroy.

160
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,041
You'd really risk your
own life like this?.

161
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,583
What you fail to understand

162
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,958
is the war is a struggle
between pride and life.

163
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,541
[C.C.] You're not falling for
the enemy's provocation?

164
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,416
They went to such trouble
to invite me, though.

165
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,666
Besides, there's something I'd
like to ask Cornelia personally.

166
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,833
[C.C.]
Destroying Britannia

167
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,208
or discovering who
murdered your mother.

168
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,666
Which is more important to you?

169
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,916
[LELOUCH]
The two are of equal importance.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,250
The royal family members are
competing with each other

171
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,458
to see who will
ascend the throne

172
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,291
and become the next ruler.

173
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,166
Or rather, they're
being forced to fight.

174
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,875
By that man.

175
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,791
But the very thing you
hate is the same thing,

176
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,625
that makes Britannia strong.

177
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,250
The royal heir who is best fit
to become the next ruler

178
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,333
of Britannia is the
last one left standing.

179
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,541
[LELOUCH]
Exactly.

180
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,000
The weak ones lose,
and they're cast aside.

181
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,166
Britannia's that
kind of nation.

182
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,625
That kind of world.

183
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,375
Survival of the fittest is
the most basic rule of all.

184
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,583
[LELOUCH] If that's true,
then what happens to Nunnally?!

185
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,583
Should I simply give up on my
sister because she's frail?!

186
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,583
I refuse to accept that!

187
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,750
I'll wipe out that
sort of world myself!

188
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,791
[gasps]

189
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:05,166
[SUZAKU humming]

190
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,541
[KALLEN] Like I said, there's
nothing between Lelouch and I.

191
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,458
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch?

192
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,166
Anyway, that's how it is!

193
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,833
There's nothing's going on.

194
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,041
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

195
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,875
Um... where's Lelouch?

196
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,291
I don't know where he is,
and I don't give a damn!

197
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,416
[SUZAKU]
Uh?

198
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,916
You can't go, Lelouch.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,958
You need to fulfill your
part of our bargain,

200
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,083
so I won't have you
dying before that.

201
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,333
[LELOUCH]
Notice that what you're saying

202
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,291
and what you're doing
are contradictory.

203
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,875
Oh, I won't kill you.

204
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,458
I'm merely going to shoot you
in the leg to quiet you down.

205
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,791
Now I get it.

206
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,875
You're unable to use Geass
yourself, aren't you?

207
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,000
[C.C.]
Uh.

208
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,875
I'm not surprised,
I suspected as much.

209
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,583
You obviously wouldn't
have asked me to do it

210
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,583
if you could've
done it yourself.

211
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,291
[C.C.] Do you honestly think
you can threaten me with a gun?

212
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes, I do.

213
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,416
[LELOUCH]
Until I met you, I was dead.

214
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,666
An impotent corpse existing
behind a false guise of life.

215
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,875
A life in which
I did nothing real.

216
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,458
Day to day, I merely went
through the motions of living,

217
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,875
as if I were a zombie,
and I always had the feeling

218
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,833
that I was gradually dying.

219
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,541
If I'm condemned to go back
to that, then I'd rather--

220
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,833
[C.C.]
Stop it!

221
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,083
I see now.

222
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,041
It's life without meaning.

223
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,708
And a life like that...

224
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,291
Oh my god!

225
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,541
Why the hell did you do that?!
Even children are here!

226
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,833
What's going on?!
We haven't done anything!

227
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,416
[CAPTAIN]
That's exactly why!

228
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,625
The people of this ghetto
refuse to report the terrorists!

229
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,666
You hide them! Cover for them!

230
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,333
That's treason against
a suzerain state!

231
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,791
We're done sweeping
away those in charge.

232
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,166
It's nearly time to set
our plan into motion.

233
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,625
So, shall we begin?

234
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,791
Right!

235
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,250
Attention, all forces!

236
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,250
Commence eradication
of the Saitama ghetto!

237
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,083
[DARLTON] All forces, assume
level one battle stations!

238
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,208
[JEREMIAH]
I don't understand.

239
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,000
Why won't Princess Cornelia
order us to attack, as well?!

240
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,541
She won't because
Orange is here.

241
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,541
Just be thankful that you
haven't been disposed of.

242
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,833
You're to blame for this.

243
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,916
It's due to you that
our careers are over!

244
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,333
You're wrong! Zero's
the one who did it!

245
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,625
[KEWELL]
That again? Hmph.

246
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,041
[VILLETTA] Zero... Could that
student be working with him?

247
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,208
[COMM 1]
Suppression of area 4, complete.

248
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,166
eighth and eleventh
mechanized infantry companies

249
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,750
are sweeping north and
south in a pincer movement.

250
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,250
[LELOUCH]
Always the same.

251
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,250
Cornelia replaces Clovis...
yet Britannia never changes.

252
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,750
[PILOT A]
What unit are you from?

253
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,291
Your unit name
and I.D., soldier!

254
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,541
Private Dario Torres, sir,

255
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,208
with third
reconnaissance company.

256
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,250
I obtained this item from
one of the terrorists.

257
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,541
Could I ask you to
please transmit it

258
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,583
to headquarters for me, sir?

259
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,333
[PILOT A]
A disk, huh?

260
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,375
Well, I still need to
verify your I.D. first.

261
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,583
Right, understood, but
before we do that, sir,

262
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,500
I'd like to borrow your
Sutherland, so hand it over.

263
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,541
[PILOT A]
Uh.

264
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,333
Sure, no problem.
Just take good care of it.

265
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,666
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

266
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,750
[TERRORIST A]
It's hopeless.

267
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,291
[LEADER] Can't we break through
along the Sai-Kyo line?

268
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,666
[TERRORIST C]
They've got armor blocking it.

269
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,250
[TERRORIST D]
We can't use back roads, either.

270
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,541
[LEADER] Any reinforcements
from Akabane or Jujoh?

271
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,125
[TERRORIST C] One man might
get through, but not a group!

272
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,666
[MAN]
Izumi!

273
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,208
[LEADER] Damn. Any word from
the Toda or Kawaguchi districts?

274
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,416
[MAN]
Forget that! Listen!

275
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,541
[LEADER]
Huh?!

276
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,708
[ZERO]
This... is Zero.

277
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,708
Zero?

278
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,208
[TERRORIST A]
Zero? You mean--?

279
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,541
[ZERO]
I assume all of you have heard

280
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,583
about the Shinjuku incident.

281
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,833
Do what I say,
and you will be saved.

282
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,916
[TERRORISTS gasping]

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,375
[COMM 1]
B-12, suppression complete.

284
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,875
[COMM 2]
F-7, no sign of the enemy.

285
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,125
[COMM 3]
D-24, 87% complete.

286
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,625
[COMM 1] Powadon team,
change course to 5-1-6.

287
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,250
[POWADON]
Yes, my lord. Moving to 5-1-6.

288
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,583
No response at all.

289
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,833
This guy Zero might turn
out to be a no-show.

290
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,750
[SUBORDINATE]
Guess he's just another

291
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,416
run-of-the mill terrorist.

292
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,375
They came! They really came!

293
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,375
Just like Zero said they would!

294
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,125
Now then, shall
I drag Cornelia out

295
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,250
or should I make an opening?

296
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,166
R-1, R-2, maintain distance.

297
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,833
Draw them back to
the area where N-2 is.

298
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,166
B-7, open fire
towards two o'clock.

299
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,666
P-5's team will
commence its barrage.

300
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,041
[COMM 1]
Gester team, contact lost!

301
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,291
[COMM 2] Enemy spotted
in district G-4-7!

302
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,708
[COMM 3] Kaczinski team
engaging. They were ambushed.

303
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,250
[COMM 1]
The enemy appears to be using

304
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,500
Sutherlands captured
from our own forces.

305
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,333
Exactly the same as Shinjuku.

306
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,875
Has there even been
any sign of zero yet?

307
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,041
N-2, continue towards
the upper-right.

308
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,291
R-4, fire.

309
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,666
N-1, take the man on the left.

310
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,291
Right. P-3, Take out the bridge
and close down the route now.

311
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,958
[STAFF OFFICER]
Point 1-7 has fallen!

312
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,875
Halley team, contact lost!

313
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,916
[CORNELIA]
That's enough.

314
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,541
Order all troops to fall back.

315
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,083
Further damage and
casualties serve no point.

316
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,250
[FORMER OFFICER 1]
Fall back?!

317
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:18,958
[FORMER OFFICER 2]
With all due respect,

318
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,000
we can still fight them!

319
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,958
We can't fight them like this.

320
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,125
[DARLTON]
All forces,

321
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,333
fall back behind ghetto
perimeter at once!

322
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,750
Formation doesn't matter!

323
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,708
Fall back behind ghetto
perimeter at once!

324
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,333
[LELOUCH]
What, no stomach for it?

325
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,208
If I blend in with
the retreating units,

326
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,000
that'll put me right
next to Cornelia.

327
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,500
Have I cleared the
task at hand already?

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,541
[C.C.] You can't fight your
own blood, can you?

329
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,583
But regardless, that type
of person is dangerous.

330
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,666
I wonder which path he'll take.

331
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,250
[C.C.]
I understand.

332
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,916
Just who do you
think I am, anyway?

333
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,666
[SHIRLEY]
Hmm...

334
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,625
So, Lulu lived here before
this became Area 11, huh?

335
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,041
Was he a neighbor?

336
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,500
[SUZAKU]
Um... What about yourself.

337
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,708
Myself?

338
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,875
I guess we're a lot
alike in that respect.

339
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,833
Honestly, I didn't like
Lulu at the beginning

340
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,083
when I first met him.

341
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,625
He gave the impression
that he was flippant,

342
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,083
and that the only thing
he worked hard at

343
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,041
was avoiding hard work.

344
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,416
But back when we were freshmen,

345
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I happened to see him come
upon a traffic accident.

346
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,416
A driver rear-ended another
car and was clearly at fault,

347
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,416
but he tried to blame it on the
elderly owners of the other car.

348
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,166
Nobody tried to help them.

349
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,333
And then...

350
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,083
[SHIRLEY] Lulu didn't do
it so that he could boast

351
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,041
to his buddies or
laugh about it later.

352
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,166
He did it with the same bored
expression he always wears.

353
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,708
That's when I wondered,
"What's up with this guy?

354
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,791
What goes on in his mind?
What does he wanna do?"

355
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:48,041
I really wanted to know, and in
the process of finding out...

356
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,375
You fell in love with him.

357
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,041
[SHIRLEY gasps]

358
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,416
[SHIRLEY]
Umm...

359
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,458
You think that's what
this is? Maybe you're right.

360
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,166
How dreamy it is to be in love.

361
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,041
Oh, how I wish.

362
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:04,166
[LELOUCH] Cornelia...
You're no match, you'll lose.

363
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,125
Zero is no match, I'll win.

364
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:06,708
[FORMER OFFICER 1]
Huh?

365
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,291
Of course.

366
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,791
That's why they call Princess
Cornelia the Goddess of Victory.

367
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,041
Shall we go then,
Guilford, my knight?

368
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:17,166
It is my pleasure to serve
and obey you, my lady.

369
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,458
[LELOUCH]
Even with my Geass,

370
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,541
the normal security
makes it too risky for me

371
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,458
to simply stroll in.

372
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,791
I guess I'll have to create an
opening as I did with Clovis.

373
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:26,958
[phone ringing]

374
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,708
[LELOUCH]
Hm? The student council room?

375
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,291
But I thought the
cat festival meeting

376
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,125
was scheduled for tomorrow.

377
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,958
[SHIRLEY] I know Kallen
said I had it all wrong,

378
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,541
but it seemed like
she was getting upset

379
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,250
in order to fool me.

380
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,583
Which is why, in this case,

381
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,833
it's best to simply
ask him directly.

382
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,291
On your behalf, I can ask
him how he feels about you.

383
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,000
What?! You'd really do that?!

384
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,458
Just relax, it'll be fine.

385
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,333
Are you nuts?! No way!

386
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,291
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

387
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,416
Oh, whatever...

388
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,208
Aw, c'mon, let me
handle this for you.

389
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,083
I'll be discrete.

390
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,666
I don't want your help, okay?!

391
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,125
It'll be fine!

392
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,666
[SHIRLEY yelps]

393
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,416
Uh! Sorry!

394
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,750
Uh, oh... Does
that hurt much?

395
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,083
[SUZAKU]
Greatly...

396
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,208
[LELOUCH]
You're desperate, Cornelia.

397
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,583
Using your royal guard
in such a manner...

398
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,166
This is Zero.

399
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,500
N-1 will re-engage
their IFF signal.

400
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,416
Operate as a Britannian unit.

401
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,791
[TERRORIST C]
Understood.

402
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,583
[LELOUCH]
As my decoy.

403
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,125
[DARLTON] One knightmare left
transmitting an IFF signal

404
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,375
within the city area.

405
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,583
[FORMER OFFICER 1]
Can't you contact it?!

406
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,041
[FORMER OFFICER 2]
Scramble a rescue team!

407
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,416
No, destroy it.

408
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
You can't!

409
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,416
He might be a captive
of the enemy!

410
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,666
[CORNELIA] I ordered
all troops to fall back.

411
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,625
I have no use for soldiers
who can't follow my orders.

412
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,708
[DARLTON]
You heard the princess.

413
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,083
[FORMER OFFICER 1]
But--!

414
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,083
[CORNELIA] Do your duty,
even if it costs your life.

415
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,833
My subordinates follow
that code without question.

416
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,958
At your command, Your Highness.

417
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,375
Hey! What're you guys doing?!

418
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,208
Can't you read the IFF
signal?! I'm on your side!

419
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,333
[TERRORIST B]
Dammit!

420
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,291
No confirmation?

421
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,791
Well then...

422
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,750
N-2, send signal, then fall
back to the hospital ruins.

423
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,666
R-1, R-2, hold your positions.
Fire only if attacked.

424
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,958
They've transmitted another
signal, which means one thing.

425
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,125
They've set an ambush!

426
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,041
Send in more Gloucesters
and surround them!

427
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,875
They're not following?

428
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,375
No, dammit!

429
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,291
R-1, R-2, abort the ambush
and fall back at once! Abort!

430
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,541
[COMM 1] Gloucesters have
arrived at indicated area.

431
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,333
[COMM 2]
No sign of enemy.

432
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,208
He anticipated my move.

433
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,083
It's possible we really are
dealing with Zero himself.

434
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,333
P-2! N-3! Circle around
behind the enemy!

435
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:48,041
What's wrong?! Come in!
P2! N3! Dammit!

436
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,166
B-1! B-5! Move in!

437
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,500
Like hell!

438
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,916
There's no way we can beat
Cornelia's royal guard!

439
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,041
That's a death
sentence! I'm out!

440
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,333
[TERRORIST A]
Hey! We surrender!

441
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,458
[MAN]
We won't resist!

442
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,833
[TERRORIST C]
Spare us!

443
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,125
[CORNELIA]
Kill them.

444
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,958
P-6, P-8, what's
happening?! Agh!

445
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,375
B-7! Circle around
and cover N-4!

446
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,708
[TERRORIST D]
This is B-7!

447
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,000
I gotta prime target here!
I'll take him out first!

448
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,208
No, hold your fire!
That's a decoy!

449
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,708
B-7! That's an order!

450
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,958
Whaddaya mean? I've got this
bastard right in my sights!

451
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,916
Fall back! They'll strike
from above! B-7, fall back!

452
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,166
[TERRORIST D yells]

453
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,708
Idiot.

454
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,166
B-8, this is Zero. I want
a status report, now.

455
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,083
[TERRORIST C]
Screw your status report! Agh!

456
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,833
B-8! Damn!

457
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,000
Anyone who's left, report
in from the P group now! Uh?

458
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,333
[WOMAN]
Mission complete.

459
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,333
All forces, take
formation number 4.

460
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,083
[LELOUCH]
Beaten as easily...

461
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,666
But that's not how the
game is supposed to go!

462
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,833
[CORNELIA] This didn't work out
the way it did in Shinjuku,

463
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,083
Zero.

464
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,291
So, are you still
masquerading as one of us?

465
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,458
We'll discover
who you are shortly.

466
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,833
[LELOUCH]
This...

467
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,958
This is what real
organization can do...

468
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,833
[CORNELIA] Attention,
all Knightmare pilots.

469
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,166
Open your hatches
and reveal your faces!

470
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,375
[gasps]

471
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,208
[LELOUCH]
Cornelia!

472
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,375
[CORNELIA]
Hah!

473
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,791
I repeat!

474
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,333
All pilots open your hatches,
and show me your faces!

475
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,708
[LELOUCH]
What do I do?

476
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,333
If she gets me in a line-up...

477
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,416
Without my mask, my
identity will be exposed!

478
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,041
That mustn't happen!

479
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,583
Use my Geass? No, impossible.

480
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,875
It won't work unless
I look directly at them.

481
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,041
The enemy is protected
within Knightmares.

482
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,291
That leaves the infantry
and the other pilots.

483
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,750
Huh-uh, forget it. There
are too many of them.

484
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,666
How do I turn this around?

485
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,541
No... Would that work?

486
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,750
Show them I'm Zero,
then use the power?

487
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,208
But then the the Knightmares.

488
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,708
Maybe I can start shooting
and break out of here!

489
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,166
Impossible.

490
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,875
Against Cornelia's royal guard,
that would be suicide!

491
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,875
[GUILFORD]
Open your hatch. It's your turn.

492
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,291
[gasps]

493
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,166
[GUILFORD] What's wrong?
Hurry up and open your hatch!

494
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,083
[LELOUCH] Well... my hatch
was damaged earlier in battle.

495
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,416
[GUILFORD] I see.
Then we'll open it for you.

496
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,208
[LELOUCH]
Uh!

497
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,291
[GUILFORD]
Turn around.

498
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,875
Well? Come on!

499
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,208
Yes, understood.

500
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,208
At once, sir.

501
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,416
[SOLDIER 1]
Zero's been sighted!

502
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,083
[LELOUCH]
Uh!

503
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,458
[GUILFORD]
Hm?

504
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,916
Ah-ha! I was right. Zero has
a flair for the dramatic.

505
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,833
No way!

506
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,916
[GUILFORD]
Capture him!

507
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,083
Platoons three and
five, stand ready!

508
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,875
[COMM 2] Image detected!
Target confirmed!

509
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:24,916
Twelfth tactical special
mobile company...

510
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,541
I'll just have to play along!

511
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,541
[SOLDIER 1] Surround the
building! Head around back!

512
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,291
[SOLDIER 2]
Sharpshooters, open fire!

513
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,750
[SOLDIER 1]
He fell!

514
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,625
Your Highness, how do
you want us to proceed now?

515
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,333
[CORNELIA]
Hm. Any likelihood it's a trap?

516
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,166
There's always that possibility,

517
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,791
especially since we don't know
anything about this person,

518
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,166
aside from the fact
that he seems

519
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,666
as prideful as you
anticipated, Viceroy.

520
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,666
Then there's no
point in chasing him.

521
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,208
[DARLTON]
Correct.

522
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,291
If he intentionally revealed
himself directly to his enemy,

523
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,875
he must already have an escape
route already in place.

524
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,583
[CORNELIA]
So self-preservation trumps all?

525
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,291
[LELOUCH]
That's how Cornelia is.

526
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,458
She's nothing at
all like Clovis.

527
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,916
Why did you rescue me?

528
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,541
[C.C.]
I told you already.

529
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,125
I can't have you dying.

530
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,083
[LELOUCH] I wouldn't have lost
if the conditions were equal!

531
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,708
You sore loser.

532
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,208
If you're really that good,

533
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,750
you should be able to set up
conditions the way you want.

534
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,583
That's what I'll do,
then. I'll set them up.

535
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,333
[LELOUCH] I'll raise an army
that can't lose to Britannia.

536
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,083
A people! A nation!

537
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,500
[LELOUCH] Where and
how can I find troops?

538
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,458
Who will serve in my army?

539
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:13,041
If only I could ask
Suzaku to join me...

540
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,750
No, that ship has sailed.

541
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,500
He's a Britannian soldier now.

542
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:20,375
Even if he doesn't enter into
the fray, he's still my enemy.

543
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,125
Well then, I'll
just have to choose.
