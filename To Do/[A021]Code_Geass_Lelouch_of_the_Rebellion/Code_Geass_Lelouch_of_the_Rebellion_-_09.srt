00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,583
[CC] Lelouch, a young
outcast prince of Brittania,

2
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,625
possesses two great powers:

3
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,333
One of them is Geass.

4
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,708
The absolute ability
to compel any person

5
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,500
to do whatever he commands.

6
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,333
The other is the Black Knights.

7
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,958
His military force assembled
with the intent of

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,416
destroying the Brittanian Empire
ruled by his father.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Veiling his true
identity behind a mask,

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,166
and the code name "Zero,"
Lelouch has made his move

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,750
to avenge his mother's murder

12
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,541
and to create a world in which
his younger sister, Nunnally,

13
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,208
can find happiness.

14
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,250
What will the be the final
outcome of these actions?

15
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,166
At this point...
no one can predict.

16
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,166
[REPORTER 1] ...clearing the
last of the debris from around

17
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,708
the Lake Kawaguchi
Convention Center Hotel.

18
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,833
[REPORTER 2]
It's been two weeks

19
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,541
since Zero unveiled
his Black Knights,

20
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,625
but there's still little insight
into the man behind the mask.

21
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,583
[REPORTER 1] They weren't able
to track his escape route?

22
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,833
[REPORTER 2]
They let the hostages go

23
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,500
and somehow made it
to the other shore.

24
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,708

[MAID whimpers]

[MAID]
Unh! Kallen--I mean Miss.

28
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,916
Forgive me. I didn't
wish to wake you...

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,416
Again?

30
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,958
I'm sorry, it was the step
ladder this time, it broke...

31
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,333
Well, just get it cleaned up!

32
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,958
And be quick about it,
I have to leave for school.

33
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,291
Mistress...

34
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,083
You've been attending school
quite a bit lately.

35
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,333
Making any friends there?

36
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,041
I don't see how that's
any of your business!

37
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,833
Just go, will you...?

38
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,833
[OILY MERCHANT]
I know it's for welfare,

39
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,458
but why waste it on the Elevens?

40
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,666
[OILY POLITICIAN] That's why I'm
selling it to you, my friend.

41
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,333
The Eleven population could
use a little thinning out,

42
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,791
if you ask me...

43
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,875
[OILY MERCHANT]
Your payment'll be transferred

44
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,500
to your wife's account.

45
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,958
[OILY POLITICIAN]
Princess Cornelia is a soldier.

46
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,333
This sort of thing doesn't
interest her all that much.

--[BOTH gasp, whimper]

48
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,166

51
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,166
You're-- You're the--!

52
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,125
[KALLEN]
The Black Knights!

53
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,541
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

54
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:13,208
[STUDENTS laughing]

55
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,916
[SHIRLEY] That's not like you,
dozing off in class like that!

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,875
Well... I, uh...

57
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,000
[RIVALZ] You could learn
a thing or two from Lelouch.

58
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,166
He's an expert at
sleeping in class.

59
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,125
[KALLEN] Huh? He's not
sleeping now, is he?

60
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,333
[RIVALZ] I dunno what he's
up to, night after night,

61
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,541
but he sleeps through about
half of 'em these days.

62
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,000
[CORNELIA]
The E.U.'s starting an offensive

63
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,166
along the El Alamein front.

64
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,916
We can't go on dragging
our feet around here.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,250
I want to solidify
domestic affairs.

66
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,708
It's high time Area 11 was
made a satellite nation.

67
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:48,375
For that to happen, we need to
stamp out terrorism, of course.

68
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,458
But another major problem is
the rampant abuse of "Refrain"

69
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,708
amongst the Elevens.

70
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,333
Productivity is plummeting.

71
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,416
It's coming in on the Chinese
Frederation's Kyushu route.

72
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,375
We have to put an end to it.

73
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,250
[EUPHEMIA]
Yes. But be careful.

74
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,333
[CORNELIA]
You as well.

75
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,041
I don't want you
leaving the settlement.

76
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,166
Cornelia...

77
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,916
What about the Black
Knights and Zero?

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,250
I'll let them roam
free a bit longer.

79
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,583
I owe them that
for saving your life.

80
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,500
However, upon my return...

81
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,833
Once I've cleaned up this area,
I'm entrusting it to you.

82
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,375
Try to stay out of harm's
way from now on.

83
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,291
All right, Euphie?

84
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,458
[ZERO]
Because Clovis was an offspring

85
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,083
of the Britannian emperor.

86
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:32,916
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,541
[ZERO]
That reminds me...

88
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,750
You're one of his children,
too, aren't you?

89
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,250
But I suppose for now...

90
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,916
[EUPHEMIA] When he spoke
to me that night...

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,125
...what was he alluding to?

92
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,458
Suzaku... What would
you make of all this?

93
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,583
About what Zero is doing...

94
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,041
And of me.

95
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,041
[yawns]

96
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,916
Man, this double life
sure is a killer...

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,750
[MILLY]
C'mon, Suzaku, hold him down!

98
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,083
[LELOUCH]
Dammit, Suzaku, cut it out!

99
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,541
Stop it! I'm not kidding!

100
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,416
[SUZAKU] Sorry, Lelouch,
but it's the president's orders.

101
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,250
[LELOUCH] Yeah, like you're not
enjoying this at all?!

Will you hold still?

103
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,958
[MILLY]
Huh? Good meowning!

104
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,250
Good... morning, I guess...

105
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,208
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

106
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,250
[KALLEN]
What is all this?

107
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,208
Whaddya mean,
didn't we tell you?

108
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,416
It's our welcome
party for Arthur.

109
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,041
Sounds like fun...

110
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,416
Well, classes are postponed,

111
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,750
we might as well have
some fun, right?

112
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,375
[SHIRLEY]
I set some stuff aside for you.

113
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,916
Over here!

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,083
To make up for all my
getting so upset before.

115
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,333
Take your pick!

116
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,583
[KALLEN]
What? For me?

117
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,083
She doesn't need a costume.

118
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,166
Wha...?

119
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,000
You're already wearin'
a mask, right?

120
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,125
You really are a riot,
you know that?

121
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,750
You oughta be on television.

122
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,625
What do you think,
Miss TV Star?

123
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,583
[SUZAKU] Oh, I thought
she meant Lelouch.

124
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,291
Would you quit
joking about that?

125
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,875
The whole thing's a
huge pain in the butt!

126
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,166
We've been hounded with
questions day and night!

127
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,916
Even in the bath!

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,500
[MILLY] We haven't been able to
leave school grounds in a week.

129
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,166
Not that I don't
feel for you,

130
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,041
but I don't see why
we can't leave either!

131
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,041

the price of friendship!

Is that you're idea
of a love quote?

If I go down, then we all do.

137
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,541
That's a little dark.
Right, Suzaku? Huh?

138
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,958

That's what's so refreshing
about Suzaku though!

147
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,333
Yeah.

148
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,083

want him to get a clue, ya know?

[KALLEN] It's so funny to think
I helped save their lives...

153
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,625
Ever since we made our big
splash at the hoteljacking,

154
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,583
the Black Knights have
taken the world by storm.

155
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,791
We've become a friend
to the weak,

156
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,416
just as Zero
proclaimed we would.

157
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,291
Terrorists who involve
civilians, overbearing military,

158
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,166
criminal sydicates, corrupt
politicians and profitiers...

159
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,166
If the law would not punish
them, then we would.

160
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,250
In the blink of an eye,
we'd become heroes.

161
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,166
Support for us has swelled,

162
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,875
and we've even gotten our hands
on some Knightmares again.

163
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,125
Of course, no one could
show that in public...

164
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,000
...because...

00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,250
[LITTLE BOY laughing]

166
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,750
[MOTHER] Stop pretending
you're a Black Knight!

167
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,041
[LITTLE BOY]
But why?!

168
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,416
You musn't ever say anything
against Britannia!

169
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,250
We're Elevens,
have you forgotten that?!

170
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,583
[KALLEN]
...because our leader, Zero,

171
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,333
had killed Prince Clovis.

172
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,500
There are many in our ranks who
wish to know his true identity,

173
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,166
myself included.

174
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,583
But if we push too hard, I
suspect that he would vanish...

175
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,208
And without him...

176
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,083
...I'm fairly certain
we'd be finished.

177
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,583
Hey there, pal.

178
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,583
Haven't seen ya much lately.

179
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,250
[LELOUCH]
Really?

180
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,916
Yeah, really.

181
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,375
Are you all right, young lady?

182
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,875
[NINA sighs]

183
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,208
[URABE]
Why would the masses

184
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,791
flock around those
who saved Euphemia?

185
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,083
[SENBA] Even Kyoto has
said that they would send

186
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,208
the Black Knights
the Guren MK-II.

187
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,791
[ASAHINA]
To those would-be Robin Hoods?

188
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,416
[CHIBA] They're not
part of the resistance.

189
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,750
Killing Kusakabe
was proof of that.

190
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,583
The colonel killed
himself, didn't he?

191
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,875
Well, I hear they
didn't try to stop him.

192
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,791
In any case, Lt. Colonel Tohdoh,
we can't let this stand.

193
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,791
[MAID]
Mistress Kallen!

194
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,666
Mistress Kallen!

195
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,875
[KALLEN]
Madame President?

196
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,583
I just dropped by to
give you something.

197
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,791
[KALLEN]
Huh...?

198
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,791
Where would you like
me to show her to?

199
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,250
The parlor perhaps? Or maybe--

200
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,708
We'll be in my room.

201
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,291
[MAID]
As you wish.

202
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,666
[KALLEN'S STEPMOTHER]
Oh. I heard you had

203
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,458
a friend down here.
I was sure it would be a boy.

204
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,458
Out all night
and missing school,

205
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,958
not to mention all your
visits to the ghetto...

206
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,125
You're lucky your father's
back in the homeland.

207
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,958
No fighting
one's blood, is there?

208
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,875
[MAID whimpers]

209
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,458
You're the one who's enjoying
Dad not being around here.

210
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,291
Aren't you?!

211
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,500
[KALLEN'S STEPMOTHER growls]

212
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,458
[crashing sound]

213
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,500
[MAID] Oh, dear...
What have I done...?

214
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,458
[KALLEN'S STEPMOTHER]
What's wrong with you?!

215
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,208
Forgive me, milady.

216
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,625
Forgive me...

217
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,791
[KALLEN'S STEPMOTHER]
Can't you do anything right?

218
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,583
Besides selling
your body, that is...

219
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,458
[MILLY] Quite the complicated
home life you have, isn't it?

220
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,583
[KALLEN] So what was it
you wantd to give me?

221
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,625
[MILLY] Grandfather
asked me to pass this on.

222
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,458
[KALLEN]
You mean the principal?

223
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,708
[MILLY] Your transcripts
since middle school.

224
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,958
[KALLEN gasps]

225
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,000
[MILLY] I thought I'd
better give them to you

226
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,291
off of school grounds.

227
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,500
So my secret's out then.

228
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,958
Isn't it?

229
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,875
That I'm actually an Eleven
and Brittanian half-breed.

230
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,500
That was my stepmother
down there.

231
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,500
My real mother was
that clod of a maid

232
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,666
who knocked over the vase.

233
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,583
And your father...

234
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,166
Is he the head of
the Stadtfeld family?

235
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,375
My mother is such a fool...

236
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,750
In the end,
she wound up a servant.

237
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,166
She doesn't have
any real skills,

238
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,041
and no matter who's
ridiculing her,

239
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,333
all she can do is laugh
like it's nothing.

240
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,125
She didn't have to choose to
stay in this house, ya know?

241
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,375
She just clinging to some
old lover who's jilted her...

242
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,250
You really hate your
mother, don't you?

243
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,041
I just find her depressing...

244
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,166
[MILLY] Wow, this is
getting a little heavy.

245
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,000
Imagine, the wife,
and the daughter,

246
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,208
and the "other woman,"
all living together.

247
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,291
[KALLEN]
Ah, it could be worse.

248
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,708
Three square meals
and a roof, right?

249
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,875
I mean, it's not unbearable...

250
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,541
Most of the time, anyway...

251
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,333
That's good.

252
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,333
Still... some things in life
we can bear on our own, but...

253
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,166
when you add 'em all up,
they eventually break you.

254
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,875
Oh, don't worry.

255
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,416
I won't lie, I'm always
hungry for secrets.

256
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,958
But I'd never talk about this.

257
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,708
[KALLEN'S REAL MOTHER whimpers]

258
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,250
[LELOUCH]
I can't believe you teared up...

259
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,208
It's so embarrassing..

260
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,958
[SUZAKU]
It's called "honesty."

261
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:14,750
[SUZAKU yelps]

262
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,125
[LELOUCH]
Well...

263
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,583
Good thing the Black Nights
were there to save 'em.

264
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,791
That's all I can say.

265
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,916
If they wanted
to catch criminals,

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,500
they could've joined
the police force, ya know?

267
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,875
Why don't they, I wonder...

268
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,375
[ARTHUR meows]

269
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,083
They probably don't think
the cops are up to the job...

270
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,416
I tend to agree...

271
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,583
The police may not be
that effective right now,

272
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,583
but they could evoke
change from within!

273
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,958
[LELOUCH]
Yeah, and in the process

274
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,833
get all tangled up in
red tape and bureaucracy.

275
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,291
If they had done everything in
their power to change things,

276
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,083
that might hold water!

277
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,416
As long as they don't,

278
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,125
then all of it's just
self-righteous posturing!

279
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,541
Self-righteous?

280
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,416
[SUZAKU] And what constitutes
"evil" in their eyes?

281
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,041
What standards are they using?

282
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,375
It's noting but self-satisfying
gratification.

283
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,541
[door slides open]

284
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,833
[SHIRLEY]
Oh? It's just you two?

285
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,166
Anyway.

286
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,166
I guess I've gotta go back
to the base pretty soon.

287
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,666
See you around, Shirley.

288
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,125
[SHIRLEY]
Uh, ah...

289
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,583
See ya later!

290
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,291
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

291
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,416
So, Lulu!

292
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,750
I was, um...

293
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,500
I was thinking,
if you had some time,

294
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,083
You and I--

295
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,083
"Back" to base, now that was an
interesting choice of words...

296
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,583
[gasps]

297
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,833
[LELOUCH]
Go back...

298
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,708
Implying that's where
he thinks he belongs.

299
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,750
[KALLEN]
Refrain?

300
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,083
[OHGI]
It's a psychotropic.

301
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,458
Makes ya think you've
gone back to the past.

302
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,875
[KALLEN] Must be all
the rage here in Japan...

303
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,458
[OHGI]
Yeah, well...

304
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,791
Who doesn't long for the days
before the occupation, right?

305
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,041
[grunts]

306
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,666
[OHGI] This stuff
was specifically targeted

307
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,833
at the Japanese.
We can't very well ignore it.

308
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,625
Soon as the Burais
are stocked, we move.

309
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,166
[KALLEN]
Supplies keep rolling in.

310
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,791
And I hear lots of people
are ready to join us...

311
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,166
Black Knights
sure are popular, huh?

312
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,041
[OHGI] Well, we are the
heroic Knights for Justice.

313
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,583
I'll call ya when
the ammo gets here.

314
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,791
[phone beeps]

315
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,958
[PUNK A]
C'mon, Eleven! Say something!

316
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,583
[PUNK B]
You are sorry, aren'tcha?!

317
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,625
[PUNK C]
Bowin' your heads

318
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,208
is what you Elevens
do best, right?!

319
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,791
Eleven...

320
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,583
[PUNK D] Eating bad food really
makes us want to off somebody!

321
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,000
[KALLEN]
Lelouch!

322
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,208
No, there're five of them.

323
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,791
You wouldn't stand
a chance at all.

324
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,666
So you think I should
just ignore it?!

325
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,666
Go on... take a good
look at that Eleven.

326
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,875
[PUNK A] C'mon, what's the
matter?! Aren'tcha gonna cry?

327
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,125
[VENDOR groans]

328
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,375
[PUNK A] C'mon, buddy!
Just say you're sorry!

329
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,625
[LELOUCH] If we intervene
and help him win,

330
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,958
he wouldn't be able to
sell a thing tomorrow.

331
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:42,208
It was his choice to become
a Britanninan slave.

332
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,916
That's just the price you pay
for working in the settlement.

333
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,083
Well even so--

334
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,958
[PUNK B]
You got a problem over there?

335
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,000
Not feelin' sorry for
this Eleven, are ya?

336
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,083
Nah, they feel the same
way we do, don'tcha guys?

337
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,541
Not quite.

338
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,291
[LELOUCH] But you're tired of
beating up Elevens now...

339
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,750
...aren't you?

340
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,166
Yeeah, this is boring.

341
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,000
You guys wanna hit the arcade?

342
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,000
[PUNK C]
I got no cash!

343
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,125

00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,083
Well, they got bored
pretty quick, huh?

345
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:11,916
[KALLEN]
Oh...

346
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,875
[VENDOR whimpers]

347
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,791
[KALLEN]
Hey, are you all right?

348
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,666
[VENDOR]
Huh...?

349
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,625
A Britannian student!

350
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,125
Wh-What can I get for you?

351
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,125
How about a nice
California hotdog, miss?

352
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,583
Ah! I-Is this your boyfriend?!

353
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,208
I can get him something, too!

354
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,541
I have ice cream, if you like!

355
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,041
[LELOUCH]
In some ways,

356
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,708
Area 11 is better off now than
the old Japan ever was...

357
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,208
Being made a colony of
the empire has stablized

358
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:41,125
its military and economic
position in the world.

359
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,125
Elevens can even attain
full citizenship

360
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,541
through the legal process.

361
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,208
It's easy to become
an honrary Britannian

362
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,250
Just a question
of pride really.

363
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,833
Though, I can certainly
understand why they'd resist...

364
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,541
--[KALLEN] And?
--[LELOUCH] Hmm?

365
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,875
[KALLEN]
Knowing all that,

366
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,250
what does Lelouch Lamperouge
think about it all?

367
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,250
What do you wanna do?

368
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,291
[LELOUCH]
Nothing.

369
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,875
You know, you've
got a lot of brains

370
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,916
but you don't seem to be
doing much with them.

371
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,583
It's all Shirley talks about.

372
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,041
Saying how intelligent you are,

373
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,333
but how you barely
ever apply yourself.

374
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,958
That's why I don't do anything.

375
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,375
That Eleven we saw
back there could tell you.

376
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,541
He can lead a better life,

377
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,041
as long as he bows
his head to Britannina.

381
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,041
You must think you're
pretty cool, huh?!

382
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,708
Just playing the critic
and judging the world

383
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,708
from the sidelines?!

[growls]

385
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,291
Guess I was a fool to expect
anything more from you.

386
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,666
You know, I really thought you
were a better man than this!

387

Hmph.

[KALLEN'S REAL MOTHER whimpers]

389
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,875
[VILETTA]
So, about this Orange thing...

390
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,333
--[JEREMIAH grunts]
--Sorry to bring it up.

391
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,916
Is this whole thing true,
though?

392
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,208
That you can't remember anything

393
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,041
about when Private Suzaku
Kururugi was taken?

394
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,041
I don't expect you
to believe me.

395
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,833
No, it's just that...

396
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,583
During the whole
Shinjuku incident,

397
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,708
I suffered some sort of
memory lapse also.

398
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,750
You did?

399
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,541
By the time I
regained my senses,

400
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,708
my Sutherland had been stolen.

401
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,041
But right before that
entire gap in my memory,

402
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,250
I remember running into
some high school kid.

403
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,166
So what you think
it was that student?

404
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,708
I can't remember his face,

405
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,375
but there may still be a way
to get to the bottom of this.

406
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,333
[TAMAKI]
What the hell is Zero thinking?

407
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,541
After all his talk about
bringing down Britannia,

408
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,291
he's just got us running around
helping the police...

409
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,625
Still feels pretty good to have

410
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,333
the will of the people
behind us though.

411
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,958

I can't believe
he got in there.

have up his sleeve anyway?

dispel such illusions...
