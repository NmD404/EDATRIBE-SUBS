1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
The world lies!

2
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,000
Thou shalt not commit murder!

3
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,791
Thou shalt not
bear false witness!

4
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,916
Thou shall not cheat!
Thou shall not steal!

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,041
Thou shalt not covet
they neighbor's wife!

6
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,666
All of these are lies!
Mere illusion, nothing more!

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,083
They don't want to be killed!
They don't want to be robbed!

8
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,916
Using the twin lies of
"justice" and "morality,"

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,583
the weak are endeavoring
to protect themselves!

10
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,583
But the first truth is that
the strong devour the weak!

11
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,833
So let us feed
Upon people! Upon wealth!

12
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:49,375
Upon riches and power!
We of Britannia shall feast

13
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,541
upon the raw flesh
of the world itself!

14
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,958
We must crush this deception
and bring forth the truth!

15
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,750
ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!

16
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:01,541
[SOLDIERS] All hail Britiannia!
All hail Britiannia!

17
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:06,333
All hail Britiannia!
All hail Britiannia!

18
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:44,916
[gasps]

19
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,916
You looked like you
were having a nightmare.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
A nightmare...

21
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,708
[ROLO] Did something
happen yesterday?

22
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,750
No, not really.
Uh, Rolo.

23
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,500
Did I happen to say anything?

24
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,791
[ROLO]
Huh?

25
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,083
[LELOUCH gasps]
Nunnally...

26
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,083
[gasps]

27
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,041
[ROLO]
No, Lelouch.

28
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,083
You didn't say one thing.

29
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,416
Nothing at all.

30
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,666
I see.

31
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,083
[LELOUCH]
The world Nunnally desires.

32
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,250
The future Nunnally has chosen.

33
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,500
But that leaves me, leaves Zero,

34
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,791
standing in the way.

35
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,458
My sister's safety
has been guaranteed.

36
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,416
She has the Britannian
military forces

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,416
to protect her, and Suzaku, too.

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,125
He may be my worst enemy,

39
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,375
but I trust him to
do at least that.

40
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,541
Yes. As I had once
hoped he would.

41
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,375
And even after I can no
longer safeguard Nunnally.

42
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,750
[SHIRLEY]
Look at this!

43
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,750
It says this temple was
built a thousand years ago!

44
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,041
That's great. Have you
seen the water pistols?

45
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,125
I got one for everyone,
but I can't find 'em.

46
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,083
Hey, what's all
this stuff, Prez?

47
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,750
[MILLY]
Some nets, candles, wigs,

48
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,916
fireworks, and a tambourine.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,291
Uh... So are those
for our class trip?

50
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,583
Just leave it to me!

51
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,208
'This'll be my
second time, y'know!

52
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,833
Right...Uh?

53
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,791
[SHIRLEY, RIVALZ]
Hm? Uh...

54
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:04,916
What's wrong, Lulu?

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,250
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

56
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,000
You just seem sort of down.

57
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,291
No, I'm fine.

58
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,875
Can't sleep 'cuz
you're thinking about

59
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,333
how much fun the trip'll be?

60
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,041
You're correct.
Yeah, I'm excited about it.

61
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,916
Lulu, you're just
like a little boy.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,583
Heh...Huh?

63
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,375
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Attention all students.

64
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,250
The inauguration speech of
the new viceroy of Area 11

65
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,750
is about to begin.

66
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,958
Please assemble
in the auditorium.

67
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,791
[NUNNALLY]
How do you do, everyone?

68
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,000
I am Nunnally vi Britannia
of the royal family,

69
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,000
87th in line to
the imperial throne.

70
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,541
Due to the unfortunate,

71
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,291
untimely loss of
Duke Calares recently,

72
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,125
I shall be assuming
the viceroyship

73
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,208
of Area 11 in his place.

74
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,958
I am physically
challenged in that

75
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,333
I am unable to either
see or walk. Therefore...

76
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,000
But she's so young. How could
that girl be a viceroy?

77
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,500
She's a royal princess!

78
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,166
[NUNNALLY]
...Please, help me to help you.

79
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,125
She wants some help, hm?

80
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,500
This'll screw up things.

81
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,291
[NUNNALLY]
I realize this is unexpected,

82
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,291
but I'd like each one of you
to cooperate with me on this.

83
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,583
Huh?

84
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,916
As your new Viceroy,
I wish to again create the

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,958
Specially Administrated
Zone of Japan.

86
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,583
[gasps]

87
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,916
That's absurd!

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,208
I can't believe she would
even mention the name!

89
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,125
[NUNNALLY]
In the Special Zone,

90
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,916
Britannians and Numbers
would have equal status.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Elevens will be allowed
to safely call themselves

92
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,375
Japanese once again.

93
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,208
She just said Japanese!

94
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,666
Are they trying to trick us?

95
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,416
She has Suzaku Kururugi.

96
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,875
He's Japanese, so he
should be on our side.

97
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,500
[ELEVEN 5]
Princess Massacre's knight!

98
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,208
He's the traitor who shot Zero!

99
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,791
[NUNNALLY] Although a
tragic misunderstanding

100
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,750
occurred in the Special Zone,
I do not believe

101
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,625
that the attempt to establish
the zone was a mistake.

102
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,916
We need a gentler world.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,833

104
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,583
And those of you in
the Black Knights,

105
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,875
I ask you to please participate
in the Special Zone.

106
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,458
What?!

107
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,625
Not again!

108
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,125
Never again.

109
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,291
[NUNNALLY] ...and admit to
the mistakes that we've made,

110
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,291
then we can take the
first positive steps

111
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,958
--to setting things right.
--[ROLO] Huh?

112

00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,625
[SUZAKU]
You surprised me, Nunnally.

115
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,333
You're trying to create the
Japan Special Zone, again.

116
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,583
Suzaku, what Euphy tried to do,

117
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,250
I mean before the disaster
happened, wasn't wrong, was it?

118
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,541
[SUZAKU]
No.

119
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,291
I can assure you it wasn't
Euphy who was wrong.

120
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,333
[NUNNALLY]
Hm.

gonna do, then?

with the Britannians!

left is one Guren?

to Zero, of course, and--

[LLOYD]
Well, that's typical of our boy.

176
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,083
I'm not surprised.

177
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,250
[GUILFORD]
Uh...?

178
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,666
We have to perfect
the Conquista, right?

179
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,375
[LLOYD]
Ugh.

180
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,750
So, how is it?

181
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,750
I mixed peanut
butter with turmeric sugar

182
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,833
and wasabi paste,
then spread it on rye bread!

183
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,916
[LLOYD groans]
That's typical of you!

184
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,375
[LELOUCH]
Even though...

185
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,500
Even though I've been
doing all this up until now

186
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,916
for Nunnally's sake...

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,958
[CONDUCTOR]
Huh?

188
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,708
How do you do, everyone?

189
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,000
[LELOUCH gasps]

190
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,875
I am Nunnally vi Britannia
of the royal family,

191
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,083
87th in line to the
imperial throne.

192
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,583
Due to the unfortunate,

193
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,166
untimely loss of Duke
Calares recently,

194
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,333
I shall be assuming...

195
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,375
What's your problem?!

196
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,333
Watch it!

197
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,875
[NUNNALLY]
...In his place.

198
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:21,833
[LELOUCH gasps]

199
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,875
[WORKER MNS]
Hey!

200
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,583
[LELOUCH gasps]
I'm finished!

201
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,541
[SUZAKU] Nunnally may have
realized that I lied to her.

202
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:39,083
Even so, she said she wants
to carry on Euphie's wishes.

203
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,875
And for that, I'll...

204
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,041
[THUG A] We told you
money first, didn't we?

205
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,000
[THUG B] Cough it up,
ya stinkin' deadbeat!

206
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:46,916
[THUG C]
Loser!

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,375
[ELEVEN VICTIM]
Stop it, please!

208
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,583
Why are you doing this?

209
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,333
Aren't you guys
Elevens like me?!

210
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,916
[KOLCHAK]
Bring the cash next time.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,958
If you want this stuff.

212
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,541
[KOLCHAK]
Hm?

213
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,833
[THUG]
A Britannian?

214
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,458
[THUG D]
A student?

215
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,666
Japanese feeding
on other Japanese.

216
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,166
What a picture.

217
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,333
But even worse than that,

218
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,458
they commit petty
crimes for a Britannian.

219
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,125
Ha! Did you call them Japanese?

220
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,791
[THUG A] We don't need
sympathy from any Britannians!

221
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,625
[THUG C]
We call ourselves Elevens.

222
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,500
And a school boy
shouldn't complain

223
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,750
about the work we do!

224
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,083
Yes, I use these gentlemen
to do my bidding,

225
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,000
but only with their consent.

226
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,291
My dear student.

227
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,416
Don't touch me! You scum!

228
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,916
Why you--!

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,375
Now get on the ground
and do push-ups!

230
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:35,791
As you like.

231
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,166
[THUGS gasp]

232
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,666
[THUG D] Mr. Kolchak,
what are you doing?!

233
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,916
And why don't you
do some dancing?

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,875
[THUG D]
Whoa! Yeah, baby!

235
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,083
Do squats!

236
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:46,958
Start howling!

237
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:47,625
Applaud!

238
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,000
[ALL shattering]

239
00:10:51,083 --> 00:11:00,000
[LELOUCH laughs]

240
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,583
[C.C.] It's really makes
no difference at all

241
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,000
if he doesn't come back here.

242
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,833
The one single thing
that's important to me

243
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,833
is that he remains alive.

244
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,375
Oh, please.

245
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,333
The simplest solution would
be for him to stop being Zero.

246
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,625
I know. Not a very
romantic story, is it?

247
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,208
Still, at this rate,

248
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,500
the Black Knights
are over, they're history.

249
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:24,125
Yes. Zero exists
for Nunnally's sake.

250
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,291
That's what
Lelouch said, Marianne.

251
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,833
[MILLY sighs]
Where's Lelouch?

252
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,750
Dunno. What is up with that guy?

253
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,625
[KALLEN]
I figured you'd come here.

254
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,666
[gasps]

255
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,708
Where Zero was born.

256
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,791
You started it here,
this is where it all began.

257
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,291
[KALLEN] Lelouch, I want
to tell you something.

258
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,416
[gasps]

259
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,250
[KALLEN]
Is that--?!

260
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,583
[LELOUCH]
Refrain.

261
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,750
You're familiar
with it, aren't you?

262
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,125
Brings back memories
of the good old days.

263
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,583
Don't give me that crap!

264
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,125
[gasps]

265
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,916
[KALLEN grunts]

266
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,958
So what if you
failed this time?!

267
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,375
Can't you come up with
another plan and get it back?!

268
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,666
Just give us orders
like you always do!

269
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,875
Should I use
my Knightmare?

270
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,416
Or maybe play decoy?

271
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,083
Tell me! I'll do
whatever you say!

272
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,541
All right, then.

273
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,125
You can console me.

274
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,166
[gasps]

275
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,416
There are things a woman
can do for that, right?

276
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,958
[KALLEN gasps]

277
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,166
[KALLEN]
No!

278
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,125
[LELOUCH gasps]

279
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,833
Snap out of it, Lelouch!

280
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,291
You're Zero now!
You have an obligation!

281
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,166
You've got to live up to the
dreams you once gave us all!

282
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,666
So please, keep fooling us
until you no longer can!

283
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,708
We need you to be Zero this
time with all of your heart.

284
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,791
Play your role like you mean it!

285
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,041
[KALLEN whimpers]

286
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,083
[LELOUCH gasps]

287
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:24,541
[LELOUCH sighs]

288
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,583
[LELOUCH gasps]

289
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,000
[LELOUCH]
Rolo.

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,958
[KALLEN huffs]

291
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,916
[LELOUCH] That's right, you're
supposed to keep an eye on me.

292
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,083
I had forgotten.

293
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,250
[ROLO] Then why not...
forget about them?

294
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,708
[LELOUCH]
Hm.

295
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,291
[ROLO] All the heavy burdens
that just weigh you down.

296
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,166
Zero. The Black Knights.
And Nunnally...

297
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,083
[LELOUCH] You're wrong!
Nunnally isn't a--

298
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,583
For Nunnally's sake, as well.

299
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,125
[gasps]

300
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,666
[ROLO] If Zero vanishes, then
peace will come to Area 11.

301
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,750
Lelouch, you can go back
to being an ordinary

302
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,250
student again and be happy.

303
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,416
[LELOUCH]
But...

304
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
[ROLO] Is there
something wrong with that?

305
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,791
Wanting happiness isn't a crime.
No one would have to be hurt.

306
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,916
Look, we still have time
to undo what's been done!

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,250
[LELOUCH gasps]

308
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,000
It's all right. I'll never
abandon you, I promise.

309
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,041
I'll stay with you as your
brother forever, Lelouch.

310
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,125
[EMPEROR]
Tell me, Nunnally,

311
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,291
why would you request this?

312
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,958
Why did you want to
be viceroy of Area 11

313
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,208
after learning
Zero had returned?

314
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,250
Because my entire life,
I have lived under

315
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,708
the protection of my
big brother, Lelouch.

316
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,208
I may not know where
he is at this moment,

317
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,750
but I'm sure that he's out
there watching me at every turn.

318
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,708
Therefore, I don't want to
make an embarrassing

319
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,000
decision as viceroy while
he's looking over my shoulder!

320
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,750
[C.C.] That mask is
heavier than it looks.

321
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,833
The wearer bears a fate.

322
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,375
Not just of the Japanese people,
but that of the world.

323
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,750
Yes. But somebody has to--

324
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,791
[SUZAKU]
This is the Britannian military.

325
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,625
Your ship's registry and
stated course are erroneous.

326
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,916
Heave to at once!

327
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,291
We will now conduct
a forced inspection!

328
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,291
[KALLEN]
They found us?!

329
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,750
It appears so.

330
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,125
[SUZAKU]
Everyone aboard is ordered

331
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,791
to disarm and line
up on the deck.

332
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,541
You have ten minutes to
comply with our order!

333
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,625
[LELOUCH]
That's right.

334
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,666
Everybody's gone
on the school trip.

335
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,125
[ROLO]
Should we go after them?

336
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,375
[LELOUCH]
No.

337
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,833
An empty birdcage suits
me just fine for now.

338
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,875
[LELOUCH, ROLO]
Huh?

339
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,666
Who's firing?

340
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,208
[LELOUCH panting]

341
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,291
Hi! Welcome back, Lulu!

342
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,750
Light some off, too, Lelouch.

343
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,666
We have plenty left
over from the festival.

344
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,041
Why are you...?

345
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,458
What about the school trip?

346
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,333
[grunts] We couldn't
leave you here crying

347
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,875
while we three went and had fun.

it's all about who
you spend them with.

Hm? Oh, you mean this?

These are supposed to make
your wishes come true,

356
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,958
so I made one.

me how to make them, though.

361
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,291
It's already coming true.

362
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,500
Well, part of it.

363
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,750
I wanted to set off
fireworks with everyone.

364
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,833
Everyone?

365
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,375
For Nina, Kallen...

366
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,458
... and Suzaku.

367
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,291
It goes without
saying, you and Rolo.

[gasps]

369
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,833
And because I only
folded one crane,

370
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,833
you were the only
one who showed up!

371
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,750
[LELOUCH] A long time ago,
Nunnally, Suzaku,

372
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,833
and I talked about something.

373
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,583
We wondered what
happiness would look like

374
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,375
if we could give
it a physical form.

375
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,125
If I'm not mistaken,

376
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,000
I think it was Suzaku
who said that the shape

377
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,375
of happiness might
resemble glass.

378
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,375
His reasoning made sense.

379
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,625
He said that even though
you don't usually notice it,

380
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,333
it's still definitely there.

381
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,041
You merely have to change
your point of view slightly,

382
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,750
and then that glass will sparkle
when it reflects the light.

383
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,041
I doubt that anything else

384
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,541
could argue its own
existence more eloquently.

385
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,875
[NUNNALLY] They say if you
fold a thousand of these cranes,

386
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,583
your wish'll come true.

387
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,375
What about you?
Do you wish for anything?

388
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,708
[NUNNALLY]
Hmm...

389
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,625
I wish the world was
a gentler place.

390
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,291
[LELOUCH] That's right.
A gentle world is this close.

by phony memories,
