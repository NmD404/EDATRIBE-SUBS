1
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:23,041
[SUZAKU] Two thousand ten
of the imperial calendar.

2
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,166
The Holy Britannian Empire
invaded Japan to gain control

3
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,166
of its underground
Sakuradite resources.

4
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,125
My father Genbu called
for do-or-die resistance.

5
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,750
To stop him, I...

6
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,500
It was childish.

7
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,583
A tragically childish,
impulsive act.

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:46,000
I thought to myself
"This will stop the war."

9
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,750
I thought that there would be
no more needless bloodshed.

10
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:55,083
But I was wrong.
The fighting didn't stop.

11
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:59,000
All I wanted was to keep people
from killing each other.

12
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,958
[SUZAKU]
No! It was Geass!

13
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,416
The power that can
twist a man's will!

14
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,541
[SUZAKU]
In the end, it's the same.

15
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,750
I...! Hm?

16
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:20,541
[NINA] I didn't know.
I didn't understand that...

17
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,375
That it would be this horrible.

18
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:27,125
That so many people would...
That I... That it would be a--

19
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:27,750
Massacre.

20
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,041
[NINA]
Uh!

21
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,208
[SUZAKU]
It's a big hit, Nina.

22
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,833
The F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead
has proven itself.

23
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,458
Britannia can't lose now.

24
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,916
[LELOUCH] The Emperor
was headed for Area 11,

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,583
but he never showed up in
the Tokyo Settlement...

26
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,541
Which means he had
another objective.

27
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:25,625
His path could have taken
him to Shikine Island. No!

28
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,916
The ruins on Kamine Island?!

29
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,083
[PRIEST A] According to the
materials left behind by

30
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,708
Director V.V. and our brethren,
this location is optimal.

31
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,875
[PRIEST B]
It will synchronize

32
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,708
with ancient ruins
throughout the world.

33
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,083
[PRIEST C] With this action, we
can make the Sword of Akasha

34
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,791
manageable once again.

35
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,791
[EMPEROR] Heh. I never
imagined I would use such

36
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,041
an ancient device.
It's quite astounding.

37
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,125
[ANYA whimpering]

38
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,416
[ANYA]
So, you're ready to begin then.

39
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,125
[DIETHARD] What's the
Shinkiroh's location?!

40
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,666
[RADIO GUY]
Sir, we don't know yet.

41
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,958
[DIETHARD] Tsk! We have the
Britannians assisting us now!

42
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,125
As soon as you find it, alert
all forces and destroy it!

43
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,083
[RADIO GUY]
Yes, sir!

44
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,583
Master is in danger. Uh!

45
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,958
[ANYA] It's been ages since we
were face to face like this!

46
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,166
It's me!

47
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,291
[C.C.]
Uh!

48
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,541
C.C., don't tell me
you've actually--

49
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,666
I'm so sorry!

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,375
[ANYA]
What are you doing,

51
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,166
closing yourself up in
here again like this?

52
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,416
C.C.? C.C.!

53
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,208
[C.C.]
Hm?

54
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,208
Who are you?

55
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,666
[ANYA]
It's me. See?

56
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,541
It's you! So, you've chased
me all the way in here, now?

57
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,208
Are you that worried
about Lelouch, Marianne?

58
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,250
Oh, come on!
Do you really think

59
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,958
I'm such an ideal mother that
that's all I think about?

60
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,208
Then why did you
come here for me?

61
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,791
[MARIANNE]
Because so much has changed;

62
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,041
I need to know if
you're still on my side.

63
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,208
[C.C.]
Huh?

64
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,500
C.C., why did you seal
off your own Code

65
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,291
just when you had
what you wanted?

66
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:23,083
Charles was ready to grant your
greatest wish: the wish to die.

67
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,333
But you stopped him.

68
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,958
[C.C.]
Even I don't know why I did it.

69
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,250
Actually, I'm a little
shocked that I did.

70
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,708
[MARIANNE laughs]

71
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,458
Then you have to find the
answer, in the real world.

72
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,875
[C.C.]
Hm...

73
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,166
I've made up my mind, and
that's all there is to it.

74
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,708
[C.C.]
How typical of you.

75
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,250
Why is that?

76
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,625
The one who always comes in
and messes around with my life.

77
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,291
[MARIANNE, ANYA] Because I
appreciate what you did.

78
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,333
At least as far as giving
me my Geass Power.

79
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,375
[C.C.] And you never
fulfilled your contract.

80
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,041
If that's what you think,
will you come with me now?

81
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,625
Yes, but wait a minute.

82
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,291
There's something I
can't leave behind.

83
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,791
[ANYA]
Hm?

84
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,833
[CORNELIA] Was there any
chance to tell Anya to stay?

85
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,416
[VILLETTA gasps]

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
[CORNELIA] We'll need someone
here to take custody of Zero.

87
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,291
So, what do you plan
to do, Villetta?

88
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,958
Stay with the Black Knights?

89
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,541
Uh.

90
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,416
[CORNELIA] Neither my brother
nor myself plan to punish you.

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,083
After all, now that things have
moved forward to the next level,

92
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,958
I'd say we have no authority
to act against you.

93
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,708
[VILLETTA]
Well, I...

94
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,833
[exhales] I'm probably the
last person to say this,

95
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,041
but noble rank isn't everything.

96
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,166
[VILLETTA]
Uh...

97
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,541
[DIETHARD]
There's no choice.

98
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,375
We have to announce that
Zero was killed in battle.

99
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,708
[OHGI] Even though we
haven't found Lelouch yet?

100
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,291
[TOHDOH] You want people
to believe he's dead?

101
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,833
Pardon me. I understand
that Zero has betrayed us

102
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,166
and all of that,

103
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,166
but do you plan on telling
everyone about Geass?

104
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,875
We can't, they'd say
we were crazy;

105
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,833
we'd lose all credibility.
There's no way.

106
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,041
And what if the real
Zero appears later?

107
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,666
[DIETHARD] How exactly would he
prove that he's the real Zero?

108
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,000
[OHGI]
Uh?

109
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,916
In the end, the masked
hero is merely a symbol.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,875
He can't re-establish
himself without us.

111
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:04,333
Oh, really? That's very
good news! Excellent.

112
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,291
[RIVALZ] Yeah! They finally
got the cell phones

113
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,041
working again and we got the
news that everyone is okay!

114
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,458
It was a gigasmic relief.
Ah... Oh, yeah,

115
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,166
your room was destroyed, but
there's space in the clubhouse.

116
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,958
[LELOUCH] I see. Is the student
council room all right?

117
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,833
[RIVALZ] Mm-hm. By the way,
where's Rolo? Is he with you?

118
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:26,666
Uh, Yeah Listen, Rivalz...

119
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,750
Can you tell the Prez something
for me? Tell her I won't be able

120
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,375
to keep my promise to shoot
off fireworks with everyone.

121
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,875
Huh? What was that
supposed to mean?

122
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,208
Sorry, Rivalz and good luck.

123
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,541
Kallen, take care of C.C...

124
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,500
I have to kill him,
even if I die doing it.

125
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,041
I'm gambling that I can kill
an immortal who never ages

126
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,291
and who is immune to
the power of Geass.

127
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,583
That's the only
chance I have left!

128
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,791
[PRIEST A] Preparations are
complete, Your Majesty.

129
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,208
[EMPEROR]
Very well. Let us begin.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,583
I feel something shaking.

131
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, really?

132
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,541
[PRIEST A] All relic systems
are now synchronized.

133
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,833
[EMPEROR] With this, shall end
the world of the existing God.

134
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,000
Destruction and creation...

135
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,000
Ragnarok has finally begun!

136
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,375
Your Majesty,

137
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,333
Prince Schneizel sent a
report on the conflict in--

138
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,500
[EMPEROR]
Did I not tell you

139
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,625
to leave these mundane
affairs to him?

140
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,541
Mundane affairs?

141
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,541
[EMPEROR] Has the truth finally
begun to dawn on you, Schneizel?

142
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:52,250
If so, it's too late. This game
called war is already obsolete.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,583
[MILLY]
This is KT Television.

144
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,750
Since our studios were
lost in the blast,

145
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,375
we've set up a temporary
studio at Ashford Academy

146
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,000
to bring you this
emergency news alert.

147
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,916
A short while ago, we
received official word

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,041
that Prince Schneizel
has signed a cease fire

149
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,875
with the Black Knights.

150
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,500
In addition, according to an
official announcement, Zero,

151
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,250
leader and CEO of
the Black Knights,

152
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,416
was killed in the final battle.

153
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
Zero was wounded in the fight
for the Tokyo Settlement

154
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,833
and subsequently received
medical treatment

155
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,625
aboard the flagship Ikaruga,

156
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,291
but he succumbed to his injuries
before daybreak this morning.

157
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,000
[MAN B]
Master Zero!

158
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,166
--[WOMAN B] No! No!
--[MAN C] It can't be true!

159
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,916
[JEREMIAH] What's the
meaning of this, Ohgi?

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,083
Is it true that Zero is dead?!

161
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,458
[OHGI] Yeah. I'm afraid it's
just as the media's reporting.

162
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,791
Could I at least see
his face to confirm it?

163
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,291
[OHGI] Sorry, but we're busy
right now, Jeremiah.

164
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,958
It'll have to wait till later.

165
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,916
[KALLEN]
Are you serious about this?

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,500
[OHGI] The Black Knights
don't need Zero anymore!

167
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,208
[KALLEN] We've only gotten
this far because of him!

168
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,125
To just throw him away
like he's disposable...

169
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,750
He's the one who treated us
like we were disposable!

170
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,958
[KALLEN gasps]

171
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,250
[OHGI] He fooled us
from the very beginning!

172
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,375
With that despicable
Geass power!

173
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,500
I called him my friend!
The best friend that I ever had!

174
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,875
I loved that guy more
than my own life!

175
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,291
But then...

176
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,833
We learned the truth.
Think about the Black Rebellion.

177
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:23,916
He was ready to dispose of Ohgi
then. No. Even before that.

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,041
[OHGI]
That's right. People are...

179
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,958
...more than just game pieces!

180
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,041
Their lives matter.
That's why we're fighting!

181
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,791
[OFFICERS grunting]

182
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,541
Lelouch vi Britannia
now commands you!

183
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:41,083
From this moment forward,
you shall obey my orders!

184
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,916
Damn, she's good.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,875
Lloyd, can you give me an update
on the status of the Lancelot?

186
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,166
You know the status. You saw the
condition of the core luminous.

187
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,041
No, I'm talking about
the Lancelot Albion.

188
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,291
[CECILE]
It's ready to roll out.

189
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,791
Albion? So what's that about?

190
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,833
Oh, I shouldn't have
mentioned that.

191
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,000
It's a custom Knightmare
built for Suzaku.

192
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,458
But in the state
of mind you're in,

193
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't want you going near it.

194
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,291
Lloyd, as the Knight of Seven,
I could order you to do it.

195
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,291
[LLOYD]
My unease grows worse and worse.

196
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,541
[CECILE] Suzaku, didn't you say
that you had to be prepared

197
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,000
not to fire the F.L.E.I.J.A.?

198
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,416
[SUZAKU] Miss Cecile, what's
the fundamental purpose

199
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,833
of any weapon?

200
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,833
Sir Kururugi, you want to debate
this like a school boy?

201
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,041
[SUZAKU]
The point is...

202
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,125
[GINO] Drop it, Suzaku.
This isn't like you.

203
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:48,875
[GINO]
Huh?

204
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,916
Your Highness!

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,541
It's all right. You can relax.

206
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,125
[LLOYD]
Princess Cornelia!

207
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,166
It's been far too long,
Your Highness!

208
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,041
Right.

209
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,791
Where is Lord Guilford?

210
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,250
Uh! Well...

211
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,333
Cornelia, I'm afraid Lord
Guilford was caught in the--

212
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,500
[KANON]
He went missing after

213
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,041
he launched the
F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

214
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,416
It was his heroism
that saved all of us.

215
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,000
[CORNELIA]
Guilford?!

216
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,083
[SCHNEIZEL] We may not
know if he's alive or dead,

217
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,666
but he did a great deed.

218
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,250
You should be proud of him. He
served you well as your knight.

219
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,666
What are you saying?!

220
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,791
I'm the one who fired
the F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

221
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,791
[CORNELIA, KANON gasp]

222
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,083
[SUZAKU]
That was my deed of honor!

223
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,250
The feat I needed to
become the Knight of One!

224
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,875
[GINO]
Hold on, Suzaku...

225
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,000
Is this manipulation designed to
protect Lord Guilford's legacy?

226
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,166
[CORNELIA]
What are you saying?

227
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,916
[SCHNEIZEL]
I suggest you stop, Suzaku.

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,083
[SUZAKU]
No. I've been naive up till now.

229
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,125
[LLOYD]
No, you?

230
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,458
[SUZAKU]
Stubbornly maintaining that

231
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,583
the means are more important
than the end result.

232
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,875
I was idealistic and
self-righteous.

233
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,375
[SCHNEIZEL]
Perhaps, but...

234
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,708
In any case, I insist on what
is due me, Your Highness.

235
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,333
Make me the Knight of One.

236
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,375
Huh?

237
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,875
You've crossed the line into
insubordination, Kururugi!

238
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,333
Anyway, only an Emperor has
the power to dub a warrior

239
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:01,958
the Knight of One.
Which means...

240
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,125
Which means...
I shall rise to this.

241
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,375
[ALL]
Huh?!

242
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,750
Brother!

243
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,916
If I become the emperor,
it will remove the problem;

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,250
it's really as simple as that.

245
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,416
Highness, what you said
just now is close--

246
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Gino.

247
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,083
[GINO]
What are you planning to do?!

248
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,166
Prince Schneizel, can
you please tell us all

249
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,958
what has lead you
to make this decision?

250
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,333
He considers our affairs
"trivial" and " mundane."

251
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:21,916
[CORNELIA gasps]

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,125
[GINO gasps]

253
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,375
[SCHNEIZEL]
That's how His Majesty referred

254
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,750
to our mortal struggle
with the Black Knights.

255
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:27,625
But...

256
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,500
You've seen it too, Cornelia.

257
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,291
How absorbed Father is with
his dangerous research.

258
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,958
How he abandons the throne.

259
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,541
It's true.

260
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,916
He treats diplomacy and war like
they were meaningless trifles.

261
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,791
A man who's lost interest in
this world who sees his people

262
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,458
locked in a life and
death struggle,

263
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,208
and shrugs in indifference,
such a man has no right to rule!

264
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,625
[KANON] He's finally
made up his mind. But...

265
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,833
Could it be? A coup d'état?!

266
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,625
That's wrong...

267
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,000
[SUZAKU] Your Highness,
as a Knight of the Round,

268
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,416
I can arrange an audience
with the Emperor.

269
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
Please give me the order
to assassinate him.

270
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,541
Suzaku!

271
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,666
[SUZAKU] If I'm predestined
to be a killer, then so be it.

272
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,625
Gino, I know what I am and what
I must do. What matters...

273
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,166
are results!

274
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,041
[KAGUYA] Now then, Your Majesty,
as we previously arranged,

275
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,458
I'll conduct negotiations

276
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,625
with Prime Minister
Schneizel in Tokyo.

277
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,208
But, Kaguya. After all,
Zero was your husband.

278
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,291
Losing Master Zero is a
terrible blow it's true...

279
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,375
But we can't dwell on that
when our nations are in danger.

280
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,916
We must turn his death
to our best advantage.

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,500
And honestly, I know I
called myself his wife,

282
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,041
but he and I were just...

283
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,958
That is, in the end, we were
married, but, in heart only.

284
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,708
[SUZAKU] His Majesty has
landed on Kamine Island?

285
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:44,875
[RADIO GUY B]
Yes, my lord,

286
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,041
along with an unknown
group of subjects.

287
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,583
[SUZAKU] Unknown group...
Survivors of the Geass Order?

288
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,708
Are you serious about
sending Suzaku

289
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,375
to assassinate your own father?

290
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:58,625
Gino, do you want this war to
remain in a stalemate forever?

291
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,666
What do you mean?

292
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,833
The true nature
of people is this:

293
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,291
they want to be controlled.

294
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,958
By their nation, their
religion, their traditions,

295
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,625
and by figures of
grand authority.

296
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,083
Above all, the Emperor of
Britannia must play his part.

297
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,875
[GINO] So now you're the one to
play that part, Your Highness?

298
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,625
The grand authority?

299
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,166
If I am called upon to
do it, then perhaps...

300
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,041
Perhaps? How so?

301
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,875
Did you know that
the word "authority"

302
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,041
actually has another meaning?

303
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,250
[PRIEST A groaning]

304
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,458
Was this treason
Schneizel's idea?

305
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,333
It was my decision.

306
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,958
Majesty, I appreciate
your patronage,

307
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,583
that cannot be questioned.

308
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,458
But, you are guilty
of two crimes!

309
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,000
[EMPEROR]
Oh?

310
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,416
[SUZAKU] First, abandoning your
responsibilities as Emperor.

311
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,958
And second...

312
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,958
...dirtying your hands
with the power of Geass!

313
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,958
Is that a capital crime?

314
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,375
[SUZAKU] Geass takes good
men and bends them to evil.

315
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,875
You knew that.

316
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,083
You could have saved Euphy.
It would have been so easy.

317
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,791
But instead you abandoned her!

318
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,000
[EMPEROR]
So what?

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,458
You also drove Lelouch
and Nunnally away;

320
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,583
their despair is in this sword.

321
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,708
Die!

322
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,208
Lord Waldstein! What
are you doing here?

323
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,750
Did you think you were the only
one who knew about Geass?

324
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,291
It takes many forms.

325
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,750
Who could be foolish
enough to relax his guard

326
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,333
with a man who constantly
betrays everyone who trusts him.

327
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,333
Bismarck, I leave this
mundane matter to you.

328
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,291
Yes, Your Majesty, so be it.

329
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,375
Hold on!

330
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,333
[HONG GU] Ohgi? This is Hong Gu.
Requesting landing clearance.

331
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,916
We've brought Her Majesty
and Lady Kaguya with us.

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,375
[OHGI]
Uh, right.

333
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,250
Uh. Then I'll contact
Schneizel's staff as well.

334
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,166
[DIETHARD] I thought Ohgi had
finally changed a bit, but no.

335
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,375
Definitely miscast.

336
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,166
His true nature is
to be defensive.

337
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,416
[SUZAKU] No. The Geass command
that compels me to live.

338
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,541
It's screaming at
me to run away!

339
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,541
Is the Knight of One really
that dangerous an opponent?!

340
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,250
I've left my weakness!

341
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,291
[BISMARCK] "Weakness?" Fool,
what you call "weakness"...

342
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,541
[SUZAKU groans]

343
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,208
[BISMARCK] That was the
source of your strength.

344
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,833
Gentleness and compassion
are what drove you!

345
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,208
Take those away and there's
nothing left but violence.

346
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,000
Which means...

347
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,250
[SUZAKU growing]

348
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,333
[BISMARCK] You will die here,
Suzaku Kururugi!

349
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,833
--[explosion]
--[BISMARCK] Huh?!

350
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,791
My name is Lelouch vi Britannia!

351
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,250
I am the eldest son
of Empress Marianne!

352
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,958
The prince who was
abandoned by his empire!

353
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,041
[CHARLY COMMANDER]
We can't contact His Majesty!

354
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,708
If you encounter
anyone suspicious,

355
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,250
don't capture them, kill them!

356
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,958
[CHARLY PILOT]
Yes, my lord!

357
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,791
What are you doing?!

358
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,208
Why are you shooting at-- Ah!

359
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,208
[MONICA] Why are we
attacking our own forces?!

360
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,333
[CHARLY OP A]
We're still confirming,

361
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,666
but we can't contact
gun turret room 3!

362
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,166
[CHARLY OP B] Someone may have
seized the weapons system!

363
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,791
[CHARLY GUARD A]
Respond! Turret room 3!

364
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,416
If you do not respond now,
we will remove you by force!

365
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,875
[CHARLY GUARD B]
Follow us, the royal guard!

366
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,083
We'll eliminate all enemies!

367
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,708
[CHARLY SOLDIER]
Yes, my lord!

368
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,375
Uh!

369
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,000
[CHARLY OP C] The reinforcements
from the Shikine Island base

370
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,458
are attacking us!

371
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,666
[CHARLY OP D] We're getting
reports of our own guards

372
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,375
turning on us as well!

373
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,416
[MONICA]
This is...

374
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,791
A damned rebellion!

375
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,708
[CHARLY OP E] Yes, my lord!
Where is the Emperor?

376
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:32,166
His Majesty is in the safest
possible place. For now, we...

377
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,375
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch! It's my burden!

378
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,916
[SUZAKU grunting]
Ah!

379
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,333
Who is in command aboard
the Great Britannia now?!

380
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,875
[CHARLY OP E]
Lady Monica Krushevsky,

381
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,625
the honorable Knight of 12.

382
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,791
[BISMARCK] Very well! In that
case, I'm taking the Galahad!

383
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,291
[KANON] You still can't
contact the Mordred?

384
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,625
[RADIO A]
No, my lord.

385
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,500
Although I think she's
headed for Kamine Island.

386
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,916
[SCHNEIZEL]
I see.

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,833
That means she must have
just received the intelligence

388
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,083
and is on her way
to His Majesty.

389
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:07,416
[SCHNEIZEL] Along with
Suzaku? No, this is...

390
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,166
[SCHNEIZEL]
My apologies, Lady Kaguya.

391
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,625
The meeting will have
to be postponed.

392
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,583
We need to go to
Kamine Island at once.

393
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,833
[KAGUYA] I see. Then we
shall go with you, as well.

394
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,166
[gasps]

395
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,583
[KAGUYA] There's only
one person I can think of

396
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,416
who would be attacking
the Britannian emperor

397
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,666
in this situation.

398
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,375
I believe we all
know who that is.

399
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,166
I agree, Lady Kaguya.

400
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,458
That changes things.

401
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,250
We have a few points to
verify before we go on.

402
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,583
We can continue the meeting once
this matter has been settled.

403
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,416
[LELOUCH] If anyone wishes
to stop me, let them try!

404
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,875
If there's anyone who can
go beyond my despair!

405
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,750
[BISMARCK]
Our own forces turning on us.

406
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,125
I can't tell friend from foe,

407
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,916
and I can't just
destroy them all. Hm?

408
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,166
[BISMARCK]
Anya!

409
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,458
Surely you aren't
part of this, too?

410
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,625
[ANYA]
So, the Knight of One

411
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,750
is behind this traitorous
coup d'etat?!

412
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,791
What's that?!

413
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:05,125
[EMPEROR laughs]

414
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,666
[BISMARCK]
Don't jump to conclusions!

415
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,541
[ANYA]
How can I trust you?!

416
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,416
[BISMARCK] The enemy
is from Shikine Island!

417
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,041
Monica can testify to it!

418
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,583
I understand now.
Forgive me, Lord Bismark.

419
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,708
All I ask of you is
your recognition.

420
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,416
How damaged is your knightmare?

421
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,458
[ANYA] My air combat
mobility is dropping,

422
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,541
but perhaps I can intercept the
rebel forces on the ground.

423
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,000
[BISMARCK] Understood. I'll
defend the royal flagship.

424
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,833
You're quite the actress,
aren't you?

425
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,958
We don't have time to explain
things to Bismarck right now.

426
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,208
Since I questioned his loyalty,
he didn't question mine.

427
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,000
Putting him on the defensive.
That's just the sort of "flash"

428
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,125
I'd expect from
Marianne the Flash.

429
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,583
And it's just perfect
for Lelouch's mother.

430
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,250
So, what comes next?

431
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,458
[C.C.]
Hm?

432
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,000
[ANYA] Well, we have
to save him, don't we?

433
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,125
God! Hear me now!

434
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,166
The time has come
to settle this!

435
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,833
[LELOUCH]
You're wrong.

436
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,666
[LELOUCH] You lift your
voice to call upon God,

437
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,958
but it's not God you need
to settle things with,

438
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,750
Charles zi Britannia...

439
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,875
It's me... your son!

440
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,916
And how will you
challenge me?

441
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,208
Neither gun, nor sword,
will have any effect on me.

442
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,291
Nor will the power
of your Geass.

443
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,708
Nothing you do can kill me!

444
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,666
[LELOUCH]
But I don't need to kill you.

445
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,500
By coming to this
parallel realm,

446
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,666
you've already
ensured my victory.

447
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,708
[EMPEROR]
Huh?

448
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,625
[EMPEROR gasps]

449
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,166
[EMPEROR]
You've sealed the exit?!

450
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,125
[LELOUCH] Yes. You, I,
and the power of Geass

451
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,333
are now sealed in
this space together.

452
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,666
And, If you can no longer
interfere with the real world,

453
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,791
then all your plans will
be meaningless in the end.

454
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,708
May as well be dead!

455
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,666
Lelouch!

456
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,416
[LELOUCH] This system which you
created has become a prison

457
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,166
which now holds your
own soul captive!

458
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,833
Now, let us repent! Suffering
together for all eternity!

459
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:57,166
[LELOUCH] Now I see. Perhaps
I did choose the wrong path.

460
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,416
Perhaps Suzaku was
right all along.

461
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,708
It's the means that
are important.

462
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,583
But I can't back down now.

463
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:07,375
For Euphy and Shirley.
Nunnally, and Rolo.

464
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,833
That's right. I must face him!

465
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,791
I have to wager everything
I am against this man!

466
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,291
Charles, the Emperor
of Britannia!

467
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,500
It doesn't matter what
happens to me in the end,

468
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,125
but I must win!
