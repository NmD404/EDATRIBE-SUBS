00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,500
[C.C.]
The young Britannian, Lelouch,

2
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:23,083
is faced with a choice
between two divergent paths.

3
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:27,333
One leads to the past in a quest
to find his mother's enemies.

4
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,500
The other way
takes him to the future

5
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,041
where he will
create a world in which

6
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,416
his little sister, Nunnally,
can live happily.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,041
Only Lelouch can choose
which direction he will go...

8
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,791
Will he follow
the path that ends

9
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,708
in destruction of the world?

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,458
Or will he travel the road
to building a bright new one?

11
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,333
[INOUE] We used to
have trouble getting

12
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,041
even a single motorcycle.

13
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,708
Now we have a submarine.

14
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,291
The military district
of India will be in big trouble

15
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,500
if the Britannians
ever find out.

16
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,000
How'd she do it?

17
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,541
[ZERO] Now then, due to
our recent reorganization,

18
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,458
a few changes have been made.

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,000
Our new Chief
of Military Affairs

20
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,750
will be Kyoshiro Tohdoh.

00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,750
[BLACK KNIGHTS exclaiming]

22
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,458
[ZERO] Taking charge of
all intelligence, espionage,

23
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,083
and public relation matters,
Diethard Reid.

00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:57,916
[BLACK KNIGHTS groaning]

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,500
This Britannian pretty boy?

26
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,583
Not to mention
his media ties.

27
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,250
Zero, I'm not a racist,

28
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,541
but what's your reasoning
for placing one of "them"

29
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,125
in such a sensitive position?

30
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,125
[ZERO]
Reasoning?

31
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,958
And what of me, I ask you?

32
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,666
[ZERO]
I'm not Japanese either.

33
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,083
You all know this.

34
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,833
What matters is the
ability to produce results.

35
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,375
Who you are and where you're
from are of little consequence.

36
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,875
All right, all right already...

37
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,916
[ZERO] My deputy commander
will be Kaname Oghi.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,875
Who, me?

39
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:26,958
[ZERO]
You object?

40
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,208
Uh, no...

41
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,166
Well, you were our
leader to begin with,

42
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,250
weren't you?

43
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,625
A newbie can't
take that job, right?

44
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,125
[ZERO] And for research
and development, Rakshata.

45
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,458
Who else?

46
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,625
[ZERO] Captain of the Zero
Squad, Kallen Kouzuki.

47
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,958
[KALLEN]
The Zero Squad?

48
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,500
[ZERO] An elite guard
under my direct command.

49
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,958
Think of yourselves
as my personal force.

50
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,583
[KALLEN]
An elite guard...

51
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,125
Zero...

52
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,750
[ZERO] Captain of the First
Squad will be Shougo Asahina.

53
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,875
Second Squad, Ryouga Senba.

54
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,291
Third Squad, Kizuna Kagesaki.

55
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,958
[ZERO] And Tamaki will lead
the second special forces.

56
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,708
That is all.

57
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,083
[TAMAKI]
I'm the man!

58
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,333
There's no position for C.C.?

59
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,208
[DIETHARD]
Zero. May I add something?

60
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,625
[ZERO]
Hm?

61
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,833
There's one issue that
still needs to be dealt with.

62
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,375
[NOBLEMAN A] Who cares if
he's an honorary Britannian?

63
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,708
Knighting an Eleven is just...

64
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,791
[NOBLEWOMAN A]
And broadcasting it live...

65
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,666
[NOBLEMAN B] How'd he ever
win her favor, I wonder?

66
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,250
[NOBLEMAN A] Well, even
a princess has needs, right?

67
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,250
[NOBLES laughing]

68
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,041
Are they kidding?!

69
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,500
No, this can't be happening!

70
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,541
They're making him a major!
An Eleven!

Suzaku Kururugi.

72
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,875
Wilt thou, upon this day,
pledge thy fealty to Britannia

73
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,375
and stand as a
Knight of the Crown?

74
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,250
Yes, Your Highness.

75
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,041
[EUPHEMIA] Dost thou wish
to abandon thy self

76
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,458
and be sword and shield for
the sake of the greater good?

77
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,541
[SUZAKU]
Yes, Your Highness.

78
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,875
I, Euphemia li Britannia,

79
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:16,083
do hearby dub thee
Sir Suzaku Kururugi.

80
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,041
[TECH] So whose payroll
is he on now?

81
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,416
[CECILE] I believe Lloyd's
already working on that.

82
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
[TECH]
You mean... with him?

83
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,958
Yes, well, it's not like
I've ever met him, of course.

[DIETHARD]
Suzaku Kururugi.

87
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,000
He's become a focal point
among Elevens

88
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,333
who are Britannian supporters.

89
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,625
I recommend he be assassinated.

90
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,583
[ZERO]
Assassinate him?

91
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,958
He may be right.

92
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,375
You've been the focus
of the resistance movement.

93
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,125
The servile masses
lack such a hero.

94
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,875
[DIETHARD] People aren't
moved by ideology alone.

95
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:31,000
But the Brittanians will hold
this boy up as a symbol.

96
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,125
I think that taking him out

97
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,041
would be the smart
decision right now.

98
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:34,916
[TOHDOH]
I object.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
[DIETHARD]
Hm?

100
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,083
[TOHDOH] The Japanese would be
revolted by such a cowardly act.

101
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,333
Yeah!

102
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,458
And the Black Knights
are not in the business

103
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,791
of killing the
defenseless, either!

104
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,333
What do you want us to do?!

105
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,041
Get him when he's alone,
and kill him straight out?!

106
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,208
Calm down.

107
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,375
I'm merely suggesting
we minimize a risk

108
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,458
in the most efficient
way possible.

109
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,250
But it's Zero's call, of course.

110
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,875
[C.C.]
What's so complicated?

111
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,416
Just use your Geass on Kururugi.

112
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,291
Drop it.

113
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,500
So stubborn...

114
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,041
Why not?
Because he's your friend?

115
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:05,958
Or is it pride?

116
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,916
[LELOUCH gasps]

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,250
All of it.

118
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,041
[C.C.] You might have
to kill him, otherwise...

119
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,291
[EUPHEMIA] You haven't said
anything about it yet.

120
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,208
[CORNELIA] Appointing a knight
is a privilege of royalty.

121
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,166
It's out of my hands,
even as viceroy.

122
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,541
Don't you see? Suzaku Kururugi
is an honorary Britannian,

123
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,375
and he's proved himself more
than worthy of knighthood.

124
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,541
Sister, even you have to--

125
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,625
It's Viceroy.

126
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,041
Viceroy, even you must
know that he's deserving.

00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,916
[CORNELIA] Discrimination
against the Numbers

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,458
is our national policy!

129
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,875
Then it's time I
tried to change that!

00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,500
Oh is it now, Sub Viceroy?

131
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:48,416
Well, when you become Empress,
feel free to do so.

00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,750
[RETAINER]
Yes, Majesty. Your orders?

You needn't interfere.

00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,500
If he's that sure of himself,
let him challenge me.

139

Okay guys, time to raise
a glass to Kururugi here,

00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,500
valued member of the student
council and knight of the realm!

141
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,083
Now let's get this

00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,916

You've Nunnally
to thank for all of this.

I'm sure you've tired

If you don't mind,
we want to honor you too.

Not at all.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,583
It's really kind of you.

149
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,291
Oh... What am I going to do...

150
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,875
Princess Euphemia...

151
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,583
[LLOYD]
Good afternoon!

152
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,458
Have you seen Major Kururugi?

153
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,083
They said I could find him here.

154
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,500
Ooh, looks like you're
working on some fun stuff!

155
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,916
[NINA]
You know what it is?

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,750
[LLOYD] Oh, I can tell a
uranium isotope when I see one.

157
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,458
Wow, you know your stuff!

158
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,250
And if you can get that uranium
to absorb active neutrons,

159
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,916
then it should split
into high speed neutrons,

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,250
and atomic nuclei!

161
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,416
The problem is,

162
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,416
you'd need to fuel
the reaction with U-235,

163
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,416
which only makes up 0.7%
of all natural uranium.

164
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,333
So even if we came up with
some means of inducing fission,

165
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,208
we'd never have
enough raw materials.

166
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,458
That's why...

167
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,208
Hey Prez, where's Nina?

168
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,916
I told her to be here.

169
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:34,833
Oh. Hey, Kallen!

170
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,166
Can you help me
set out more pizza?

171
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,458
Hey, are you listening?

172
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,041
[KALLEN]
This is for Zero, Kallen.

173
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,041
If you don't do it here...

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,958
[gasps]

175
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,916
Hey!

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,291
I think Shirley wants
you to give her a hand.

177
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,708
I'm sorry, but I'm right
in the middle of something

178
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,875
at the moment.

179
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,583
What're you doing?
Maybe I can help out.

180
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,791
[SUZAKU]
Hey.

181
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,416
I'm sorry, I got held up.

182
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,125
Huh?

183
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,458
[SUZAKU]
No problem!

184
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,041
I'm just happy
you could be here.

185
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,916
Hey, what did
you wanna talk about?

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,166
You said it was kind
of important, right?

187
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,708
Oh... yeah, uh...

188
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:17,875
Just forget it.

189
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:18,958
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

190
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,875
[LLOYD]
Bad news, Suzaku!

191
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,666
You just got even more
work to do, I'm afraid.

192
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, right...

193
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,208
You know him?

194
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,416
He's my boss.

195
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,458
[MILLY]
Lloyd, is something wrong?

196
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,291
Oh...

197
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,833
Do you guys know each other?

198
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:32,958
We're to be married.

199
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:33,625
[NINA]
Huh?!

200
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,875
[STUDENTS]
Huh?!

201
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,791
Isn't that right, honey bunch?

202
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,875
Uh... Yeah...

203
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,000
Secret's out.

204
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:40,916
So you knew?

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,041
Mhm.

206
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:44,625
Whoa! Whoa!

207
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,875
What's goin' on here?!

208
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:46,958
Who is this guy?

209
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,166
[MILLY]
Earl Asplund.

210
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,416
Earl?!

211
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,833
It's an honor,
Your Lordship.

212
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,833
Now, what did you say your
relationship was again?

213
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,125
She and I are betrothed.

214
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,208
No!

215
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,791
You were serious then?

216
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,375
So do I have
military duties, then?

217
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,791
Yes.

218
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,791
An important someone-or-other
is arriving by boat.

219
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,083
We're off to meet him.

220
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,416
Along with the Lancelot,

221
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,791
and Princess Euphemia,
naturally.

222
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,791
[STUDENTS gasping, squealing]

223
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,291
[SUZAKU]
Why Shikine Island?

224
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,625
The Tokyo Settlement
would've been a lot safer.

225
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,208
[CECILE] Yes, I'm curious
about that myself.

226
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,291
[SUZAKU]
Wha--?!

227
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,791
You're saying you
don't know either?

228
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,375
Ditto.

229
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,541
[SUZAKU]
Huh?!

230
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,166
You still shouldn't
have said anything.

231
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,333
After all, your loose lips got
our plans leaked onto the net.

232
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:38,083
That girl was so charming
though, I couldn't resist.

233
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,833
[ZERO]
Euphemia is going to that island

234
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,041
to meet a noble
from their homeland.

235
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,333
Her knight, Suzaku Kururugi,
will be accompanying her.

236
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,583
That far out at sea, the enemy's
strength will be limited.

237
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,708
It is a golden opportunity.

238
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,833
Our objective is
the capture of the Lancelot

239
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,500
and Suzaku Kururugi.

240
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,666
Once we've won the battle,

241
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,541
I want Kururugi
taken safely into custody.

242
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,666
[TOHDOH sighs]

243
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,208
[TAMAKI] So what happens
after we've got him?

244
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,583
[ZERO] Don't worry.
Just leave that to me.

245
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,875
[RAKSHATA]
That's our spot, huh? 

246
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,333
You suppose it's going to work?

247
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,916
I think we'll be fine.

248
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,166
The stealth effect we get as a
byproduct seems to be working.

249
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,458
How can you tell?

250
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,375
The Britannians haven't
found us, have they?

251
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,583
What's that tell you?

252
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,583
Oh, I see. You're right!

253
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,500
[RAKSHATA] It is just
a first step, though.

254
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,750
[ZERO] Diethard, what did
you talk Kallen into doing?

255
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,083
I told her to dig up
what she could on Kururugi.

256
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,333
Maybe I implied a
little more than that...

257
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,375
[ZERO]
Don't overstep your bounds.

258
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,375
I don't recall ordering
his assassination.

259
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,083
You want us to be the
hammer of justice, right?

260
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,500
We can't have
people thinking of us

261
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,750
as cold-blooded killers, I know.

262
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,083
But we can hide the
truth using the media.

263
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,416
You can't change the world

264
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,708
without getting
your hands dirty.

265
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,458
Am I wrong?

266
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,541
[ZERO]
Diethard...

267
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,416
What are you really after?

268
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,583
You may have been demoted,
but you're still a Britannian.

269
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,458
You don't need to
join the Black Knights

270
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,416
to change the world, do you?

271
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,458
I never mentioned this,

272
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,125
but the first time
I ever saw you

273
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,166
was the night
you rescued Kururugi.

274
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,708
And I trembled!

275
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:18,000
It was like a new era had taken
form and appeared before me!

276
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,041
I wish to document you, Zero,

277
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,000
as you build your organization
and topple over the empire,

278
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,666
then take this world
for your own.

279
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,208
I wish to be there documenting
history as it's created!

280
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,583
Nothing has ever made
my heart dance more!

Documenting?

282
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,541
You're right in the thick of it.

283
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,500
I'd say you're
fabricating history.

284
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,833
Objectivity is a fairy tale.

285
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,958
In the end, journalism is
a product of the human mind,

00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,875

We've prepared a room
for you back at headquarters,

00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,250

292
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,000
Is it safe to assume
that the ship is docking here?

293
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,750
[DEFENSE UNIT CAPT]
Yes, that hasn't changed.

00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,333
This will do fine, then.

What the...?!

351
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,500
It's frozen?

352
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,625
No good!

353
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,250
[ZERO]
We need to talk, Kururugi.

354
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,250
[ZERO]
I suggest you come out.

355
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,041
Your secondary systems should
still be functioning.

356
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,125
You'll be treated as a prisoner
under international law.

357
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,916
Of course,
if you don't care to talk,

358
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,916
we could just gun you down.

359
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,791
I don't care!

360
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,125
Tell Suzaku to abandon the unit!

361
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,750
What could possibly
be wrong with it?

362
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,000
How come it won't move?

363
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,500
Something's happened
to the Sakuradite

364
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,458
that's powering
Suzaku's Lancelot.

365
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,166
Somebody is interfering with it!

366
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,875
[LLOYD]
A Gefjun Disturber.

367
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,250
You mean...

368
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,000
But they're actually
using it as a jamming mechanism.

369
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,500
I thought it only theoretical.
What a fool I am.

370
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,791
It really is you, Rakshata.

371
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,416
It's looks like
the range and endurance

372
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,375
still need a little work.

373
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,708
[ZERO] I'll get straight to
the point, Suzaku Kururugi.

374
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,208
I want you to join me.

375
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,208
[SUZAKU]
Is that a threat?

376
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,916
Well you can forget it.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,541
I already told you.

378
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,458
Results gained through
contemptable means

379
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,875
are worthless to me.

380
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,250
[ZERO] So you wouldn't
describe the peace we have now

381
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,458
as worthless?

382
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,833
[SUZAKU gasps]

383
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,333
[ZERO] If Japan had resisted
to its very last breath

384
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,666
seven years ago,

385
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,333
what do you think
would have happened?

386
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,375
The Chinese and the E.U.
would have stepped in,

387
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,416
and split Japan in three.

388
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,625
They'd be fighting even now.

389
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,375
Our current peace is the result

390
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,583
of Japan's immediate and
unconditional surrender.

391
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,500
That's right.

392
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,958
And I've been fighting to
preserve my father's peace,

393
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,541
ever since it began!

394
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,833
[ZERO]
You're wrong.

395
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,875
Prime Minister Kururugi,
elected by the people,

396
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,541
didn't choose surrender.

397
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,708
That decision was selfishly
made by his killer.

398
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,166
[SUZAKU gasps]

399
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,125
[ZERO] With the government
thrown into chaos,

400
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,375
surrender became
the only logical choice.

401
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,333
The will of the people
was stolen from them

402
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:38,000
by a lone criminal pursuing
his own selfish agenda!

403
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,375
Can you hear them at all?

404
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,375
[CECILE] There's too much
static on the mic!

405
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,125
H-How on earth
do you know that?

406
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,666
[ZERO] There's only
one way for you to atone now.

407
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,458
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

408
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,833
[ZERO]
Present the Japanese people

409
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,625
with the choice they
weren't able to make then.

410
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,500
The path they were robbed
of seven years ago...

411
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,791
Fighting Britannia.

412
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,500
Fighting them? That again?

413
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,708
[ZERO] It's an option
worth exploring.

414
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,500
Or would you rather
drive the masses

415
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,458
towards a future dictated
by your own egotism?

416
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,166
You call that peace?

417
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,583
[radio static]

418
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,000
[FAYER]
...Major Kururugi?

419
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,375
Please respond!

420
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,083
May I?

421
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,375
[ZERO]
As you wish.

422
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,958
[FAYER]
This is Lt. Col. Fayer,

423
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,916
commander here
on Shikine Island!

424
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,750
We're launching
surface to surface missiles

425
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,791
against the terrorists!

426
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,750
Major Kururugi, your
orders are to keep Zero there!

427
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,625
[ZERO]
They're giving him up to die!

428
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,083
[ZERO]
Kururugi, what're you...?!

429
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,083
[SUZAKU] I can't approve
of your methods!

430
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,750
All I can do right now is this!

431
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,083
Why you little--!

432
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,916
[TOHDOH] Don't move!
The field'll affect you too!

433
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,208
But Zero!

434
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,458
[DEFENSE UNIT CAPT]
We're assigning Portman here

435
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,500
to escort them.

436
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,583
The Sub-Viceroy should be--

437
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,875
[EUPHEMIA]
Wait!

438
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,125
[LLOYD] You're going
to destroy the Lancelot?!

439
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,375
[DEFENSE UNIT CAPT]
Kururugi is holding Zero there.

440
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,375
This is our chance to kill him!

441
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,250
And whose idea was this?

442
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,666
Major Kururugi's
my personal knight!

443
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,833
It was a para-level one order.

444
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,041
It can only be countermanded
by the consensus

445
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,958
of at least
three ranking generals

446
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,875
or the Viceroy herself,
I'm afraid.

447
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,625
Then who exactly
issued this order, Captain?

448
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,458
Get me a line
to them immediately!

449
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,958
Para-level one order,
Princess Euphemia.

450
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,833
[EUPHEMIA]
Out of my way!

451
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,083
[DEFENSE UNIT CAPT]
Sub-Viceroy!

452
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,583
Contact the base!

453
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,958
Tell them there's a chance
I'll be caught in the attack!

454
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,083
See if they'll initiate
their launch then!

455
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,041
[DEFENSE UNIT CAPT]
Please stop this!

456
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,375
Think what you're doing!

457
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,541
But they'll stop with
the princess out there...

458
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,083
I'm not sure
they will, unfortunately.

459
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,750
[CHIBA]
Incoming missiles confirmed!

460
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,000
Damn!

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,750
Hold on! I'm coming!

462
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,791
Dammit!

463
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,291
[ZERO]
You're gonna die here as well!

464
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,291
You don't have a
problem with that?!

465
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,833
[FAYER] Your sacrifice
isn't in vain, Major!

466
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,375
We're about to put an end

467
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,250
to the most dangerous criminal
our homeland has ever known.

468
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,250
They'll speak of your
bravery for generations to come!

469
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,333
[ZERO]
Shut up!

470
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,958
All Knightmares,
target on those missiles

471
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,583
and throw up a barrage!

472
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,666
Empty your guns if you have to!

473
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,041
[KALLEN]
Suzaku, let Zero go!

474
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,458
It's me... Suzaku!

475
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,916
It's Kallen Stadtfeld,
from the student council!

476
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,541
Look at me!

477
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,750
[EUPHEMIA]
Suzaku... You can't die now!

478
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:28,541
[SUZAKU] A soldier must
always follow his orders!

479
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,041
[ZERO] Certainly easier
than following your own heart!

480
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,625
How do you feel about this?!

481
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,833
[SUZAKU]
You're wrong!

482
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,083
I have rules that I made
and need to live by!

483
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,541
[KALLEN gasps]

484
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,791
They completed a float system?

485
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,541
Well I'm not done...

486
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,583
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

487
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,458
[EUPHEMIA]
That's... my brother's Avalon!

488
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,541
No, it can't be!

489
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,500
[ZERO] Damn it, Suzaku! Do
something! You're going to die!

490
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,291
[SUZAKU] Better that
than breaking the rules!

491
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,250
[ZERO] 
You stubborn fool!

492
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,250
[LELOUCH] My Geass is
the power to command others.

493
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,375
None can disobey...

494
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,916
Those I turn it on

495
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,583
find their ethics, their
thoughts, and their feelings

496
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,041
crushed beneath its power.

497
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:22,500
And knowing all of that,
I use it... on Suzaku.
