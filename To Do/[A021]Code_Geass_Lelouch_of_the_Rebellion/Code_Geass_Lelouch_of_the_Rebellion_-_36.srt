1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,333
[GIRL A] Madam President!
Is she all right?

2
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,833
[GIRL B] I don't get this
Chinese Federation thing!

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,416
[NEWS ANCHOR] We've just
received an update...

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,458
She said that she's sorry, but
she can't buy us any souvenirs.

5
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,875
She's joking about it?

6
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,041
[SHIRLEY]
Thank goodness.

7
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,250
[LELOUCH]
We should make an announcement

8
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,708
so everyone knows she's okay.

9
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,708
[SHIRLEY sighs]
Uh?

10
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,375
Thank you, Lulu.

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,000
You're welcome, Shirley.

12
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:38,708
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

13
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,250
Lelouch, got a minute?

14
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,250
[PA chimes]

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,791
[PA GIRL]
Attention, all students.

16
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,541
This is an emergency update!
We have confirmation that Milly,

17
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,083
our student council
president, is all right!

18
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,291
She's apparently escaped from
the scene of the coup d'état

19
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,208
in the Chinese Federation
under the protection

20
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,083
of Knight of Seven,
Sir Suzaku Kururug.

21
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,166
[ROLO]
Aren't you getting

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,000
a little carried away
with all this?

23
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,791
Oh, does it seem that way
to you? I'm very sorry, Rolo.

24
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,958
[ROLO] You're acting way
too nice to everyone.

25
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,166
[SAYOKO]
But I'm supposed to keep

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,375
his relationships
harmonious.

27
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,791
Those were Zero's
exact orders.

28
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,208
Yes, and of course you're
to follow his orders...

29
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,541
But you're not to exceed
your role as a stand-in.

30
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,375
Remember, he's very
self-absorbed.

31
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,041
Yes, I see your point.

32
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,291
After all...

33
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,083
I'm a woman who serves
both Lelouch and Zero.

34
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,458
[VILLETTA] Sayoko, Zero
is in danger right now.

35
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:26,375
[gasps]

36
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,375
[SAYOKO]
He's in a stalemate

37
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,041
with the Chinese
Federation, right?

38
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,250
[VILLETTA]
Yes,

39
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,500
and Prince Schneizel
just joined the battle.

40
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:34,041
[ROLO] Uh! Britannian
forces inside of China?!

41
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,458
[VILLETTA]
That's right.

42
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,250
The Knights of the Round
have entered the battle zone.

43
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,291
[TAMAKI] Our reinforcements
aren't coming! What the--?

44
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,625
[OHGI]
Calm down, Tamaki!

45
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,666
We still have the Chinese
Empress as a captive!

46
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,625
They can't just
start shooting at us!

47
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,958
--[explosion]
--[ALL gasping]

48
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,041
[DIETHARD]
What is it?!

49
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,750
[ZERO]
Full scale bombardment.

50
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,166
But that means--

51
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,916
[ZERO] Yes. The Chinese
Federation intends to obliterate

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,541
the Mausoleum of Eighty Eight
Emperors and us along with it!

53
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:03,416
As for the Empress,
they want her to die.

54
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,625
[XING-KE]
The High eunuchs.

55
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,666
They'd violate this
sacred Masoleum

56
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,250
for their petty ambitions?!

57
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,958
All forces, cease fire!
Her Imperial Empress is inside!

58
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,541
[ZHAO HAO] You still don't
understand, do you, Xing-ke?

59
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,833
Generation upon generation
of emperors are buried there.

60
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,375
[XIA WANG]
In short, it's a grave.

61
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,750
A good place to bury
our current empress.

62
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,583
We've already arranged for a
new empress to replace her.

63
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,208
A puppet bride who would
nicely match Prince Odysseus

64
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,666
on their wedding photo.

65
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,583
[XING-KE gasps]
You dare to say this?!

66
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,125
You're the one?

67
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,666
The guy who started
the coup de etat.

68
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,291
[XING-KE]
Stand aside, Britannian!

69
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,375
This concerns my country alone!

70
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,958
[GINO] But, those guys
represent your country,

71
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,875
internationally speaking.

72
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,416
[XING-KE growls]

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,625
[GINO]
Besides...

74
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,125
You captured the Guren,
isn't that right?

75
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,500
I happen to have a bit
of unfinished business

76
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,000
with that Knightmare
and its pilot.

77
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,500
[TOHDOH] Remember,
our air power's limited!

78
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,333
Ride with honor,
and strike like steel.

79
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,416
[BOTH]
Roger!

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,750
[C.C.]
I'll go out in the Akatsuki.

81
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,458
[ZERO]
C.C.

82
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,791
[C.C. gasps]

83
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,208
[LELOUCH] In case we lose,
have an escape route.

84
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,833
If you come up with a smart
trick, I won't need one.

85
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,416
Second enemy air raid
squadron, coming in fast!

86
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,708
[MINASE] We're not gonna
hold out long against this!

87
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,833
[TOHDOH] Stand aside!
I am Kyoshiro Tohdoh!

88
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,416
What do you know?

89
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,750
They actually brought in someone
good aside from that Guren girl.

90
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,416
[SUZAKU]
Gino. Leave him to me!

91
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,375
[TOHDOH grunts]
Suzaku!

92
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,708
We really could go
down this time.

93
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:19,000
They've got the Lancelot and
those next generation units...

94
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,958
The Mordred is here!
They're all closing in on us!

95
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,833
All rebel forces,
annihilate them.

96
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,041
Split into three groups!
Surround her and fire!

97
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,416
[ANYA]
Your shells... Useless...

98
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,375
[XING-KE] If I can get
inside her shields...!

99
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,250
Oh, no! I'm leading
the dance at this party!

100
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,291
[XING-KE]
What?!

101
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:43,458
[XING-KE grunts]

102
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,916
[EMPRESS whimpers]

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,708
A single shot from the Mordred's
Stark Hadron cannon

104
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,541
would demolish the
mausoleum, wouldn't it?

105
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,833
[LLOYD] Well, yes, if you
just want to crush them.

106
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,125
[KANON]
And the moment we did that,

107
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,958
they'd say we killed
their empress.

108
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,833
We have to let the High Eunuchs
make that last, mortal blow.

109
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,875
Ah.

110
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,750
So you admit you're outmatched?

111
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,541
Well, we won't accept your
surrender. It's too late now!

112
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,250
[ZERO]
You insist on fighting?

113
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,541
Even though your own empress
will die in the attack!

114
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,791
[ZHAO HAO]
The empress is merely a system.

115
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,916
[XIA WANG] There are plenty
of others to replace her.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,333
So you can't use her
as a bargaining chip.

117
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,583
[ZERO]
But you used her

118
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,750
to gain noble titles in
the Britannian court.

119
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,416
[ZHAO HAO laughs]
You have sharp ears, don't you?

120
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
[XIA WANG]
A cheap price to pay for power.

121
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,041
[ZERO]
Cheap? A phony treaty

122
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,250
that gives China's land
to a foreign nation?

123
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,458
[ZHAO HAO] Land is nothing
but dirt, after all.

124
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,791
[XIA WANG]
Correct.

125
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,333
We're Britannian noblemen
now, that's what counts.

126
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,708
[LELOUCH] And what
about the common people

127
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,083
you've sworn to protect?!

128
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,000
[ZHAO HAO] Zero, when you
walk down the street,

129
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,208
do you worry about
stepping on the ants?

130
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,208
[CHENG ZHONG] You throw away
the paper that clings to your

131
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,208
bottom, don't you?
It's the same thing!

132
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,916
[ZERO] You sell out your
country, abandon your empress,

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,041
betray your own people,
and all for what?!

134
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,625
[ZHAO HAO]
Ha, an idealist!

135
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,791
I never thought you
were so naive, Zero.

136
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,750
[XIA WANG] Indeed, masters and
commoners will always breed.

137
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,958
[CHENG ZHONG]
Like insects.

138
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,000
[ZHAO HAO, XIA WANG laugh]

139
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,958
Radiant shield generators
two and five are off-line!

140
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,291
That leaves the deck exposed!

141
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,500
[FUTABA]
Ah!

142
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,666
Stop it!

143
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,541
[KAGUYA]
Your Majesty!

144
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,625
[ZERO]
Noblemen? You're bureaucrats,

145
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,291
paper-pushers who know nothing
about noblesse oblige!

146
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,333
Please, stop it. You have
to stop all this fighting!

147
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,833
[GUARD A]
You can't go out there now!

148
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,208
I have to! Out of my way!
I have to go after the Empress!

149
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,666

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,416
What?! My wing!

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,708
You let yourself get distracted.

153
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,708
This is wrong!
All of it! All of it!

154
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,875
Do it now.
Fire on the Empress!

155
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,833
[CHINESE SOLDIERS]
We hear and obey!

156
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,125
[XING-KE growls]

157
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,291
[XING-KE] Hang on, Shen Hu!
My life is yours.

158
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:50,500
Take it if you must,
but save the Empress!

[EMPRESS yelps]

160
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,333
[XING-KE grunts]

161
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,166
Run away, Your Majesty! Go, now!

162
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,625
[EMPRESS gasps]
Xing-ke?

163
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,416
[XING-KE] You finally made
it outside of the city,

164
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,125
but you haven't seen
any of the world yet!

165
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,791
I will defend you here!

166
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,083
But, without you it's
no good, Xing-ke.

167
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,583
It has to be you and I
together! It has to be!

168
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,125
[XING-KE]
Uh?

169
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,916
Your words are wasted on me,
Your Majesty. However...

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,541
[ZHAO HAO]
Intensify the attack!

171
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,583
Don't stop till you've
crushed the Shen Hu!

172
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:21,500
[HONG]
Scum! It can't end like this!

173
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,291
[XING-KE]
I can't save you, after all.

174
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,916
Can't protect you.
For six years,

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,375
everything I've done has been
to fulfill my promise to you.

176
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,583
Someone do it!
I don't care who!

177
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,625
But, please, someone save her!

178
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,416
[ZERO]
Very well. I understand.

179
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,000
Wish is granted.

180
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:40,875
[XING-KE grunts]

181
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,958
Uh! What is that Knightmare?!

182
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,250
It's not only protecting the
Empress, but Xing-ke as well!

183
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,541
[LELOUCH] I ask this of
the Chinese Federation

184
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,625
and the Britannians.
If you want to keep fighting,

185
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,708
are you prepared for
the consequences?

186
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,208
[SUZAKU] Zero? He's come
to the front line himself?

187
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,208
Zero?

188
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,541
But why would he...?

189
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,541
Why are you stopping?!
All units, wipe them out!

190
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,791
So be it!

191
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,416
I gave you your chance,
let no one forget that!

192
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,583
Lloyd, you know what that is!

193
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,666
Yes. We may have lost this one.

194
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,666
Using the Gawain's Druid System
to generate that shield?

195
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,750
I can't believe it.

196
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,791
What kind of scientist
worked it out?

197
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,750
[RAKSHATA]
Knightmare Frame Shinkiro!

198
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,291
Its Absolute Defense
Field is the strongest

199
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,791
protective shield
system in the world.

200
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,791
Ah!

201
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,500
This could be a problem.

202
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,250
[GINO] What are your orders,
Prince Schneizel?

203
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,375
If we fire, the Empress will--

204
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,541
[SCHNEIZEL]
Hmm.

205
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,333
We could just hang back
and wait them out.

206
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,041
There's something
strange about this.

207
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,666
[KANON]
Uh?

208
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,500
[SCHNEIZEL] Why did Zero choose
this time to show up in front.

209
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,208
[ZERO]
How pathetic, Xing-ke.

210
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,291
You were betrayed by
your own countrymen,

211
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,416
and you couldn't even
save one little girl.

212
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,958
Do you get it now?
You need me.

213
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,041
I'm the only ally
you can rely on.

214
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,375
I'll never be subordinate
to you, Zero.

215
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,250
[ZERO]
Subordinate? No.

216
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,583
You have the potential to
lead your entire nation!

217
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,125
They need deliverance.
Your empress.

218
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,708
And all the helpless people
of the Chinese Federation!

219
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,166
They're crying out for it!

220
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,500
[XING-KE]
You think your Knightmare

221
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,583
can turn the tide
of this battle?

222
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,083
Not at all.

223
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,791
The tide of a war is determined
by strategy, not tactics.

224
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,916
[gasps]

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,083
[RADIO ANNOUCER]
Emergency alert!

226
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,000
Riots have broken
out in Shanghai!

227
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,125
Street riots?!

228
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,333
[RIOTERS yelling]

229
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,791
--[BOMBER A] Damn you!
--[BOMBER B] You'll pay for this

230
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,625
They're rioting in Shanghai?

231
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,958
[CHINA DECK B]
It's not just Shanghai.

232
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:16,166
Shou Xian, Beijing, Burma,
Jakarata, Islamabad...

233
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,791
And there are 14 other areas
that we're still confirming.

234
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,583
People are rising up everywhere!

235
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,166
Rebellions breaking
out simultaneously?

236
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,083
Yes, they're broadcasting
a communication

237
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,375
between Zero and
the High Eunuchs.

238
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,625
Communication?

239
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,916
So they were conspiring
without informing us.

240
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,958
Can you run it?

241
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,625
[CECILE]
Yes.

242
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,833
[ZHAO HAO]
The empress is merely a system.

243
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,083
[XIA WANG] There are plenty
of others to replace her.

244
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,625
[ZERO] And what
about the common people

245
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,958
you've sworn to protect?

246
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,583
[ZHAO HAO] Zero, when you
walk down the street,

247
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,833
do you worry about
stepping on the ants?

248
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,791
[XIA WANG] Indeed, masters and
commoners will always breed.

249
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,875
[CHENG ZHONG]
Like insects.

250
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,791
Heh. Thanks to the Empress,

251
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,708
the High Eunuchs are now
firmly cast as the villains.

252
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,791
You mean... you planned
on their betrayal?

253
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,833
He couldn't have caused this;
it's happening too fast.

254
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,875
Unless he made use of someone
else's plan already in place.

255
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,041
[ZERO]
Correct!

256
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,750
I stole another strategy
of yours as well.

257
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,125
We start a coup and
the people rise up!

258
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,458
In other words...

259
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,083
We're not trapped here
without reinforcements!

260
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,875
We do have reinforcements.

261
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:17,416
The starving masses of this
land are backup we needed.

262
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,791
Then we can take
the offensive...

263
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,833
And strike!

264
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,000
The Black Knights are
to be annihilated.

265
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,041
She's just as tough
as I expected.

266

So, that's what you did!

[CHIBA]
Mm? What's that?

Fools!

00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,291
Deploying their ground forces
at this point in the battle?

280
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,791
[BRIT DECK B]
If we bomb them from the air,

281
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:00,833
we'll destroy them.

282
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,250
[SCHNEIZEL]
No, we're withdrawing.

283
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,791
[NINA]
Huh?

284
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,000
Nations aren't dirt and they're
not systems. They're people.

285
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,333
The High Eunuchs have
lost the people's support,

286
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,916
they're no longer qualified
to join us as representatives

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,458
of the Chinese Federation.

288
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,041
[SUZAKU]
Yes, Your Highness.

289
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,833
[FUTABA] The Avalon and
the Knights of the Round

290
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:19,875
are withdrawing!

[OHGI sighs]

292
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,541
[LELOUCH] Yes, I thought
that's what you'd do, Brother.

293
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,958
However...

294
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,291
What do you think the Emperor
would have done Kanon?

295
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,958
Forget it. I was
just musing a bit.

296
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,541
[ZHAO HAO screams]

297
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,500
[XING-KE] So, Prince Schneizel
has abandoned you.

298
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,250
So much for your titles.

299
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,416
Don't hurt us!
We'll give up our power.

300
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,625
Whatever you want!

301
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,666
[XING-KE] Still worried
about your own skin?

--[XING-KE grunting]
--[HIGH EUNUCHS gasping]

Where is Kallen Kouzuki?!

00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,083
[XIANG-LIN sighs]

305
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,833
That's the Guren's pilot.

306
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,375
She was classified as a
P.O.W. and transferred out.

307
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,583
What?!

308
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,708
The High Eunuchs handed
her over as a favor

309
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,750
to the Knight of Seven.

310
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,375
To Suzaku?!

311
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,666
[LELOUCH] So, you're trying to
take everything away from me,

312
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,750
even Kallen. But that's
not going to happen.

313
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,416
I promised that I'd come
for her, and I will.

314
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,875
Nothing will stop me,
not even you.

315
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,416
[BARTLEY]
Where is this place?

316
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,666
I thought we were going to meet
in the Britannian homeland.

317
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,541
And besides, this was by
direct order of the emperor.

318
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,750
[V.V.] Yes. As requested.
In your attempt to recreate

319
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,541
C.C.'s power, you
enhanced Lord Jeremiah.

320
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,083
In light of your 'efforts' I
felt we should call you in.

321
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,416
You see, I need some
final adjustments.

322
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,458
You're really the only
logical choice for this,

323
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,833
and in any case...

324
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,291
You should be pleased;
it's a great honor for you!

325
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,166

Is this all right for you?

Uh. Well...

327
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,250
[XING-KE]
Uh?

328
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,375
I was finally able to leave
the Forbidden City,

329
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:55,333
uh, and now... I mean...

330
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:59,250
This doesn't mean it's
"the end." It's just...

331
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,083
I shall protect you in
the future, as well.

Until the very end of time.

333
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,625
It's so strange. I'm so happy!

334
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,125
I'm so happy, and yet...

335
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,791
[EMPRESS cries]

336
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,458
Zero, we need to let the world
know that the Empress's

337
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,375
betrothal to the
Britannian Prince is off.

338
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,625

That's true.

339
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,000

00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,000
is to have her marry
someone from our side.

341
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,541
A member of a Japanese
family would be perfect.

342
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,708
[EMPRESS]
Uh?!

343
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,375
[LELOUCH]
Hm. That's tastelessly obvious,

344
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,166
but a smart move all the same.

345
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,291
We can have her marry Tohdoh.
Even Tamaki would do.

346
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,208
If you'd like, I can draw up a
list of suitable candidates--

347
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,750
[KAGUYA]
But you mustn't!

348
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,958
Lady Kaguya, this is a political
maneuver, it isn't personal.

349
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,166
You're wrong, it is personal.

350
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,708
It's a simple question of love!

351
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,250
She has a point.

352
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,291
[LELOUCH]
Mm?

353
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,750
We're at war;
lives are at stake!

354
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,541
Hey, you're pushin' it, buddy.

355
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,625
Buddy?! I am a staff officer!

356
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,000
[laughs]

357
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,250
[growls]

358
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,791
[DIETHARD]
Zero, what's your decision?

359
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,083
[KAGUYA] You understand,
Master Zero, don't you?!

360
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,125
[ZERO]
Well...

361
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,208
Zero! Listen,
about yesterday. Hm?

362
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,875
Are you guys still
in conference?

363
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,000
[ZERO]
No, let's go.

364
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,291
[DIETHARD]
Zero! This is vital!

365
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,833
[LELOUCH]
Tamaki's issue is also vital.

366
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,458
I never thought C.C.
would object to this.

367
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,958
I could easily use my Geass

368
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,500
to make Xing-ke and the
others go along with this.

369
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,083
So, what's the problem?

370
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,666
[TAMAKI] Of course, I'm worried
about Kallen, too, y'know.

371
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,958
But, uh I still need you to deal
with my current position here...

372
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,083
If the Black Knights
don't pull together,

373
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,583
we've got problems, right?

374
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,458
But if things stay like this,
I won't get any respect

375
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,250
from the new guys.

376
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,666
[ZERO]
Tamaki...

377
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,583
You get the picture, cause
you're like my best buddy,

378
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,666
aren't ya?!

379
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,416
Uh, Lulu. Do you have a minute?

380
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,833
[LELOUCH]
Yeah, sure, what's up?

381
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,708
Well, it's about Prez's
graduation event, remember?

382
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,375
If I talk about it in class,
Rivalz'll blab to her.

383
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,875
[LELOUCH]
Maybe it's better

384
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,000
just to let her decide for
herself what she wants to do.

385
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,333
[SHIRLEY]
I guess...

386
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,333
Uh, Shirley! Can I
ask you something?

387
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,833
[SHIRLEY]
Mm-hm.

388
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,375
[TAMAKI] Dammit! Every time
ya try to talk to this guy,

389
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,708
he disappears.

390
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,750
The thing is, there's
this couple that just has

391
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,041
to split up, but I can't
convince anyone else.

392
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,750
[SHIRLEY]
Hm. Do they wanna split up?

393
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,500
No, it's a political issue.

394
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:17,500
Uh! I mean, family politics,
y'know their parents and all.

395
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,208
[SHIRLEY]
Then don't!

396
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,458
[LELOUCH]
Don't what?

397
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,000
[SHIRLEY] Don't break them up!
Love is power!

398
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,291
When you love someone,
that has incredible power!

399
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,250
You think about them
all day long.

400
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,625
You write poetry with bad
rhymes, knit mufflers!

401
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,208
You feel like you can fly,
and that's only the beginning!

402
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,416
And I've always felt like-- Uh!

403
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,458
That is... What about you Lulu?

404
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,833
Haven't you ever felt that way
for someone important to you?

405
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,833
[LELOUCH gasps]
She's right. I have.

406
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:48,708
I was trying to recreate the
whole world for Nunnally's sake.

407
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,833
Passion has the power to change
the whole entire world!

408
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,375
That's the truth,
isn't it, Shirley?

409
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,875
Thanks, Shirley. I'm really
glad I talked to you.

410
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,333
Really?! Cause passion's very--

411
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,875
[dial tone]

412
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,333
Ah! He'll never change!
Why do I waste my time?!

413
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,541
[ZERO] Your Majesty!
Your future belongs to you.

414
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,125
You decide your own fate.

415
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,083
Zero...

416
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,583
Oh, I knew you'd understand!

417
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,000
But we need to establish
a position of power!

418
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,375
[ZERO] The human heart is
the source of all our power!

419
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,750
That's why the people rose up
against the High Eunuchs,

420
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,500
and why the Black Knights
fight like titans!

421
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,000
We fight with the power
of our hearts!

422
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,791
Ah, yes, you got that right!

423
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,166
Power of the heart, is that it?

424
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,958
Zero, I'm starting to
see what kind of man

425
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,791
dwells behind that mask.

426
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,541
[ZERO] The path
ahead of us is arduous.

427
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,750
[XING-KE] That's precisely why
tomorrow belongs to us alone!

428
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,791
[SHIRLEY] Hm, Lulu has really
been acting strange lately.

429
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,000
One minute he's his usual self,
the next he's weirdly nice.

430
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,250
Like a completely different p--

431
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,041
[LELOUCH]
Uh!

432
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,458
[SHIRLEY]
Huh? Lulu?

433
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,458
[LELOUCH]
Hi! You need something?

434
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,791
[SHIRLEY]
I told you earlier

435
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,833
I was going to bring back
these gardening books.

436
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,833
Ah, of course, that's right.

437
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,000
[SAYOKO]
This isn't good.

438
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,000
If she sees the panel
before it closes,

439
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,375
she'll know about the
underground control center!

440
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,166
What's up? Are you hiding
something there?

441
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,541
[SAYOKO] I can't let her see it!
I've got to stop her!

442
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,125
Shirley!

443
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,208
Lulu?

444
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,250
[SHIRLEY gasps]

445
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,750
[ZERO]
We will find Kallen,

446
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,250
but I need to return
to Area 11 first.

447
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,750
[C.C.]
And the Chinese Federation?

448
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,041
[LELOUCH] There are still some
opposing factions there...

449
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,208
but they'll be no match
for Xing-ke and Tohdoh

450
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,625
now that the people
are on our side.

451
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,500
Besides you want to see it, too.
The power of the human heart.

452
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,625
[C.C.]
The little devil grows up, huh?

453
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,583
And you're still a witch.

454
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,791
In any case, this gets
us back on track

455
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,583
so we can hit them at
their deepest level.

456
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,458
[C.C.]
The religious order?

457
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,708
[LELOUCH] The ones that
are trying to create warriors

458
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,750
with the Geass power.
If we can control the order,

459
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,583
then I can surpass the
emperor in terms of Geass.

460
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,916
[C.C.] However, the very
existence of the order

461
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,083
has been concealed from
the human world.

462
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,625
They change locations when
a new leader is named,

463
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,833
so it's almost impossible
to track them.

464
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,375
[LELOUCH] But you're
certain they're based

465
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,375
in the Chinese Federation right
now, somewhere within reach?

466
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,041
Yes, according to V.V.,

467
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,833
the one that replaced
me as their leader.

468
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,791
But this is a vast country.

469
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,041
Even that guy Rolo doesn't know
where their base is, right?

470
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,708
So, how are you
going to find it?

471
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,250
[LELOUCH] That's why I took
over the Chinese Federation.

472
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,791
[C.C.]
Hm?

473
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,500
[LELOUCH] The flow of goods,
power supplies, communications:

474
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,458
the order must leave
traces of its existence.

475
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,333
You're using the power of
the whole nation to find them?

476
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,541
[LELOUCH] As you said,
"it's a vast country."

477
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,208
You're to remain here C.C.

478
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,416
If you find any clues
on the order, contact me.

479
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,541
Yes, I understand.

480
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,125
[LELOUCH] This place,
are you sure it's safe?

481
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,125
[ROLO]
It's an O.S.I. facility...

482
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:55,208
Just consider that it may as
well belong to you and I.

483
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,250
Ah!

484
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,083
Welcome home, brother!

485
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,083
It's good to see you, Rolo.
Sayoko, did anything change

486
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,666
while I was away
on this mission?

487
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,083
Nothing of immediate concern.

488
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,750
I noted all the details
in the designated file.

489
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,083
[ROLO] So, you'll be staying
here for quite a while now,

490
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,666
isn't that right, Lelouch?

491
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,875
[LELOUCH] Yes, I have to develop
some effective countermeasures

492
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,583
for the Knights of the Round.
The Lancelot's bad enough,

493
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,833
and we certainly don't need
the Tristan and the Mordred

494
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,416
getting in our way again.

495
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
[ROLO] It would be a pleasure
to back you up in my Vincent.

496
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,166
[LELOUCH sighs] I told you
not to behave like that.

497
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,208
[gasps]

498
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,625
[LELOUCH]
Shirley, are you okay?

499
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:43,458
Look, Lulu about what happened
with us yesterday...

500
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,666
Yesterday?

501
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,208
[gasps]

502
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,041
Morning, Lelouch Lamperouge.

503
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,416
[ROLO gasps]
It's Anya, the Knight of Six!

504
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,541
Hey, we've been
waiting for you!

505
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,333
You're the Vice-President,
right? This is an honor--

506
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,583
[RIVALZ]
Don't be so formal.

507
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,000
[GINO]
Oh, right.

508
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,291
Anyway, we've both just enrolled
here at Ashford. And...

509
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:07,208
While we're here, we insist that
our social status be ignored.

510
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,833
They said they wanted
the experience

511
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,000
of being ordinary students.

512
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,041
So I'm teaching them
how to talk normal.

513
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:16,916
[GINO] I am really lookin'
forward to this... Old Man.

514
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,583
Uh. Right.

515
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,833
[LELOUCH] Gino Weinberg.
Anya Alstreim.

516
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,750
What are they thinking?!
What are they up to?!

517
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,916
The Knights of the Round have
not only come to Ashford,

518
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,666
they've joined the
student council?!

519
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,541
I thought no one but the OSI and
Suzaku would look at me as some

520
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,250
kind of bait to capture C.C...

521
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,500
I doubt this is part of Suzaku's
operation, but the emperor

522
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,958
of Britannia might be feeding
them the information.

523
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:17,041
If they realize I'm Zero,
then Nunnally is in danger!

524
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,333
Somehow, I have to find out what
these two are really up to!
