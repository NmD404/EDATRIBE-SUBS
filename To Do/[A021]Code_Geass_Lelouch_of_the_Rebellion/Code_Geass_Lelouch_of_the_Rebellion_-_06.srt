1
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,791
[RETAINER] Your Majesty,
the remains have arrived.

2
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,041
I was just conversing
with Clovis, actually.

3
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,458
[RETAINER]
Huh?

4
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,750
The project must proceed.
Without a moment's delay.

5
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,541
[STUDENT D] What's an
Eleven doing here?!

6
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,625
[PONY TAIL GIRL]
He was a suspect

7
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,208
in Prince Clovis's murder!

8
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,750
[PIG TAILS GIRL] But the teacher
said the charges were dropped.

9
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,791
[STUDENT D]
He was suspicious enough

10
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,250
to arrest though, right?

11
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,625
You don't really think
he's a terrorist, do you?

12
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,208
[KALLEN]
Um?

13
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,625
Of course he isn't.

14
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,291
The school board would
know something like that.

15
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,583
An Eleven here at school?

16
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,583
He is an honorary Britannian.

17
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,416
I know but still, all the same.

18
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,583
Well, he doesn't look
all that scary to me.

19
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,291
Why don't we just talk
to him, I'm sure he's--

20
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,541
Hey.

21
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,250
The guy just got here,
give him some space.

22
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,416
Seven years since we used
this signal. Long time, huh?

23
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,458
Meeting on the roof
like the old days.

24
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,625
[LELOUCH]
Yeah.

25
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,958
I'm glad you're okay.
I've been worried.

26
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,208
Alive and kicking,
thanks to you.

27
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,583
You almost died...
trying to protect me...

28
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,416
I was just returning the favor.
From seven years ago.

29
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,291
What about the girl?
You know, from the capsule?

30
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,458
I don't really know, we got
seperated during the fray.

31
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,666
But you would know more
about her than I do, right?

32
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,208
No. The only ones
who knew anything

33
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,791
were the inner circle
of the Royal Guard.

34
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,416
I see.

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,458
[SUZAKU] And your name,
do I still call you Lelouch?

36
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,666
[LELOUCH] The records count
my old identity among the dead.

37
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,625
I go by the name
Lelouch Lamperouge now.

38
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,083
[SUZAKU]
Oh.

39
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,125
[LELOUCH]
And you?

40
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,541
What happened at
your court martial?

41
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,958
And why did you
enroll at this school?

42
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,708
I'm as surprised as you are.

43
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,375
What're the odds that we'd
end up at the same school?

44
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,958
Truth is...

45
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,916
...someone arranged for me to
receive a proper investigation.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,583
And that person said that a
17-year-old should be in school.

47
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,708
[EUPHEMIA] Were all of
these painted by Clovis?

48
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,833
[BUTLER]
Yes.

49
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:33,291
Such gentle colors...
Very much akin to my brother.

50
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,041
[OFFICER A] We've successfully
identified the guerillas.

51
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,041
[DALTON]
That's good.

52
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,625
Now all we need
is their hideout.

53
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,541
Get that intel to the viceroy!

54
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,041
[OFFICER B]
Yes, my lord!

55
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,125
What the--?!

56
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,583
Is that Cornelia?!

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,500
Relics of a forgotten age.

58
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,500
[CORNELIA]
Darlton! In here, correct?

59
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,000
[DALTON] Yes, m'lady.
Shall we accompany you?

60
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,791
[CORNELIA] Not for this
level of resistance.

61
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,208
[DALTON]
Understood.

62
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,708
[CORNELIA] Surrender at once,
you feeble-minded Elevens!

63
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,583
[TERRORISTS]
Down with Britannia!

64
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,875
[CORNELIA]
Doesn't seem Zero is here.

65
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,916
No point in going after them
one at a time, I suppose.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,833
Vermin.

67
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,458
Rot like the filth that you are!

68
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,250
Hi, Lelouch. I've returned home.

69
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,791
Hi, there. Welcome
back. Miss Sayoko.

70
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,791
I've got a special
present for you today.

71
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,041
[NUNNALLY]
Really? What could it be?

72
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,291
[SAYAKO]
Huh?

73
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,666
[gasps]

74
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,541
[NUNNALLY]
This hand.

75
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,083
Thank heaven.

76
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,083
I knew it. I just knew
you'd be all right!

77
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,875
It's been a long time, Nunnally.

78
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,333
[NUNNALLY] So tell me, you will
stay the night, won't you?

79
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,375
Suzaku's enrolled as a student
at Ashford Academy now.

80
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,250
So you can see him
anytime you want.

81
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,500
Is that true?!

82
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,458
[SUZAKU] Well, I still
have military duties,

83
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,291
so I can't be here every day.

84
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,125
Oh, you're... you're
still in the military?

85
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,416
Don't worry.

86
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,750
I've been re-assigned
to the engineering corp.

87
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,416
It's a lot less dangerous.

88
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,333
Oh, cool. Engineering, huh?

89
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,333
Oh! Lemme help you!

90
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,791
You just sit down.

91
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,666
Unlike seven years ago,
we get to be your host now.

92
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,583
[SUZAKU]
Uh.

93
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,416
It's funny, you're a lot more
mellow than you used to be.

94
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,333
And you're a bit more rough.

95
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,083
[LELOUCH]
Ha, I suppose.

96
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,416
Hm?

97
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,333
I told you to stay in my room.

98
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,708
That boy out there.

99
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,666
He's the Britannian soldier
from Shinjuku, isn't he?

100
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,625
Is that wise?

101
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:28,291
Don't worry, it's fine. He's...

102
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,333
[C.C.]
Hm?

103
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,916
He's a friend... from the past.

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,958
[GUILFORD]
You're getting out, Jeremiah.

105
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,250
Lord Guilford!

106
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,958
You see I'm innocent,
don't you?!

107
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,541
Well it seems in the eyes of
the court you are anyway.

108
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,666
Orange boy.

109
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,291
Whatever the truth
is, Zero got away.

110
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,958
And you purebloods
let it happen.

111
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,875
You've been demoted
three ranks for failure.

112
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,125
You have two options
to choose from.

113
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,416
Starting over as a pilot,

114
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,125
or cultivating an orange farm.

115
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,250
[gasps]

116
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,708
[LELOUCH]
You should come by again.

117
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,083
Nunnally would enjoy it.

118
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,916
[SUZAKU]
Sure. But...

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,708
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

120
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,041
Lelouch, I...

121
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,083
I don't think we should be
seen together at school.

122
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,291
What do you mean?

123
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,291
Think. How would you explain it?

124
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,958
Being friends with an
honorary Britannian?

125
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:17,958
We have to guard your secret.
No one can know you're royalty.

126
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:18,833
[LELOUCH]
Uh.

127
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,250
And the same goes for Nunnally.

128
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,958
I don't wanna cause
you any trouble--

129
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,500
Doing it again, huh?
Everyone's needs but your own!

130
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,708
[SUZAKU]
Again?

131
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,875
Forget it...

132
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,083
[SUZAKU]
Uh...

133
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,708
Thanks for having me.
It was a lotta fun.

134
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,666
I'll, uh... see you later.

135
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,875
Right.

136
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,875
I'm so glad, ya know?

137
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,083
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

138
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,625
I never thought we'd
get another chance...

139
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,208
...to talk like this.

140
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,458
[STUDENTS chattering]

141
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,666
So, what's the deal?

142
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,791
Something happen to you
yesterday, or what?

143
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,083
Ya didn't even show up
for the council meeting.

144
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,291
You know, I kinda
tanked that history exam.

Please, I don't buy that.

It hasn't made the news yet,

150
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,875
but the "Blood of
the Samurai" faction

151
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,875
was wiped out by Cornelia.

152
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,750
They were the largest group
we had in Central Japan.

153
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:20,416
Look, Zero, it won't be long
till she comes after us.

154
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,791
Just keep your head.
Our chance will come.

too overly familiar...

cut my ties with them.

here? What about class?

we debit has a guy's name on it,

175
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,166
is that okay?

176
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:29,958
[C.C.]
Huh?

177
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,583
Trying to you hide
your mask, huh?

178
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,750
Unlike my Geass, the mask is
a physical piece of evidence.

179
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,875
[knocking]

180
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,250
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

181
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,125
All right, Lelouch. The tea
is ready when you are.

182
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,541
That smell. Hey, did you
ordered pizza again?

183
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,500
I'm racking up reward points.

184
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,291
I'll be right down, okay?

185
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,375
[NUNNALLY]
Lelouch.

186
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,750
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

187
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,500
[NUNNALLY] Maybe you should
cut down on the pizza.

188
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,666
You don't want a blubbery belly.

189
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,958
Just don't touch
or rub it, okay?

190
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,041
[NUNNALLY]
Ooh, scary!

191
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,166
[LELOUCH chuckles]

192
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,000
[CAT yowls]

193
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,291
[C.C.]
Hm?

194
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,791
What the heck?

195
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,291
[LELOUCH] Yeah... I was
wondering if that was going on.

196
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,416
They're just being
cruel to Suzaku.

197
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,416
No. It's just...

198
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,458
These things take time.
People will come around.

199
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,625
Isn't there anything
you can do though?

200
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,666
I mean, he is your friend.

201
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,708
[CAT meows]

202
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,000
[yelps]

203
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,041
[NUNNALLY]
Huh?

204
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,625
[LELOUCH]
Hey! Give that back!

205
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,208
Uh... Lelouch?

206
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:48,916
[CAT meowing]

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,291
[LELOUCH]
A cat...

208
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,500
A... stupid, little cat!
You've gotta be kidding me!

209
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,250
There's no way I'm getting
exposed by a lousy feline!

210
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,208
[C.C.]
Huh?

211
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,458
That wasn't my fault... was it?

212
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,625
I didn't touch or rub anything.

213
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,750
Hmm.

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,458
[NUNNALLY] Yeah, that's right.
I think a cat ran off

215
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,416
with something pretty
important to him.

216
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,791
[MILLY]
Important?

217
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,958
I'm not sure what exactly,

218
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:22,041
but I'm positive it was
something of value to him.

219
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,250
Because... I've never heard
my brother sound like that!

220
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,208
He was completely hysterical!

221
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,291
That's weird.

222
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,125
What could be so
important to the guy?

223
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,333
A love letter?

224
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,291
An embarrassing photo?

225
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,416
Poetry he wrote?

226
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,333
Poetry?

227
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,666
[RIVALZ, MILLY chuckle]

228
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,708
Leave it to us! We'll get
our hands on this thing

229
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,916
before Lelouch has
a chance to blink!

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,583
Just you wait!

231
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,125
[LELOUCH] If I had those
terrorists with me,

232
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,041
we could encircle
the enemy! Maybe Kallen?

233
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,916
No... She's suspicious
of me as it is!

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,791
Get it together.

235
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,958
[BLONDE STUDENT] So anyway,
I told him to buzz off, ya know?

236
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,416
[BRUNETTE STUDENT]
Totally. And then?

237
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
[BLONDE STUDENT]
C'mon, you can guess, can't you!

238
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,208
[BOTH]
Hm?

239
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,458
What's up with that cat?

240
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,041
Is that the mask Zero
wears? Or am I crazy?

241
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,458
[BRUNETTE STUDENT]
No way. Why would it be here?

242
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,916
You two saw it?!

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,041
Forget everything
you've just seen!

244
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,208
[GIRLS]
Sure, no problem at all.

245
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,333
[LELOUCH]
Good.

246
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,375
[MILLY] This is Milly Ashford,
your student council president.

247
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,333
Cat hunt, everybody!

248
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,875
[SUZAKU]
Cat hunt?

249
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,208
There's a cat loose on campus
that needs to be rounded up!

250
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,041
Put everything on hold people.

251
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,083
Participating clubs'll
get budget priority!

252
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,208
And whoever catches
our feline friend

253
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,666
will get an extra special prize!

254
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,000
A big 'ole kiss from one of
the members of the council!

255
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,708
--[SHIRLEY screaming]
--[MILLY laughing]

256

[KALLEN gasps]

259
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,416
You've been hangin' the
student council haven't ya!

260
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,958
Wouldn't mind a
taste 'a those lips!

261
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,791
It's not gonna be like some
lame peck on the cheek though,

262
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,000
is it?!

263
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,416
A kiss on the cheek
would be fine with me!

264
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,166
Wait, we can choose
where she plants it?!

265
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,166

All right!

[BOYS yelling]

268
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,083
There's no way that's how
I'm gonna get my first kiss!

269
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,416
What? From a member
of the student council?

270
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,000
Does that include Lelouch?

271
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,625
Actually, I would
prefer Milly.

272
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,791
[REDHEAD STUDENT]
Ugh.

273
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,250
Could you get back
in the closet please?

274
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,166
[FOOTBALL TEAM]
Hut-hut-hut!

275
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,333

the advantage in mobility!

Hurry, look for catnip!

277
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,000
[GARDENER B]
Science will prevail!

278
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,708
[MILLY]
And when you do catch that cat,

279
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,666
bring what it's carrying to me!
To me! To meeee!

280
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,250
[MILLY laughs, coughs]

281
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,166
Milly! Stay out
of this, will ya!

That's why I hate Britannians.

I know, crazy, right?

284
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,666
[FEM STUDENT F]
Yeah, I can hardly believe it.

285
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,625
[FEM STUDENT G] I was, like,
floored when I heard it.

286
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,125
[FEM STUDENT F]
All I can say is sign me up!

287
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,958
Dammit! Why do I have to pretend
like I'm sick and feeble?

288
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,083
Jeez, I'm sorry about that--

289
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,583
Shirley, why are you
dressed like that?!

290
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,041
I didn't have time to change!

291
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,125
They're gonna make us kiss
somebody. We've gotta hurry!

292
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,458
I'm with you!

293

[NINA] Nunnally, is there
anything about this cat

294
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,583
that's special?

295
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,958
[NUNNALLY]
Hm...

296
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,000
I think that its
leg must be hurt

297
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,750
because it's footsteps
sounded off to me.

298
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,791
And uh... Oh!
I almost forgot!

299
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,666
It meowed like this...

300
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,791
Meooowwww!

301
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,708
[STUDENTS]
Meooowwwwwwwwww!

302
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,833
This school seems
so laid back.

303
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,416
In spite of the fact
that they're in mourning.

304
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,541
You suppose Sukzaku will
be all right in here?

305
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,250
[LLOYD] Never mind that.
The university here...

306
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,333
[CECILE] Don't worry, I've
made arrangements with them.

307
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,833
[LLOYD]
Hmm...

308
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,791
They still didn't have to kick
poor Lancelot out though.

309
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,083
[CECILE]
I know.

310
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,083
Even if they did say Elevens
aren't acceptable.

311
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,625
'Kay! Let's go!

312
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,666
What happens if a member of the
student council catches the cat?

313
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,625
We don't get a prize do we?

314
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,291
Do we get a kiss? But of course.

315
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,958
Is that so?

316
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, what are we
waitin' around for then?

317
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,958

320
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,625
Okay, we do this right
and our lips will be safe.

321
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,791
Shirley, you cover the rear.

322
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,791
Wait a sec!

323
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:18,833
What's the matter?

324
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,541
Who would you wanna
get a kiss from?

325
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,291
 Is there anybody in particular?

326
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,208
Huh?

327
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,333
It wouldn't be
Lelou, would it?

328
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,875
Just what would make
you think that?

329
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,208
Oh, well... I guess...
it's just...

330
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,708
[SUZAKU]
Hey, that's...

00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,125

332
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,666
Lelouch?! You're
looking for the cat too?

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,791
[CAT meowing]

334
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,208

Up there...

[LELOUCH]
Suzaku, wait!

336
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,125
[LELOUCH]
Don't go up there!

337
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,208
But the student council
president said to catch it!

338
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,041
[LELOUCH] Don't worry
about it, I'll get the cat!

339
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,291
[SUZAKU] I was always
more agile than you!

340
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,041
Remember when that
little bird got loose?

341
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,291

Quit talkin' ancient history!

It was only seven years ago!

Oh, for Pete's sake.

344
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,208
He always was an exercise nut...

00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,250
So someone's got
it cornered, huh?!

346
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,583
Who's the lucky winner?!

347
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:13,916
Up there!

348
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,125
[SHIRLEY]
Suzaku?

349
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,333
Easy now. You don't
have to be scared.

350
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,625
Suzaku! Come back!

351
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,083
It's all right.
Leave this to me.

352
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,958
[LELOUCH]
That's funny.

353
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,500
He never went along with
the crowd like this.

354
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,750
[yelps]

355
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,875
[STUDENTS gasping]

356
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,250
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

357
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,541
Lelouch!

358
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,291
[SUZAKU]
Are you... okay?

359
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,125
[LELOUCH]
Y-Yeah...

360
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,875
Is it possible...
those two are?

361
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,000
[sighs]

362
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,000
Pretty calm for someone
on the verge of death.

363
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,333
Yeah, right. I was
just limp with fear.

364
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,208
[MILLY]
Huh?

365
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,833
Hey, what's going on?

366
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,708
That transfer student
just saved Lelouch

367
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,291
from a really close call.

368
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,333
[NUNNALLY]
Uh.

369
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,583
[SUZAKU] I think it's the
same cat from the other day.

370
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,375
[CAT hisses]

371
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:18,958
[ALL gasp]

372
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,166
[RIVALZ]
Huh.

373
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,916
You saved him! Thank you
so much, Suzaku!

374
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,750
Yeah, way to go there, new guy!

375
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,083
That cat was carrying
something, wasn't it?

376
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, there was
something on its head,

377
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,250
but I never really got
a good look at it.

378
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,375
Guess it slipped off
when I wasn't looking.

379
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,375
So where is Lelou?

380
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,000
He said he forgot something.
Told me to go ahead.

381
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,458
That's it! The embarrassing
secret that he's hiding!

382
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,625
[SHIRLEY]
Hm?

383
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,166
[LELOUCH]
So that's it, Madame President?

384
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,208
[ALL]
Hm?

385
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,916
Aww. After all this time, I
thought I had some dirt on you.

386
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,791
Yeah, he almost lost
his cool for once.

387
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,333
So, uh, do you two
know each other, then?

388
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,416
[BOTH gasp]

389
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,833
Yeah, but, he's an Eleven.

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,041
No, I just...

391
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,291
[LELOUCH]
He's my friend.

392
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,791
Madame President,

393
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,708
would you permit him as a
member of the student council?

394
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,625
[MILLY, SHIRLEY, RIVALZ]
Huh...?

395
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,916
The rules are clear.

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,916
All students are
required to join a club.

397
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,375
Although...

398
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,375
Well, you are the
vice president.

399
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,875
I s'pose I can't refuse.

400
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,208
[SHIRLEY chuckles]

401
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,500
Well then, I'd say
that's the end of that.

402
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,166
Now c'mere you two,
lend me an ear.

403
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,125
Nunnally?

404
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,583
There you go, the reward
Miss Milly promised.

405
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,291
Since you both caught the cat,

406
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,125
you'll just have
to settle for me.

407
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,875
Almost a real council member!

408
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,083
All right then!

409
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,958
Let's celebrate the
catching of the cat!

410
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,083
Everything's on the
new guy, naturally!

411
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,500
Oh, back off!

412
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,916
Hi there, I'm Shirley!

413
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,125
Pleasure to meet 'cha!

414
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,666
[RIVALZ]
Oh, right, I'm Rivalz!

415
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,583
[MILLY] Milly Ashford.
Student council president.

416
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,833
[SUZAKU]
The pleasure is mine.

417
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,458
[RETAINER]
And now, his royal majesty,

418
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,583
the 98th emperor of the
Holy Britannian Empire!

419
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,375
All men.. are not
created equal...

420
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,375
Some are born swifter of foot.
Some with greater beauty.

421
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,916
Some are born into poverty.

422
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,416
And others born sick and feeble.

423
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,333
Both in birth and in upbringing.

424
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:07,000
In sheer scope of ability, every
human is inheritantly different.

425
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,375
Yes,

426
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,916
that is why people discriminate
against one another.

427
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,791
Which is why there is
struggle, competition,

428
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,125
and the unfaltering
march of progress.

429
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,000
Inequality...

430
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,416
...is not wrong. Equality is.

431
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,750
What of the EU, which
made equality a right?

432
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,708
Rabble politics by
a popularity contest!

433
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,250
The Chinese Federation with its
equal distribution of wealth?

434
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,958
A nation of lazy dullards...

435
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,375
But not our beloved Britannia.

436
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:42,500
We fight. We compete.
Evolution is continuous.

437
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,583
Evolution. Such a
pretty little word.

438
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,000
Britannia alone moves forward,

439
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,041
advancing steadily
into the future.

440
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,791
Even the death of my son Clovis,

441
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,541
demonstrates Britannia's
unswerving commitment

442
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,333
to progress.

443
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,083
We will fight on!

444
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:03,916
We shall struggle, compete,
plunder, and dominate!

445
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,041
And in the end, the
future shall be ours.

446
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,166
All hail Britannia.

447
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,625
[ALL]
All hail Britannia!

448
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:24,666
All hail Britannia!

449
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,708
[C.C.] So... This is
Lelouch's enemy. Well.

450
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,416
[LELOUCH] The word "hatred"
is not strong enough...

451
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,875
If my father is the
embodiment of Brittannia,

452
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,458
he must be detroyed!

453
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:15,208
And if Cornelia gets in my way,
she'll suffer the same fate!

454
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:19,000
You may not know it yet,
but I have power!

455
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:23,250
So long as I possess Geass,
I can go this alone.
