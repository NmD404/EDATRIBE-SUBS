1
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,875
[C.C.]
Imperial Calendar, 2018.

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,583
As the Holy Britannian
Empire continues its drive

3
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,750
to dominate the world,
a lone rebel is resurrected.

4
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,250
His name is Zero.

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,708
A mysterious girl named
C.C. has given him

6
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,125
the power of Geass,
the absolute power

7
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,041
to compel anyone to obey him.

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,875
Now, Zero is again
challenging the Britannian

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,541
conquerors of Japan,
the once proud nation

10
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,333
now referred to only as Area 11.

11
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,750
As his actions spread like
a ripple through the world,

12
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,166
how will they affect
the people of this age?

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,375
For the moment, no one knows.

14
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,625
[G1 OFFICER 1]
What about the O.S.I.

15
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,000
forces that broke in first?

16
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,250
[G1 OFFICER 2]
No contact with them yet.

17
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,333
[G1 OFFICER 1]
The chaff density should

18
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,958
be dropping now.
Recon section four!

19
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,250
[G1 OFFICER 3]
The terrorists remain embattled

20
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,708
inside of Babel Tower.

21
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,541
They're believed to be members
of the Black Knights

22
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,333
We've confirmed the presence
of enemy Knightmare Frames.

23
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,708
[G1 OFFICER 1]
All right, Special Weapons

24
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,250
Batallion Seven will
break in from below.

25
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,791
[PILOTS]
Yes, my lord!

26
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,583
[BLACK KNIGHT] This is
hopeless! Let's run for it!

27
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,375
Just hold out
a little bit longer.

28
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,708
Wait until Zero can get the
layout of the building!

29
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,916
We'll back you up,
but you've gotta stand firm!

30
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,000
[KALLEN]
Lelouch...

31
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,333
It's true, I am Zero.

32
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,958
[gasps] Zero!

33
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,458
It's Lelouch!

34
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,500
It's the man who's used

35
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,875
the Japanese people!
Who's used you!

36
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,208
You wanna defend a
man like that?! You?!

37
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,208
[gasps]

38
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,916
[groans]

39
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,166
[LELOUCH]
Hm.

40
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,166
Zero, this is the end of you.

41
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:40,791
[LELOUCH] I was defeated
by the old me. By Suzaku.

42
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,291
And by my biggest enemy.

43
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,250
[LELOUCH gasps]

44
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,041
[LELOUCH]
He dragged me before

45
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,041
the Britannian Emperor!

46
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,625
[groans]

47
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,916
[EMPEROR]
The former 17th heir

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,958
to the imperial throne,
Lelouch vi Britannia.

49
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,458
It's been a long time,
hasn't it, my errant son?

50
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,708
How dare you!

51
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,875
You won't use your Geass!

52
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,250
Your Majesty, I have a request.

53
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,041
Please, sire, allow me to join
the Knights of the Round,

54
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,583
the 12 strongest knights
of the Britannian empire!

55
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:20,541
As a reward for capturing
Zero, is that it?

56
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,125
[LELOUCH]
You!

57
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,000
[SUZAKU]
I told you before, Lelouch,

58
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,208
that I was going to change
this world from the inside.

59
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,416
[LELOUCH] Even if it means
selling out your friends?!

60
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,416
That's right.

61
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,791
[LELOUCH]
Tch!

62
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,041
Very well.

63
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,416
I like the answer
you just gave him.

64
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,541
Now then, as a
Knight of the Round,

65
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,625
I order you: Cover up
Zero's left eye.

66
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,833
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,708
[EMPEROR] My unworthy son,
who raised the banner

68
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,541
of rebellion although
he was a prince.

69
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,500
Still, there's another way
we can make use of him.

70
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,625
What?!

71
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,333
[EMPEROR]
I will rewrite your memory:

72
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,750
About being Zero, about
the death of your mother,

73
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,791
about the very
existence of Nunnally...

74
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,541
[LELOUCH]
No! Geass?!

75
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,125
[EMPEROR]
You'll remember none of it.

76
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,541
You'll just be insignificant.

77
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,875
No, stop!

78
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,833
You're stealing what's
most precious to me again!

79
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,416
First my mother, and now
you're taking Nunnally?!

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,625
[EMPEROR] Charles zi Britannia
engraves into you...

81
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,041
Stop it!

82
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,750
False memories of a false life.

83
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,333
[screaming]

84
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,875
C.C...

85
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,208
Don't even think it.

86
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,291
I'm not the one who
gave him his Geass.

87
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,791
[LELOUCH]
Hm.

88
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,291
Where is Nunnally now?

89
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,041
[C.C.]
We tried to find your sister,

90
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,208
but with the Black Knights
all but destroyed,

91
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,125
that's why--

92
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,250
[LELOUCH]
What about Sayoko?

93
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,500
[C.C.]
She and Diethard escaped

94
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,333
to the Chinese Federation.

95
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,250
She still doesn't know
Zero's true identity.

96
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,458
And she didn't know
Nunnally's real importance,

97
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,791
so she can't be blamed.

98
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,125
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

99
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,083
I'll find the one
who gave the emperor

100
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,083
his Geass and then get Nunnally.

101
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,750
[LELOUCH gasps]
I had a younger sister,

102
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,041
but not a younger brother!

103
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,500
So, who is he?

104
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,583
[gasps]

105
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,583
[ROLO]
Thank goodness!

106
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,125
You're Britannian
soldiers, right?

107
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,708
I'm looking for my big brother.

108
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,166
This has the layout
of the building

109
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,041
in detail, but the I.D.
code I need isn't here.

110
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,541
So we can't commandeer
this Knightmare, can we?

111
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,000
[KNIGHTMARE 1]
What are you doing there?

112
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,583
That's a student
uniform, isn't it?

113
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,250
Oh, you're a soldier!
Thank goodness!

114
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,166
We need to help
this man at once!

115
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,541
Office of Secret Intelligence?

116
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,541
What are the emperor's
personal agents doing here?

117
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,791
[LELOUCH] Good. These
reports are accurate.

118
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,083
Calares's forces
don't know about me.

119
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,208
So I can use the data
in this journal.

120
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,708
There's only one survivor?

121
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,083
Yes. Just you.

122
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,333
What?

123
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,291
[LELOUCH]
That's right.

124
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,583
Now give me your Knightmare.

125
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,666
I understand.

126
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,625
The I.D. code is QR5-YK1D6.

127
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,583
[LELOUCH]
Thank you.

128
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,708
Even though you need
direct eye contact,

129
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,291
are those theatrics necessary?

130
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,375
[LELOUCH]
I don't need comments

131
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,291
from an immortal witch.

132
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,416
[chuckles]

133
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,333
[CALARES] The terrorists are
staging a counterattack?

134
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,208
[GUILFORD]
Yes.

135
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,250
It seems that they've managed

136
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,416
to capture some
of our Knightmares.

137
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,625
That's disgraceful!

138
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,666
Still, their numbers are small.

139
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,625
If I could possibly
join the battle...

140
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,041
[CALARES]
No.

141
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,875
You're still a guest here,
and under our protection.

142
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,833
As viceroy, it's my
place to go out there.

143
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,333
[GUILFORD]
But...

144
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,083
[GAO HAI]
Hm...

145
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,041
I don't like the spices
in Chinese food.

146
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,083
However, I might enjoy it.

147
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,083
Huh?

148
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,833
[CALARES]
A manhunt.

149
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,000
[ELEVENS yelling]

150
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,791
Let me see you
burst, Britannian!

151
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,583
Well done, Q1! Now,
head up to level 21.

152
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,750
P4, block the stairway.

153
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,000
R5, left 30 degrees.

154
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,833
N1, fire a barrage
50 meters ahead,

155
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,666
angled toward the ceiling.

156
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,250
[G1 OFFICER 4]
Contact lost with Lord Emilio!

157
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,583
[G1 OFFICER 2]
Change I.F.F. codes!

158
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,250
[G1 OFFICER 3]
We have! Five times already!

159
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,791
[G1 OFFICER 4]
Ortiz unit, wiped out!

160
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,916
[G1 OFFICER 1]
Outrageous!

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,500
Who's directing
these terrorists?!

162
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,250
[CALARES]
What are you doing?

163
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,666
Viceroy!

164
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,958
So, Zero really is
just a student, huh?

165
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,250
Well, he's something special!

166
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,166
[BLACK KNIGHT 1] Zero supplied
more stolen Sutherlands

167
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,291
for us to use.

168
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,750
Get on them, fast!

169
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,416
[BLACK KNIGHT 2]
With Zero here, we can win!

170
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,666
[BLACK KIGHT 3] He'll make
a miracle for us! He will!

171
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,166
Damned terrorists!

172
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,625
[LELOUCH chuckles] Shouldn't
Viceroy Calares be making

173
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,166
his appearance, soon?

174
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,291
[KALLEN]
It's going well.

175
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,208
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

176
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,083
Kallen I sent
you to level 21.

177
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,958
I wanted to be
here by your side.

178
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,791
We're finally alone,
just you and me.

179
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,500
It would seem that somebody

180
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,666
is nibbling at the bait
we left in Area 11.

181
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,333
Is it C.C., Majesty?

182
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,750
We do not know that.

183
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,416
Kururugi, even among

184
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,583
Knights of the Round,
you're the first one

185
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,791
ever allowed to
enter this place.

186
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,583
Even Schneizel and the
others aren't aware of it.

187
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,458
[SUZAKU] I'm honored,
Your Majesty. But, why me?

188
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,250
[EMPEROR]
Because you are the only one

189
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,500
of the Knights of
the Round who knows...

190
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,500
[gasps]

191
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,208
About Zero's
identity. And Geass.

192
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,416
[gasps]

193
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,583
This place... Is it a shrine?

194
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,250
[EMPEROR]
No, it's not.

195
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,625
This is...

196
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,958
This is a weapon
for destroying God.

197
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,750
[SUZAKU]
A weapon?!

198
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,750
It is called the
Sword of Akasha.

199
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,291
[LELOUCH] You, who abandoned
Zero at Kamine Island,

200
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,875
what do you wanna tell me?

201
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,791
Lelouch, you were deceiving me
right from the very beginning.

202
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,833
[LELOUCH] About Zero
being your classmate?

203
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,916
Or about my Geass power?
Which one has offended you?

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,291
Both of them.

205
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,666
Tell me this!

206
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,041
Did you use your Geass on me
like you did the others?

207
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,250
Did you twist my
mind and my heart

208
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,375
and make me follow you?

209
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,375
[LELOUCH laughs]

210
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,791
Lelouch!

211
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,125
Your mind and your heart
are yours alone.

212
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,583
As was your loyalty
and admiration for Zero.

213
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,708
[KALLEN]
Don't move!

214
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,250
[LELOUCH]
Kallen, you should be proud

215
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:05,041
of what you did. You decided.
You made the choice.

216
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,833
You chose...

217
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,583
...Zero.

218
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,083
[grunts]

219
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,916
You don't believe me?

220
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:18,000
I wanted to believe so much
that I'd become a slave...

221
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,458
I see.

222
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,291
But the one that I
believe in is Zero!

223
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,375
Just him! It's not you, Lelouch!

224
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,916
[LELOUCH] Well, fine
with me. By the way...

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,666
Are you ever going to change
out of those clothes?

226
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,000
[gasps]

227
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't look at me, you pervert!

228
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh? Is that the way
you talk to Zero now?

229
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,250
[KALLEN]
I'm saying it to you, Lelouch!

230
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,375
Very well then.

231
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,208
[beeping]

232
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,291
Go ahead.

233
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,416
Britannian reinforcements
are here.

234
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,875
[BLACK KNIGHT 4] There's
zillions of 'em! What do we do?

235
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,166
[BLACK KNIGHT 5]
We can't beat this many!

236
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,333
There's no chance.

237
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,166
What's happening over there?

238
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,041
[G1 OFFICER 1]
Special Weapons Batallion Four

239
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,250
has begun to drop.

240
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,416
[CALARES]
Show the Chinese Federation!

241
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,375
Show them our emperor's might!

242
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,916
The overwhelming power of
our Holy Britannian Empire!

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,708
[G1 OFFICERS]
Yes, my lord!

244
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,500
They're coming in
from above, too!

245
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,125
[LELOUCH]
That's right.

246
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,250
[KALLEN gasps]

247
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,041
Viceroy Calares
must have arrived.

248
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,708
Escape would be
difficult. That's why...

249
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,041
...I'm going to win.

250
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,416
[G1 OFFICER 1]
Assault team two now has control

251
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,333
up to floor J!

252
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,750
[G1 OFFICER 2] That leaves
only one escape route

253
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,541
the Black Knights can use.

254
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,041
[CALARES]
And our main fighting force

255
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,083
is right there waiting for them.

256
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:46,958
Yes, sir.

257
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,625
We just need to drive them out.

258
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,708
Set up a broadcast link quickly.
We'll make the extermination

259
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,583
of these terrorists
a media event.

260
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,666
The Britannians must feel
certain of their victory.

261
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,833
That clears all
the tasks at hand.

262
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,791
All that's left is
your level, right?

263
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,333
[C.C.] We'll be finished
in ten minutes.

264
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,500
[LELOUCH]
Understood.

265
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,125
We'll make a stand
here to buy you time.

266
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,541
What about Diethard's setup?

267
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,666
[LELOUCH]
The system's still running.

268
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,791
Everything is going
according to plan.

269
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,916
[BLACK KNIGHT 6]
This is B2!

270
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,875
A single enemy
Knightmare is-- Agh!

271
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,125
What's wrong?

272
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,166
[BLACK KNIGHT 6]
But, that's-- It was just there!

273
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,333
B2? What's going on?

274
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:24,708
An enemy deactivating his
I.F.F.? Operating on his own?

275
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:29,333
[BLACK KNIGHT 7] Zero, this is
P6! The enemy is...! It's-- Agh!

276
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,583
[LELOUCH]
P6!

277
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,958
[BLACK KNIGHT 7]
This is R5! They destroyed R1!

278
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:34,875
[LELOUCH]
This isn't good.

279
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,458
And he's headed right for me!

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,166
[URABE]
Zero!

281
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,750
At the very least, you
have to get outta here!

282
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,625
We can move in
and act as decoys,

283
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,208
sacrificial pawns for
the plan. So, please...

284
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,166
[LELOUCH]
That's wrong.

285
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,166
[URABE]
Hm?

286
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,666
[LELOUCH]
You're mistaken, Urabe.

287
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,708
If you consider
yourselves disposable,

288
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,375
you'll never beat
the Britannians.

289
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,875
[KALLEN gasps]

290
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,583
[BLACK KNGIHT 8]
Captain Urabe!

291
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,916
Can you get over there?

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,791
[BLACK KNIGHT 8]
Yeah.

293
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,250
The cargo loading dock, right?

294
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,333
[URABE]
Yes.

295
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,125
It's a shortcut to this level.

296
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,375
[BLACK KNGIHT 8]
Confirmed.

297
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,291
[BLACK KNIGHT 8]
Yes, I see it.

298
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,416
This looks like a
mass-production prototype

299
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
based on the Lancelot.

300
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,333
[LELOUCH]
I see.

301
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,458
Still, this is not the
time to try capturing it.

302
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,333
Destroy it.

303
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,500
[BLACK KNIGHT 8]
Understood.

304
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,666
Huh?

305
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,416
It vanished?!

306
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Huh?

307
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,750
[BLACK KNIGHT 8]
How'd it get over here?!

308
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,000
Hold on!

309
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,541
Are you saying the
Knightmare "disappeared?!"

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,208
C.C.!

311
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,375
Aren't you finished
preparing that level yet?

312
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,041
Why are you panicking?

313
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,208
You have Kallen
and Urabe with you.

314
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,166
[LELOUCH gasps]

315
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,125
That's it! The aberration!

316
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,500
[LELOUCH]
You're out of your league.

317
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,291
You aren't Suzaku,
and your maneuvers

318
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,291
are no match for real strategy.

319
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,041
We've got the advantage
in close-range combat!

320
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,583
[URABE]
Too slow!

321
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,875
It vanished! Just like that!

322
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,375
Fast as a god!

323
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,000
[LELOUCH]
That can't be...

324
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,541
It's not physically possible!
It must be something else!

325
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,791
[LELOUCH]
It's closing in!

326
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,333
Urabe!

327
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,791
[KALLEN]
Oh, no!

328
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,916
[URABE] Zero, I don't care
if you're really a student,

329
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,625
or what your background is.

330
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,250
And I know you meant
it when you said

331
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,500
we're not expendable.

332
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,541
I know that every fighter
we've got counts.

333
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,375
Kozuki!

334
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,833
Ye-Yes?

335
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,208
[URABE]
Protect Zero.

336
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,541
He's our last hope, and hope
is what our people need.

337
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,583
Forgive me, Rakshata.

338
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,041
[URABE]
Zero! Save Japan!

339
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:14,125
Help our people to lift
their heads again and fight!

340
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,750
"The Four Holy Swords"...

341
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,791
...have proven our worth.

342
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,083
Urabe...

343
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,875
[beeping]

344
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,041
[LELOUCH]
Damn.

345
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,500
He used that
teleportation again.

346
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,541
No, wait!

347
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,250
[KALLEN]
I have to make my move now.

348
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,708
This one's for Zero.

349
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,875
I have more bad news for you.
We're all finished here.

350
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,291
Then it's done.

351
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,666
Urabe, your sacrifice
wasn't in vain.

352
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,375
Hope begins now!

353
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,416
[CALARES] Damned terrorists!
A suicide attack!

354
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,083
Uncivilized monkeys!

355
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,291
[G1 OFFICER 4]
All units, lost!

356
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,708
[G1 OFFICER 4]
Contact lost with all units!

357
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,666
--[KNIGHTMARE 3] Wh-What the--?!
--[KNIGHTMARE 4 screams]

358
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,291
[PILOT 2]
Ascending from intercept

359
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,208
to 1,500 and circling!

360
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,500
[KALLEN]
That's it!

361
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,000
The tower will smash
the enemies above us

362
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,875
and crush them as it falls!

363
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,958
[LELOUCH]
Not just that.

364
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,250
[gasps]

365
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,250
No! It can't be!

366
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,625
[LELOUCH]
Your mistake was sealing off

367
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,083
your escape route.
And signaling your location

368
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,583
like that made you
so easy to target.

369
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,875
[CALARES screams]

370
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:39,958
[laughs] Goodbye,
Viceroy Calares.

371
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,208
[BUREAU A]
The viceroy has been killed?!

372
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,291
[BUREAU B]
Where's Lord Cornwell?

373
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,666
[BUREAU A]
He was with the viceroy.

374
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,291
[BUREAU B] Then, who's next
in the chain of command?

375
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,083
[BUREAU A] The Minister
of Internal Affairs.

376
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,958
[BUREAU B]
A civil servant in charge now?!

377
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,791
This is no time to panic!

378
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,625
[BUREAU A, BUREAU B]
Hm?

379
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,291
[GUILFORD]
I am taking command!

380
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,541
This is not a grab
for political power!

381
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,083
It's a temporary measure!

382
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,625
I swear it in the
name of my princess!

383
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,750
I ask for your cooperation!

384
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,166
The Princess?

385
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,500
[BUREAU B]
Does he mean Princess Cornelia?

386
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,625
In that case...

387
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,416
[BUREAU B]
Right.

388
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,583
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, my lord!

389
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,166
[GUILFORD]
Thank you. I am grateful to you.

390
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,583
Now then, I'll go to the scene

391
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,041
to direct emergency
rescue operations.

392
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,625
Alfred, you contact the police.
Bart, you remain here.

393
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,500
[BART, ALFRED gasp]

394
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,583
[GUILFORD]
Hm?

395
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,416
[gasps] But that's...!

396
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,791
What's wrong?

397
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,583
[ZERO]
I am Zero!

398
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,916
What the hell?!

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,833
[gasps]

400
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,125
[MAN]
Whoa, whoa! What the--?!

401
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:34,916
[WOMAN]
Isn't that Zero?

402
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,166
[MAN 2]
No...

403
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,166
[MAN 3]
I thought he was dead!

404
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,333
[ONLOOKER]
How could this happen?

405
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,166
[GIRL] It can't be
the real Zero, can it?

406
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,625
[ZERO] People of Japan,
I have returned!

407
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,791
Kill the video!

408
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,125
I can't! It won't
take my access code!

409
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,458
[DIETHARD] That's it!
The Omega Line that I set up!

410
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,208
And the only one
who knows about it...

411
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,083
...is Zero!

412
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,791
Yes! I knew you
were still alive!

413
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,625
[ZERO]
Hear me, Britannia!

414
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,791
All you who have power,
heed my words carefully.

415
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,000
I am burdened by sorrow.

416
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:06,916
[gasps]

417
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,416
[ZERO]
War and discrimination.

418
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,708
Malicious deeds carried
out by the strong.

419
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:15,083
The same abhorrent interplay
of tragedy and comedy.

420
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:19,416
The world has not changed!
The people still suffer.

421
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
That is why the resurrection
of Zero was necessary!

422
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,083
So long as the strong
oppress the weak,

423
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,708
my rebellion will
continue to grow!

424
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,166
It begins today with
the divine punishment

425
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,291
I have wrought upon the inept
and foolish Viceroy Calares!

426
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,416
Man, oh man.

427
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,250
The Elevens' rebel
leader sure popped

428
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,500
back up with a vengeance.
Right, Suzaku?

429
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,666
Got it! The signal's coming from

430
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,583
the Chinese
Federation consulate!

431
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,708
Chinese Federation?

432
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,333
Has he defected?

433
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,833
They broke through
our encirclement.

434
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,791
[gasps] Of course!

435
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,041
They've stayed inside
the fallen building!

436
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,708
They've made Babel Tower
itself their pathway!

437
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,208
But, what about the
Chinese Federation?

438
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,250
Did they plan this out
with them beforehand?

439
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,958
Is that possible?!

440
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,625
C'mon, Zero's dead, isn't he?

441
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,625
Yes.

442
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,166
So, this guy's a fake.

443
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,958
And whoever he is,
if we just go over there

444
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,375
and storm the consulate...

445
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,750
Then we'd be breaking our treaty

446
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,083
with them, risking an
international incident.

447
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,250
He's saying that he's Zero,
and Zero killed our royals.

448
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,208
That gives this equal
status with the E.U. war.

449
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,625
It's a slippery
slope, either way.

450
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,750
[KALLEN]
Killing the viceroy and securing

451
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,791
our escape route.
He was able to do

452
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,625
both at the same time!

453
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,250
[XING-KE] Such cunning and
audacity is impressive.

454
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,000
It's Zero! The real one!

455
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,291
[ZERO]
I shall fight against all those

456
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,041
who abuse their power!

457
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,291
[ZERO] Therefore, once
again, here and now,

458
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:54,125
I declare the establishment
of the United States of Japan!

459
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,750
Are you certain about this?

460
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,291
We still haven't
received direct orders

461
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,416
from the Empress.

462
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,125
Are you dissatisfied
with my decision?

463
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,166
No. Never mind.

464
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,916
[laughs] Zero, you've actually
founded the United States of...

465
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,333
...Japan.

466
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,541
[VILETTA]
Terrorists forming a nation?

467
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,333
[ZERO]
Starting from this moment,

468
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,500
this room shall be the first
dominion of the U.S.J.!

469
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:21,916
[laughs] A nation consisting
of just one room!

470
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,166
That man's as amusing as ever.

471
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,208
[ZERO] Race, ideology, and
religion will not matter!

472
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,750
Being a citizen will have
but one requirement!

473
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,916
To do that which is just!

474
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,541
I trust you understand
the consequences

475
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,416
if you force your way in.

476
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,708
All right.

477
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,333
We'll settle this in
diplomatic chambers later.

478
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,666
[XING-KE]
Zero...

479
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,041
How useful will he
prove to us in the end?

480
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,208
[gasps]

481
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,333
If you're Britannian,
you have already

482
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,000
been asked to leave.

483
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,833
Or, are you one of
Zero's followers?

484
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,250
[ROLO]
I'm not sure. Which am I?

485
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,208
I'm not terribly
fond of riddles.

486
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,500
[ROLO] Yes, I'm exactly
the same way, myself.

487
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,625
What I wanna
know is the truth.

488
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:18,500
That's why I came
here to kill Zero.

489
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,625
[LELOUCH] I cannot move
a world by waiting.

490
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,083
To find Nunnally
and get her back,

491
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,125
I'm going to need real power.

492
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,791
Power stronger than
the emperor and Suzaku.

493
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,333
I must seize that power,
and I'll use my Geass to do it!

494
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,125
With the United States of Japan

495
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,500
as my starting point,
I'll build a new world

496
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,666
that's even greater
than Britannia.

497
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,750
But before I can do it,
I'll need to take care of him

498
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:21,000
My phony little brother, Rolo.
