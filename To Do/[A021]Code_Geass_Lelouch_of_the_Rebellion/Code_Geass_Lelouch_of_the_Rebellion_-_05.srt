00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,333
[SECRETARY GENERAL]
Open fire!

2
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:31,958
Gloucesters?!

3
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,791
They're supposed
to be in Serupham!

4
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,875
Shoddy oversized
imitation Knightmares!

5
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:43,500
They would've been wise to
surrender from the start.

00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,541
[ALL yelping]

7
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,750
What?!

8
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:54,166
So, Cornelia, a single
unit, did this?!

9
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,833
Another victory.

10
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,166
Area 18 has been established.

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,541
[DALTON] My Lady, about
our next course of action...

12
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,708
Sorry to have you clean up after
my foolish younger brother.

13
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,541
[DALTON]
Please don't apologize, milady.

14
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,083
We live to serve, and
our place is with you.

15
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,375
[CORNELIA]
Ha.

16
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,791
Do you think Area 11
needs our usual treatment?

17
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,083
[DALTON]
Yes, milady.

18
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,250
Good.

19
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,125
[CORNELIA] I'll drive you
into the open, Zero.

20
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,666
Clovis will be avenged.

21
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,375
[LELOUCH]
I'm back.

22
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,458
Welcome home, Lelouch.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,958
I'm so glad. I was worried.

24
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,625
I'm assuming you
ate out tonight,

25
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,541
judging from your appearance.

26
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,625
[NUNNALLY]
Thank goodness!

27
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,791
I thought maybe you'd
gotten caught up

28
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,458
in all the uproar
caused by that man Zero.

29
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,916
I tried calling you, but you
didn't answer your cell phone.

30
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,750
I wanted to tell you Miss C.C.'s
been waiting for you, as well.

31
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,458
[gasps]

32
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,666
C.C.?

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,208
[NUNNALLY giggles]

34
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,583
Your friend goes by such an
unusual name. Only her initials.

35
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,833
[LELOUCH]
Yeah...

36
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,250
I was just wondering,
is C.C. your girlfriend?

37
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,458
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

38
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,791
He made a promise about
our future together.

39
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:45,416
Right?

40
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,750
[LELOUCH]
Huh?

41
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,500
[NUNNALLY] A future together?
You mean marriage?

42
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,916
No!

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,208
No, that isn't what
she was talkin' about.

44
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,833
It's like, uh...

45
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,833
She's kidding around.

46
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,875
[C.C.]
No, I'm not.

47
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,458
Well, you're certainly doing
this sooner than most.

48
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,625
But everyone's
different, aren't they?

49
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,583
So I suppose it
isn't that strange,

50
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,125
and if you feel like
you're ready for-- Uh.

51
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,000
[LELOUCH]
Oh, C.C., look what you've done.

52
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,583
You're soaking wet.

53
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,041
C'mon, let's get you
to the bathroom

54
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,500
into a dry change of clothes.

55
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,291
Nunnally, stay here, and I'll
clean that up in a minute.

56
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,625
And she was kidding
before. Kidding!

57
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,666
Just a dumb joke, that's all!

58
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,500
[LELOUCH]
Who are you?

59
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,750
She said my name. I'm C.C.

60
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,750
That's not what I meant.
Why aren't you--

61
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,458
Supposed to be dead?

62
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,791
[C.C.]
So...

63
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,166
...do you like the power
that I gave you?

64
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,000
[LELOUCH]
As I thought. It was you.

65
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,208
[C.C.]
Dissatisfied?

66
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,250
[LELOUCH]
On the contrary, I'm grateful.

67
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,708
It allows me to speed up
my schedule tremendously,

68
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,625
which is a huge help.

69
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,125
[C.C.]
Your schedule?

70
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,083
[LELOUCH] Yes, my schedule
for obliterating Britannia.

71
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,500
I'd have had to wait much longer

72
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,666
before I could've made
the initial move.

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,541
You believe you can destroy it
simply by using that power?

74
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,416
[LELOUCH] I intended to
do it without this power.

75
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,541
I just knew that he'd turn out
to be a fascinating guy.

76
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,083
[LELOUCH]
What will you do now?

77
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,208
I'm sure the military
is after you.

78
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,375
[C.C.] Not the entire military,
only a small faction of it.

79
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,958
So it shouldn't be difficult
to find a hiding place.

80
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,375
[C.C.]
I can make do here.

81
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,791
What?! You expect to stay here?!

82
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,666
[C.C.] A gentleman would
sleep on the floor.

83
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,375
[LELOUCH]
Don't joke around.

84
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,875
[C.C.] My being caught would
cause trouble for you, too.

85
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,791
[LELOUCH]
It's dangerous to stay together.

86
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,958
[C.C.] If I wander the
streets, they'll find me.

87
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,000
This isn't about you.
It's my situation.

88
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,375
[C.C.]
I hate stubbornness!

89
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,750
[LELOUCH grunts]

90
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,958
[LELOUCH] You sure take
things casually, don't you?

91
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,333
How did you manage
to survive before this?

92
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,000
What did you do before now?

93
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,291
And what's the deal with that
so-called "contract" you spoke--

94
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,208
[C.C.]
Goodnight, Lelouch.

95
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,583
[CECILE]
Fukushima, Kochi, Hiroshima.

96
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,000
This has been the
seventh occurrence

97
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,500
since that man named
Zero raised his head.

98
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,666
[LLOYD] It seems that the other
groups are following his lead

99
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,416
and putting up a valiant fight.

100
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,875
[CECILE] And now suspicions
about that "Orange" thing

101
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,291
have cost Margrave
Jeremiah his command.

102
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,333
[LLOYD] Maybe he wasn't
good enough. Thanks to him,

103
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,750
connections between the
police and administration

104
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,208
are screwed up. It's made
a fine mess for us, as well.

105
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,833
[KUSAKABE]
Help them, Tohdoh!

106
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,250
Zero has thrown the
Britannians into chaos!

107
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,666
Now's the time for us in
the Japan Liberation Front

108
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,625
to make our stand!

109
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,041
[TOHDOH]
Calm down!

110
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,333
The information of Kyoto
giving the Guren MK-2 to Zero

111
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,541
hasn't been confirmed.

112
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,333
If we pay too much
attention to Zero,

113
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,416
we may trip ourselves up.

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,208
[C.C.] So, what did "Orange"
turn out to be, anyway?

115
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,416
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

116
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,916
[C.C.]
Well?

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,166
You know, for someone who isn't
willing to answer any questions,

118
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,833
you certainly do
ask a lot of them.

119
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,041
If you don't want to
answer my questions,

120
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,333
you don't have to.
Just as I don't.

121
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,708
[sighs]

122
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,791
There is no "Orange,"
it's something I made up.

123
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,833
But... the more they claim
to be comrades of like mind,

124
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,458
the easier it is to divide them
with the thorns of suspicion.

125
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,583
[C.C.]
Hm.

126
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,083
[C.C.] Everyone on Earth
is looking for you.

127
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,083
Because of you, the world
is going through an upheaval.

128
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,291
So.

129
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,833
Is this it? Is this what
you wanted to see?

130
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,000
[LELOUCH]
No.

131
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,083
This uproar is simply
a means to an end.

132
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,250
The world is destined to
descend into greater chaos.

you are no longer a suspect

I'm sorry!

00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,916
I wasn't aware you were down
here until I had leaped!

144

Well, don't worry.

145
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,958
I wasn't expecting a girl
to come falling outta the sky

146
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,458
and into my arms, either.

Oh, my!

00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,708
Yes! There is something wrong!

[SUZAKU]
Huh?

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,208
[GIRL] The truth is,
bad guys are chasing me.

152
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,958
So considering
the circumstances,

153
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,708
could you help me, please?

154
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,583
[KEWELL] We must get rid
of this "Orange" character

before Princess Cornelia

[SIGNALMAN] Are the reports
we've been hearing true?

158
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,833
Lord Jeremiah was bribed?

159
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,500
Do you know what
this "Orange" means?

00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,500

[KNIGHT A]
In any case,

00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,541
Lord Jeremiah is
definitely hiding something.

Exactly like those
of the men in Shinjuku

00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,250
Euphy?

174
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,166
[EUPHY]
Yes.

175
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:55,958
My name's--

176
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,208
[EUPHY]
Don't tell me!

177
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,500
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

178
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,541
'Cause I already know it.
You're a celebrity.

179
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,041
Son of Prime Minister
Genbu Kururugi,

180
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,041
Private Suzaku Kururugi.

181
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,625
[SUZAKU]
Hm.

182
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,250
You lied before. There's no
one chasing you at all, right?

183
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,125
[EUPHY]
Meow!

184
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:12,958
What?

185
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,500
[EUPHY]
Meow, meow!

186
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,541
Aw, does a kitty's paw hurt?

187
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,500
Oh.

188
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,750
Meow, meow, meow!

189
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,375
[meows]

190
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:23,750
[meows]

191
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,875
Meow, meow.

192
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,541
[SUZAKU]
Hm.

193
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,833
[SUZAKU chuckles]

194
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,500
[EUPHY]
Oh, my.

195
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,833
[LLOYD]
We're running late.

196
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,083
I hope he's still
waiting for us.

197
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,708
Considering the charge,
did they really release him?

198
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,625
Yes, they had no evidence.

199
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,375
I'm sure they put him
through the third degree

200
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,791
because of that
Zero incident. Huh?

201
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,833
What? Why is he--?

202
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,250
[gasps]

203
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,583
Do you have trouble with cats?

204
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,916
Hm. I like them fine, however...

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,916
[hisses]

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,833
Hm. The attraction isn't mutual.

207
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,250
I think unrequited love is
the mark of a kind person.

208
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,083
Oh!

209
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,291
[SUZAKU]
Uh.

210
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,500
[EUPHEMIA]
The kitty ran away.

211
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,208
Mm, Euphy...

212
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,666
Why did you tell me
that lie when we met?

213
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,666
Do you ask because
you're concerned about me?

214
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,541
Huh? Um, of course.

215
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,250
Good! Then you can
accompany me some more!

216
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,250
C'mon, it'll be fun!

217
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,875
[EUPHY] You know, being here
is just like being in Britannia.

218
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,125
I feel right at home.

219
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,583
[SUZAKU]
Are you from the Homeland?

220
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,791
[EUPHY]
Uh-huh!

221
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,041
I was a student there
up until last week.

222
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,666
[SUZAKU] Last week?
So, what are you doing now?

223
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,583
By student, do you
mean high school?

224
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,500
You can go sightseeing
any time, can't you?

225
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,500
[EUPHY giggles]

226
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,416
[EUPHY]
You ask a lotta questions.

227
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,083
[SUZAKU]
Uh. Sorry...

228
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,958
[EUPHY] Oh! No, I didn't
mean it like that!

229
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,291
You see... today is the
last day of my vacation.

230
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,083
I wanted to see as much
of Area 11 as I could,

231
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,416
because I'd like to know
what kind of place it is.

232
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,291
[SUZAKU] Well, you
didn't need me for that.

233
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,291
[EUPHEMIA] No. I'm glad
I could see with you.

234
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,833
[SUZAKU]
Is that right?

235
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,541
[EUPHY]
Suzaku...

236
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,666
Would you mind taking me
to one more place, please?

237
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,541
Your wish is my command,
milady. Where to?

238
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,833
[EUPHY]
Take me to Shinjuku.

239
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:21,958
[gasps]

240
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,416
[EUPHY]
Suzaku Kururugi.

241
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,416
Please escort me there.

242
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,708
[KALLEN]
Lelouch?

243
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,625
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

244
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,000
[KALLEN]
Do you have a minute?

245
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,000
[LELOUCH]
Mh-hm. What is it?

246
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,500
[KALLEN] About that
phone call the other day...

247
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,125
Phone call?

248
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,291
Yeah... You know, when you
and I were in the bathroom.

249
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,708
[LELOUCH]
Uh-huh.

250
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,666
[KALLEN] Can you find out
what the caller I.D. was?

251
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,666
I want to contact
that person again.

252
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,333
It was a school phone.

253
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,750
So I'm no sure, sor-- Uh!

254
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,083
I see.

255
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,500
Makes sense.
I should've known.

256
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,916
[LELOUCH]
That girl.

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,541
[KALLEN]
Uh.

258
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,833
What?

259
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,916
Is there something wro-- Uh!

260
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,958
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

261
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,083
No way...

262
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,958
[KALLEN]
Excuse me.

263
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:16,958
What're you doing?

264
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,125
Ah. What indeed.

265
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,958
[BARTLEY] To think I'd return
to the Homeland like this.

266
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,916
I wish I'd never involved
that damned girl.

267
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,666
[LELOUCH]
Are you insane?!

268
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,208
You can't go walkin' around!

269
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,666
[C.C.]
Don't act strict with me.

270
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,166
I never leave the school
grounds, so it's fine.

271
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,875
It's not! You can't do as you
like here. You don't belong!

272
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,083
[C.C.]
I don't belong anywhere.

273
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,875
Hm? What's with her?

274
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,625
Oh. Is she doing
it again today?

275
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,041
[C.C.]
Again?

276
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,291
[LELOUCH] She's going to be
markin' the wall like that

277
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,666
every day, because I used my
Geass on her to make her do it.

278
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,833
[C.C.]
Geass?

279
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,083
[LELOUCH]
The name of the power I have.

280
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,916
That's what I heard when
we first made contact.

281
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,916
[C.C.]
Hm.

282
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,666
You're testing
how long it lasts?

283
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,291
I need to know the specs
of my weapon, don't I?

284
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,500
So behave, or I'll
try it on you.

285
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,291
Would it work... on me?

286
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,958
[LELOUCH]
Uh.

287
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,500
Oh, relax.

288
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,333
You and I are in this together.

289
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,750
I won't do anything to endanger
us or our unique partnership.

290
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,958
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

291
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:27,125
[SUZAKU] The Shinjuku ghetto.
Ruined again.

292
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,958
The residents were
starting to return, too.

293
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,791
[OTAKU A] Man, they didn't
use R-G on the Elevens.

294
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,041
I figured they wouldn't.

295
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,583
[OTAKU B]
Hey, look!

296
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,833
Those are marks from hummer
rounds. Get a clear shot of it!

297
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,291
[OTAKU A] Say "cheese"!
Got it! Okay, me next!

298
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,333
[JEREMIAH]
This is accurate?

299
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,000
This information about Zero?

300
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,291
[SIGNALMAN] Yes, sir.
Lord Kewell contacted me.

301
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,708
Right.

302
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,083
Set up a cordon around Shinjuku
ghetto sector 4 at once!

303
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,166
Cordon sector 4, roger.

304
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,500
Okay, ball's in your
court now, Lord Kewell.

305
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,000
[BOTH gasp]

306
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,416
[VILLETTA] I wanted to put be
through to Lord Jeremiah,

307
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,250
but it appears that
you're too busy now.

308
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,541
Get out of here, you
damn Britannian bastards!

309
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,708
[SUZAKU]
Stay here!

310
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,625
How dare a lowly
Eleven speak like--

311
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,833
[TAMAKI] Don't call me an
Eleven! I'm Japanese!

312
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,291
[OTAKU B] Wrong, you seem to
forget that you people lost!

313
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,958
You're nothing but a beaten dog!

314
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,750
You racist pig!

315
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,958
[SUZAKU]
Stop, please! No violence!

316
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,916
[TAMAKI]
Stay outta this!

317
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,666
You're that...

318
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,208
Are you... Suzaku Kururugi?

319
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,875
[MINAMI]
The guy who killed Clovis?

320
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,291
[YOSHIDA] No, idiot.
It was Zero who killed him.

321
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,416
[TAMAKI] Tch. This guy's
nothing more than a slave.

322
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,958
Big deal, you're an honorary
Britannian. Nobody cares.

323
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,625
You sold your pride,
your people, your soul,

324
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,458
yet you call
yourself Japanese?!!

325
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,708
No, you're wrong! I--

326
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,333
[TAMAKI]
I am not wrong!

327
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,833
You stinkin' Britannian lap dog!

328
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,625
Stop, please!

329
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,083
[groaning]

330
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,500
I warn you, I've been
trained for military combat.

331
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,208
Don't make me fight
against my own people.

332
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,458
[TAMAKI]
Like hell we're "your people"!

333
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,416
[MINAMI]
C'mon, just let it go!

334
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,333
[TAMAKI]
Ugh! Lousy traitor!

335
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,875
[EUPHY]
Suzaku!

336
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,916
Oh, my! Are you okay?

337
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,416
[SUZAKU]
Yeah, I'm all right.

338
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,541
Well, I'm not okay! Just look
at my Prime G and my LX-4!

339
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,833
Why did you wait?!

340
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,625
Dammit, some honorary
citizen you are!

341
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,375
Why'd you let 'em go?!
You shoulda killed them!

342
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,000
What's a few dead Elevens
to a guy like you?!

343
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,500
Who do you think's taken care of
you all of these years anyway?!

344
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,833
[OTAKU A yelps]

345
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:45,041
I'll not allow you to insult
this man any longer, you oaf!

346
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,458
[LELOUCH]
To use my Geass,

347
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,000
I need to have direct eye
contact with the subject.

348
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,583
Transparent objects like
eyeglasses present no problem.

349
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:56,000
The effective range is
approximately 270 meters,

350
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,625
and the subject appears
to have no memory

351
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,125
of events before, during,
or after the power is used.

352
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,416
I think this is due to
damage caused by the Geass

353
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,166
interfering with the
brain of the subject.

354
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,416
Also, if the signal's
optical, I can reflect it.

355
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,291
In the short time you've
had it, you've learned a lot.

356
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,708
[LELOUCH]
My opponent is an empire

357
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,291
that controls more than
one-third of the entire world.

358
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,958
There's no such thing
as being too careful.

359
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,875
[C.C.] I'd understand
if you were an Eleven,

360
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,750
but you're a Britannian,
aren't you?

361
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,916
This opponent may be
too large and strong

362
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,083
to fight with only
Geass for a weapon.

363
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,041
[LELOUCH]
Is it good to be strong?

364
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,375
[SUZAKU]
Is it bad to be weak?

365
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,000
Back then, when I was ten,

366
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,666
the world seemed like
such a terribly sad place.

367
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,875
A world without any hope at all.

368
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,708
[LELOUCH]
Starvation.

369
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,166
[SUZAKU]
Disease.

370
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,375
Filth. Decay.

371
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,500
Racism.

372
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,583
Constant war and terrorism.

373
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:53,291
Living in a
never-ending cycle of hate.

374
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,250
[LELOUCH]
Rat's running in a wheel.

375
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,083
[SUZAKU]
The cycle must be broken.

376
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,333
Somebody has to do it.

377
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,708
How idealistic.

378
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,291
[SUZAKU]
Of course, it's doubtful

379
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,208
that the one who does it will
make all the bad things go away.

380
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,458
[LELOUCH]
I'm not that arrogant. And so...

381
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,000
No one should lose more
of the people they love.

382
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,291
At least, a world without war.

383
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,541
[C.C.]
And to have this utopia you'd...

384
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,250
How would you do it?

385
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,750
It's simple.

386
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,916
When somebody wins...

387
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,083
...the fighting will end.

388
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,583
[C.C.]
Somebody?

389
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,750
[SUZAKU] I don't know
how you would do it.

390
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,416
But if I stop trying,

391
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,541
then my father's death
will have been in vain.

392
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,416
The Prime Minister's death?

393
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,916
My own father died

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,041
because he had to sacrifice
his life in that war!

395
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:39,708
[explosion]

396
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,833
[EUPHY gasps]

397
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,541
[KEWELL]
Jeremiah!

398
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:48,333
You're going to pay for letting
Prince Clovis' murderer go free!

399
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,041
Kewell, you dirty coward!

400
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,166
That sighting of Zero
was a lie, wasn't it?!

401
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,125
[KEWELL] We have to
wipe away our disgrace

402
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,166
before Princess Cornelia
takes up her post here.

403
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,875
This is how we keep
our officials honest.

404
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,333
Suzaku!

405
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,375
[SUZAKU]
Miss Cecile!

406
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,000
[CECILE]
It's dangerous here! Get in!

407
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,208
The purebloods are
having a silly squabble.

408
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,750
Better get out of here.

409
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,375
Oh, and by the way, what
a shame about your acquittal.

410
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,166
Because now you'll have
to work for me again.

411
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,500
[SUZAKU]
Wait, please!

412
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,541
Isn't this an opportunity
to gather battle data

413
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,583
for the Lancelot?

414
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,333
[CECILE]
Uh?

415
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,833
[LLOYD]
Oh, ho...

416
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,333
[EUPHY]
Suzaku...

417
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,250
I'm sorry, Euphy, we
have to say goodbye here.

418
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,458
I need to do this. I think I can
stop them with the Lancelot.

419
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,083
I have to try. I--

420
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,416
I must!

421
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,750
Damn! It's four against one!

422
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,041
Cowards!

423
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,666
[KEWELL]
Don't worry, Jeremiah.

424
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,416
We'll say you died in battle.

425
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,625
Your family's name
won't be disgraced.

426
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,083
You're serious then?

427
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,750
You actually intend to kill me?!

428
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:48,708
Kewell!

429
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,333
[KEWELL]
Silence, Orange!

430
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,375
We serve the imperial family!

431
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,916
Why else would we be here?!

432
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
All... hail... Britannia!

433
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,416
[KEWELL]
Wha--?!

434
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,291
[SUZAKU] Stop it! You're
all Britannian soldiers!

435
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,125
That's him. It's that
honorary Britannian.

436
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,791
The advanced weapon! Lancelot!

437
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,291
[KEWELL] What business does
the Special Corps want here?!

438
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,041
Interlopers will die!

439
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,125
[SUZAKU]
No!

440
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,583
[SUZAKU] I can't stand by and
ignore this senseless battle!

441
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,416
Oh my god. They've
perfected the MVSs.

442
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,791
Too late! I won't back down!

443
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,416
We're on the same side!

444
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,625
Suzaku Kururugi... is saving me?

445
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,291
We can at least kill Orange!

446
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,416
Lord Jeremiah!

447
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,125
Villetta, thanks!

448
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,083
[SUZAKU]
Still wanna fight?

449
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,041
Men, stand down.

450
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,125
[VILLETTA]
Kewell?

451
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,458
[SUZAKU]
You understand, then?

452
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,375
[KEWELL]
I'm using a chaos mine.

453
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,416
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

454
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,458
No! Stop it now!

455
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,541
What?

456
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,791
[SUZAKU grunting]

457
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,125
That honorary Britannian...

458
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,833
He risked his life for...

459
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,166
[EUPHY] Everyone, lower
your weapons at once!

460
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,333
[EUPHEMIA]
In my name, I command you!

461
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,916
It... can't be.

462
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,375
I am Euphemia Li
Britannia of the empire,

463
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,875
and the third princess
of the royal family!

464
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:56,916
[gasps]

465
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,416
Euphy?

466
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,041
[EUPHEMIA] I'm assuming
command here! Now fall back!

467
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,791
It is her. It's the princess.

468
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,041
Did you know it was her, Lloyd?

469
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,083
[LLOYD]
Uh-huh.

470
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,375
But she's been a
student up until now

471
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,916
and hasn't made her
public debut yet.

472
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,916
We... we're truly...

473
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,416
We're truly sorry,
Your Highness!

474
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,333
[SUZAKU]
My lady!

475
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,833
[EUPHEMIA]
Uh?

476
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,083
I had no idea who you were.
Please forgive me, Princess!

477
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,166
Suzaku, you and I bear
a similar deep pain.

478
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,000
You have lost your father
as I have lost my brother.

479
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,500
[gasps]

480
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,166
Will you let me help
you in your quest

481
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,000
to ensure that no one ever
again has to suffer the loss

482
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,333
of a loved one
on the battlefield?

483
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,541
[SUZAKU] Yes! I'm...
unworthy of your kindness.

484
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,041
[CORNELIA]
I heard what you did, Euphemia.

485
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,916
You shouldn't be so reckless.

486
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,375
[EUPHEMIA] I know, sister.
Forgive me. But...

487
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,291
[CORNELIA] You will
address me as viceroy here,

488
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,041
sub-viceroy Euphemia.

489
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,291
Because we're sisters, we need
to follow a stricter protocol.

490
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,333
Yes. I understand.

491
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,916
[CORNELIA]
Heh.

492
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,166
Now then, give me your report.

493
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,500
Yes. Milady, the first order
of business is a welcome party

494
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,125
we've arranged for
Your Highness and-- Uh!

495
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,291
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

496
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,958
[CORNELIA]
Sloppy. Senile. Corrupt.

497
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:23,458
Where is Zero?! I want the enemy
of the empire caught! Get Zero!

498
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,500
[LELOUCH]
Uh?

499
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,125
[SUZAKU] I'll be joining
the student body here

500
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,500
at Ashford Academy
beginning today.

501
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,750
My name is Suzaku Kururugi.

502
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,041
It's a pleasure to meet you.

503
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,041
[LELOUCH]
Yes. I understand. I'm lying.

504
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,166
To Shirley and Rivalz
and the others.

505
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,250
Even to Suzaku and Nunnally.

506
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,125
But there's no goin' back now.

507
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,583
I can't turn back.

508
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,208
As long as C.C. and I are
bound by our "contract,"

509
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,750
I have to keep at this.

510
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,375
Beause I don't wanna
lie to myself any more.
