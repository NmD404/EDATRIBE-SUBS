1
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,958
[SOLDIER gasps] The capital
Pendragon's been obliterated?!

2
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,333
[SOLDIER 2]
Is it true?!

3
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,833
[SOLDIER 3] They say it
was a F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

4
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,833
[SOLDIER 4] The thing that
wiped out the Tokyo Settlement?

5
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,208
[SOLDIER 2]
An accident?

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,208
[SOLDIER 1] But I heard
the F.L.E.I.J.A.s they built

7
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,083
are all missing now.

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,625
[JEREMIAH]
Stop spreading wild rumors!

9
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,833
[SOLDIERS gasp]

10
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,125
It's imprudent to talk
as if the capital's

11
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,333
been destroyed, even as rumors!

12
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,625
[SAYOKO]
No, I'm afraid it's all true.

13
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,333
What?! You!

14
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,250
Please take me to
Lelouch. It's urgent.

15
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,375
[LELOUCH gasping]

16
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,125
[LELOUCH]
N-Nunnally...

17
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,458
It's you... You're alive!

18
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,458
Yes, thanks to our
brother, Schneizel.

19
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,625
[LELOUCH]
Schneizel...

20
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,083
Nunnally...

21
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,125
Do you understand what
Schneizel has done?

22
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:45,083
Yes. He attacked
the capitol, Pendragon

23
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,791
with a F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

24
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,500
If you know about
that, then why?!

25
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,416
[NUNNALLY]
Do you think that using

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,333
Geass on people is better?!

27
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,166
[grunts]

28
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,791
Both you and big
brother have been

29
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,000
lying to me from the very
beginning, haven't you?

30
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,833
You've kept the truth
from me all this time.

31
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,333
But now I know everything.

32
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,041
[NUNNALLY] Lelouch,
you were Zero all along,

33
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:06,833
weren't you?

34
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,708
[gasps]

35
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,041
[NUNNALLY]
Why?!

36
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,458
Tell me. Were you
doing it for my sake?

37
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,250
Because, if you
were that means--

38
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,291
[laughs] For your sake?

39
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,041
I see my little sister
is presumptuous as ever!

40
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,166
[gasps]

41
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,500
You think it's just
natural for people

42
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,375
to help you all the time
out of sympathy and pity?

43
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,333
It's so easy to criticize others

44
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,916
while you keep your
own hands unsullied.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,250
You are the quintessence

46
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,625
of the privileged aristocrat
that I've rejected.

47
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,541
You... No...

48
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,166
I act for no one's sake!

49
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,041
It is for me, my sake,

50
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,916
that I take the world
into my hands!

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,416
If you choose to stand in my way

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,875
by allying yourself
with Schneizel,

53
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,333
I won't hesitate to
crush you without mercy!

54
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,666
And without regret.

55
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,916
[NUNNALLY]
Lelouch!

56
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,291
[NUNNALLY sighs]

57
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,958
Are you all right, Nunnally?

58
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,250
That must have been
very hard for you, Nunnally.

59
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,208
I thought showing him the
power of the F.L.E.I.J.A.

60
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,041
might convince him to surrender.

61
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,791
[NUNNALLY] Schneizel.
Are the people of Pendragon

62
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,583
really all right?
Are you sure they're safe?

63
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,958
[SCHNEIZEL]
You needn't worry.

64
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,291
We gave warning for them
to evacuate well in advance.

65
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,541
[gasps]

66
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,083
[SCHNEIZEL] Of course,
the damage to the city

67
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,166
was significant, but we
did everything we could

68
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,500
to minimize it.

69
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,333
But, now we'll have to use
the weapon on people,

70
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,875
on Lelouch and his followers...

71
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,708
If they stand in the
way of world peace,

72
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,250
we'll have no choice.

73
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,708
Schneizel, please...

74
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,166
Will you let me have
the F.L.E.I.J.A.

75
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,041
firing switch to hold onto?

76
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,250
[gasps]

77
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,375
I can't fight battles
or defend my country

78
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,291
or my people.
So, at the very least,

79
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,375
I want this sin to
be on my shoulders.

80
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,333
Schneizel, may I please
have a word with you?

81
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,625
Tch!

82
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,750
C.C., why didn't you
find out about Nunnally?!

83
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,708
I'm certainly not a god.

84
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,625
I can only read people
if they're connected

85
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,958
to the power of Geass.

86
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,500
Tch! Schneizel!

87
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,458
You knew but you kept the
truth from me all this time!

88
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,875
Just so you could play this
card at the right moment!

89
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,750
Still, the way that
you shuffled the deck

90
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:13,333
was more than artful. It was
remarkable and effective.

91
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,458
[SUZAKU]
Lelouch.

92
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,958
[grunts]

93
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,083
Our strategic
objective's unchanged.

94
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:18,958
[LELOUCH gasps]

95
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,458
We can't stop this just because

96
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,583
we found out that Nunnally
is still alive...

97
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,916
Or the Zero Requiem
will have no meaning.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,375
[gasps]

99
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,541
Remember your promise!

100
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,708
[C.C.]
Suzaku!

101
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,875
[SUZAKU]
I am his sword.

102
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,833
It's my job to rid
him of his enemies

103
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,166
and his own weakness.

104
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,333
And you, C.C., you
must be his shield.

105
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,375
[C.C.]
Huh?

106
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,750
[SUZAKU]
Your job is to protect him.

107
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,500
We do things as you like.

108
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:50,000
[SUZAKU] Lelouch is your
accomplice, isn't he?

109
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,541
[C.C.]
My accomplice? Huh.

110
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,250
[CECILE] The F.L.E.I.J.A.
they used on Pendragon

111
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,958
had ten times
the effective range

112
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,291
of the one used on
the Tokyo Settlement.

113
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,375
[gasping]

114
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,208
[CECILE] If they haven't
developed a new model, then...

115
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,708
[NINA]
They've removed the limiter?

116
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,041
Bingo.

117
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,875
By removing both
the effect range

118
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,208
and the detonation
time limiter...

119
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,791
Prince Schneizel, how could you?

120
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,291
Yes, what about it?

121
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,041
[gasps] You mean the people
of Pendragon were...!

122
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,958
[SCHNEIZEL]
I made them vanish.

123
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,375
It was better for
them than a life,

124
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,375
swearing loyalty to
Lelouch, wouldn't you say?

125
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,000
[CORNELIA]
They're our own people.

126
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,000
And you told Nunnally--

127
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,416
[SCHNEIZEL]
Lies are expedient.

128
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,791
There's no need to tell Nunnally

129
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,666
things that would get in
the way of her opposition

130
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,250
to Lelouch, is there?

131
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,250
She'll never know
the difference.

132
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,333
[CORNELIA]
You use everyone?

133
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,541
Even your own sister?

134
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,500
Cornelia, what is it
that people truly want?

135
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,333
Starvation and poverty?

136
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:48,333
Discrimination and corruption?
War and terrorism?

137
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,625
They want the problems that are

138
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,083
flooding the world
to go away forever.

139
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,708
People can't
understand each other

140
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,708
under these situations at all.

141
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,958
Your theories don't justify
butchering civilians.

142
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,250
[SCHNEIZEL] Even civilians
who have rejected war

143
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,291
depend on the police,
don't they?

144
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,791
Everyone knows, don't they?

145
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,541
That people are driven
by their own desires.

146
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,750
The lust that dwells
within the soul of man

147
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,291
cannot be denied.

148
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,916
So why win hearts and minds
or tout some shining ideology?

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,958
Why not bring peace to the
world with a system and power?

150
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,875
[gasps]

151
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,458
[chuckles]

152
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,291
[SCHNEIZEL]
In ten days, Damocles will enter

153
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,708
the airspace of the
United States of China,

154
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,416
and then switch over to
a secondary acceleration.

155
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,041
After that, we're
scheduled to ascend

156
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,291
300 kilometers
above the surface.

157
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,541
From there, we will
hit every enemy nation

158
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,625
with F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

159
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,166
Are you insane?!

160
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,541
We only agreed to use
them against Lelouch!

161
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,458
This will destroy the world!

162
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,791
You're trying to control
people through fear!

163
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,958
[SCHNEIZEL]
Mankind's history is war.

164
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,708
Peace is an illusion.

165
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,166
To turn illusion into reality
is an arduous task.

166
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,541
It requires discipline.

167
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,708
[CORNELIA]
And you plan to discipline

168
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,166
the entire human race
all by yourself?!

169
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,125
Only a god could pull that off!

170
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,666
[SCHNEIZEL]
Then I shall become a god.

171
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,666
[gasps]

172
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,375
If that is what
it takes to bring

173
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,958
peace to the world.

174
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,166
You're deranged.

175
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,583
[DIETHARD]
Magnificent!

176
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,416
I knew I was right
to change sides

177
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,708
and support you!

178
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,375
Surpassing Zero's
chaos with a state

179
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,583
of perfect nothingness,

180
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,750
and a kaleidoscopic
transformation!

181
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,625
Prince Schneizel,
we've made contact

182
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,833
with the Black Knights.

183
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,500
They say if you plan
to kill Lelouch,

184
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,250
they're willing to
join you immediately.

185
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,833
Thank you, Kanon.

186
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,958
Those who've experienced
Lelouch's tyranny

187
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,458
first hand will
have no alternative

188
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,458
but to choose the
lesser of evils.

189
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,000
Is that why you
stayed back and let

190
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,875
Lelouch get away
with this until now?!

191
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,750
[SCHNEIZEL] It was a way
to minimize the damage.

192
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,500
But in the end,
if we have to sacrifice

193
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,583
one or two billion
lives to achieve

194
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,083
a state of permanent peace...

195
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,375
You're wrong!

196
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,083
Peace attained by
force is not peace!

197
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,208
[SCHNEIZEL]
This is so sad, Cornelia.

198
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,166
[SAYOKO]
Schneizel outmaneuvered us.

199
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,166
He had another escape
plane as a decoy

200
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,875
during the battle of Tokyo.

201
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,250
And so...

202
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,541
[JEREMIAH] The plane
destroyed by the F.L.E.I.J.A.

203
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,958
was the decoy.

204
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,458
That's right, and now
he's trying to use

205
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,375
Miss Nunnally to
control Master Lelouch.

206
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,291
You're Japanese, aren't you?

207
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,375
Why come to Master Lelouch
instead of the Black Knights?

208
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,875
Uh...

209
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,875
You're devoted to
chivalry as well,

210
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,375
aren't you?

211
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,458
Ah. Perhaps there's
some truth to that.

212
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,791
[gasps]

213
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,375
[C.C.]
I'm impressed.

214
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,000
You didn't drop your mask
in front of Nunnally.

215
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,500
[LELOUCH]
No matter what angle I use

216
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,500
to attack the problem,
the answer is always the same:

217
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,125
The conclusion I came
to then wasn't wrong.

218
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,791
[C.C.] Lelouch, haven't
you done enough?

219
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,125
You've handled this well.

220
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,291
[LELOUCH] You understand
why I'm doing this evil,

221
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,375
don't you? Besides, under
the rule of Democles,

222
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,791
people would become
lifeless puppets.

223
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,583
That's true, but Nunnally
is aboard Damocles.

224
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,500
Everything you've done
from the beginning

225
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,916
was for her.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,250
I can't treat her
differently any longer.

227
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,666
So many people have
died since this began.

228
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,791
For their sakes, we have to
see it through to the end.

229
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,083
Don't we, C.C.?

230
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,791
[sighs]

231
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,791
[C.C.]
Yes. You are right, Lelouch.

232
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,250
[KALLEN] Are you sure you
want to join with us?

233
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,958
It means you'd be
fighting against Britannia.

234
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,500
[GINO]
Y'know, right now...

235
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,083
Huh?

236
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,333
[GINO] Right now, I think
I understand your feelings

237
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,500
just a bit.

238
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,875
Uh...

239
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,291
Uh, well, thanks, I guess.

240
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,291
[GINO]
I beg your pardon?

241
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,458
[XING-KE]
Pendragon was the capital

242
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,375
of the Holy Britannian Empire.
With its destruction,

243
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,541
their internal
government is paralyzed.

244
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,458
[TOHDOH] They're confronting
our Black Knight forces

245
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,875
in every part of the world

246
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,416
so they're pinned
down everywhere.

247
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,916
[XIANG-LIN]
In short, the only force

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,625
Lelouch can deploy against us
is the division he brought

249
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,833
to reoccupy Japan.
But the balance of power

250
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,791
can be tipped for
him at any time.

251
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,416
To minimize damage,
we cannot hesitate.

252
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
The time to confront him is now!

253
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,708
Since Schneizel has
now agreed to join us,

254
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,666
our forces are evenly
matched with the enemy.

255
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,166
Our intention is
not the approval

256
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,041
of the Damocles use
of F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

257
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,375
It's bringing unity to the world

258
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,750
is our first priority.
This battle...

259
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,958
[LELOUCH] This battle
is the ultimate test.

260
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,541
Control of the entire
world at stake!

261
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,958
If we defeat Schneizel
and the Black Knights,

262
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,875
then there will be no one
left to stand in our way!

263
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,250
This world shall be destroyed

264
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,250
and then recreated
by Lelouch, the one,

265
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,166
true emperor of Britannia!

266
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,500
Crush them!

267
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,041
Destroy Schneizel and the
sky fortress Damocles!

268
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,333
Crush them all!

269
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,208
We have nothing to fear!

270
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,250
My name is the
future of this world!

271
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,375
[MASKED SOLDIERS]
All hail Lelouch!

272
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,125
[SCHNEIZEL] Lelouch has
spread malice and turmoil

273
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,750
all across the globe.

274
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:30,125
As the enemy of peace,
he must be wiped out.

275
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,833
It is time for
the Black Knights,

276
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,625
and for us, to cast aside
the grudges of the past

277
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,500
and join forces!

278
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,833
The people of the
world are waiting

279
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,000
for our song of victory!

280
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,625
I pray that, for all
time, this shall be

281
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,333
the last battle in the
last war that mankind

282
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,666
will ever need to fight!

283
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,291
Oh, Lelouch...

284
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,625
I'll make both of
you into records

285
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,625
on my hard drive.

286
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,625
[KANON]
Are you sure Anya

287
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,208
will be all right in the battle?

288
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,375
I know you promised to restore
her memory, Your Highness, but--

289
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,375
[SCHNEIZEL]
We need every bit

290
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,625
of battle strength
we have. So...

291
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,250
[alarms beeping]

292
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,666
Oh? An open channel?

293
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,916
Official greetings, Schneizel.

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,958
[DIETHARD chuckles]

295
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,541
[SCHNEIZEL] Lelouch, if
you're going to surrender,

296
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,250
now is the time.

297
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,791
We have an arsenal
of F.L.E.I.J.A.s,

298
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,083
ready to launch.

299
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,875
F.L.E.I.J.A.s? I wonder
if you dare to use them.

300
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,541
Considering that I
have all the U.F.N.

301
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,041
representatives aboard
the Avalon with me.

302
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,583
He's hiding behind
the hostages he took!

303
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,583
I can't believe
he'd go this far!

304
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,041
So, Schneizel, these
people are from

305
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,583
all over the world.
They're not related to you.

306
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,750
[SCHNEIZEL]
You're right, they're not.

307
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,750
Their lives are a
small price to pay...

308
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,666
Schneizel, you can't attack!

309
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,416
I understand that
the U.F.N. members

310
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,083
have elected
acting representatives

311
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,666
to speak for them.

312
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,958
We're prepared for the worst,
and we know how dire this is.

313
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,500
But that doesn't mean
we're going to throw

314
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,083
their lives away on a gamble!

315
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,791
[LELOUCH laughs]

316
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,583
[SCHNEIZEL] Li Xing-ke,
aside from the Damocles,

317
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,416
our strike force consists
only of the Mordred.

318
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,166
If you're going to tie
our hands so we can't

319
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,416
use the F.L.E.I.J.A.s,
then I request that you

320
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,083
put me in charge of
all our united forces.

321
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,541
[XING-KE]
We're facing Lelouch!

322
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,666
[SCHNEIZEL] Exactly. I've
never lost to Lelouch. Ever.

323
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,666
And I know him far better than
anyone on this battlefield.

324
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,041
[XING-KE]
Understood.

325
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,416
[XING-KE]
Deploy the Shen Hu.

326
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,750
Transmit the command
structure to all forces!

327
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes, sir!

328
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,958
Then, shall we let the
game play out, brother?

329
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,666
[SCHNEIZEL]
Indeed.

330
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,166
Kanon, it's just
as you predicted.

331
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,333
Yes. The Black Knights
are now yours

332
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,625
to command, your highness.

333
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,208
Heh. Transmit pattern
Sigma to all forces.

334
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,333
Enemy fleets are in motion,

335
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,916
deploying into a wide-field
aerial formation.

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,916
He's using conventional
forces. Good.

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,041
Stretch our left wing!

338
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,083
Assume Half-Moon
Spirit formation!

339
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,958
Yes, Your Majesty!

340
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,375
Their main wings
are undermanned.

341
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,291
Have Gino's unit advance.

342
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,750
Keep the enemy's left
wing from extending!

343
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,125
[GINO]
Yes, Your Highness!

344
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,625
Checking my move.

345
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,791
Reverse the direction
of our left wing!

346
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,666
[CECILE]
That'll break up our formation!

347
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,708
[LELOUCH]
Do it!

348
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,333
Gino, halt your advance, now!

349
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,541
[GINO]
But why?

350
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,958
We should strike while
they're in disarray.

351
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,291
[SCHNEIZEL]
It's a false opening.

352
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,083
I'm not buying it.

353
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,291
[LELOUCH]
Not falling for it, huh?

354
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,083
Switch our battle plan
to Ursa Major formation!

355
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,208
Sixth Unit, follow Anya and move

356
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,791
to the northeast,
elevate 40 degrees!

357
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,125
Bombardiers, prep
for anti-air combat!

358
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,750
Anya, stop there, climb
200 meters and stabilize!

359
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,291
[TAMAKI] What the hell?!
Nobody's fighting!

360
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,375
You're wrong.

361
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,041
Contests fought
between two masters

362
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,375
are decided instantly.

363
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,208
An invisible battle
is now raging

364
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,875
between the two of them.

365
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,291
We have to hurry.

366
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,666
They're going to attack
each other any moment now.

367
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,000
They're surrounding us!

368
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,250
Counter move!

369
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,625
Reinforce the front line
with Suzaku's Lancelot!

370
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,083
Hold at combat speed four!
And send out Ward's unit!

371
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,208
Ah-ha, you haven't
changed, Lelouch.

372
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,708
You'd rather attack
my front line

373
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,625
than defend your own flanks.

374
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,541
[SCHNEIZEL]
I now have a small window.

375
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,041
Xing-ke?

376
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,000
[XING-KE]
Heh. He's already incorporated

377
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,291
our skill levels.

378
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,625
The enemy's left wing
is breaking away!

379
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,208
Stand fast!

380
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,458
Live up to His
Majesty's trust in us!

381
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,083
If we can defeat Lelouch,
this will be over!

382
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,083
If we smash their line,
it'll be a free-for-all...!

383
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,541
They're punching through!

384
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,291
They're cutting us to pieces.

385
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,166
Should I have Suzaku fall back?

386
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,750
[LELOUCH] No, that's what
Schneizel wants us to do.

387
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,375
Draw in the battle line!
Fall back and regroup!

388
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,833
Their fleet is damaged
and falling back.

389
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,875
[XING-KE]
Don't lose the momentum!

390
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,083
Push forward!

391
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,958
[HOSTAGES yelping, gasping]

392
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,916
[XING-KE]
Guren, you're too far out!

393
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,750
Match pace with us and
we can surround them!

394
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,125
I understand, but...!

395
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,333
Don't rush!

396
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,583
If we beat their vanguard,
we'll isolate the Avalon!

397
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,958
The Dreadnought is destroyed!
They're breaking through!

398
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,541
So that's how it stands.

399
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,958
I don't wish to engage the Black
Knights as formidable enemies.

400
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,666
However, my side has motive.

401
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,916
[SOLDIER]
For His Majesty!

402
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,416
It's heartrending.

403
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,166
Seeing soldiers controlled
by the false power of Geass.

404
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,333
And so!

405
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,250
[SCHNEIZEL] This is the
moment. Smash both wings.

406
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,500
Bow-mounted hadron
scatter cannon, now set!

407
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,625
[XIANG-LIN]
Move the Seventh Squad

408
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,833
out of the firing angle!

409
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,500
[FUTABA]
Gefjun control synched.

410
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,500
[MINASE]
Ready to fire!

411
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,291
Target both enemy
wings. And fire!

412
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,916
[OHGI] Zero, with all
of us working together,

413
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,541
we can defeat you!

414
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,541
It seems that Lelouch badly

415
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,041
underestimated the fighting
skills of the Black Knights.

416
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,041
Well, Lelouch?

417
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,500
Right.

418
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,125
They've shown great skill,
forcing me to use this plan!

419
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:25,875
Dammit!

420
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,416
Energy chain reaction, below us!

421
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,416
What?!

422
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,250
Impossible! He
timed this to...?!

423
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,000
[TOHDOH] All forces!
Deploy radiant shields!

424
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,541
[TOHDOH growls]

425
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,583
Zero!

426
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,750
[OHGI] I was the one
who first acknowledged

427
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,625
his leadership and encouraged
the others to follow him.

428
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,208
So I'm responsible
for all of this.

429
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,875
But I don't want a new
life caught up in it.

430
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,375
I know this is a
selfish request,

431
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,125
but I want you stay
here on Horai Island.

432
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,458
Please.

433
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,083
[KALLEN]
Ohgi, please respond!

434
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,541
Minami! Rakshata!

435
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,500
It can't be...!

436
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,541
He used the Sakuradite
in the Fuji mines.

437
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,083
Yes he has.

438
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,458
Destroying his own
ground forces as well.

439
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,833
[XING-KE]
I was careless!

440
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,583
So, that was Lelouch's
tactical plan.

441
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,666
But how could he sacrifice
his own forces?!

442
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,000
[C.C.]
This has drastically depleted

443
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,458
the enemy's strength.
Which leaves Damocles...

444
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,833
...wide open.

445
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,708
In reality, it's you
who's been checked.

446
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,625
And you brought it on yourself.

447
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,958
Nunnally, targeting is complete.

448
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,791
Now that the Black Knights
have been smashed,

449
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,083
we must use the
F.L.E.I.J.A.'s power.

450
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,333
[NUNNALLY whimpers]
Yes.

451
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,541
[NUNNALLY]
With this act, I will wipe away

452
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,250
my brother's sins!

453
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,541
Incoming! It's a F.L.E.I.J.A.!

454
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,291
So, he's finally launched.
Special division three!

455
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,083
[MAN ON RADIO]
Yes, Your Majesty!

456
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,250
It's useless.

457
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,666
It can't be stopped;
the F.L.E.I.J.A.

458
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,416
went critical the
moment it was fired

459
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,750
from the Damocles.

460
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,125
[LELOUCH]
Avalon continue to fall back.

461
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,958
All units, charge
at the Damocles.

462
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,375
Force them to keep
launching the F.L.E.I.J.A.

463
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,833
warheads until their
arsenal is empty.

464
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,958
[TAMAKI]
Ohgi! Ohgi!

465
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,625
[KALLEN]
Ohgi, please!

466
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,750
[TAMAKI]
This is no time to play dead!

467
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,166
[OHGI] I-I don't believe it.
You two shielded us?

468
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,291
[laughs] We were only
able to protect

469
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,208
the bridge though, eh?
You're on your own now.

470
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,375
Hang in there. Let's go...!

471
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,750
[TAMAKI]
Kallen!

472
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,083
[KALLEN] Oh, great...
Who's the guy giving orders?

473
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,333
[LELOUCH] Tch. Now that
I've used the Fuji plan,

474
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,083
and considering the number
of the remaining F.L.E.I.J.A.

475
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,500
warheads, I'm at a
disadvantage of one move.

476
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,791
Meaning, I have to
depend on Nina now.

477
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,583
Can she do it?
I know she hates me.

478
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,875
Detests me for being
Zero, Euphy's murderer.

479
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,083
The enemy of her precious
Britannia which I now rule.

480
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,375
And yet, to defeat Schneizel...

481
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,625
I wonder... Do you really think
you can defeat me, Lelouch?

482
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,458
Because if you do, you're
at the end of your path.

483
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,208
A man who has not
mastered the use

484
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,666
of the mask can never prevail.

485
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,083
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku and I...

486
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,958
Together, there was
nothing we couldn't do.

487
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,291
That's what I thought.

488
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,666
But now, Schneizel has
proven an unrelenting foe.

489
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,125
The truth is, it's his
detachment, his lack of desire.

490
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,625
A man coldly focused,

491
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,291
who understands
Geass and possesses

492
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:11,208
the F.L.E.I.J.A.s. What
strategy does he pursue?

493
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,625
Is there any tactic
that can work

494
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:13,875
on a battlefield
where F.L.E.I.J.A.s

495
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,375
rain down from the sky?

496
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,291
I have one last gamble,
one final card to play.

497
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,833
And it lies within
Schneizel's own heart.
