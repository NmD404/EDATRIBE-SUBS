00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,458
[NARRATOR]
The date was August 10

2
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,666
in the year 2010 of
the Imperial calendar.

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,541
The Holy Britannian Empire had
just declared war upon Japan.

4
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,833
Confronted by Britannia's
newest weapon,

5
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,666
the formidable Knightmare Frame,

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,500
Japan fell to its enemy
in less than a month.

7
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,000
The conquered
nation was stripped

8
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,375
of its freedom, rights,
culture, and dignity.

9
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,375
Finally, even its name
was taken away.

10
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,958
Eleven.

11
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,750
The name of Japan and its people
was replaced with a mere number.

12
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,916
[LELOUCH]
I don't understand

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,625
what it is you wanted me to do?

14
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,375
Why did you give me
this bizarre power?

15
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,458
[explosion]

16
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,875
[LELOUCH gasps]

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,125
[gasps]

18
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,208
How could all these
royal guard be dead?!

19
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,916
[VILLETTA]
What happened here, boy?!

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,750
And why is a Britannian student
in a place like this?!

21
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,833
Are you deaf?!
Answer me, or I'll--

22
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:05,875
[grunts]

23
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,666
[VILLETTA]
Answer me!

24
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,625
I order you to
come out! At once!

25
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,625
Who the hell do you
think you are to order me?

26
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,833
[LELOUCH]
I see.

27
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,708
It only works with
direct eye contact.

28
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,625
[LELOUCH]
My name is Alan Spacer.

29
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,250
My father's a duke.

30
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,458
Nobility.

31
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,958
[LELOUCH] My I.D. card's
in my breast pocket.

32
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,666
After you confirm who I am,
I'll request your protection.

33
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,541
[VILLETTA]
Keep your hands up in the air.

34
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,083
I'll take out your I.D.

35
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,291
Now then, hand your
Knightmare over to me.

36
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,666
Understood.

37
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,583
The code number is XG21G2D4.

38
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,916
Got it.

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
[gasps]

40
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,458
What the--?

41
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,416
So, are we having a bad day?!

42
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
[SUZAKU]
Uh.

43
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,416
[LLOYD]
Looks like you missed a chance

44
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,041
to go heaven, Private Kururugi.

45
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,083
[SUZAKU]
I did? Uh.

46
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:20,666
Where...?

47
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,708
[LLOYD]
Hm? Ah.

48
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,791
We're still in
the Shinjuku ghetto.

49
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,041
[CECILE]
With Prince Clovis nearby,

50
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,333
this is probably the
safest place anywhere.

51
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,916
This is what saved
your life, Mr. Suzaku.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,875
You're lucky it was
under your protective suit

53
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,791
because that's what
deflected the bullet.

54
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,333
Is it a keepsake?

55
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,916
Yeah. Very.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,250
[LLOYD] You Elevens believe that
gods live inside of everything,

57
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,500
even objects, don't you?
I guess this one--

58
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,916
Is Lelou--?

59
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,666
What's the latest
on the situation?

60
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,208
[LLOYD] It looks like the
poison gas was released.

61
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,166
Massive Eleven casualties
have been reported.

62
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,416
[CECILE] They haven't caught
the perpetrators yet.

63
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,916
They haven't, huh? Not yet...

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,500
[LLOYD]
Private Kururugi,

65
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,583
how much experience do you have
in piloting a Knightmare Frame?

66
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,000
[SUZAKU]
Wha--?

67
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,083
But... there's no way an Eleven
would be made a knight.

68
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,041
Well, supposing you could.

69
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,708
Congratulations!

70
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,375
The only Knightmare
of its kind awaits you!

71
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,416
Once you take the controls
of this big beauty,

72
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,375
everything will change.
You and your world.

Whether you want it to or not.

74

Those damned Brittanians!

[OHGI] Kallen! Can
the Glasgow still move?!

76
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,375
Don't worry, Ohgi, it's
all right! I'll decoy them!

77
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,458
Get the people out of here!

78
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,958
The only ones
that'll be captured

79
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,250
are those us in the resistance!

80
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,500
I know, but we're trapped!

81
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,375
They've got us
completely surrounded!

[TV AUDIENCE laughing]

83
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,458
[BOB] When that happens,
use this sticker.

84
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,000
[JACK]
What's that for?

85
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,166
[GIRL 1] That's because you
don't have enough leg strength,

86
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,500
right?

87
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,708
[GIRL 2] You're wrong.
You sink when you get fat.

[SHIRLEY]
Uh, Lelou?

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,500
Uh, what in the world
have you been doing?

92
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,875
Where are you now?

93
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,083
If you keep cutting class,
you'll get held back.

94
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,083
[LELOUCH]
Are you near a TV?

95
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,416
[SHIRLEY]

[LELOUCH]
The news.

102
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,625
Is there anything
about Shinjuku?

Why is it restricted?

I dunno. They're not saying.

107

[LELOUCH]
I get it.

108
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,708
Once they finish everything off,

109
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,375
they'll release news
that favors the military.

how dangerous that is!

tell my little sister that
I'm gonna be home late tonight,

Why does he always
hang up on me like that?!

called is beyond service range.

Oh, darn it, not this again.

122
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,833
[LELOUCH] They need to keep
a lid on this information,

123
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,541
so it'll be hard for them
to call in reinforcements.

124
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,041
They'll have to make do with the
pieces they have on the board.

125
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,333
But I'm hemmed in here,

126
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,541
it'll be tough to break
through by myself.

127
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,333
Gaining refuge carries
its own risk, too.

bein' dragged into your fight.

just gonna have to trust me!

supposed to do now?

If you simply run away,

offer in the way of sport.

this guy a chance!

176
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,125
[KALLEN]
All this...

177
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,125
But how...?

178
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,291
[LELOUCH]
Woman in the Glasgow.

179
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,500
Y-Yes!

180
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,791
[LELOUCH]
Stay where you are.

181
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,125
Your unit's gonna run
decoy, you got that?

182
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,250
[KALLEN]
Understood.

183
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,500
[LELOUCH]
Energy filler status?

184
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,916
[KALLEN]
About 15 minute's worth.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,458
[LELOUCH]
Then recharge it.

186
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,458
In ten minutes, I'll contact you
with your next instructions.

187
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,083
[sighs]

188
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,375
This is wearing me out.

189
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,750
Regardless, I'll need
determination to succeed.

190
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,166
After all, I'm betting
my life in this game.

191
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,250
[BARTLEY] The terrorists are
mixed among the Eleven populace

192
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,666
and they're mounting a minor
resistance against us.

193
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,833
But they pose little threat
to our vastly superior army.

194
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,000
[CLOVIS]
We know that. Moving on...

195
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,583
[BARTLEY]
Understood, Your Highness.

196
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,666
The gas capsules will be--

197
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,041
[CLOVIS]
What the public thinks.

198
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,250
[BARTLEY] Yes. We'll keep
searching for her.

199
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,791
Either way, I want her
captured, dead or alive.

200
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,166
[TAMAKI] Hey, are you certain
about this whole thing?

201
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,500
They've all had their IFF's
removed. What if this is a trap?

202
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,791
[OHGI] The other side has
total advantage in this war.

203
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,708
They don't need
to set any traps!

204
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,041
All right, people, let's move!
Get to your assigned points--

205
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,541
[LELOUCH]
P-1, can you move?

206
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,416
It operates basically the
same as what you're used to.

207
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,916
[OHGI]
Can't you tell us who you are?

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,750
At least your name.

209
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,000
[LELOUCH]
I can't do that.

210
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,958
What if these signals
are being intercepted?

211
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,500
Any way, if Q-1 is on
schedule, enemy Sutherlands,

212
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,041
probably two of them, will
reach you in 23 seconds.

213
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,750
Shoot them through the wall.

214
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,791
Aah! He's outta his mind!

215
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,250
[OHGI] Everyone,
double-check your weapons.

216
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,958
What?! Are you serious?!

217
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,291
[OFFICER A]
Enemy spotted at point F-31.

218
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,166
A feint, eh? How pedestrian.

219
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,625
[BARTLEY] Tell Lazlo
squad to go straight in!

220
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,708
Have Eugen and Valerie
strike from the rear!

221
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:52,083
Three... two... one... Fire!

222
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,750
[EUGEN]
What?!

223
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,916
[OFFICER A] Sir Eugen
and Sir Valerie, both lost.

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,208
Huh? An ambush?

225
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,583
[LELOUCH chuckles]

226
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,416
[LELOUCH] An I.D. signal
can be a double-edged sword.

227
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Besides, if the terrorists
follow the orders I issue,

228
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,625
my task at hand is
sure to be completed.

229
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,750
[LELOUCH] P-1, P-4, P-7,
move 100 meters to the right.

230
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,083
Fire your slash harkens
toward three o'clock.

231
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,375
You heard him!
Do what the voice says!

232
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,250
Damn, what else does
he want us to do?!

233
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,916
[LELOUCH]
P-5, ready?

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,416
[TAMAKI]
Agh! Quit callin' me that!

235
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,541
[SOLDIER 1]
They're using the same--

236
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,833
[OFFICER B]
The enemy's moving towards G-28!

237
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,291
Send Lazlo squad--
I mean Glaube squad!

238
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,958
This means... terrorists
have our military weaponry?

239
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,666
[OFFICER C]
Sir Glaube has ejected!

240
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,166
His unit's been lost!

241
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,125
Change our codes! They're
intercepting our transmission!

242
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,208
[OFFICER D] We already
have, sir! Four times!

243
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,291
[BARTLEY]
Do it again!!

244
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,666
[CLOVIS]
This failure is unacceptable!

245
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,291
Forgive me!

246
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,333
Good afternoon!

247
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,375
[BARTLEY]
What is it?!

248
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,875
We're in the middle
of an operation!

249
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,666
I'd say it's time to deploy
the ASEEC's special weapon.

250
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,583
We've no time for
this right now!

251
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,583
[LELOUCH]
R-2, fire anchor.

252
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,916
B-7, use U.N. ordnance.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,916
N-Group, you'll
continue your advance.

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,625
[REBELS yelling]

255
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,875
[LAZLO SQUAD yelling]

256
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,791
[STAFF OFFICER A]
We just lost Lazlo squad!

257
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,458
So do it! We'll have to
bring up Quincy's squad!

258
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,916
My lord, that will
break the encirclement!

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,583
Now then. The enemy has
five options. Their move...

260
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,583
[CLOVIS]
Reinforce the breach

261
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,541
with some of the
units guarding me.

262
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,666
All we know for certain is
that enemy forces are here.

263
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,708
Who ordered them
to break formation?

264
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:48,416
[LELOUCH] Well, that's a more
stupid move than I expected.

265
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,541
You, Q-1, do you
have an area map?

266
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,791
Yes, I have a map
of the old town.

267
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,500
But it has no current landmarks.

268
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,708
[LELOUCH]
It'll do.

269
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,458
All right. Send in Bertz
and the others, too!

270
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,791
Mission number three now.

271
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,000
Concentrate our forces
there! Surround them!

272
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,666
Is everything prepared?

273
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,625
[CLOVIS] The enemy's main
force is that center dot.

274
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,125
Finish every one of them off!

275
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,250
[chuckles]

276
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,125
What?! Where's the enemy?!

277
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,875
With this, I call check.

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,958
[CLOVIS gasps]

279
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,708
[LELOUCH laughing]

280
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,458
My plan worked, didn't it?

281
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:42,916
I can do it! I can!
I can defeat Britannia!

282
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,916
[CLOVIS]
Who...?

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,458
Who in hell am I up against?!

284
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,791
What if... he's even
better than Tohdoh?!

285
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,666
[CLOVIS]
Lloyd!

286
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,291
[LLOYD]
Yes, Your Highness?

287
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,416
[CLOVIS]
Can it win?

288
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,583
Will your toy beat them?

289
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,916
[LLOYD]
Hmph.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,916
My lord. Please be so kind
as to call it Lancelot.

291
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,250
[COMM 1]
Z-0-1 Lancelot, now activating.

292
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,375
Lancelot activating.
Releasing hatch.

293
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,916
Z-0-1 Lancelot,
stand by for activation.

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,208
Pallet extension, initiating.

295
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,625
[CECILE]
Did you read the manual?

296
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,541
[SUZAKU]
Pretty much.

297
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,916
[CECILE]
Well done.

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,083
You scored at the top of
the class in the simulator.

299
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,458
Hey, look, about what
you told me earlier--

300
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,916
[CECILE]
Huh?

301
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,041
Ah... It could be, but the
possibility is nearly zero.

302
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,791
[SUZAKU] But that means
there's still a chance, right?

303
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,833
[CECILE]
Yes, I'm afraid that's true.

304
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,125
Even so, you're not to
do anything reckless.

305
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,833
The new system is not outfitted
with an ejection mechanism.

306
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,166
[SUZAKU]
Okay. I understand, Miss Cecile.

307
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,791
That's it?

308
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,041
[CECILE] Yes. The advanced
weapon developed by us

309
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,083

generation Knightmare Frame.

311
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,791
[LLOYD]
Well, if you're ready, Suzaku,

312
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,125
shall we proceed with
the initial start-up?

313
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,791
Initial start-up now
proceeding from phase 20.

314
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,875

344
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,916
[LELOUCH]
Hm? Reinforcements?

345
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,750
Real battle is
different, isn't it?

346
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,750
[LELOUCH]
Status.

347
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,000
[TERRORIST 1]
Everyone ejected,

348
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,958
but they took out four
units in nothing flat!

349
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,916
[LELOUCH]
Enemy numbers?

350
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,958
[TERRORIST 1]
Just one!

351
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,208
I think it's a new model.

352
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,083
Never seen anything like-- Ah!

353
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,333
[gasps] What's
happening out there?!

354
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,125
[TERRORIST 2]
Bastard!

355
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,708
What?! It reflects bullets?

356
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,375
[TERRORIST 2]
Ah! What do we do?!

357
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,208
Ishida!

358
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,375
[TERRORIST 2 screams]

359
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,458
[LELOUCH]
Useless so-called terrorists.

360
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,791
With all the
resources they have,

361
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,125
they're being
beaten by one unit.

362
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,833
[TERRORIST 3]
Dammit!

363
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,125
Yes, I can do this!

364
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,041
With Lancelot, I can
stop all this at once!

365
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,041
[LELOUCH]
N-4, N-5, hold there.

366
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,416
When the rear units arrive,
surround that thing!

367
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,583
[TERRORIST 4]
Gotcha.

368
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,166
[TERRORIST 5]
We can't stop it!

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,333
N-units, what is it?!

370
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,916
[static]

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,625
What happened?
Something I didn't foresee?

372
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,208
[CLOVIS]
For heaven's sake...

373
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,333
Now I'll owe my older brother
a debt I don't need to incur.

374
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,000
It's for the best, though.

375
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,041
[screaming]

376
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,041
[LELOUCH]
P-1, report!

377
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,750
The enemy...

378
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,041
Can it really be
only one unit?

379
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,208
These readings are even
higher than predicted.

380
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:58,375
It's because our pilot is
taking his job very seriously.

381
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,875
[SUZAKU] If I can stop
all of the Knightmares,

382
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,583
then this battle is over.

383
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,916
No matter what it takes,

384
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,666
I've gotta save Lelouch
and that girl.

385
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,708
Uh?

386
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:15,833
[gasps]

387
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,958
You mean this thing's
what's ruining my plan?!

388
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,250
Are you the guy
that's in command?

389
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,458
Nothing more than a
pilot! How dare he!

390
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,208
No choice, I've gotta
get outta here!

391
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,166
Hey! I'm returning the favor!

392
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,708
I can't--!

393
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,916
[LELOUCH]
I must remember that.

394
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,333
The most vital element
in battle is the human one.

395
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,916
--[phone ringing]
--[LELOUCH] Uh?!

396
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,416
That damn monster's unstoppable!

397
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,750
Bastard! He's tearing
things up for no reason!

398
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,791
--[phone ringing]
--[SUZAKU] Huh?

399
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,333
[WOMAN screaming]

400
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,750
[LELOUCH] In the midst of
battle, he rescues someone?

401
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,416
Hmph. I'll concede you
the tactical victory here.

402
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,083
Nevertheless...

403
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,958
Huh? He saved someone?

404
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,625
Yes. So it would seem.

405
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,666
[LLOYD]
Hmm...

406
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,958
It's very strange of him.

407
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,083
[WOMAN screaming]

408
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,083
[gasps]

409
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,333
[CECILE]
Suzaku?

410
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,541
Are you tired? We'll
call it quits for today.

411
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,750
[SUZAKU] No,I'm fine.
Please let me keep going.

412
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,458
[LLOYD] Be careful with
his operational time!

413
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,958
[CECILE]
Yes, sir!

414
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,166
[LLOYD] My, that boy's an
excellent piece of equipment.

415
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,458
[GUARD]
Stop there! Your I.D.

416
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,208
This is Prince Clovis'
personal transport!

417
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,000
[LELOUCH]
At last, the checkpoint.

418
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,875
And barely guarded, per my plan.

419
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:14,708
Your plan?

420
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,708
[LELOUCH]
That's right.

421
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,000
Now, I'd like you
to let me pass.

422
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,291
Yes, sir. Understood.

423
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:25,791
Kallen!

424
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,250
[ELEVEN MAN 1]
It's your fault!

425
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,791
This is what happens when
you oppose the Britannians!

426
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,375
[TAMAKI]
What?! Why, you gutless coward!

427
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,416
How many people were
killed because of this?!

428
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,125
Shut up! Do you know how many
of us were killed or captured?!

429
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,666
Do ya?!

430
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,708
Quit cryin'!

431
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,416
Ohgi, who was
that voice we heard?

432
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,833
[OHGI]
Damned if I know.

433
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,791
He doesn't answer when I call,
so maybe he bought it.

434
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:45,875
[gasps]

435
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,625
There, you see?!

436
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,333
Instead of following somebody
we don't even know,

437
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,500
we should've used
the poison gas!

438
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,458
But he--

439
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,416
Damn Nagata to hell!

440
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,125
[COMMANDER]
So, this is where

441
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,875
you Eleven vermin
scurried off to.

442
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,791
Prepare to fire!

443
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,625
Naoto!

444
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,000
Commence--

445
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,166
[CLOVIS] Attention, all forces!
Cease fire at once!

446
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,208
Uh?

447
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,500
[SUZAKU]
Cease fire?

448
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,375
[CLOVIS] I, Clovis,
third prince of Brittania,

449
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:20,041
and royal viceroy of Area 11,
hereby command you!

450
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,041
All forces are ordered
to cease fire at once!

451
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,291
You will also cease destruction
of any buildings or property!

452
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,000
All casualties, whether
Britannian or Eleven,

453
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,791
shall be treated equally
and without prejudice!

454
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,875
In the name of
Clovis La Britannia,

455
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,750
you are hereby ordered!
Cease fire at once!

456
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,583
I shall allow no
further fighting!

457
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,958
Are you satisfied?

458
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,875
[LELOUCH]
Very. Well done.

459
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,083
[CLOVIS]
And what shall we do now?

460
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,333
Sing a few lively ballads?

461
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,208
Or perhaps a nice
game of chess.

462
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,000
[LELOUCH]
That has a familiar ring.

463
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,041
[CLOVIS]
Hm?

464
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,083
[LELOUCH]
Don't you recall?

465
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,000
The two of us used to play
chess together as boys.

466
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,958
Of course, I would always win.

467
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,125
[CLOVIS]
What?

468
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,083
[LELOUCH]
Remember? At the Aries villa?

469
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,708
You...

470
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,958
Who are you?

471
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,375
[LELOUCH]
It's been a long time...

472
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,708
...big brother.

473
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,166
[gasps]

474
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,916
[LELOUCH] The eldest son of
the late Consort Marianne

475
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,958
and 17th in line to
the imperial throne.

476
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,500
Lelouch vi Britannia,
at your service.

477
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,500
[CLOVIS]
Lelouch? But-But I thought--

478
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,500
[LELOUCH]
That I was dead? You were wrong.

479
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,916
[LELOUCH]
I have returned, Your Highness.

480
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,708
And I've come back
to change everything.

481
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,333
[LELOUCH]
How could a single student

482
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,750
ever be able to
change the world?

483
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,208
It isn't realistic.

484
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,375
Just think about it for a
moment, and you'll see that.

485
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,250
Nevertheless...

486
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,875
Now that I hold the advantage...

487
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,000
...there may be a strategic
move I need to play.
