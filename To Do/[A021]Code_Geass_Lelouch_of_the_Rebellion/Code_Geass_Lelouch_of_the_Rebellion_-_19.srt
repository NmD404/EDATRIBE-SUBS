1
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,500
[groans]

2
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,250
[SUZAKU]
Where's the Lancelot?

3
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,208
[SUZAKU]
Zero!

4
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,500
It's no use.

5
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,583
I can't remember anything.

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,375
[LELOUCH]
Where am I?

7
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,500
[SUZAKU]
Just as I thought.

8
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,916
This is another island.

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,041
[LELOUCH]
The vegetation and climate

10
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,250
are the same
as Shikine Island.

11
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,791
We can't be that far from it.

12
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,750
[SUZAKU] There's no way to
contact anyone without an incom.

13
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,416
But what's more important
right now is to find

14
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,916
a source of drinkable
water and shelter.

15
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,708
[SUZAKU gasps]

16
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,541
[SUZAKU]
Kallen? It can't be.

17
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,208
Excuse me!

18
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,333
Suzaku?

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,375
A Black Knight uniform?!

20
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,083
You mean that you're a-- 

21
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,000
[KALLEN growls]

22
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,125
I don't believe it.

23
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,041
It's really you?

24
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,166
[KALLEN growls]

25
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,375
[KALLEN gasps]

26
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,708
[KALLEN yells]

27
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,583
Kallen!

28
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,916
Kallen Stadtfeld,
I don't believe it! You're--

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,041
[KALLEN]
Don't call me by that name!

30
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,583
Kallen Kouzuki's my real name!

31
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,083
I'm Japanese!

32
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,458
You're kidding,
then you really are...

33
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,291
[KALLEN]
Yes!

34
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,458
I'm a Black Knight, got it?!

35
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,041
I'm not going to
hide that anymore!

36
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,375
Well then, Kallen Kouzuki,
I'm placing you under arrest,

37
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,125
for conspiracy and rebellion
against Britannia!

38
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,541
[LELOUCH]
Tsk!

39
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,916
Contacting Ohgi and the others
is going to be a chore.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,416
Although...

41
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,458
I suppose I could pass myself
off as an ordinary person

42
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,000
and ask the Britannian
forces to rescue me.

43
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,041
Huh?

44
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,750
[SUZAKU]
I see.

45
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,083
Then you don't know
what happened, either.

46
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,666
When you came to, you found
yourself on this island.

47
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,125
Is that right?

48
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,166
[KALLEN] So then you're
stranded here, too, huh?

49
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,458
Serves you right.

50
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,833
When my people get here,

51
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,833
you're the one
who'll be a prisoner!

52
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,666
[SUZAKU] You mean Zero
will come to save you?

53
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,833
Without a doubt.

54
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,375
Okay, before he does,
tell me one thing.

55
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,291
Tell me who he really is.

56
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,291
[KALLEN] Why don't you
find out for yourself?

57
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,791
[SUZAKU]
Oh, I see.

58
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,791
You don't know, either.

59
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,958
[KALLEN]
How did...?

60
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,875
I knew it.

61
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,083
[KALLEN]
You tricked me?

62
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,708
Isn't masking one's
identity a bigger fraud?

63
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,125
I'm curious,
why do you follow Zero?

64
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,916
[KALLEN] I dunno.
Figure it out for yourself.

65
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,750
[EUPHEMIA]
Lelouch.

66
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,500
Lelouch, it's you, isn't it?

67
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,791
I haven't told
anyone about you. I swear!

68
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,208
Please... before you shoot...

69
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,708
Let me at least see your face.

70
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,458
[EUPHEMIA gasps]

71
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,291
Lelouch!

72
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,041
[COORDINATOR A]
Underground probe radar team,

73
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,541
move from section D
to section F.

74
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,375
[COORDINATOR B] Establish
a 5 second silent interval...

75
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,541
[FAYER]
Find her!

76
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,166
Whatever it takes,
find Princess Euphemia!

77
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,083
Why couldn't she behave the way

78
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:18,291
a sub-viceroy figurehead
is expected to?!

79
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,458
What a situation!

80
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,916
If Princess Cornelia
hears about this...

81
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,833
[LLOYD]
Oh, my!

82
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,666
Who would have imagined
a floating aircraft carrier?

83
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,958
You told me to gather data
before practical application.

84
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,375
Correct?

85
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,416
Because I'm extremely interested
in whatever you create.

86
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,666
I needed to see if
this could be made real.

87
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,166
And the hadron cannon?

88
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,375
We wanted to know
if the thing worked.

89
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,000
[SCHNEIZEL] I've been looking
forward to meeting you,

90
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,208
Ms. Cecile Croomy.

91
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,166
I am--

92
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,375
Prince Schneizel?!
Right here?!

93
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,916
You impudent little--!

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,666
How dare you look down upon
the second prince of the empire!

95
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,333
G-General Bartley!

96
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,416
[yells]

97
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,666
Nice one.

98
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,625
[CECILE groans]

99
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,625
[SCHNEIZEL]
You're not injured, I hope.

100
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,333
Yes, I am Prince
Schneizel el Britannia.

101
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,458
Please, give me your hand.

102
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,625
Yes...

103
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,416
Ugh! She's unworthy!

104
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,375
General, you're quite the
devoted subject, aren't you?

105
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,291
Primarily because
the prince is the one

106
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,000
who commuted my
sentence and saved me

107
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,916
from being chained up
deep beneath Temple Tower!

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,333
I wish you'd stop
thinking of me so formally.

109
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,500
You've been a great help
to me in this current matter,

110
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,166
as you were to
my brother Clovis.

111
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,250
It is I who
am grateful to you.

112
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,625
[BARTLEY]
M-My lord...!

113
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,333
Please, Bartley.

114
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,833
[SCHNEIZEL] Now, my lady Cecile,
if you'll excuse me.

115
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,625
Y-Your Highness!

116
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,791
Farewell.

117
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,166
You can wait for me
at the base, Cecile.

118
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,541
Huh? Where are you going?

119
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,125
[LLOYD]
Just a little errand.

120
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,208
While I'm doing that, I'll use
the Avalon to look for Suzaku.

121
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,750
It's hard to find
devicers like that young man,

122
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,416
especially after
yesterday's exploits!

123
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,791
[CECILE]
Please wait.

124
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,583
Were those orders yesterday
issued by the prince?

125
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,000
Silence!

126
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,833
You don't want to be in
contempt of royalty, do you?!

127
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,833
Those orders
were mine, Miss Cecile.

128
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,208
I also fired the hadron.

129
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,833
Even in a situation like that,
priorities mustn't be forgotten.

130
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,791
Besides, if something
anomalous happened,

131
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,750
we would have still
been able to rescue him.

132
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,416
That's what I gambled on.

133
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
He is, after all,
Suzaku Kururugi,

134
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,125
ace pilot of the Special Corps
and Euphy's knight.

135
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,500
Yes, my lord. I understand now.

136
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,333
And I sorely regret my rudeness.

137
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,250
I accept any
punishment you decree.

138
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,625
Nonsense.

139
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,541
It's my fault for not
protecting my subordinates.

140
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,708
Can you ever forgive me?

141
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,666
[LELOUCH]
When did you figure it out?

142
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,625
[EUPHEMIA]
Back during the hotel jacking.

143
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,958
[LELOUCH]
I see...

144
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,958
At that time, I said
too much without thinking.

145
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,958
[EUPHEMIA] Still, I wasn't
convinced until now.

146
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,916
[LELOUCH]
Hmph. I'm naïve as well.

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,541
Even so, why didn't you
discuss it with Cornelia?

148
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,375
I didn't because my
sister never listens to me.

149
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,958
Besides that...

150
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,833
I think things are
depressing enough as they are.

151
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,833
Nunnally? How is she?

152
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,458
[LELOUCH]
She's living with me.

153
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,208
But she's still
blind and crippled.

154
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,666
The hatred you
must feel for us...

155
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,541
I only want to
find out one thing.

156
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,291
Do you know anything
about the circumstance

157
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,750
in which my mother was murdered?

158
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,291
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,333
It seems my sister's
investigated it

160
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,958
extensively, though.

161
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,958
Cornelia thought
a lot of Lady Marianne

162
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,000
and really looked up to her.

163
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,708
[EUPHEMIA] May I ask you
something now?

164
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,083
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

165
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,083
[EUPHEMIA]
Are you Zero?

166
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,416
Or... or are you...?

167
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,416
I'm Lelouch.

168
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,375
Yeah.

169
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,000
Right here and now, I'm Lelouch,

170
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,125
the brother that
you know, Euphy.

171
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,791
Oh, Lelouch...

172
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,875
[crying]

173
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,208
[stomach growling]

174
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,250
I believe feeling relieved
has made me hungry.

175
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,166
Are you sure
that this will work?

176
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,625
From the paw prints
and droppings,

177
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,333
I can tell that wild
animals use this path.

178
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,250
I plan to set up a trap

179
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,625
that dates back
to Medieval times!

180
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,666
[EUPHEMIA]
Oh...

181
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,666
Gotcha, haha!

182
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,166
Oh wow! You're not bad at that!

183
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,958
Do you wanna try it, too?

184
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,458
I tell ya what,

185
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,791
I'll let you loose if you
promise to help me find food.

186
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:13,416
Is that a deal?

187
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Hmph.

188
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,875
You're not gonna
win me over, so why try?

189
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,666
What do you take me for?

190
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,208
[SUZAKU]
Man, you're stubborn!

191
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,708
You're not anything like
the way you are at school!

192
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,083
Even using... a lever...

193
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,166
Why don't you let me
help you with that?

194
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,541
Manual... labor isn't...
for a... royal princess.

195
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,750
Don't worry.
My method's perfect.

196
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,125
Well, I suppose...

197
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,416
I could go and search
for something, like fruit!

198
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,750
Okay?

199
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,208
Be careful, Euphy!

200
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,541
Right!

201
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,708
[SONAR OP]
Enemy battleship has passed us.

202
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,958
[TAMAKI]
You've gotta be kidding!

203
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,625
A battleship that
can hover in midair?

204
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,708
That's great!

205
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,625
We can't remain
in this area any longer.

206
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,958
The risk is too great.
We should pull out of here.

207
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,083
[OHGI]
Mmhmm.

208
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,625
Ohgi. I disagree.

209
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,750
We ought to at least stay put
and look for Zero.

210
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,166
He has a point.

211
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,958
But we can't send out a
search party in this situation.

212
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,583
Even though we're able to hide,
thanks to Rakshata,

213
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,958
there's no guarantee Zero
and Kallen are still alive.

214
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,583
One wrong step, and we
threaten the very existence

215
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,416
of our organization.

216
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
What do you mean?!

217
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,375
It's entirely
the other way around.

218
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,125
This entire organization
is built around Zero!

219
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,208
It's not a group
without members!

220
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,041
The way you speak, you sound
like a typical Britannian to me.

221
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,666
[DIETHARD]
All right, then, answer me this.

222
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,875
We have followers
of almost every ideology

223
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,333
under the sun gathered here.

224
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,083
Yet how is it that
the whole lot of them

225
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,958
can cooperate and work
together toward the same goal?

226
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,958
Because of the results we get?

227
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,041
Tell me, who is it
that gets us those results?

228
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,166
[TOHDOH] I'll be the first
to admit that he does!

229
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,375
But is he worth
the lives of everyone?

230
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,916
At times, the life
of a single man

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
is worth more than
those of a million.

232
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,208
I thought that would be
common sense to a soldier!

233
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,583
You dare say that here?!

234
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,541
Easy, guys.

235
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,208
[C.C.] Oh, all right,
then I'll tell you.

236
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,541
He's very much alive.

237
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,166
We've no time for
your wishful thinking.

238
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,625
The information's true.
I simply know it.

239
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,541
Oh, you're an oracle now?

240
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,000
I told you to shut your trap

241
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,500
and to get some training
on a Knightmare, you dumbass!

242
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,333
[C.C.]
Dumbass? Oh really?

243
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,583
It's been ages since
anyone's dared to refer to me

244
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,958
in such a rude manner.

245
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,708
[TAMAKI] Like Zero's
mistress has any right

246
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,083
to get uppity with us!

247
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,625
[C.C.]
I said you were wrong.

248
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,416
You're a man who
only has vulgar ideas.

249
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,541
You've got a lot of nerve

250
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,000
talking to your
superior like that!

251
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,666
Look, this whole conversation's
gotten out of hand!

252
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,791
Okay, how about this?

253
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,416
We hang in a safe zone.

254
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,625
An ocean area just out
of detection range

255
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,125
where we wait until
the end of tomorrow.

256
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,791
How does that sound
for a time limit?

257
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,833
All right.

258
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,750
Well, I suppose
we have no choice.

259
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,166
[ALL chattering]

260
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,583
[C.C.]
For heaven's sake!

261
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,625
I was forced to talk
with that boring little man,

262
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,583
thanks to your silly prank.

263
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,458
You sent Kallen to the island?

264
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,791
You have very poor taste

265
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,041
for being such
an imperious observer.

266
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,875
[EUPHEMIA] What's wrong?
They're quite tasty!

267
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,500
[EUPHEMIA]
I'm sure you'll be able to make

268
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,291
your pitfall trap tomorrow.

269
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,583
[KALLEN] Oh...
I can't eat another bite!

270
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,916
Boy, am I stuffed!

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,916
So is this a glimpse
of what you're really like?

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,875
Yeah, ya wanna
make somethin' of it?

273
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,583
[SUZAKU] No, I think
it's charming to see you

274
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,833
so much livelier
than you are at school.

275
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,791
[gasps]

276
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:39,833
Hmph!

277
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,791
Kallen...

278
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,458
Leave the Black Knights.

279
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,750
It's not too late.

280
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,625
A captured terrorist never
winds up with a happy ending.

281
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,916
I thought you weren't so bad,

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,541
and then you showed
your true colors.

283
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,875
Well that won't work.

284
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,333
I happen to be the
captain of Zero's elite guard.

285
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,541
And in fact,
I fought you in my Knightmare.

286
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,833
Were you that red one?

287
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:01,916
[KALLEN]
Yeah.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,708
And even if I lose
my life doing it,

289
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,250
I'll beat that
Knightmare of yours someday.

290
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,541
Using Zero's methods
offers no future.

291
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,458
And what about
your future, then?!

292
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,166
To just live the life of a
conqueror's subjugated lap dog?!

293
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,791
An honorary Britannian?!

294
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,375
Or to be the knight of
the third princess?! Ha!

295
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,791
The name of Genbu Kururugi,
the Last Samurai, weeps!

296
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,125
I am not you!

297
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,041
The world is wrong,
and I'm trying to change it!

298
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,791
If I don't--

299
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,958
If I don't, my brother's death
will have been for nothing.

300
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,416
That's my reason for fighting!

301
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,250
And I'll do whatever
it takes to win!

302
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,625
[SUZAKU]
Kallen, the truth is...

303
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,166
I killed my father.

304
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,250
[SUZAKU] My father
didn't commit suicide.

305
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,541
I took his life.

306
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,333
With this hand.

307
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,666
The stars haven't
changed, have they?

308
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,916
They were the same back then.

309
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,250
Long ago, we all used to gaze up
at the stars together.

310
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,875
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we
could live like that again?

311
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,708
I'd be so happy then.

312
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,000
Can't we go back to that?

313
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes, you're right.

314
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,250
It would be so good to
just go back to how things were.

315
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,333
[SUZAKU] Zero is
a lot like my father.

316
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,416
He firmly believes
that the entire world

317
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,000
revolves around him.

318
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,166
That's why he's able to
justify spilling the blood

319
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,625
of so many people--

320
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,083
[KALLEN] That's why you accept
the way things are now?!

321
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,583
You call that peace?!

322
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,041
Some things are more important
than your life, you know!

323
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,166
It isn't that I
want you to give up.

324
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,041
I just want you
to ask yourself:

325
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,833
When you gain results
the wrong way,

326
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,875
what are you
left with in the end?

327
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,833
Only dark regret
and a deep emptiness

328
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,500
that have nowhere to go.

329
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,458
Then explain something.

330
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,750
What higher purpose did
the death of my brother serve?

331
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,625
Who gets to sit in judgment?

332
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,041
Who decides whether
it's right or wrong?

333
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,416
[LELOUCH] Euphy...
Even for me to survive...

334
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,791
[SUZAKU] Even struggling
with my shame...

335
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,583
I still search for a
reason to go on living.

336
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,416
I'm a disgrace.

337
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,666
[SCHNEIZEL] We couldn't find
major Kururugi washed ashore

338
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,708
on the other island.

339
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,416
So it's obvious
we should look here.

340
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,333
[BARTLEY] We'll send out a
search party in the morning.

341
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,875
Hm... And this must be
what you mentioned?

342
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,250
Yes.

343
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,125
We uncovered it when the
Shinjuku incident occurred.

344
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,708
[SCHNEIZEL]
Ahh...

345
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,375
Yes, I can see why this would
have attracted Clovis' interest.

346
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,708
Are you sure
you really saw a light?

347
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,958
[SUZAKU]
Yeah, I'm positive.

348
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,833
[LELOUCH]
It must be a search party.

349
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,666
Once we learn who it is,
we'll know how deal with them.

350
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,125
Deal with them?

351
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,083
[LLOYD]
A thought elevator, you say?

352
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,500
I'm afraid archeology
isn't my strong suit,

353
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,000
especially this
paranormal stuff!

354
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,208
[BARTLEY]
Why you...!

355
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,625
Show some respect!

356
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,583
[LLOYD] As I was saying,
this is way outside of my field.

357
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,500
I wish you could have
asked Cecile about this instead.

358
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,666
[SCHNEIZEL]
Please don't complain so much.

359
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,000
My father is infatuated
with this as well.

360
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,750
Isn't that right, Bartley?

361
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,833
[BARTLEY]
Yes.

362
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,000
We've found artifacts
similar to these

363
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,500
in a number of places
around the world.

364
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,333
Except for this one
that I discovered,

365
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,333
all the other sites are are
directly under imperial control.

366
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,250
This is mere
speculation on my part,

367
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,916
but I think the real reason
we're invading other countries

368
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,166
is to obtain these objects.

369
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,458
And so,

370
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,708
in order to analyze
this ancient occult data,

371
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,125
you're going to use
the Gawain's Druid System,

372
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,041
untuned prototype that it is?

373
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,666
[SCHNEIZEL]
That's why we called you in.

374
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,625
[LLOYD]
A-ha!

375
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,541
[LELOUCH] I think it
was right around here.

376
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,583
[EUPHEMIA] Lelouch,
if it is a search party,

377
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,958
then will our time
be over here?

378
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,416
Yes, it will.

379
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,625
[chuckles] I'm such
an undependable knight,

380
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:15,458
I couldn't even
capture you any food!

381
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,666
And besides,

382
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,666
that's a job reserved
for a real knight.

383
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,166
Your knight.
Suzaku Kururugi.

384
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,958
Mind if I ask you?

385
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,375
Why choose
an honorary Britannian?

386
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,666
Well, I...

387
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,041
[LELOUCH] What are those
two doing together?!

388
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,500
Suzaku!

389
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,958
P-Princess Euphemia?!

390
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,166
[ZERO]
Don't move!

391
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,208
This girl is my prisoner!

392
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,250
Zero!

393
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,291
[ZERO]
Just follow my cue.

394
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,791
I'll take back my
subordinate you have there!

395
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,250
We'll exchange prisoners!

396
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,083
Zero!

397
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:52,750
Once again, you-- 

398
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,375
[ZERO]
Keep back!

399
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:58,208
Ha! You find
my actions cowardly?

400
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,958
[ZERO chuckling]

401
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,416
[ZERO] Eliminate terrorists,
no matter what the sacrifice.

402
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,208
Do you intend
to follow this rule

403
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,416
and let your mistress die?

404
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,291
In spite of the fact
that your integrity

405
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,208
has already been broken?

406
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,708
[KALLEN yells]

407
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,625
Leave him alone!

408
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,750
Shut up, you royal puppet!

409
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,250
You're useless!

410
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,833
You can't think for yourself
or do anything on your own!

411
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,541
What?!

412
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,583
I'm not afraid of you,

413
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,791
and I don't care
what happens to me!

414
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,458
Suzaku, I command you to fight!

415
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,583
[ZERO]
Your Highness!

416
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,875
[SUZAKU]
With pleasure!

417
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,541
[ZERO]
You hardheaded fool!

418
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,583
[LLOYD]
Oh... not good.

419
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,166
[BARTLEY] Agh! My lord,
please save yourself!

420
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,708
Major Kururugi!

421
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,958
And is that...

422
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,333
...Zero?

423
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,916
Don't shoot, you fools!

424
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,458
Princess Euphemia's with them!

425
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,041
Capture them! Capture them!

426
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:00,916
[ZERO]
Tsk!

427
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,791
Look, Zero!

428
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,041
That's a Knightmare over there!

429
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:03,833
[ZERO]
Perfect!

430
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,375
We'll use that! Let's go!

431
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,000
Right!

432
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,041
[EUPHEMIA]
Suzaku!

433
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,583
[SOLDIERS grunting]

434
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,500
Suzaku, what is it,
what's wrong?

435
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,625
[ZERO]
This is good!

436
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,625
Not only unmanned,
but activated, too!

437
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,375
[SOLDIER] Form a wall in
front of Princess Euphemia!

438
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,416
Hurry!

439
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,916
[ZERO] What kind
of Knightmare is this?

440
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,875
[ZERO chuckles]

441
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,833
It's my lucky day!

442
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,375
[ZERO]
Schneizel!

443
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,583
So that's him? That's Zero?

444
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,333
[LLOYD]
Agh! The Gawain!

445
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,708
Stop that woman now!
Get that machine back!

446
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,666
We cannot allow it to
fall into Zero's hands!

447
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,625
[ZERO]
Schneizel!

448
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,666
Next time!

449
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,250
[COMM ALERT 1]
Alert 1! Alert 1!

450
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,083
Sutherlands are
blocking our exit!

451
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,000
[ZERO]
Hang on tight!

452
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,041
I'm going through them!

453
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,208
[KALLEN]
Huh?!

454
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,708
[ZERO]
Disappear.

455
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,958
[KALLEN yells]

456
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,000
[ZERO] Damn!
The weapons are incomplete!

457
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,333
Zero! Reinforcements!

458
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,708
Don't be worried yet.

459
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,041
Another system is operational!

460
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,666
We're flying?

461
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,833
This Knightmare can fly!

462
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,791
[laughing]

463
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:29,875
The Gawain!

464
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,625
Our beautiful prized Gawain!

465
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,083
Well, it was
only a test model.

466
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,166
Aside from that, I'm
thankful you're both all right.

467
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,875
Oh Schneizel, I missed you!

468
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,416
Dear Euphy,
I'm sorry it took us so long.

469
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,666
[EUPHEMIA]
No, it's all right!

470
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,583
[DEFENSE UNIT CAPT]
Your Highness,

471
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,916
shall we keep
to the schedule?

472
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,541
Oh. Right.

473
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,250
[EUPHEMIA]
Uh...

474
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,875
Major Suzaku Kururugi,

475
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,375
you're under
arrest for violation

476
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,416
of military regulations.

477
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
What's the meaning of this?!

478
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,333
Major Kururugi's my knight!

479
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,125
You can't do--

480
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,125
This is something
I can take care of later.

481
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,083
For now, let them be.

482
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,416
[EUPHEMIA]
Um, did something happen?

483
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,833
[ZERO]
I've contacted Ohgi!

484
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,416
We'll rendezvous
with them out at sea.

485
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,125
[KALLEN] Right!
And one other thing...

486
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,375
The Guren MK-II...?

487
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,833
It was recovered.

488
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,833
You may thank Asahina
and Chiba for that.

489
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,458
Yes, sir!

490
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,583
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku, forgive me.

491
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,625
I never intended to
use the power on you, but...

492
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,208
[ZERO]
Live!

493
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,875
[FAYER] Major Kururugi,
follow your orders!

494
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:41,750
[SUZAKU]
Shut up!

495
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,166
Who cares about them?!

496
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,958
I have to live!

497
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,291
[FAYER] I have no idea how you
got out of the Lancelot.

498
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,916
But you blew
a golden opportunity

499
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,375
to put an end to Zero in
order to save your own life,

500
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,583
according to this.

501
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,666
Are you going
to protest this evidence?

502
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,375
Was that... really me?

503
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,333
[FAYER] This is nothing less
than insubordination!

504
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,291
[CORNELIA]
Kururugi did that?

505
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,500
[STAFF B]
Yes. The details are unknown.

506
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,083
[CORNELIA]
Dammit.

507
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,041
And just when I thought we had
nailed the lid on Ishikawa.

508
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,083
[GUILFORD]
Your Highness!

509
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,916
[CORNELIA]
What now, Guilford?

510
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,916
The enemy has destroyed
the Great Kanmon Bridge

511
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,666
in Kyushu block!

512
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,875
What?!

513
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,291
[GUILFORD] They also
cut off vehicle access

514
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,458
at four other points,

515
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,000
and large numbers
of assault landing craft

516
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,250
are moving into the Genkai Sea!

517
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,791
[CORNELIA]
The Chinese Federation?!

518
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,958
But have they made
a declaration of war?

519
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,125
[GUILFORD]
No, Highness!

520
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,958
The craft are bearing
the flag of Japan!

521
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,791
[LELOUCH] What was Schneizel
doing on that island?

522
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,791
Was there something
hidden in that area?

523
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,791
And Euphy...

524
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,375
I think I can
trust you for now,

525
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,416
but I also need to consider what
happened with Kallen and Suzaku.

526
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,458
No!

527
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,041
First, we have

528
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,625
That will determine our future.

529
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,708
The future of both the
Black Knights and myself!
