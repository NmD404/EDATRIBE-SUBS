1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,416
[C.C.]
The Chinese Federation:

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,791
An alliance of nations

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,375
boasting the largest
population on the planet.

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,666
But the truth is, it can be
called a doddering old man.

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,375
The symbol of this
alliance is the empress.

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,833
The ruling class, which controls
society from within her shadow,

7
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,541
has grown exceedingly
tyrannical, while poverty

8
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,250
and stagnation
have sapped the life

9
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,958
from the nation's people.

10
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,000
When the Black
Knights fled Japan,

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,833
they sought refuge in this
neighboring federation.

12
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,708
The high eunuchs, the most
powerful men at the time,

13
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:50,083
lent the Japanese people the
man-made island of Horai,

14
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,291
built for tidal power generation
off the Jiangsu Province

15
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,208
on the coast of the Yellow Sea.

16
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,291
Even though this arrangement
was worked out well in advance,

17
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,333
all the political
implications of the deal

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,250
will not become apparent
until a later time.

19
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,125
[MINAMI]
Man, the Federation's laying

20
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,708
a lot of recognition on us!

21
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,666
[SUGIYAMA] There was that
whole bit with Sawasaki, too.

22
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,333
Think they're pro-Japanese?

23
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,000
The High Eunuchs, you mean?

24
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,166
Asahina! Don't you know?
The High Eunuchs may be guys,

25
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,916
but they've got no
jewels down below!

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,291
That's enough!

27
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,000
You'll get us in trouble
for saying stuff like that!

28
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,250
Aw, chill out!

29
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,416
[OHGI]
Hey!

30
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,000
I need a hand off-loading
the Knightmares.

31
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,875
What? They're here already?

32
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,791
Something's gotta be going
on behind the scenes

33
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,416
for India to be giving us
this much cooperation,

34
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,416
[OHGI] No, I think it's
that they're serious.

35
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,458
They want their independence

36
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,291
from the Chinese
Federation, as well.

37
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,041
[MINAMI]
Rakshata mentioned that, too.

38
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,041
[TAMAKI] Considering the
place is nowhere's ville.

39
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,000
[KID giggling]
C'mon! Hurry!

40
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:25,750
[DIETHARD]
We've finished picking out

41
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,000
staff leader candidates.

42
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,458
Should we assign them
to the Ikaruga for now?

43
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,708
[ZERO] Yes. That leaves us
with the municipal leaders.

44
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,250
[DIETHARD]
Correct.

45
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,375
Let's work with the intelligence
section and get that set up.

46
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,916
Now then, if you'll excuse me.

47
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,041
Are you sure that we
can depend on Diethard?

48
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,375
He acts on his own,
like what he did with Sayoko.

49
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,750
[ZERO] On the contrary,
he's easy to read.

50
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,625
[KALLEN]
Huh?

51
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,875
[ZERO]
In that man's mind,

52
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,625
he's trying to turn Zero
into a symbol for God.

53
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,708
Going from there, you can
guess what actions he'll take.

54
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:02,083
Besides, he has a useful talent
for manipulating information.

55
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,208
All right. That just
about does it.

56
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,625
That only leaves
the combat carrier.

57
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,041
You're installing
the Gawain's system

58
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,041
onto the Ikaruga, aren't you?

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,500
I used the same
on Shinkirou, too.

60
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,875
The Gawain's main
body was so damaged

61
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,083
when we salvaged
it from the sea.

62
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,000
And what about the
unit that sank with it?

63
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,625
The one being called
the Knight Gigafortress?

64
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:25,000
I tried to find
that myself, however...

65
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,750
[KALLEN]
You seriously want to take down

66
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,583
the Chinese
Federation's capital?

67
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,208
[LELOUCH] In such a way that
we won't be viewed as invaders.

68
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,708
If we overthrow Luoyang,

69
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,416
we clear a lot of conditions
for defeating Britannia.

70
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,583
[sighs]

71
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,708
[KALLEN]
He seems to be okay now.

72
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,958
I don't know what was happening
with him at that time.

73
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:43,833
[LELOUCH]
What is it?

74
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:44,458
Wha-?!

75
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,625
[KALLEN screams]

76
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,458
[thudding]

77
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:58,000
Tell me something, Lelouch.
Why'd you come back to us?

78
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,833
Kallen, when this is over,

79
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,000
will you then return
with me to Ashford?

80
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,041
[KALLEN]
Uh?

81
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:04,625
Cuz I'm...

82
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,791
[C.C.]
Tabasco?

83
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,541
[KALLEN, LELOUCH]
Uh! Huh?

84
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,958
[LELOUCH]
How long have you been there?

85
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,125
It needs Tabasco, but all
we have is hot sesame oil.

86
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,166
What should I do?

87
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,125
I wouldn't know.

88
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,041
I wouldn't neither.

89
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,208
[beeping]

90
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,250
[KAGUYA]
Master Zero,

91
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,125
please come to
the Ikaruga, hurry!

92
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:20,958
We've got trouble!

93
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,208
[C.C.]
Huh?

94
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,458
[ZERO]
What?! A political marriage?

95
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,750
Yes. I received an invitation

96
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,583
to the wedding through
the Sumeragi Conglomerate.

97
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,083
The bride-to-be is the empress,
icon of the Chinese Federation.

98
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,291
I'm her good friend,
and she wants me to attend.

99
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,833
[TOHDOH] And the groom is to be
the first prince of Britannia.

100
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,750
[RAKSHATA] That one
they call Odysseus.

101
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,416
It's too soon to activate
the plan we've set up.

102
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,250
I didn't expect that the
High Eunuchs would--

103
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,541
[ZERO]
No. This is a Britannian plot.

104
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,291
What do we do under
the circumstance?

105
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,333
[ZERO]
The worst possible situation.

106
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,250
[LELOUCH] Tsk! And I was going
to move in and grab the empress

107
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,250
before they had a chance to!

108
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,333
I never imagined
that mediocre man

109
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,041
could act so quickly!

110
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,458
Aw, why worry about it?

111
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,291
It's not as if we're involved
with Britannia any more!

112
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,500
What?!

113
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,333
We've been kicked out.
Have you forgotten?

114
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,875
Um...

115
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,000
But they haven't exonerated
us of our crimes, have they?

116
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,041
However, a political marriage...

117
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,375
There's always the possibility

118
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,750
that the Chinese Federation
might attack us.

119
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,333
And what then?!

120
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,625
The Black Knights are wrapped up
and given as a wedding present?!

121
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,625
Actually, that's an
apt way to put it.

122
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,125
You're sure developing
a useless ability there.

123
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,500
We're in big trouble here!

124
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,875
We're in no position to sit
around and make jokes!

125
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,208
[RAKSHATA]
Which is why...

126
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,500
[OHGI We're discussing
the matter at this moment!

127
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,625
Zero, the one behind this...

128
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,083
[ZERO]
Yes. There's another person.

129
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,416
The one who, overnight,
made this fiendish move

130
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,791
in order to reverse their
embittered relationship

131
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,000
with the Chinese Federation.

132
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,208
They would dare barter away the
empress to the Britannians?

133
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:06,333
[CROWD chatters]

134
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,791
[chuckles]

135
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,875
[whimpers]

136
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,416
Tell me, did the
empress willingly

137
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,958
consent to this marriage?

138
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,041
That's what they said, so we
can only take their word for it.

139
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,583
Besides, this arrangement
may be the path to peace.

140
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,041
True enough.

141
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,208
Today, let's just be good
guests and enjoy ourselves.

142
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,583
[GINO]
Suzaku! Look, I found it!

143
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,083
This is that charred newt stuff

144
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,333
you told me about, isn't it?
So, how do I eat it?

145
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,666
That's a decoration
made out of food.

146
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,208
Decoration? But didn't
I see you eat a bird

147
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,041
like this earlier
in the reception?

148
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,583
Do you mean the
Chinese phoenix?

149
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,125
Oh, that's what it was, hm?

150
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,375
I thought it was meat,
but it was really carrot--

151
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,458
--[beeping]
--Huh?

152
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,000
[GINO] Is this made out of
potato? I mean, I can eat it...

153
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,541
Excuse me, Lord Alstreim,

154
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,750
are you accessing your e-mails
here in the reception hall?

155
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,958
No. I'm memorizing something.

156
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,416
[CECILE]
Oh. That's a diary?

157
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,958
Well then, you're recording,
not memorizing.

158
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,208
Uh, Lloyd, I have a serious
question to ask you:

159
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,041
Am I still your fiancée or not?

160
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,375
You're, um... We didn't
call it off, did we?

161
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,875
This is a rare picture.

162
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,083
I figured you'd skip
the celebration party

163
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,000
and just attend the
ceremony tomorrow.

164
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,791
Occasionally, Suzaku gets
angry with me and says

165
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,833
that I ought to behave
like a betrothed man.

166
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,041
And this young woman
right here is the issue.

167
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,958
It's a pleasure to meet you.
My name's Milly Ashford.

168
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,625
Pleasure's mine. I am
dumbfounded to find Lloyd

169
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,416
showing interest
in anything human.

170
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,541
[chuckles]
Yeah, I must be growing up!

171
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,208
Allow me to introduce
Earl Kanon Maldini,

172
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,875
Prince Schneizel's aide-de-camp.

173
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,375
Public and private.

174
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,708
Huh? Uh...

175
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,750
[KANON]
I'm kidding.

176
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,833
[gasps]

177
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,125
It so happens the prince
has a preference

178
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,000
for unusual things.
Which includes myself.

179
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,625
[ANNOUNCER] Announcing the
arrival of the prime minister

180
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:52,041
of the Holy Britannian Empire!
Second prince Schneizel!

181
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,583
[MILLY]
It can't be... Nina!

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,833
My, I never thought my
younger brother

183
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,625
would keep the company of
just one particular woman.

184
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,666
Uh-huh.

185
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,083
[FEMALE A]
Who is that girl?

186
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,666
[FEMALE B]
Isn't she the chief of Invogue?

187
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,875
[FEMALE C]
Yes, the prince's research team.

188
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,250
[FEMALE A]
She's awfully young.

189
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,416
[FEMALE D] A girl like
that should know her place.

190
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,583
[SCHNEIZEL]
Be strong.

191
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,041
Euphy always presented
herself grandly.

192
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,541
[NINA gasps]

193
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,625
Right.

194
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,958
[GINO] It's been
a while, Your Highness.

195
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,916
The Emperor has commanded
that we accept orders

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,750
from you while in this land.

197
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:27,166
Three of the Rounds at court?
How splendid. Although...

198
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,333
[GINO]
Hm?

199
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,458
What, sir?

200
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,958
[SCHNEIZEL]
This is a celebration!

201
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,958
Relax a bit and have some fun.

202
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,333
[GINO]
Understood, sir!

203
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,083
Suzaku, I trust everyone
at school is doing well?

204
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,041
Yup. You see?

205
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,250
Hi, there!

206
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,791
Huh? Milly, it's you!

207
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,875
[XIANG-LIN] A secret
agreement has already been

208
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,375
set up between Prince
Schneizel and the High Eunuchs.

209
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,375
When she's married,

210
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,125
they'll cede our
territory to them.

211
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,416
He'll then grant
the High Eunuchs

212
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,333
titles of Britannian nobility.

213
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,083
Nobility? They would sell
off their country for that?

214
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,250
And our people?

215
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,500
[SYMPATHIZER B]
Death to the High Eunuchs.

216
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,875
[SYMPATHIZER C]
We've got to stop this wedding,

217
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,375
even if it means putting
our plan into action early.

218
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,500
[XIANG-LIN]
But if we stage a coup,

219
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,291
Britannia's going
to declare war.

220
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,166
Either we ensure peace,
or we do not.

221
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,208
[grunts]

222
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,291
[JAILER]
But, Your Majesty,

223
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,291
this man broke the law by trying
to save the life of an inmate.

224
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,375
[EMPRESS]
Yes, but...

225
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,000
I get brought medicine
when I'm sick,

226
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,916
and the person who
brings it isn't punished.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,791
[JAILER] There's no comparing
that prisoner with you,

228
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,583
Your Majesty.

229
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,583
[GAO HAI]
Don't argue!

230
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,916
The banquet will
be starting soon!

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,583
Do as Her Majesty commands!

232
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,375
[JAILER] If he's taken to face
the law, he'll be executed!

233
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,125
[gasps]

234
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,458
But that's wrong!

235
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,291
[JAILER]
Uh?

236
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,125
[EMPRESS]
That's wrong!

237
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,416
He was doing something good,

238
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,125
so he shouldn't
die because of it!

239
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,916
[JAILER]
Uh! Well...you see...

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,208
[EMPRESS]
Officer's school?

241
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,458
[XING-KE]
Yes.

242
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,333
That's how I'll use the
life that you spared.

243
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,875
I wish to protect
you in any way I can.

244
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,291
I would like to go too.
To the outside.

245
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,166
Outside?

246
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,041
Outside of the forbidden city.

247
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,916
To school or
maybe to the sea.

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,416
Where you can find
all kinds of hot,

249
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,875
yummy food and lots
of friends to make.

250
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,208
Yes, very well.

251
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,291
[EMPRESS]
Huh?

252
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,666
[XING-KE] One day,
if you still wish,

253
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,250
I will take you away
from here, Your Majesty.

254
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,875
[EMPRESS]
Really?!

255
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,333
[XING-KE] It's my
way of thanking you

256
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,791
for sparing my life.

257
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,208
[EMPRESS]
Hm?

258
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,166
[XING-KE] This is how we
make promises outside the city.

259
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,208
[EMPRESS]
Hm.

260
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,291
[XING-KE]
Mm-hm.

261
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,000
An everlasting promise.

262
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,208
[EMPRESS]
For all time.

263
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,458
Either I protect her Majesty

264
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,083
or I allow an alliance
to ensure peace.

265
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,458
[ODYSSEUS]
At any rate,

266
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,250
I'm certainly glad this
arrangement all worked out!

267
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,958
I'm no good at fighting.

268
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,708
Your Highness, will the Emperor
be attending the wedding?

269
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,083
He informed me at the banquet

270
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,208
back in the homeland
that he would attend.

271
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,875
Miss Kaguya Sumeragi!

The representative of the
Sumeragi Conglomerate!

isn't she the Guren pilot?

To a place like this?!

So you are the puppet

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,625
But I'm happy for you.

You seem to be doing
well for yourself.

Uh-huh.

If anything happens, you can
come to me for advice.

Just stop that.

[MILLY gasps]

00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,416
Princess Euphemia

Instead of running away,

298
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,541
she risked her own
life to save mine.

00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,666
She was the only
one who helped me.

And I'll help you, too.

[NINA] Will you stop
spouting pity for me!

You're always playing
around as the campus queen,

and you hide behind Ashford
as if it's a shield!

It's the same with your
engagement to Professor Lloyd!

You always look down on me,

00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,208
acting like some
self-appointed guardian

00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,166
while you swim in

You're giving
them Kaguya, too?

Put that girl out of your mind.

No, you can't! That's wrong!

[XIA WANG]
Your Majesty,

00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,500
the Black Knights are the

Please, don't get involved and
just leave the politics to us.

00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,083
Isn't that what
you've always done,

323
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,750
let us handle things our way?

00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,500
But, she's a friend.

Can we please stop
quarrelling now?

I suppose.

I don't have much
of a choice, do I?

332
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,791
If that is the wish of the
Prime Minister of Britannia,

333
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,458
then withdraw!

00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,041

We're cousins, you and I.

Of course I do.

[XING-KE gasps]
That's right.

518
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,333
I have no idea
whether my action

519
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,708
is in accordance with
Her Majesty's wishes.

520
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,791
She may not even have
the faintest memory

521
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,708
of what occurred six years ago.

522
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,125
But no matter.

523
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,458
I made an everlasting
promise to Her Majesty

524
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:43,458
in return for sparing my life!
A vow I swore in my heart!

525
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,750
I must... I must
save the empress!

526
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,958
I will take her...
to the outside world!

527
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:50,875
[EMPRESS]
Xing-ke!

528
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,916
[XING-KE]
Huh?

529
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,375
[EMPRESS]
Xing-ke...!

530
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,250
Xing-ke! Xing-ke! Xing-ke!

531
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,083
[XING-KE]
She does... She remembers!

532
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,916
[XING-KE]
In my heart...

533
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,666
...there is no more doubt!

534
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,125
Xing-ke!

535
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,166
[gasps]

536
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,666
[ZERO]
I appreciate this, Xing-ke!

537
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,791
You've made it so much
easier for me to make my move.

538
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,125
Oh! T-That man, too?!

539
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,125
[XING-KE] Zero, what's the
meaning of this?

540
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,083
[ZERO]
Don't move!

541
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,083
[whimpers]

542
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:26,791
[gasps]

543
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,125
What a wretched coward!

544
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,333
Zero. My warning
fell on deaf ears.

545
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,083
[XING-KE] I thought the
Black Knights owed us

546
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,125
for what we did
for them in Area 11.

547
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,541
[ZERO] Which his why
I'm ruining this wedding.

548
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,791
Exactly as you people wanted.

549
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,791
The only thing is, I'm taking
the bride with me!

550
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,250
Xing-ke!

551
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,666
Your Majesty!

552
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,541
[growls]
You filthy scum!

553
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,333
[ZERO]
Oh, am I?

554
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:57,375
[ZERO laughs]

555
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,958
[V.V.]
Yes. If Zero's true objective...

556
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,208
...turns out to be here,
we're in trouble.

557
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,416
[JEREMIAH]
Yes.

558
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,833
Is that why you've made
preparations for me?

559
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:07,791
[V.V.]
It is.

560
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,083
[JEREMIAH]
Thank you very much.

561
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,458
Once I'm properly adjusted, C.C.

562
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,708
and Lelouch will be
no match for me.

563
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,291
Your expectations
of Jeremiah Gottwald

564
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,833
will be more than satisfied,
I promise you!

565
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,208
[LELOUCH] Even if they try
to move now, it's too late.

566
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,416
The empress, the symbol
of the Chinese Federation,

567
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,125
has fallen into my hands.

568
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,375
Xing-ke, the High Eunuchs,
Schneizel, too...

569
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,458
Let them all dance to my plan!

570
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,458
I'm through
positioning my pieces.

571
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,208
This is no game of chess.

572
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,291
I intend to checkmate the nation
known as the Chinese Federation!

573
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,291
And once I have, I'm coming
for him! I'll possess

574
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,000
the power to confront the
emperor of Britannia!

575
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,583
And for that, I swear I'll...!
