1
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,500
[BOTH]
Huh?

2
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,125
[NARRATOR]
The date was August 10

3
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,375
in the year 2010 of
the Imperial calendar.

4
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,541
The Holy Britannian Empire had
just declared war upon Japan.

5
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:59,083
The far east island nation had
held fast to its neutrality,

6
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,833
and now Britannia looms as
the world's only superpower.

7
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,166
Rights to Japan's
underground resources

8
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,083
became a hotly disputed issue,

9
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,958
straining the already
deep-rooted diplomatic tensions

10
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,791
between the two sides.

11
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,958
In the deciding battle
for the mainland,

12
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,333
Britannian forces
introduced into combat

13
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,541
the humanoid autonomous
armored knight

14
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,916
known as the Knightmare Frame.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,125
The enemies forces were far
greater than anticipated,

16
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:27,000
and the Knightmares obliterated
the Japanese line of defense

17
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,708
on the mainland
with little effort.

18
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,541
Japan became a
dominion of the empire.

19
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,958
The country was stripped
of its freedom, its rights,

20
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,791
and its name.

21
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,333
Area 11.

22
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,916
The defeated and
once-proud nation of Japan

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,666
was re-christened
with a mere number.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,541
[LELOUCH]
I swear...

25
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:52,666
[SUZAKU]
Huh?

26
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,250
[LELOUCH]
I swear, Suzaku, so help me!

27
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:59,041
I will one day...
obliterate Britannia!

28
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,708
[COP 1]
This is Alpha 3.

29
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,958
Target is traveling from
Delta-12 toward Delta-14

30
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,041
at a speed of 80
kilometers per hour.

31
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,791
[COP 2]
CCP to all mobile units.

32
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,333
Declaring a code 3
from floor 5 to floor 2.

33
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,666
All units, take 2-8-8.
I want the target intact.

34
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,250
Here's video footage
of yesterday's

35
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,416
terrorist bombings in Osaka.

36
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,666
The Secretary reported 59
casualties in this incident.

37
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,500
Eight Britannians and 51 others.

38
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,375
[gasps]

39
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,958
[MAN]
You're out of time.

40
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,833
From here on, you'll make
your moves every 20 seconds.

41
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,208
Huh! Very well, I'm game.

42
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,250
[gasps]

43
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,500
[NOBLEMAN]
Hm?

44
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,416
Did your substitute arrive?

45
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,333
[OWNER]
Thank heavan, I'm saved.

46
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,416
Are things going well at school?

47
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,083
What have we here?
School boys?

48
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,083
[LELOUCH]
Hmph.

49
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,916
Well, look at this, a nobleman.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,666
I envy you kids today, you have
so much time on your hands.

51
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,416
Time for regrets...

52
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,541
What's your name?

53
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,666
Lelouch. Lamperouge.

54
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,000
Whoa, now wait a minute!

55
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,208
You can't win this one,
it's impossible. Right?

56
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:50,833
Rivalz.

57
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,000
[RIVALZ]
Huh?

58
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,208
When do you think
we would have to leave

59
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,041
in order to make our next class?

60
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,333
Uh, 20 minutes,
if we bust our hump.

61
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,916
Then be sure that you drive
safely on the way back.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,291
Huh?!

63
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,000
[LELOUCH]
I'll need nine minutes.

64
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,041
And by the way,
about yesterday...

65
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,458
[OWNER] Understood, sir.
We'll discuss it later.

66
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,916
[NOBLEMAN]
Nine minutes?

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,750
You only have 20
seconds per move.

68
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,833
Enough time.

69
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:13,541
[NOBLEMAN]
Hm?

70
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,333
You start with the king?

71
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,791
[laughing]

72
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,125
[MILLY]
Where's Lelouch?

73
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,541
[SHIRLEY]
He went somewhere with Rivalz.

74
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,916
[MILLY] What, maybe
it's poker this time?

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,958
[SHIRLEY]
They seem to forget

76
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,333
that they're on
the student council!

77
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,916
They're off gambling for money!

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,125
Lulu may be smart,

79
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,500
yet he wastes his brain
on stupid things!

80
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:35,208
If he'd only apply himself in
school, he'd get high grades!

81
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,500
"Oh, I wish my darling Lulu
would be a serious young man."

82
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,500
How adorable is that?!

83
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,458
Uh. Please, Madam President...

84
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,541
Perfect!

85
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,833
After we finally steal
this damn thing!

86
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,541
It's all because Tamaki
couldn't stick to Naota's plan!

87
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,291
And now we've got a problem!

88
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,291
[RIVALZ] I love playing
against the nobility!

89
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,500
When they lose, they
always pay out of pride.

90
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,833
By the way, eight minutes,
32 seconds is a new record!

91
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,375
[LELOUCH] He also didn't have
much time to move, either.

92
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,916
And as opponents go,
the nobles are tepid.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,416
They're just over-privileged
parasites, that's all.

94
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,916
[RIVALZ] Well then,
why don't you challenge

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,666
one of the Elevens? They're
nothing like us Britannians.

96
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,708
Huh?

97
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,541
[MAN]
What're they trying to prove

98
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,166
by killing innocent people?

99
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,666
[WOMAN]
Those Elevens terrify me.

100
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,458
[NEWSCASTER]
We apologize for the delay.

101
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,375
Now, His Royal Highness
Prince Clovis,

102
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,416
third prince of Britannia,
will address the nation.

103
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,375
To all my imperial subjects!

104
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,833
Including, of course,
the many cooperative Elevens

105
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,083
who choose to serve
the empire of Britannia!

106
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,291
We're not "Elevens,"
we're Japanese!

107
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,875
[CLOVIS]
Do you not see my pain?

108
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,250
My heart was ripped from my
chest only to be torn apart!

109
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,083
The remnants are filled
with rage and sadness!

110
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,583
However, as ruler of Area 11,

111
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,500
I will not tolerate
terrorism of any kind!

112
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,166
Because the battle we
fight is a righteous one!

113
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,166
A virtuous battle to protect
the well-being of one and all!

114
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,750
Now then, everyone,

115
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,416
I would like you to join me in
observance of the eight who died

116
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,041
for justice in the line of duty.

117
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,541
[NEWSCASTER]
A moment of silence, please.

118
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,833
Well, aren't you gonna join in?

119
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,125
[LELOUCH]
Aren't you?

120
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,083
[RIVALZ]
Heh! It's sort of embarrassing.

121
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,666
And I agree with you.

122
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,666
Besides, spilling tears
over those people

123
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,541
won't bring them back
to life, now will it?

124
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,416
Dang! That's dark, buddy!

125
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,541
[LELOUCH] It's all about
self-satisfaction.

126
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,750
Doesn't matter how hard you try.

127
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,916
You can't do it.

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,083
There's no way you
can change the world.

129
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,166
[LADY A] You were magnificent,
Your Highness!

130
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,500
One would never guess

131
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,291
that you were attending
a party while doing that!

132
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:33,041
After all, the viceroy is
the marquee actor of Area 11.

133
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,000
I need to change
costumes quickly.

134
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,291
[LADY A]
My! You're so self-confident!

135
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,916
It's all in the performance.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,083
Since the media want
a charismatic prince,

137
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,333
I give them one.

138
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,875
Untrue! Prince Clovis,
our key purpose in life

139
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,791
is to support and assist
your reign in any way we can!

140
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,833
His reign is a pathetic sham.

141
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:50,958
[BARTLEY]
Y-Your Highness!

142
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,291
Huh? A soldier?

143
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,375
Gad, how boorish of you.

144
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,625
[BARTLEY] I beg your pardon,
Your Highness, m'lord--

145
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,416
Not another appearance for him.

146
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,416
Hope it's not as dreary.

147
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,375
[BARTLEY]
You fool!

148
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,750
[DIETHARD]
Hm?

149
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,750
The police were informed
that it's medical equipment,

150
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,000
that's all.

151
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,250
If we scramble the army,
there'll be a record--

152
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,708
Deploy the royal guard!
The Knightmares as well!

153
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,750
[CONTROLLER]
Alert 1! Alert 1!

154
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,375
Fourth, seventh. and eighth
rapid reaction companies

155
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,416
as well as the 31st air assault
team, immediate scramble!

156
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,375
Special division nine,
stand by for deployment!

157
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,750
[RIVALZ]
That first move you made.

158
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,833
[LELOUCH]
Hm?

159
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,333
[RIVALZ]
Why'd you start with the king?

160
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,583
If the king doesn't lead,

161
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,625
how can he expect his
subordinates to follow?

162
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,625
What's with that?

163
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,166
With what?

164
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,625
[RIVALZ] Do you fantasize about
running a major corporation?

165
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,833
[LELOUCH]
No way.

166
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,291
Ambitions like that
will ruin your health.

167
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,500
Uh.

168
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,583
[RIVALZ]
Waaaagggh! We're gonna die!

169
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,583
You idiot! Watch
where you're going!

170
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,583
[KALLEN]
No, not that way!

171
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,541
[RIVALZ]
Eh... Was that our fault?

172
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,916
[LELOUCH]
I don't think so.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Uh?

174
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,541
[COP 1]
Control, the target has crashed

175
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,250
at the abandoned V.O.
building construction site.

176
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,208
[HQ] The military will take over
General Bartley's command.

177
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,791
[COP 1]
Him?!

178
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,916
[BARTLEY] We have to
retrieve it at all costs!

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,375
That thing...
in the wrong hands...

180
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,416
What the--?

181
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,083
Oh, man, this sucks!

182
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,291
Looks like the power line
on the bike got cut.

183
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,625
Yeah... Rivalz,
come check this out.

184
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,208
[MAN 1]
Hey! Over here!

185
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,208
[MAN 2]
Whoa... nasty crash.

186
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,083
[WOMAN 1] What happened,
some sort of accident?

187
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,375
[MAN 3]
Probably a drunk driver.

188
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,583
[WOMAN 2]
It's always some moron!

189
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,416
[MAN 4] Hey, maybe
somebody oughta go help.

190
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,083
[LELOUCH]
Hmph. All those idiots...

191
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,625
[RIVALZ]
Wait!

192
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,083
[BYSTANDERS chattering]

193
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,875
Look, the student rescue
team has arrived!

194
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,458
So like, why doesn't somebody
call for help, y'know?

195
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,166
[LELOUCH]
Hey! Are you all right?

196
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,833
[RIVALZ] Yeah, yeah, I know
it's the right thing to do,

197
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,958
but I wish the guy would
quit flaunting his pride

198
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,250
and just give it
a rest for a while.

199
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,916
Now we're gonna
be late to school.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,500
[KALLEN]
Nagata! Nagata!

201
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,333
Can you hear me?
Are you okay?!

202
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,625
[FEMALE VOICE] It's you...
Finally, I have found my--

203
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,083
But where--?

204
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,000
[LELOUCH]
Are you in there?

205
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,958
Stop! I'm in here!

206
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,583
[RIVALZ] So, would you
call that a hit-and-run?

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,083
You'd think they'd stick
a ladder on the inside, too!

208
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,708
--[SOLDIER A] Stop the vehicle!
--[LELOUCH gasps]

209
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,208
[SOLDIER A] Surrender now,
and you'll get the chance

210
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,833
to defend yourself in court.
Stop and surrender at once!

211
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,750
[SOLDIER A] Give up now,
or we will shoot to kill!

212
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,625
Now whadda we do?!
That's the Army!

213
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,250
[KALLEN] Have you forgotten?
That's what I'm here for!

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,375
[LELOUCH]
If I jump out, I have the choice

215
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,458
of breaking my neck
or getting shot.

216
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,083
I can try to call-- Uh.

217
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,583
[KALLEN] Can you enter the
subway via the Azabu route?

218
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,833
[NAGATA] Kallen!
Let's use it here! Why not?!

219
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,625
Because that would
mean a blood bath!

220
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,125
[NAGATA]
You're right...

221
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,208
[LELOUCH]
I've seen her before...

222
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,125
Lelouch, c'mon, where are you?

223
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,083
We've gotta get to school!

224
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,541
[SOLDIER A] Target is moving
from the settlement

225
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,583
toward the ghetto.

226
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,375
[SOLDIER B]
Copy that! Corner 'em!

227
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,458
[SOLDIER A]
Roger!

228
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,000
[SOLDIER C]
A slash harken?!

229
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,583
A Knightmare!

230
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,291
[LELOUCH]
Crap!

231
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,041
These guys are real terrorists!

232
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,416
You fellas know full well what
this bad-ass mother can do!

233
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,083
[JEREMIAH]
The rest of you, back off.

234
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,875
I'll take this guy.

235
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,333
[JEREMIAH] I can only assume
you dug that obsolete relic

236
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,000
out of some scrap heap.

237
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,625
An over-the-hill Glasgow
is no match for a Sutherland!

238
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,291
Not to mention a filthy Eleven

239
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,541
who spurns the compassion
of our glorious emperor!

240
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,416
[NAGATA]
Kallen, we should both split up!

241
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,791
Both of us can't risk
being killed! Run for it!

242
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:55,833
[KALLEN]
But--!

243
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,291
[gasps]

244
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,375
Heh. Simple-minded Eleven.

245
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,750
No way! It's stuck!

246
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,458
[JEREMIAH]
Secondhand junk!

247
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,750
I'll admit, I really
like your spirit.

248
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,125
However...

249
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,333
[LELOUCH]
Tsk! No cell phone reception...

250
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,708
We're out of range.

251
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,625
Judging from the darkness
and road surface,

252
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,083
we must be drivin' along
the old subway lines.

253
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,458
They're headed for an exit
somewhere in the ghetto.

254
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,083
Getting out will be dangerous.

255
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,291
Still... Okay, I've got it...

256
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,083
I'm not big on the military,
but I'll take their protection.

257
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,416
If I give them a
terrorist communicator...

258
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,291
Oh, wait, I forgot...

259
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,500
Some friend! Leaving
me behind like that!

260
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,083
Ah-ha!

261
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,291
What're you doing?

262
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,166
Looking at a man who
blundered, am I right?

263
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,250
Why you...!

264
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,083
[LLOYD]
You really screwed this one up.

265
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,333
Terrorists came along
and stole whatever it was

266
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,958
that you and Prince Clovis
were secretly working on.

267
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,541
Retrieving it is simple,

268
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,291
but you want to sweep up all of
their compatriots, in addition.

269
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,125
Let the terrorists go, and
you can find their hideout, too.

270
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,125
Congratulations! Your
reasoning was on spot on!

271
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,000
Uh, it was nothing.
I just thought it was strange.

272
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,250
[BARTLEY]
Okay, that's enough!

273
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,083
What is it the special
corp wants outta this?

274
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,375
I'm merely saying that I'd like
to assist with the clean up.

275
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,375
[BARTLEY]
To assist?

276
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,458
Correct, because
it's data I want.

277
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,875
Excuse me,

278
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,791
but what in the world have
they just stolen, anyway?

279
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,250
[BARTLEY]
Chemical weapons.

280
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,416
In other words... poison gas.

281
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,166
[CAPTAIN] The terrorists are
hiding in the subway system.

282
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,041
Your mission is to locate
the weapon that they've stolen.

283
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,416
Investigate the old subway
system that runs through

284
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,291
the Eleven residential district
in the Shinjuku ghetto.

285
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,250
Report in the moment
you spot them.

286
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,750
Recovery of the target will be
handled by us, the royal guard.

287
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,708
You people bear the honorary
title of Britannians now,

288
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,458
but you were born Elevens.

289
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,166
Therefore, the stench
of these monkeys

290
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,500
oughta be a familiar one.

291
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,750
If you want to earn
the right to carry arms,

292
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,416
then show some results!

293
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,750
This is your opportunity to
show your loyalty to Britannia!

294
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,750
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, my lord!

295
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,416
An accident? Or else--

296
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,166
No... the tire's stuck...

297
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,708
[NAGATA]
Please, Ohgi... Find me...

298
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,500
[SQUADDIE A]
4-0-4 has sighted the target.

299
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,708
[CAPTAIN]
Roger! Prepare for recovery!

300
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,833
[LELOUCH] Now I can use
this chance to climb up.

301
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,291
Are you Britannian?

302
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,583
That's enough mindless murder!

303
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,791
Wait! I'm not one of--!

304
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,083
[SOLDIER]
Planning to use poison gas?

305
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,083
[LELOUCH]
Huh?!

306
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,166
[SOLDIER]
Don't play dumb with me!

307
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,875
Get off me!

308
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,458
I'm not here by choice!

309
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,000
And if that's poison gas, it was
made in Britannia, wasn't it?

310
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,000
[gasps]

311
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,208
My god...

312
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,458
Mindless murder?

313
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,041
Then why don't you just
obliterate Britannia!

314
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,125
[SOLDIER]
Lelouch...

315
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,166
It's me. Suzaku.

316
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,291
[gasps]

317
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,166
[LELOUCH]
You...

318
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,375
You became a Britannian soldier?

319
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,625
[SUZAKU]
Yeah, and what about you?

320
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,583
You're a--

321
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,750
[LELOUCH]
What're you saying?!

322
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,500
That's not poison gas...

323
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,708
What is it?

324
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,041
[KALLEN] In all the confusion,
I left it in the coat.

325
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,083
[OHGI]
It's okay.

326
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,625
The Glasgow's
circuits are usable.

327
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,291
So, were we right?

328
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,541
Think so.

329
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,500
I bet it's poison gas,
like intelligence said.

330
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,833
[OHGI]
And Nagata?

331
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,458
[KALLEN] I dunno. I think
he made it underground.

332
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,750
[LELOUCH]
Tell me the truth, Suzaku.

333
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,208
Poison gas? This girl?

334
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,958
Hey, it's what they told us
in the briefing, I swear!

335
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,000
Huh?!

336
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,791
[CAPTAIN]
Stinking monkey.

337
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,250
Being an honorary Britannian
will not excuse you!

338
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,791
[SUZAKU] Uh! But sir! I was
told this was poison gas!

339
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,500
How dare you question orders!

340
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,625
[LELOUCH]
This is bad.

341
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,666
A poisonous situation.

342
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,000
Which would pose a threat
to Suzaku's superiors

343
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,916
if it's unleashed.

344
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,583
However, in light of
your outstanding

345
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,250
military achievements,
I'm going to be lenient.

346
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,500
Private Kururugi, take this
and execute the terrorist.

347
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,625
--[SUZAKU grunts]
--[LELOUCH gasps]

348
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,125
[SUZAKU]
But he's not a terrorist!

349
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,000
He's a civilian who got
caught up in all this!

350
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,250
[CAPTAIN]
You insubordinate little--!

351
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,791
That's an order!

352
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,291
Didn't you swear your loyalty
and your life to Britannia?!

353
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,291
[SUZAKU]
Yes, but...

354
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,625
But... I can't.

355
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,333
[LELOUCH]
Uh.

356
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,583
[CAPTAIN]
What?

357
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,458
[SUZAKU]
I won't do it, sir.

358
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,291
I won't shoot a civilian.

359
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,291
I can't follow your orders, sir.

360
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,583
[CAPTAIN]
Very well.

361
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,458
[gunshot]

362
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,791
Suzaku!

363
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,416
Well, Britannian school boy,
not a good day to cut class.

364
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,666
Collect the girl.

365
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,708
After you've secured her,
kill the student!

366
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,875
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, my lord.

367
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,791
[NAGATA]
Death to...

368
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,375
...Britannia...

369
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,875
[NAGATA]
Long live...

370
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,333
...Japan.

371
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,208
[BARTLEY]
They got away?!

372
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,208
And you call yourselves
the Royal Guard?!

373
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,916
[CAPTAIN]
Uh. Forgive me, my lord!

374
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,791
The blast was mainly directed
upwards, but the bed--

375
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,041
[BARTLEY]
Why the hell do you think

376
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,958
I only told you
people about this?!

377
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,333
[CAPTAIN] W-We'll continue
the investigation.

378
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,208
[CLOVIS] The plan has moved
forward to the next phase.

379
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,750
B-But, Your Highness!

380
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,583
[CLOVIS] If knowledge of her
gets out, I'll be disinherited.

381
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,083
Tell them back home
we're carrying out

382
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,125
a planned "urban renewal" here.

383
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,500
As Clovis, third prince of
the empire, I command you!

384
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,875
Destroy Shinjuku ghetto!
Leave no one alive!

385
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:06,166
[SHINJUKU RESIDENTS screaming]

386
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,875
[OLD MAN]
W-Why are they doing this?!

387
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,041
Dear, let's go!

388
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:09,916
[OLD MAN]
H-Hurry!

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,791
--[door opens]
--[gunfire]

390
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,458
[SOLDIER 1] Okay, let's
sweep the next floor.

391
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,625
[BARTLEY] The enemy is garbage
that can never hope to become

392
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,250
even honorary Britannians!

393
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,000
Wipe out every last one of them!

394
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,458
Naturally.

395
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,916
[SOLDIER 2]
Supervisor Jeremiah,

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,083
General Bartley requests
that you take command--

397
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,000
Bartley has staff officers.

398
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,708
I haven't had this much fun
on the front lines in ages!

399
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,708
[CLOVIS]
Hmph.

400
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,500
[LELOUCH]
What the hell are you?!

401
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,000
This chaos is all
your fault, isn't it?!

402
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,541
Aaaggh!

403
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,833
Not only that
but Britannia has...

404
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,916
They even killed Suzaku!

405
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,416
[LLOYD]
Not there?

406
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,166
[CECILE] It looks like
he's gone to the front line.

407
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,666
[LLOYD] Even though we
brought the Lancelot here?

408
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,125
Now what'll do we do?

409
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,541
We steam rolled our way in here,

410
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,541
but we don't have
a devisor to use it.

411
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,375
[LELOUCH]
Stay quiet, and wait here.

412
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,708
[CAPTAIN]
Report.

413
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,583
[SOLDIER C] We found
only Elevens here, sir.

414
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,208
[CAPTAIN]
Ahhh.

415
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,333
You're sure of it?

416
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,916
That exit comes out here?

417
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,375
[SOLDIER C] Yes, sir. It matches
up with our map of the old city.

418
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,125
[BABY crying]

419
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,166
[gunshots]

420
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,666
[phone ringing]

421
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,958
[CAPTAIN]
Hm?

422
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,000
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

423
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,458
That jerk! He hung up
on me! I can't believe it!

424
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,625
[CAPTAIN]
What an appropriate location

425
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,458
for a terrorist to meet his end.

426
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,750
[LELOUCH]
You scum...

427
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,500
[CAPTAIN] Still, you did
well for a student,

428
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,208
but that's to be expected.
You're a Britannian.

429
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,958
Unfortunately, my
clever young friend...

430
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,666
...you have no future.

431
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,666
He mustn't die!

432
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,791
[LELOUCH]
You shot her!

433
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,166
[CAPTAIN]
Hmph.

434
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,916
Our orders were to bring
her back alive, if possible.

435
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,333
Oh well, nothing can
be done about it now.

436
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,541
We'll tell our superiors
that the royal guard

437
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,083
found the terrorist hideout
and killed them all.

438
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,625
Regrettably, the female hostage

439
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,916
had already been
tortured to death.

440
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,291
What do ya think, school boy?

441
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,375
[LELOUCH]
How can this be happening?

442
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,250
First Suzaku's killed...
then this girl...

443
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,166
Now I'm about to die...

444
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,375
...before I've had a chance to
do a single thing with my life.

445
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,791
It's gone in a heartbeat...

446
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,333
Nanally!

447
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,375
[gasps]

448
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,916
[FEMALE VOICE] You don't
want it to end here. Do you?

449
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,583
[LELOUCH]
What?

450
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,375
[FEMALE VOICE] You appear
to have a reason for living.

451
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,708
[LELOUCH]
The girl? That's impossible.

452
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,833
[FEMALE VOICE] If I grant
you power, could you go on?

453
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,333
I propose a deal.

454
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,750
In exchange for this power,

455
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:59,541
you must agree to make
my one wish come true.

456
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,875
Accept this contract, and
you accept its conditions.

457
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,875
While living in
the world of humans,

458
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,291
you will live unlike any other.

459
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,833
A different providence...

460
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,291
A different time...

461
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,541
A different life.

462
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,416
The power of the king
will condemn you

463
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
to a life of solitude.

464
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,916
Are you prepared for this?

465
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,125
[EMPEROR] A convergence with
the Ragnarok Connection?

466
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,458
So the myth is
beginning once again?

467
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,166
[LELOUCH]
Yes!

468
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,791
I hereby accept the
terms of your contract!

469
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,291
[CAPTAIN]
Hm?

470
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,500
[LELOUCH]
Say, how should a Britannian

471
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,125
who detests his own
country live his life?

472
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,750
Are you some kind of radical?

473
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,833
Huh?

474
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,333
[LELOUCH] What's wrong?
Why not shoot?

475
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,666
Your opponent is
just a school boy.

476
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,791
Or have you finally realized?

477
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,291
The only ones who should kill

478
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,833
are those who are
prepared to be killed!

479
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:56,916
[CAPTAIN]
Uh...

480
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What's happening here?

481
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,833
I, Lelouch vi Britannia,
command you!

482
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,750
Now, all of you...

483
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:03,916
...die!

484
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,458
[CAPTAIN chuckling]

485
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,333
Happily, Your Highness!

486
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,208
[CAPTAIN]
Fire!

487
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,750
[LELOUCH]
That was the turning point.

488
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,500
Since that day,
I've lived a lie.

489
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,500
The lie of living.

490
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:36,458
My name, too, was a lie.
My personal history, a lie.

491
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,041
Nothing but lies.

492
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,708
I was sick to death of a world
that couldn't be changed.

493
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:46,916
But even in my lies, I refused
to give up in despair.

494
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,833
But now this incredible
power... it's mine.

495
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,791
Well, then!
