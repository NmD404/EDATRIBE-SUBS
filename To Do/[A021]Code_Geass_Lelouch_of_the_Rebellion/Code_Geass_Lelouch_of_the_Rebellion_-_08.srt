00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,208
[C.C.]
Lelouch, a Britannian youth,

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,958
has been given a god-like power

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,833
by the mysterious
young woman, C.C.

00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,333
Geass.

5
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,541
The absolute power to compel
anyone to follow any order.

6
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,041
For the sake of his
younger sister, Nunnally,

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,916
Lelouch plots to destroy
the Holy Britannian Empire.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,166
Meanwhile, his best friend from
childhood, Suzaku Kururugi,

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,833
has established himself
as an honorary Britannian

10
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,291
within the Empire.

11
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,458
At this point, their lives
are already intertwined

12
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,250
and their destinies
predetermined

13
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,541
with inevitable outcomes.

14
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,083
I never left the Tokyo
settlement before!

15
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,666
This is my first time!

16
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,833
I'm sure you wish Lelouch could
have come with us, don't you?

17
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:51,708
[SHIRLEY gasps]

18
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,083
Don't be so shy.

19
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,166
Tonight, we can stay up
all night talking.

20
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,375
Let's tell each other which
boys we like from school.

21
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,041
Then you'll probably
have a lot to talk about,

22
00:02:59,125 --> 00:02:59,833
right, Ms. President?

23
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,375
Who can say?

00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:03,916
[gasps]

25
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,625
[MILLY]
Nina, it's all right.

26
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,875
There are lots of Britannian
tourists at Lake Kawaguchi,

27
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,375
so security's fine.

28
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,583
Don't be afraid.
It's not the ghettos.

29
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,375
Yes, but--

30
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,333
We'll be with you
the whole time.

31
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,125
We won't leave your
side for a second.

32
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,333
Th-Thanks.

33
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,666
[ZERO] What are you
waiting for? Come in.

34
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,250
As of now, this place
will be our hideout.

35
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,500
[OHGI]
So...

36
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,500
...you think joining up
with us is a good idea?

37
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,833
[ZERO]
Yes. We're comrades, after all.

[MINAMI]
Holy cow!

39
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,416
[TAMAKI]
So, what is this, huh?

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,375
D'you mind if I ask
how you came by this?

41
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,708
[ZERO] I borrowed it from
a rather libertine nobleman

42
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,458
who indulges my requests.

43
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,666
[OHGI] You asked for it?
Just like that?

44
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,833
[ZERO] Don't worry.
No strings attached.

45
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,208
[YOSHIDA]
It's huge.

46
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,541
Check it out, it's
got a second story.

47
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,791
[KALLEN]
On the other hand,

48
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,791
no one would expect us
in something like this.

49
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,333
[MINAMI]
It's even got a TV.

50
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,875
[NEWSCASTER] How's are
things looking at the scene?

51
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,125
[MINAMI]
Huh?

52
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,291
--I'm here in front of
--[KALLEN] What's this?

00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,833
the Lake Kawaguchi
Convention Center Hotel.

54
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,833
The hotel jackers have
identified themselves

55
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,125
as the Japan Liberation Front.

56
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,333
Members of the Sakuradite
allocation meeting,

57
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,125
most notably, Chairman
James, were taken hostage,

58
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,125
as well as several tourists
and hotel employees.

59
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,375
This footage was taken
by the perpetrators.

60
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,458
In it, you can clearly
see Chairman James,

61
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,125
including some students.

62
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,291
From the student council.

63
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,541
[ZERO]
Hm?

64
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,083
[REPORTER] The leader of
the group claims to be

65
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,875
Lt. Colonel Kusakabe of the
now-defunct Japanese military.

66
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,583
Agh! That imbecile!

67
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,500
Sakuradite, an
essential component

68
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,333
in the manufacture of high
temperature superconductors,

69
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,833
is a vital strategic resource

70
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,416
that directly affects
world security.

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,250
Area 11 is the largest
producer of this material,

72
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,625
providing 70% of the
world's total supply.

73
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,583
Here at the yearly national
meeting of Sakuradite producers,

74
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,083
it will be determined how this
resource will be distributed

75
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,125
among the world's nations.

76
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,291
It's no exaggeration
to say that the outcome

77
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,500
determines the balance
of global power

78
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,083
between Britannia
and other countries.

79
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,250
It is believed that the
terrorists are using

80
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,000
world interest in
the annual gathering

81
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:16,041
to their advantage by carrying
out this violent hotel takeover.

82
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,083
I'm Kusakabe of the
Japan Liberation Front.

83
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,416
This stand we're taking

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,458
is for the freedom of Japan
and our countrymen!

85
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,750
Even though you
are not soldiers,

86
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,208
you are still Britannians!

87
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,458
You are the ones who
rule and oppress us!

88
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,125
Sit still, be quiet,
and you'll be fine.

91
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,791
[TAMAKI]
So, they've made their move.

92
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,958
They're easily the biggest
anti-Britannian force in Japan.

93
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,416
And now their pride's hurt.

94
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,416
Because of us?

95
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
Maybe.

96
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,833
[TAMAKI] I don't know whether to
feel happy or sad about that.

97
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,125
Because they're all
gonna end up dead.

99
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,750

This is Lelouch.

Please leave a message
after the beep.

What the hell's he doing
at a time like this?!

103
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,916
[LELOUCH]
I know. But...

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,708
[STAFF OFFICER A] All bridges
connecting to the hotel,

105
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,333
with the exception of the main
one, have been destroyed.

106
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,166
Our attempted approaches
from air and water

107
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,083
have been unsuccessful.

108
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,666
There's only one route left

109
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,500
that will allow us to develop
a possible hostage rescue plan.

110
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,791
The main utilities tunnel
running directly beneath

111
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,250
the convention center hotel.

112
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,208
Basically, we would go
in through this route,

113
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,583
destroy the foundation block,
and submerge the hotel.

114
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,541
Since the tunnel was also built
to handle supply deliveries,

115
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,291
it should be able to
accommodate Sutherlands.

116
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,125
Even if the enemy
has taken precautions,

117
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,833
it should be no problem.

118
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,291
[PILOT A]
Go.

119
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,458
[STAFF OFFICER A] They've been
using sub-standard weaponry,

120
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,625
so we'll have no
trouble evading them.

121
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,166
[PILOT 1]
Enemy detected!

122
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,416
As expected, they're moving
through the underground tunnel!

123
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,958
Roger that!

124
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,375
Raikou, secondary start-up!
Both quad-linkage legs locked!

125
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:49,083
Super electromagnetic shrapnel
cannon voltage, confirmed!

126
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,333
[PILOT A] I think these guys
have Knightmare rifles.

127
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,166
Spread out and
break their ranks.

128
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,833
Super electromagnetic
shrapnel cannon, fire!

129
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,875
[PILOT A]
What?!

130
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:06,500
[SOLDIER 1]
One shot!

131
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,583
--Yes!
--It works!

132
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,708
The Raikou was
a complete success!

133
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,916
What do you think of
that, Britannian pigs?

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,333
Wiped out?!

135
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,708
[STAFF OFFICER A] It looks
as though they've modified

136
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,708
a Glasgow into a linear cannon.

137
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,541
[STAFF OFFICER B] Then there's
no way we can break through.

138
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,000
[STAFF OFFICER C]
What do we do now?

139
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,958
If we release the political
prisoners as they demand--

140
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,083
We can't show
weakness to terrorists!

141
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,000
But Princess Euphemia, she's...

142
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,208
Yes, I know.

143
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,708
Thus far, it appears
that none of them

144
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,333
have discovered that fact.

145
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,416
If they learn that Princess
Euphemia is among the hostages,

146
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,041
they'll undoubtedly use
her as a bargaining chip.

147
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,833
She went there just to observe,

148
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,125
therefore she isn't registered
along with the other guests.

149
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,375
[C.C.] Yes. Yes, I understand.
I'll do well this time.

150
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,583
I'll try to look out for him,
but I'm not his guardian.

151
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,791
[SUZAKU] Can't the Special
Corps offer any assistance

152
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,583
with the rescue operation?

153
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,416
[LLOYD] I've already asked them,
but we're an irregular unit,

154
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,083
and they don't acknowledge
our chain of command.

155
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,208
Besides...

156
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,708
It's too risky to entrust
the operation to an Eleven,

157
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,041
is that right?

158
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,500
Yet I'm sure you're aware
that Princess Cornelia

159
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,375
is very discriminating about
Britannians and Numbers.

160
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,625
So the Japanese still aren't
being accepted enough

161
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,958
into your structure?

162
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,333
If that were true, then
what point would there be

163
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,875
in even having an honorary
Britannian system?

164
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,375
[REPORTER] Sir, did
your daughter appear...

165
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,375
[MINAMI]
Where do you want this?

166
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,958
Over there, by
the driver's seat.

167
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,125
[YOSHIDA] Hey! What
about these boxes here?

168
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,958
[SHIRLEY'S DAD]
She was only sightseeing!

169
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,541
Shirley is still a student.

170
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,083
But these criminals
act indiscriminately.

171
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,291
Savages! I want
to know if Shir--

172
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,958
I want to know if my
daughter's all right!

173
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,791
She hasn't done
anything wrong!

174
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,333
[REPORTER]
All he's asking...

175
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,125
[LELOUCH] We need to organize
before we fight them again.

176
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,583
It's too soon, though.
We're not ready.

177
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,000
But we can't just sit here
and do nothing, either.

178
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:53,125
Knowing Cornelia, she'll
sacrifice the hostages.

179
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,208
Then why doesn't
she make her move?

180
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,458
Is it possible?

181
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,958
[KALLEN]
Zero.

182
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,875
What will happen
to the hostages?

183
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,458
[ZERO]
Eventually...

184
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,916
...there will be no reason to
keep those Britannians alive.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,541
Yeah. I'm sure you're right.

186
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,458
[OHGI]
Hey, Zero. I found these.

187
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,333
Should I hand them
out to everyone?

188
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,583
I mean, as far as gear
goes, it looks pretty hip,

189
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,000
but we're just a
resistance group, so--

190
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,666
[ZERO]
Wrong!

191
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,916
We're not a resistance
group. Is that clear?

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,541
Well then, what are we?

193
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,625
[ZERO] What we are...
what we're trying to be...

194
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,625
...are knights for justice.

195
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,583
[COMM 1] Attention all sniper
teams. Situation is "hold."

196
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,000
All team commanders, confirm...

197
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,666
[CECILE] Those teenage
hostages are friends of yours

198
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,083
from school, aren't they?

199
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,125
They're still negotiating,
so let's not give up hope.

200
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,041
[SUZAKU]
I have faith in the system.

201
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:43,333
I prefer the logic of systems
to individualist emotions.

202
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,500
Uh. Miss Cecile, look!

203
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,500
[CECILE]
Huh?

204
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,333
[CECILE]
LooK!

205
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,208
[SUZAKU]
That's...

206
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,416
What are they gonna do to him?!

207
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,625
Oh, no...

208
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,875
Don't do it!

209
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,916
[SUZAKU]
No!

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,541
Our demands have
gone unanswered.

211
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,666
Therefore, we will throw
one hostage from the roof

212
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,375
every 30 minutes until
our terms are met.

213
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,666
For the sake of the hostages,

214
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,083
negotiations better
be in good faith!

215
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,750
[DARLTON] This is their
warning? Barbarians.

216
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,208
[GUILFORD]
For now, we could negotiate

217
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,625
just to get the women
and children out--

218
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,833
Forget it!

219
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,375
If you give in to their
conditions even once

220
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,791
then you're simply
legitimizing terrorism!

221
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,166
Then do we use force?

222
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,791
We would pursue that
course of action

223
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,666
after we secure the safety
of Princess Euphemia.

224
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,958
[grunts]

225
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,791
[CORNELIA]
Euphy... I...

226
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,375
[VICE SOLDIER 1]
Viceroy! It's Zero!

227
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,791
We just received a
message from Zero.

228
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,083
[DIETHARD]
What?

229
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,916
What do you mean van
three was stolen by Zero?

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,958
What the hell was Gibson
doing all the while?

231
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,000
He said that when he
realized what was happening,

232
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,166
it was too late.

233
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,291
[DIETHARD]
Ugh. Then where's van three now?

234
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,958
Driving straight
toward the military.

235
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,000
[DIETHARD]
Huh?

236
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,083
[COMM 2] We confirm.
It's Zero! Should we open fire?

237
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,583
[COMM 3]
No, just stand by.

238
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,916
We'll capture him
after he's surrounded.

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,083
[OHGI]
Hey...

240
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,708
When Zero went off
about "justice" earlier,

241
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,000
what do you think he meant?

242
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,166
[KALLEN]
Dunno.

243
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,208
But we may die first
before we find out.

244
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,333
It seems all of our escape
routes have been cut off.

245
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,750
[YOSHIDA] I'm just wondering,
why didn't we use that trailer?

246
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,916
[SUGIYAMA]
Oh, so you want the whole world

247
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,166
to see where we hide out, huh?

248
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,458
[MINAMI]
Point taken.

249
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,958
[INOUE] I don't know
about this Zero character.

250
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,416
You sure we should trust him?

251
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,375
[TAMAKI] No, that's why I
said he looked shifty to me.

252
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,583
But if anything goes wrong,
I'll do somethin' about it.

253
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,708
[LELOUCH]
Cornelia...

254
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,916
Much as I'd love to get you
back right here and now,

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,833
you're more useful to me alive.

256
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:32,083
If you do what I predict,
I won't need to use my Geass.

257
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,291
Well, well, we meet again, Zero.

258
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,041
Are you a member of the
Japan Liberation Front?

259
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,125
Or perhaps you
intend to help us.

260
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,541
Regardless,

261
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,291
our concerns take priority
over yours at the moment.

262
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,875
And so, for the death of
my half-brother, Clovis,

263
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,041
I shall take my
revenge right here!

264
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,250
[ZERO] Cornelia!
Which would you chose?

265
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,166
Clovis, who is dead, or
Euphemia, who is alive?

266
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,208
[gasps]

267
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,166
[LELOUCH]
My suspicion's confirmed.

268
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,583
The first task at
hand is completed.

269
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,833
You haven't changed,
dear sister.

270
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,500
You've always doted on
sweet little Euphemia.

271
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,666
That's why you won't
take aggressive action.

272
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,041
Your emotions are
getting in the way.

273
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,416
[ZERO] It's within my power
to save Euphemia for you.

274
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,625
[CORNELIA]
What do you mean?

275
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,833
I have no idea what
you're talking about!

276
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:21,208
[ZERO] I said that
I'm able to rescue her!

277
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,500
Zero, you say?

278
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,500
Yes, sir. Word came
from the Britannian army.

279
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,750
[COMM 1]
Attention all forces!

280
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,416
Let Zero pass! I repeat,
let Zero pass!

281
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,083
[LELOUCH] Either the
Japan Liberation Front

282
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,250
will accept me as their ally,

283
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,458
or they're going to treat me as
nothing more than a nuisance.

284
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,208
In any event, I highly
doubt that they can't resist

285
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,083
the temptation of meeting
the infamous Zero.

286
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,416
We shall see...

287
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,791
Excellent.

288
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,375
All the operation's preliminary
conditions have been cleared.

289
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,958
[DARLTON]
Viceroy, what are we doing?

290
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,166
[CORNELIA] I believe that
by letting Zero go in,

291
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,250
we can buy some time before
the next hostage is executed.

292
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,416
So... this is our chance.

293
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,625
We can hit them both
at the same time.

294
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,916
Wonderful! I want to thank
you for that lovely order!

295
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,375
[laughing]

296
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,416
[LLOYD] They said you've got
the green light, Lancelot!

297
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,041
You've orders to charge right in

298
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,833
to that linear canon
in the tunnel.

299
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,208
Wait a minute, you mean
they're using him as a decoy

300
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,541
to make an opening for them?

301
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,875
[LLOYD] Yup! Seems like
they'll use the confusion

302
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,458
to send in the royal guard!

303
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,541
"Seems like"?! But Lloyd--!

304
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,291
Miss Cecile.

305
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,041
I'm ready. Please let me do it.

306
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,625
If Lancelot and I are needed,

307
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,750
and we're able to give the
hostages an opportunity

308
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,125
to be saved, then I'll do it.

309
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,416
Even if it means being a decoy.

310
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,166
[CECILE]
Warrant Officer Kururugi,

311
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,833
here is a guideline
for your mission.

312
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,208
According to prime search,

313
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,666
the hostages are located
on the hotel's middle floor

314
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,250
and believed to be locked
inside a food storage room.

315
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,875
Advanced prototype
weapon Z-01 Lancelot

316
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,666
will use the utilities tunnel
to move under the hotel.

317
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,916
Once on site, you will
destroy the foundation block

318
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,458
and submerge the building.

319
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,625
The area with the hostages

320
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,250
should hold out
for eight minutes.

321
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,291
Hostage rescue and
mop-up of the terrorists

322
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,916
will be handled by other units.

323
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,625
You will be using the VARIS
to destroy the foundation.

324
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,583
Set the impact rail to
anti-material level three.

325
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,125
[LLOYD]
The only variable in this

326
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,708
is that pesky linear cannon
waiting for you in the tunnel.

327
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,083
Space is tight in there.

328
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,750
The Lancelot will only
have a 47.8% evasion rate.

329
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,500
Are we really going
through with this?

330
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,583
Yup. Make sure you both pull out
of there before it's too late.

331
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,250
Lancelot might be wrecked,
that would be unacceptable.

332
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,500
[SUZAKU]
"Before it's too late"?

333
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,708
[LLOYD]
Mmmm!

334
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,625
Understood, sir.

335
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,166
[SHIRLEY]
Suzaku.

336
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,083
The president, and Nina and
I are going to Lake Kawaguchi

337
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,291
on Sunday. Wanna join us?

338
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,041
[SUZAKU]
Sorry. I have to work that day.

339
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,333
You do?

340
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,291
Too bad, but I guess
that can't be helped then.

341
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,750
[SUZAKU] But thank
you for inviting me.

342
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,333
I really appreciate it.

343
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,083
I hope all of you

Not Elevens! We are
Japanese, dammit!

Yes, we're aware of that!
Just lay off of her!

352
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,625
Then correct her! We're
not called "Elevens"!

Fine, we'll correct her!

speak like that to me!

No, Sub-viceroy, please.

You're addressing

But before I do, I'd like

What exactly do you hope to
accomplish by this action?

00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,416
[KUSAKABE]
Gain attention.

379
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,166
I want this country

He doesn't want to play decoy,

[ZERO] The colonel and the

meaningless this operation was.

00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,583
You were willing to sacrifice
yourself for the commoners.

You haven't changed.

What? The ASEEC's Knightmare?

00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,458
Yes. At the rate it's going,
it'll break through soon.

Huh. Do we dare hold out hope?

Yes!

00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,083
It can take this level
of destructive force!

417

That thing broke through

Deploy the quad-link free-fire

No, you could get killed!

There's no room
for me to evade.

Why, you stinking son of a--

Princess Euphemia Li Britannia.

It's not an appointment
I'm happy with.

430
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,375
[ZERO] No. That's because
Clovis was murdered.

431
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,875
That was my handiwork.

432
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,000
He begged pathetically for
his life to the very end.

433
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,416
He pleaded with the same tongue

434
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,250
that ordered the
deaths of Elevens.

435
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,958
So is that the reason
why you killed my brother?

436
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:43,833
[ZERO]
No.

437
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,250
Then why?!

438
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,958
[ZERO]
Because Clovis was an offspring

439
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,250
of the Britannian emperor.

440
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,958

You're one of his

Use maximum output!

I don't give a damn if
that destroys the guns!

I told you, Zero took the van--

Well then, let's hope we
pick up a signal from them!

What're you doing, Zero?

Wasn't that part of your plan?
To show us something?

All of the hostages from

If we attack you,

executed them.

It was a wanton and
meaningless act.

[ZERO] Just as former

for ordering the slaughter of

We could not stand by and allow
such cruelty to be carried out.
