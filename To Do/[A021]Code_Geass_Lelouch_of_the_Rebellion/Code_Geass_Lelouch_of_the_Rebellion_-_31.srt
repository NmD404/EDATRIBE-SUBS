1
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,541
[NUNNALLY]
Is that you, Lelouch?

2
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,416
It's me, Nunnally.

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,666
[SUZAKU]
If your memory hasn't returned,

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,750
you won't know who she is.

5
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:33,583
Go on, Lelouch,
let's hear your answer!

6
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,541
[LELOUCH]
Suzaku, you've got me trapped.

7
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,375
[NUNNALLY] Um. This is
my brother, isn't it?

8
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,875
[LELOUCH] I can't do this!
I can't lie to Nunnally!

9
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,833
[LELOUCH]
I... I... Uh?

10
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,375
[LELOUCH]
Rolo?

11
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,458
Good work. Keep him like that.

12
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,541
You'll have to hurry.
Don't forget the time limit.

13
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,916
I know. Nunally, listen to me.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Lelouch! It is you!

15
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,041
[LELOUCH]
For right now,

16
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,333
we have to act like
we're strangers.

17
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,625
[NUNNALLY gasps]

18
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,458
[LELOUCH] It's necessary!
Just follow my lead!

19
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,375
I'm going to come
for you. I swear it!

20
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,208
And so, until then ...

21
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,750
Until then,
I love you, Nunnally!

22
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:19,791
[gasps]

23
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,083
Uh, you're confusing
me with someone else.

24
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,208
That's right, I'm just a
student at the school here.

25
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,875
[SUZAKU] Lelouch, your memory
really hasn't come back?

26
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,708
[LELOUCH]
Yes. I beg your pardon.

27
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,958
[NUNNALLY]
Forgive me.

28
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,458
When I heard you was a
good friend of Suzaku's,

29
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,875
I guess I just jumped
to conclusions.

30
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,541
It's just I...

31
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:45,125
No, please, it's an honor for me
to speak with a royal princess.

32
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:49,541
[NUNNALLY gasps] Um, could you
please put Suzaku back on?

33
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,416
[LELOUCH]
Yes, Your Highness.

34
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,583
[SUZAKU]
Forgive me, Nunnally.

35
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,916
I didn't mean to cause
a misunderstanding.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,833
[NUNNALLY]
No, it's all right.

37
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,916
He just seemed so similar
that it surprised me.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,916
Well, um, I'll see you
when I get to Area 11.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,333
[GUILFORD]
Don't underestimate the threat.

40
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,583
He may be at a disadvantage,

41
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,291
but, we're still
dealing with Zero!

42
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,166
You can be sure he has
some plan underway.

43
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,625
[UPSON]
Such a cowardly response.

44
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,125
And they call you the
"Spearhead of the Empire". Hmph.

45
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,708
Fortunately, Viceroy Nunnally
has me to protect her.

46
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,500
Your services won't be needed.

47
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,666
But, general, Zero is--

48
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,750
Dead, Lord Guilford!

49
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:24,750
[GUILFORD gasps]

50
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,958
[UPSON]
Zero was killed last year!

51
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,791
The Zero we face now
is just using his name!

52
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,916
Princess Cornelia
would regret seeing

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,875
your contemptable fear
for this cheap imposter?

54
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,708
Speaking of regret.

55
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,416
[UPSON grunts]

56
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,875
Earl Asplund.

57
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,375
[LLOYD]
Sorry we're late.

58
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,666
Adjusting Lancelot took longer
than we thought it would!

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,833
It's been quite
a while, Earl Asplund.

60
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,083
That's because I'm working

61
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,875
directly under
little Charlie now!

62
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,541
Are you referring
to His Majesty!

63
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,750
[CECILE gasps]
Please forgive him, sir!

64
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:53,833
Lloyd, please!

65
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,166
[LLOYD]
Hm? Did I say something wrong?

66
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,625
I see that you
haven't changed.

67
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,666
As for the item we discussed...

68
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,291
Yes, It comes to us
via Prince Schneizel.

69
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,083
It's rather nice, having a
second prince to call on.

70
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,875
You have my thanks.

71
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,250
[UPSON]
Unbelievable!

72
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,500
This prodigal
aristocrat is serving

73
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,291
as Lord Kururugi's guardian!

74
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,916
He'd better not
interfere with efforts

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,041
to educate the new viceroy.

76
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,333
[NUNNALLY]
Did Suzaku lie to me?

77
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:24,000
But, my own brother...
I don't understand.

78
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,458
Has something
happened between them?

79
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,500
[MALE NEWSCASTER]
The new viceroy is set to arrive

80
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,833
at Area 11 tomorrow
to take up her post.

81
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,875
The name and background
of the new viceroy

82
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,833
still has not been
released to the public.

83
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,958
The big question's the Chinese
Federation consulate, right?

84
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,291
You mean regarding Zero?

85
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,208
As there has been no
formal announcement,

86
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,625
some think Chief Consul Gao-Hai
may be acting on his own.

87
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,583
The consul general's
standing will depend

88
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,083
upon the balance of power...

89
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,916
[EUNUCH A] W-What about
the stand-off in Area 11?

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,375
[KAGUYA] Oh, I'm afraid
I don't know the details.

91
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,125
[EMPRESS] Can you tell
me anything about the

92
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,791
outside world? I've never gone
beyond the walls of this palace.

93
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,833
[EUNUCH A] That's because
this Forbidden City in the

94
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,250
Luoyang Capital is the very
center of the world, Empress.

95
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,583
[EMPRESS]
But...

96
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,291
I'm going to go outside
and see what's happening.

97
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,833
[EMPRESS]
Huh?

98
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,208
[KAGUYA] The truth is, I came
today to say goodbye to you.

99
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,500
Oh, no!

100
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,708
Not now, when I've finally
made a real friend.

101
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,541
I'm very sorry,

102
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,208
but you know my husband
is waiting for me.

103
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,625
[C.C.] The supplies
were successfully

104
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,250
received in Niigata.

105
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,833
[LELOUCH]
I see.

106
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,500
[C.C.] However, there's no way
for them into the consulate now.

107
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,000
[LELOUCH]
As expected.

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,666
Nunnally is going to
be the new viceroy.

109
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,791
Will you be able to fight her?

110
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,041
Your sister?

111
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,583
[LELOUCH]
Fight? Nunnally?

112
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,250
Is that some kind of joke?

113
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,791
Then you're just going
to leave her alone?

114
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,416
[LELOUCH]
Out of the question.

115
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
If nothing's done,
Nunnally will be used

116
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,041
as a political tool,
just like she was before!

117
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,666
[C.C.] A girl who can't
walk and can't see...

118
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,208
Do they plan to use her as
a pawn, then throw her away?

119
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,041
[LELOUCH growls]
I'm doing all this to keep that

120
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,250
from happening! That's why I
formed the Black Knights!

121
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,125
I became Zero for
Nunnally's sake!

122
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,666
I'm well aware
that your sister's

123
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,583
your entire reason for living.

124
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,125
However...

125
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,083
I am going to create a world
where Nunnally can live happily!

126
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,750
To do that, I will
obliterate Britannia!

127
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,125
You mentioned, V.V. Is he
in the Britannian homeland?

128
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,208
I don't know that
much about him.

129
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,125
However, I know that he's
your father's first ally:

130
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,166
Emperor Charles of Britannia's
chief confederate.

131
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,500
[LELOUCH]
Confederate?

132
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,458
[C.C.]
Long ago, they made a pact.

133
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,166
I shall slay the god!

134
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,833
Yes, that is our
binding contract.

135
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,958
[V.V.] Tell me, Charles,
why didn't you tell Nunnally

136
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,750
about Zero's true identity.
And about Geass.

137
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,708
[EMPEROR] It wasn't
necessary for her to know.

138
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,041
You know, Charles, you really
are still a child.

139
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,916
Perhaps I am, big brother.

140
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,041
Where's Viceroy Nunnally?

141
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,208
[SHIP ADJUTANT]
She's in the garden.

142
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,416
Even if she came
to the bridge...

143
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,333
[UPSON scoffs]
I guess there'd be no point

144
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,625
[SUZAKU]
The Black Knights?!

145
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,708
They're not here?!

146
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,750
[XING-KE]
Right.

147
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,291
We only just
confirmed it ourselves.

148
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,041
I'll give you all the
information I have.

149
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,333
That way, it should
be crystal clear

150
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,458
that my country has no hostile
intentions toward Britannia.

151
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,833
Did Zero go with them?!

152
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,333
[XING-KE]
It appears so.

153
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,375
They took their knightmares
with them and they vanished.

154
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,041
We're guessing they left
through an underground level.

155
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,500
[SUZAKU huffs]
To where?

156
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,541
[XING-KE]
No idea. That's all I have.

157
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,250
They wouldn't attack Nunnally?

158
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,625
We've been had.

159
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,208
Should we... strike back.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,166
[UPSON]
The Black Knights!

161
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,708
[ZERO]
The objective of this operation

162
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,416
is the capture of
the new viceroy!

163
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,541
No matter what happens,

164
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,208
she absolutely
must not be harmed!

165
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,416
Keep her safe, is that clear!

166
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,583
[BLACK KNIGHTS]
Roger!

167
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,041
Tamaki, what are you doing?!

168
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,458
Amateurs!

169
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,291
Bringing land-based units
for an aerial mission-- Ah!

170
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,125
Surface flares will have
no effect on our defense.

171
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,875
Surround and attack now!

172
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,291
All right, General Tohdoh,
the rest is up to you.

173
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,791
Right. Good luck,
Deputy-Commander.

174
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,208
[UPSON]
Impossible...!

175
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,250
They're landing on top of us?!

176
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,541
[RADIO TECHNICIAN A]
Two more enemy Knightmares

177
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,041
have landed on our main wing!

178
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,625
[RADIO TECHNICIAN B]
They're on our escorts as well!

179
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,875
Send our aerial forces to--

180
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,041
[booming]

181
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,583
[LELOUCH]
You took the bait, commander.

182
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,375
I figured you'd concentrate
your air power on the smoke.

183
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,166
The obvious response.

184
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,958
Now we can focus
on the flagship.

185
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,000
All right! We're withdrawing!

186
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,500
[UPSON]
Deploy the remaining air ships.

187
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,666
Have the escort
ships fire as well!

188
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,250
[SHIP OFFICER A] But sir,
the enemy is targeting

189
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,083
our float units. We can't shoot
back because our shields are up!

190
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,458
Then how can we
defend this ship?!

191
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,375
[grunts]

192
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,416
If I'd known this was possible,

193
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,625
I'd have brought
Lord Guilford along!

194
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,333
It'll take an hour
for reinforcements

195
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,458
to reach us from the
Tokyo settlement!

196
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,291
[ORANGE VEST] What if a
Knightmare makes it inside?

197
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,416
[LAB COAT]
Then we crash.

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,166
Our job now is to
help the survivors--

199
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,208
[BOTH gasp]

200
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,125
What... is that?

201
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,541
[ZERO]
Die!

202
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,333
--[ORANGE VEST gasps]
--[LAB COAT gasps]

203
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:06,833
Ya.

204
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,500
Understood.

205
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,250
[LELOUCH] Nunnally,
I'm coming to save you.

206
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,625
Now, Samurai Leap over
Floating Boats attack!

207
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,166
[ASAHINA]
You can put your shields up,

208
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,708
but once we get inside,
your finished.

209
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,166
Looks like they're running
out of air strength too.

210
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,875
You'll end up a skinned rabbit.

211
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,125
Don't get cocky.

212
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,208
Right, right.

213
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,333
I'll stick to basics, but, huh?

214
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,666
Reinforcements from Tokyo?

215
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,750
So soon?

216
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,416
No, it looks like
their rear guard.

217
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,541
And, they have float units.

218
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,833
[KALLEN]
Knightmares!

219
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,916
[KALLEN gasps]

220
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,250
[KALLEN]
It can't be That machine is...

221
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,541
Now, Let's bring
down the curtain.

222
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,458
[CECILE] Output on
all units is normal.

223
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,458
Isn't mass production nice?

224
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,250
Well, I'm not so
sure about this.

225
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,375
Did Prince Scneizel
really approved the budget?

226
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,125
If he didn't, he'll notice
it pretty soon.

227
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,291
What?!

228
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,375
You didn't tell him
what you were doing?

229
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,250
[KALLEN]
I don't need to fly for this.

230
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,125
You have the right instincts,
but the wrong Knightmare.

231
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,166
[KALLEN huffs]

232
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,000
Sorry! I'm out.

233
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,958
Damn Guilford,
acting without orders!

234
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,416
But he saved us, my lord.

235
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,333
Yes, and he'll take all
of the credit for it!

236
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,625
[LELOUCH] All tasks at
hand have been cleared.

237
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,375
And now, the tide of
battle shall turn!

238
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,375
[LELOUCH gasps]
Nunnally...

239
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,333
Look! Zero's inside!

240
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,916
What are those guards doing?

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,541
Viceroy Nunnally, it's Zero!

242
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,875
[NUNNALLY gasps]

243
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,708
[SECURITY GUARD B]
I'm informing General Upson now.

244
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,166
[SECURITY GUARDS groan]

245
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,791
Their reunion is starting.
It must not be disturbed.

246
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,916
[LELOUCH gasps]
Nunnally...

247
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,750
[LELOUCH]
We're together again. At last.

248
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,583
You're, Zero, aren't you?
The terrorist.

249
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,291
Have you come to
kill me as well?

250
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,791
Like you killed
my brother Clovis

251
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,458
and my sister Euphie?

252
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,916
[NUNNALLY] Even so, will you
wait just a moment, please?

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,916
I think that what
you're doing is wrong!

254
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,458
[grunts]
It's a Harken!

255
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,916
Hit him now, Kouzuki!

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,083
[KALLEN]
Right!

257
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,125
[KALLEN grunts]

258
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,541
[gasps]

259
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,708
Okay, it's discipline time!

260
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,750
What a weird-looking
fighter plane.

261
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,208
Even so...!

262
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,250
[ASAHINA]
A Knightmare?!

263
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,291
[grunts]

264
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,291
I'm finished. Sorry.

265
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,500
[SHIP OFFICER B] That just
leaves four enemy units.

266
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,583
The Knights of
the Round as well!

267
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,625
I'll never bear this disgrace.

268
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,583
--[computer beeping]
-- Now what?!

269
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,625
[SHIP OFFICER C] Starboard
escort ship has lost control!

270
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,833
What?!

271
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,583
[SHIP-OFFICER C]
It's on a collision course!

272
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,625
[UPSON]
Turn the ship!

273
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:07,750
[SHIP ADJUTANT]
We'll never make it!

274
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,625
[SHIP OFFICER C]
We're going to crash!

275
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,375
[yells]

276
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,333
[GINO chuckles] The Mordred
always handles things

277
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,500
in its own unique way.

278
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,500
Anya, don't do
that again, okay?

279
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,625
We don't want to kill
the viceroy now, do we?

280
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,291
But I saved her.

281
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,541
Lloyd, how's the Lancelot?

282
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,875
[LLOYD] Ready and waiting
for you! Come and get it!

283
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,708
General! What are you
doing in that gun turret?

284
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,000
[UPSON] At this rate,
I'm going to be demoted!

285
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,208
I have to do something
to prove myself!

286
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,833
I'll kill the Black Knights!

287
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:46,500

00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,833
[UPSON laughs]

00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,916
You fool! You shot
your own engines!

291
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,250
[NUNNALLY] Right now, Zero is
standing in front of me.

292
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,291
Lelouch, give me
the courage I need.

293
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,958
[ZERO]
It's Britannia that is wrong.

294
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,458
The emperor believes
that might is always right.

295
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,125
Do you approve of that?

296
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,750
[NUNNALLY]
Well...

297
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,416
[ZERO] Viceroy Nunnally,
you're just being used.

298
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,750
You're saying
they sent a blind,

299
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,083
crippled girl to win
everyone's sympathy?

300
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,416
Then, you're wrong.

301
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,916
[ZERO]
Hm?

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,958
[NUNNALLY] I asked them to
send me. That's why I'm here.

303
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,000
[LELOUCH gasps]

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,458
Where's Zero?

305
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,291
[TOHDOH] We can't contact him
because of the ECCM effects.

306
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,250
I want to rendezvous
with Chiba and Kouzuki

307
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,500
and scout inside the ship.

308
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,416
[SENBA] But the
ship's going to crash.

309
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,625
Do you think you
have time for that?

310
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,291
It's very--

311
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,333
[TOHDOH]
Senba!

312
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,833
I don't like picking on those
who are weaker than me, but...

313
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,125
Never thought a
place like this...

314
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,416
[TOHDOH]
Senba!

315
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,708
[GUILFORD] Using land
units for an aerial attack?

316
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,000
That's not your kind
of tactic, Toudo.

317
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,333
[ZERO]
You requested it?

318
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,333
[NUNNALLY] I think with
a peaceful approach,

319
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,750
I can make the world
a more gentler place.

320
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,250
That's why I want to
carry out Euphie's plan

321
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,625
to create the Specially
Administrated Zone of Japan.

322
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,083
[ZERO]
You'd have that return?!

323
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:19,833
Zero, won't you please try
to help me to rebuild it?

324
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,583
[ZERO gasps]

325
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,458
[NUNNALLY]
People can start over! Please!

326
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,416
[SUZAKU] Zero's coming to steal
Nunnally away, but there's been

327
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,791
no word from the Office
of Secret Intelligence.

328
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,125
So, am I fighting
Zero or Lelouch?

329
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,875
Sir Kururugi, I'm confirming the
data now. The number two float

330
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,750
unit on Viceroy Nunnally's
Flagship has shut down.

331
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,916
The number 3 and 4 float
units are interlinked,

332
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,875
so a case theta has occured.

333
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,250
[LLOYD]
To sum that up,

334
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,750
we'll all be swimming
in the ocean soon.

335
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,875
Uh. Except for general Upson,

336
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,791
who's regrettably
didn't make it.

337
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,833
Right now, rescuing the
viceroy has top priority!

[KALLEN gasps]

349
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:40,000
Kallen, I have to save Nunnally.
Nothing else matters now.

350
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:44,666
I won't ask for your
forgiveness... any more.

351
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,291
Kouzuki, hide!
Get inside of the ship!

352
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,708
[KALLEN] I can't Not until
everyone's gotten away!

353
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,750
What the hell!

354
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,708
Kouzuki!

Pull the eject lever, Kouzuki!

357
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,791
No use! It isn't working!

358
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,166

[RAKSHATA]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

369
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,666
I have the new Black Knight

370
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,500
You did review
the manual I sent?

371
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,500
[KALLEN]
Uh, sure. I'm good to go!

372
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,708
All right, let's try
it out then.

373
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,416
We'll give you the
basic guidance from here.

374
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,583

No matter how many
enemies are coming...!

394
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,916
[GUILFORD] Our unit
will go after Tohdoh!

395
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,333
[GINO] Right, and we'll
protect the viceroy.

396
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,083
Huh? In the sky?

397
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,458
The Black Knights have
a float system, too?

398
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,083
Kouzuki! Save Zero!

399
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,541
I'm on it, sir!

400
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,250
Oh? You've gained wings and
a shield, huh? So what!

401
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,250
If this Guren doesn't work
perfectly, then I'm finished.

402
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,458
Well, we don't have
much choice, try shooting it.

403
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,250
[KALLEN]
You've got a point, there!

404
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,791
[GUILFORD gasps]
From long range?!

405
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,000
[GUILFORD grunts]

406
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,375
I can do it! With this Guren
Flight-Enabled Version!

407
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,458
Nice one.

408
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,125
[GINO]
Suzaku, get to the viceroy!

409
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,458
[SUZAKU]
Don't let your guard down!

410
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,125
That's the pilot who
defeated Lord Jeremiah!

411
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,708
[GINO]
The one who beat Orange boy?

412
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:42,958
Come on!

413
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Well, look at that.

414
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,250
As good as the
Knights of the Round?

415
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,416
We'll see, right now.

416
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,541
Don't underestimate the Guren!

417
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,291
[ANYA grunts]
Dirty shoes.

418
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,375
I'll take care of
you guys later.

419
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:09,916
Gad!

420
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,291
It can fire wide-range, too?!

421
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,666
What's its total energy?!

422
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,250
[CECILE]
The same amount, but scattered.

423
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,583
With the internal
damage it caused,

424
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,375
those units won't be able
to function for a while.

425
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,166
So, what's with that knightmare?

426
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,541
Uh-uhh. It's all the pilot.

427
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,958
I shouldn't have held
back on my attack.

428
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,708
[SUZAKU]
Kallen, Why would you come back

429
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,250
under these conditions?

430
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,875
Is it that Zero's on
the ship already?!

431
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,916
MOVE IT!

432
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,375
[RAKSHATA]
Have a taste of the Gefjun Net!

433
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,791
We have a countermeasure
for this!

434
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,750
[KALLEN] You're still
stuck where you are!

435
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,291
No way!

436
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,916
It can't be more powerful than
and advanced Yggdrasil Drive!

437
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,166
[CECILE]
Suzaku!

438
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,666
We've located the viceroy!

439
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,000
She's in the garden space to
the rear of the main bridge!

440
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,375
But hurry!

441
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,083
Now there's only 47 seconds
till the ship crashes!

442
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,541
[SUZAKU]
I promise, I'll save her!

443
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,083
Damn!

00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,958
[LLOYD yells]

445
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,791
[C.C.]
Kallen! Forget about Suzaku!

446
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,833
[KAGUYA]
Save Master Zero!

447
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,833
I understand, but where?!

448
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,083
[SUZAKU]
Tsk! There's no time left.

449
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,416
I'll have to use the
Core Luminous Cone.

450
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,000
Go!

451
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,166
[LELOUCH]
What do I do?

452
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,791
I can't reveal Zero's
identity to her,

453
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,916
but I can't take her
by force either.

454
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,500
I can see now that
would traumatize her!

455
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,541

456
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,541

458
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,125
[ZERO]
Escape with me!

459
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,666
Nunnally!

[ZERO gasps]

462
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:52,333
[LELOUCH] No! Not after he
sold me out to the emperor!

463
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,916
Suzaku! Down here!

[ZERO grunts]

465
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,125
[SUZAKU]
Were you frightened?

466
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,416
Forgive me! It's all right now!

467
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:06,333
[LELOUCH gasps]
Nunnally with Suzaku!

468
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,000
[SUZAKU]
Zero! Not this time!

469
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,166
[ZERO]
Nunnally!

[gasps]

471
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,500
[LELOUCH] Eight years ago,
because our mother was murdered,

472
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,666
because we were
abandoned by Britannia,

473
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,250
protecting Nunnally
became everything to me.

474
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:06,500
Cleaning the house,
making our dinner everything.

475
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,666
But now! I'm a fool!

476
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,500
Nunnally has
dreams of her own.

477
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,958
She has chosen a
path for herself.

478
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:17,791
It's so obvious. So simple.

479
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,916
[LELOUCH gasps]
What should I do?
