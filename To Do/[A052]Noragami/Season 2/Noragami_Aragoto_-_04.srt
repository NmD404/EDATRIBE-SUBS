1
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:27,666
[banging]

2
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,541
[gasps] Where are we?

3
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,916
I wish I knew.
We were knocked out.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,875
I didn't see how we got
here. And we're trapped.

5
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,333
The door's been scourged
from the outside.

6
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,333
This sounds like
a classic kidnapping!

7
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,708
[KAZUMA]
Uh, yes.

8
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,333
I've been trying to free us,
but nothing's worked.

9
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,666
[HIYORI chuckles]

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,041
[gasps]

11
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,791
[HIYORI] The kidnappers
made one serious oversight.

12
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,333
Those fools.

13
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,375
They should have known
better than to kidnap me!

14
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,291
Huh?

15
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,958
[HIYORI]
Let's go! Jungle Savate!

16
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:05,000
[screams]

17
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,333
[KAZUMA]
Are... you okay?

18
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:11,958
And I've got my
advancement exam tomorrow!

19
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,375
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,708
You should never have
been dragged into this.

21
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:19,958
It's okay... Really.

22
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,125
I hope Yato's all right, though.

23
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,416
He was in pretty bad shape.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Knowing him, he'll go
and push himself too hard.

25
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,750
[KAZUMA]
At this point, you should really

26
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,125
be more concerned
about yourself.

27
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:31,875
[HIYORI]
Hm?

28
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,208
This is serious.

29
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,125
We're both sealed off
from the outside.

30
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,791
You can't remain this
way for too long...

31
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,416
...or you'll die.

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,583
[gasps]

33
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,291
[HIYORI'S MOM] What happened?
Did she faint again?

34
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,041
[HIYORI'S DAD]
Try to stay calm, dear.

35
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,458
She isn't hurt anywhere.
She's just asleep.

36
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,208
[HIYORI'S MOM]
But look at her!

37
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,791
[HIYORI'S DAD] She's probably
worn out from studying.

38
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,291
Why don't you
stay here with her?

39
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,750
She's breathing shallower
than I'd like.

40
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,791
To be safe, let's prep
an oxygen ventilator.

41
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,125
God, I beg you, let her be okay.

42
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,083
Let her come back to us.

43
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:53,500
[HIYORI] I'm really going
to die here? No. I can't.

44
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,291
It's my fault. I should
have prevented this.

45
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,916
But still. What happened there?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,375
Kugaha clearly had his
sights set on you. But, why?

47
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,958
Plus, my invocation
had no effect on him.

48
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,541
I shackled him with the
"Kuga" name, and yet...

49
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,750
Shackled him with a name?

50
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,333
[KAZUMA]
Yes.

51
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,541
For Regalia, a name is
a bestowment and a scourge

52
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,625
from the god we call master.

53
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:24,125
Both things at once, in simpler
terms, it's a gift and a curse.

54
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,250
Even for you? Your
name... is a curse?

55
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,458
[KAZUMA]
Yes.

56
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,083
Names dwell within those
to whom they refer.

57
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,500
Invocations are
based on that fact.

58
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,208
Yet, when I invoked his name,

59
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,791
Kugaha remained unaffected.

60
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,541
Could it be? Is he...?

61
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,625
[HIYORI]
Eh?

62
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,750
[KAZUMA]
No. I can't know that.

63
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,083
All that's certain is
that he's betrayed Veena.

64
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,041
Using their names
to employ Phantoms

65
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,750
and scourged weapons,

66
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,666
Kugaha and Aiha have defiled
their god-given gifts!

67
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,750
[KAZUMA]
How could they?

68
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,333
Names are so precious to us!

69
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,708
Kazu-ma.

70
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,166
Why are you the only one
whose name ends differently?

71
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,000
Kugaha, Aiha, Suzuha...

72
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,041
Their names all end in "ha."

73
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,500
Why does yours end in "ma"?

74
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,000
[KAZUMA] It's something
a lot of the gods do.

75
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,500
They'll add a common character
to all their Regalia's names.

76
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,041
For some, it's like
a brand of sorts.

77
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:28,291
For others, it is a way
to foster a familial bond.

78
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,500
Veena currently
unifies her Regalia

79
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,333
under the "Ha" Clan name.

80
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,166
[HIYORI]
"Currently"?

81
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,541
[KAZUMA] Yes. The previous
clan shared the "Ma" name.

82
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,916
I'm the sole survivor
of that clan.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,208
The "ma" in Kazuma is a relic.

84
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,375
What? What happened
to all the rest?

85
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,000
They were annihilated.

86
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,291
Yato slaughtered
the entire clan.

87
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:58,583
[BISHAMON] Yato. If you want
Kazuma, you can have him.

88
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:03,208
Go ahead and make him a Nora.
May he betray you as he did me.

89
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,458
When next we meet,
I will eradicate your name.

90
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:11,125
Not even a shred of a
memory will remain of you.

91
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,375
[YUKINE]
What? Bishamon took Hiyori?

92
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:18,083
But, why? That's crazy! What
would Bishamon want with her?

93
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,208
How could you let
this happen, Yato?

94
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,375
[gasps]

95
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,833
[YUKINE]
It's my fault.

96
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,333
Never mind that.
Let's go kick some ass.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,833
Yeah!

98
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,333
Wha-- Hey!

99
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,625
Hold on! You're not
planning to assault

100
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,875
Bishamon's headquarters
by yourselves, are you?

101
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:40,916
That's crazy!

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,166
You've been smart enough

103
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,958
to stay away from her.
Don't change that now!

104
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,291
You know what happens to anyone
who messes with that chick!

105
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:52,041
How do you even plan to
get to Takamagahara, huh?

106
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,541
Do you hear me?

107
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,958
[KAZUMA]
Yato was very thorough.

108
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:02,250
The destruction was total.
We lost our family.

109
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:06,083
Only Veena and I
survived the massacre.

110
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,875
She wept for their loss,
and fell gravely ill

111
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:13,750
for a long time. Eventually,
her sorrow changed into hatred

112
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,333
for Yato and she
obtained a new Regalia.

113
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,708
Then another and another.

114
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,833
She gave them the "Ha" name.

115
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,000
They're her family now.

116
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,291
So great is her guilt
for the "Ma" Clan's death,

117
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:32,083
she now makes any spirit she
comes across into a Regalia.

118
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,291
Among all the gods in existence,

119
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:39,083
only a very few are capable
of shouldering so many of us.

120
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,458
It takes immense
strength and determination

121
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,791
to endure the pain of
bearing even one Regalia.

122
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,958
That is what makes her
the mightiest god of war.

123
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,625
And probably the one with
the kindest heart, as well.

124
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:57,125
I do like that about her,
but it also makes me worry.

125
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,458
I can't help but fear that,
someday, her kindness

126
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,875
might be her undoing.

127
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,791
We can't allow a
repeat of that tragedy.

128
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,625
But she's now beset
by poor health

129
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:11,666
and her Regalia's betrayal.
It's almost like before!

130
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,708
If nothing changes,
then soon, Veena will--

131
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,666
[gasps]

132
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,000
[KAZUMA] Wait. Is that what
Kugaha is after? Succession?

133
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,791
[AIHA]
I don't understand!

134
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,500
Did the plan change
at some point?

135
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,666
I thought we were just
capturing the girl.

136
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,416
Why'd we take Kazuma, too?

137
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,041
[KUGAHA] Because, he is
a traitor to his kin.

138
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,750
Besides, he might
be able to tell us

139
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,625
Lady Bishamon's weaknesses.
And that could be very helpful.

140
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,500
[AIHA] What?! You're
not making any sense!

141
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,208
There, do you see?

142
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,791
Using that staff made
a bunch more grow!

143
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,083
I can't go anywhere like this!
People will see them!

144
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,583
[KUGAHA chuckles]
You know, you're as gullible

145
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,458
as you are pretty.

146
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,375
You're my creature now.

147
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,458
If you want this to stay
secret, you'll do as I say.

148
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,875
Now, you could have
an ablution done.

149
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,791
Of course, if you did
that, there's no doubt

150
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,708
you would be exiled for good.

151
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,958
[laughs]

152
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,083
Lady Bishamon will be
replaced soon enough.

153
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,416
Until then, just take
some more of these.

154
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,416
[KUGAHA]
Todays' dose.

155
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,916
What? Something's going
to happen to our master?

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,791
[KUGAHA]
You catch on quickly.

157
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, a successor is
going to take her place.

158
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:27,000
But first, she's
going to have to die.

159
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,208
[KAZUMA]
Gods are born from wishes.

160
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:33,416
Because of that, gods with a
name are immortal, in a sense.

161
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,250
A god's death won't
change people's faith.

162
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,458
The name of
Bishamon will remain.

163
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:42,583
And if people still pray to it,
a new god will be born.

164
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,000
[KAZUMA]
There will be a new Bishamon.

165
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,958
[KUGAHA] The time is ripe
for a successor.

166
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,250
And when our new master arrives,

167
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,791
I'll be standing by
to take Kazuma's place

168
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,708
as exemplar with the absolute
power of a mighty war god

169
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,708
at my fingertips.

170
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,708
That's horrible.

171
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:07,500
But Bishamon's so powerful,
how can he possibly kill her?

172
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,583
If you don't return,
Yato will think

173
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,250
Veena abducted you.

174
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,208
He'll come to your rescue,
and he'll be very angry.

175
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,583
[HIYORI]
Huh?

176
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,916
[KAZUMA]
Yes. Kugaha can't do it himself.

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,291
He plans to have Yato kill her.

178
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,250
[AIHA] No! That's absolutely
unforgivable! I won't--

179
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,458
Stop talking.

180
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,375
Unless becoming a monster
is what you actually want.

181
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,875
[DAIKOKU]
Damn it!

182
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,375
Where is Kazuma, now that
we actually need him?

183
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,750
You'll have to use me to
stop Yato. C'mon, let's go!

184
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,166
[DAIKOKU]
Kofuku!

185
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,916
If we did that,
the Storm we'd cause

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,250
would be huge. Do you know
how many people would die?

187
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,375
But what should we do?

188
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,333
Those two may well
kill each other.

189
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,333
Bishamon would be
reborn right away,

190
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,583
but Yato's got no name,
and there's Yukine!

191
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,250
[KOFUKU]
Let's make a bet!

192
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,708
The odds against Yatty
winning are ten to one.

193
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,416
So I'll bet on Bisha!

194
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,791
Gambling? Now isn't
the time for--

195
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,750
That's right. Think
about it for a second!

196
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,125
I'm the god of poverty.

197
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,875
If I bet money on Bisha,
then she should lose.

198
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,666
Which means Yatty
should win, right?

199
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,291
Certainly not!

200
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,500
You know that I
don't have a shrine.

201
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,791
Without one, I can't get
to Takamagahara on my own.

202
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,458
Please, Tenjin.
Just take us up there.

203
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,791
For Hiyori.

204
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,458
[sighs] This sort of thing
is exactly the reason

205
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,500
you shouldn't be keeping
her tied to the Far Shore.

206
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,416
I'll agree to help you
on two conditions.

207
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,208
First, no one is to know
I was involved in any way.

208
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,250
As for the second...

209
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,541
I assume you know.

210
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,375
Yeah.

211
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,208
[TENJIN]
Yato. Yukine.

212
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,166
It seems strange.

213
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,750
Bishamon has always been
such a noble god.

214
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,750
Not the sort who would
stoop to kidnapping a girl.

215
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,500
[TENJIN]
What is it? Are you worried?

216
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,458
Well, a little.
He is obstinate, though.

217
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,625
Once he gets going,
not much can stop him.

218
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,041
They'll be just fine. I'm sure.

219
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:21,833
Still, this is going
to be one stormy night.

220
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,208
It certainly will be.

221
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,125
And the plum blossoms
are in full bloom.

222
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,416
I do hope they survive
the disturbance.

223
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,541
Let's go, Sekki!

224
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,041
[REGALIA screaming]

225
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,208
[REGALIA 4A]
What's that?

226
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,250
[REGALIA 4B]
Intruder at the front gate!

227
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,416
[REGALIA 4C]
Run!

228
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,708
[REGALIA 4D]
All non-weapons, get inside!

229
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,666
[REGALIA 4E]
Who goes there?

230
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,291
[REGALIA 4F]
Alert the master!

231
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,833
[BISHAMON] I never expected
you to come to me.

232
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,625
I've been wanting
to see you, Yato.

233
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,916
It looks like you got your wish.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,166
Not yet, but soon enough.

235
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,083
Gaiki! Suki!

236
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,375
I want you at maximum firepower!

237
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,291
Feel that?

238
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,416
Those two Regalia
seem extra powerful!

239
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,333
They're way beyond
normal handguns.

240
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,583
[YATO]
With Kazuma gone, there's nobody

241
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,250
to keep this crazy
woman in check!

242
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,916
But that doesn't matter
if she can't hit us!

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,083
[YATO yells]

244
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,291
[KAZUMA]
I'm her exemplar!

245
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,208
I should have seen this coming.

246
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,333
He's set two gods
against each other.

247
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,875
It's unthinkable!

248
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:52,125
Don't do it, Veena!
You can't face Yato!

249
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,458
You're playing into
Kugaha's hands!

250
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,125
[KUGAHA]
I'm glad you came, Yato god.

251
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,375
I've sickened Bishamon for you.

252
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,416
I think you'll find her much
weaker than you expected.

253
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,625
Considering how graciously
I've prepared everything,

254
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,208
I think it's only fair
you do your part

255
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,541
and kill Bishamon!

256
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,583
This is awful!

257
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,666
[TSUGUHA]
There you are!

258
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,583
[AIHA gasps]

259
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,625
Oh, awesome!

260
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,958
I'm glad you're
already standing by!

261
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:22,916
This is a big one!

262
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,791
We're up against Lord Yato.

263
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,750
You're more experienced,
so we're holding you in reserve.

264
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,916
If I go down, it'll
all be up to you.

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,375
Milady, I'm coming!

266
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,375
Come! Kinki! Shoki!
Jinki! Shuki!

267
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,375
[KURAHA roars]

268
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,125
[YATO grunts]

269
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,791
[YATO]
What the hell?

270
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,333
Why'd you go dull
all of a sudden?

271
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,583
Sorry, I can't help it.

272
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,708
Her whip, her lion,
her outfit...

273
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,958
They're all Regalia like me.
How can I kill them?

274
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,166
They don't share your
reservations, you know.

275
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,458
They're trying to kill us.

276
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,875
Yeah, I know that, but still.

277
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,000
Maybe if I put it another way.

278
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,041
Protect me!

279
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,291
[gasps]

280
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,916
We came here to get Hiyori back!

281
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,541
[heartbeat]

282
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,875
[YUKINE]
All right.

283
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,625
[YATO]
Let's go!

284
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,000
Suki! Gaiki!

285
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,166
[grunting]

286
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,000
[BOTH gasp]

287
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,166
[BISHAMON]
Don't flinch!

288
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,375
Blast him and his
Regalia to bits for me!

289
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,833
[yells]

290
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:35,583
[KARUHA yelps]

291
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,166
[gasps]

292
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,333
Karuha!

293
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,333
Tell me where Hiyori is!

294
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,625
What? How should I know?

295
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,125
[YATO] That's one tough Garment
for how little it covers.

296
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,916
Don't play dumb, coward!

297
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,625
You dragged an innocent
person into this!

298
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,375
You act so righteous.

299
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,875
You, who slaughtered
my entire family!

300
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,791
Tell me! Why did you
kill them, Yato?

301
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:05,083
What I'm wondering is why
I just didn't kill you, too!

302
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,458
[HIYORI] Why would he do
something like that?

303
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,666
[KAZUMA]
Because of me.

304
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,750
Huh?

305
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,500
[KAZUMA]
Because I asked him to do it.

306
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,666
I asked Yato to murder my clan.

307
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,833
[KAZUMA]
As is natural for a war god,

308
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,125
Veena has always
kept many Regalia.

309
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,916
Now. Come, Choki.

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,583
Uh. Yes, Lady.

311
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,833
[KAZUMA] As a fledgling Regalia,
I was just a simple nail.

312
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:36,625
I wonder what that portends,
his impaling our master's body.

313
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,083
This isn't an ill omen
of things to come, I hope.

314
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,916
[BISHAMON]
Don't judge too swiftly.

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,875
It could be a sign that he
will always serve me soundly.

316
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,583
Let's go easy on him.

317
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,333
We have all the time
in the world, after all.

318
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,791
I will serve you soundly.
I'll make you proud.

319
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,583
[KAZUMA] She won me over
easily with her kindness.

320
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,458
I was determined to live
up to her expectations.

321
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,500
Borderline! Borderline!

322
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,041
Pathetic!

323
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,250
Keep going like that,
and you'll never

324
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,708
be any use to the master.

325
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,250
Borderline!

326
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,250
[KAZUMA]
And then, one day.

327
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,833
[groaning]

328
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:16,541
[CLERIC 4A] This is terrible!
Our master has been befouled!

329
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,250
Who is responsible?

330
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,458
You'll pay dearly for
this when I find out!

331
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,791
[REGALIA 4G]
How can this be happening?

332
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,583
[REGALIA 4H] There must
be something we can do!

333
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,625
What will happen
to us if she dies?

334
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,125
[REGALIA 4I]
Nothing good.

335
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,125
I'm sure our clan will be
banished after her succession.

336
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,708
[REGALIA 4J]
Are there any other gods willing

337
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,833
to accept Regalia such as us?

338
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,583
Step forward this instant!

339
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,541
Or I shall have a god of
calamity strike you down!

340
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,583
God of calamity.

341
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,500
[KAZUMA]
I'd heard rumors of him.

342
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,041
Of a god who
reveled in atrocities,

343
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,625
wielded a Nora, and
slaughtered all he saw.

344
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,500
If the guilty one
will not confess,

345
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,708
we will have to hold
an ablution for you all!

346
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,000
[KAZUMA]
But we could never determine

347
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,750
who was responsible.

348
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,875
[KAZUMA] The ablution
rituals changed nothing.

349
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,708
Veena's condition worsened.

350
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,333
[REGALIA 4L]
Whoever it is should confess!

351
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,750
[REGALIA 4K]
Shut up. I bet it's you.

352
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,541
[REGALIA 4M]
It's not me. It's her!

353
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,541
[REGALIA 4N]
How dare you!

354
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,541
[KAZUMA]
Suspicion and distrust built

355
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,250
among the ranks of the Regalia.

356
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,916
--Until...
--I will find the person--

357
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,708
[REGALIA grunting, screaming]

358
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,791
[KAZUMA]
Powerless to do anything,

359
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,458
I had no choice but
to seek outside help.

360
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,791
[KAZUMA] I hoped this
god of calamity would

361
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,500
grant the most taboo of wishes.

362
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,375
[KAZUMA] The Ma Clan,
Regalia of Bishamon,

363
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,750
have become corrupted.
They cannot be saved!

364
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,125
I beg you to kill them!

365
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,416
[YATO, BISHAMON grunt]

366
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,208
[KUGAHA] I've made sure
she's well drugged.

367
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,458
And Aiha's transgressions
must be affecting her.

368
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,416
After everything I've done,
she can still fight?

369
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:57,958
[grunts]

370
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,125
[YATO groans]

371
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,625
[KUGAHA] Behold and tremble,
for the war god,

372
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,916
Bishamon, is among us.

373
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,166
[YATO grunts]

374
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,708
[BISHAMON] You stubborn
louse. Aki, Koora, Kinu.

375
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,541
Keep your eyes on Yato!

376
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,083
[REGALIA 4S]
Why did she revert her weapons?

377
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,833
[REGALIA 4T]
Is that a good idea, my lady?

378
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,791
[YATO laughs]
Can't handle that much weight?

379
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,333
Somebody's corrupted you
again, haven't they? Aww.

380
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,708
My Regalia are loyal.

381
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,916
There are no traitors!

382
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,666
[NORA] Now this is betrayal
on a grand scale.

383
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,291
Did you hear him, Yato?

384
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,791
This boy is begging us
to kill his comrades.

385
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,583
What payment can you offer?

386
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,916
I... I don't have anything.

387
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,375
[NORA] You have your name.
Do you want to be a Nora?

388
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,791
[BISHAMON]
Kazuma!

389
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,916
[KAZUMA] My name was given
to me by my master.

390
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,833
It belongs to her.

391
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:01,541
I have come here ready to die.
We have disgraced our lady.

392
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:05,166
The "Ma" name will be forsaken,
never to be called again.

393
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,166
But I don't care!

394
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,458
I will give my name back to her.

395
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:14,083
If it will save her,
I'll do it gladly!

396
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,125
[YATO]
Take me there.

397
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,750
You can repay me later.

398
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,375
[GIANT PHANTOM 4A growls]

399
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,375
[NORA giggles] The Regalia
have become a giant Phantom.

400
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,458
That's the end for Bishamon.

401
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,750
[NORA] She'll die now and be
replaced. It's for the best.

402
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,666
[KAZUMA]
No! There she is! In its mouth.

403
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,375
She hasn't been absorbed yet.

404
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,833
I beg you. Please save her!

405
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,000
Hiki.

406
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,916
[REGALIA screaming]

407
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,625
[REGALIA 4U]
My lady.

408
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,250
[REGALIA 4V]
Please help me!

409
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,875
[BISHAMON]
Stop! Please! Don't kill them!

410
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,458
Have mercy! O' fierce
deity. Take pity!

411
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,375
Don't kill my
little ones, please!

412
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,916
They're innocents.

413
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,208
Gentle children, all of them.
I beg you! Don't kill them!

414
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,375
My lady! Help!

415
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,750
Please, my lady!

416
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,875
[REGALIA]
Lady Bishamon!

417
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,708
[gasps]

418
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:38,583
[BISHAMON]
How dare you? How dare you?

419
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,958
Somehow, Veena
survived that day.

420
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:45,791
However, her hatred
for Yato endured.

421
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,416
I'm sorry for burdening
you with all this.

422
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,291
That's what you meant before.

423
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,208
You told me once... that you
owed him a great deal.

424
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,791
There's a way to stop them.
There must be, right?

425
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,875
If they keep fighting like this,

426
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,708
there'll be no
undoing what happens.

427
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,375
[yelps]

428
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,666
[yells]

429
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,791
Tch! Nice try! Sekki!

430
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:13,833
Now!

431
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,958
[KINUHA, KURAHA, AKIHA]
Confine!

432
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,083
[gasps]

433
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,666
[BISHAMON]
You're finished.

434
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,625
Come, Saiki!

435
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:27,750
[yells]

436
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,000
[YATO]
No--

437
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,375
Yukine!

438
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,291
[HIYORI]
What was Yato like

439
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,958
back when you met him, Kazuma?

440
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,000
[KAZUMA]
He was cool.

441
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,416
[HIYORI]
"Cool"?

442
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,291
The guy with the tracksuit
and "fluffy-fluff" scarf?

443
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,291
[KAZUMA]
On the next Noragami Aragoto:

444
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,375
"Divine Acclamation,
Imprecation."

445
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,708
Cool in a scary sort of way.

446
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,583
[HIYORI]
He was cool. Wow.
