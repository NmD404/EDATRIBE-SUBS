00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,625
[BOY] Excuse me, Mr. Yato,
the light is green.

00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,958
[BOY]
Will we be there soon?

00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,166
[gasps]

5
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,791
Hey, it looks like your
shoelace is untied.

6
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,666
I've tried very hard,
but it's difficult

7
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,291
for me to tie them.

8
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,625
[LADY 9A]
Welcome! Come in, have a seat!

9
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,583
Anything in here sound
good to you, Ebisu?

10
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,708
Well, Yato made
it back. Finally.

11
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,958
Yeah.

12
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,833
It was nice of Lady
Bishamon to give him

13
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,375
a room to recover in.
Though I'm kind of surprised.

14
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,250
Yeah.

15
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,416
And Kofuku gave him
all those snacks.

16
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,291
He'll be well fed while
he heals, at least.

17
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,375
Yeah.

18
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:39,583
I just hope he'll
be okay. You know?

19
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,625
Me, too.

20
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,708
But, I wish I
could help somehow.

[HIYORI sighs]

22
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,958
Huh?

[KAZUMA]
Yukine!

24
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,875
[YUKINE]
What is it? Is something wrong?

25
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,250
[KAZUMA]
Have you seen Yato recently?

26
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,583
--[HIYORI] Hm?
--[YUKINE] Uh...

27
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,125
Ebisu came to visit Yato,
but now they're gone.

28
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,541
The room is empty, and we
have no sign of them.

29
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,625
And, my room had been ransacked.

30
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,666
[BOTH gasp]
That was them!

31
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,125
[silverware clinking]

32
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,333
So this is the Olive Tavern?

33
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,625
Feel free to order
whatever you want.

34
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:33,041
I mean it, go nuts.
It's Kazuma's treat today.

35
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,666
Well, dear, what
can I get for you?

36
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,583
Looks like they
have a kids' meal.

37
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,750
How's that sound?
Even comes with a toy.

38
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,416
[EBISU]
No, thank you.

39
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,750
I'd like a simmered
Hamburg steak.

40
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,333
Well, what do ya know?

41
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,291
I had a feeling that's
what you'd ask for.

42
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,916
You look just like
another gentleman

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,833
who gets that all the time!
He must be your daddy!

44
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,041
Like father, like son, eh?

[YATO grunting]

50
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,000
[grunts, coughs] That was
incredible! Yato god!

51
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:44,791
He truly is fearless.
And so is his Blessed Vessel.

52
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,416
Damn monkey suit.

53
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,583
How does Kazuma
stand this thing?

54
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,583
Feels like I'm suffocating.

55
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,083
If you don't mind
me asking, sir,

56
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,416
is there a particular
reason you brought me here?

57
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,875
[YATO]
Because it was Ebisu's wish.

58
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,875
You mean my last self?

59
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,666
Were you friends with
my previous incarnation?

60
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,541
[YATO]
Your last self, huh?

61
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,416
Veena, look!

62
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,666
No! Run, Ebisu!

00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,833
[cackles]

64
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,958
[YATO]
You really did reincarnate.

65
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,416
Yes.

66
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,125
From what I've been told,
plenty of gods reincarnate,

67
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,375
though none do it
as frequently as I do.

68
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,583
The previous Ebisus-- 

69
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,791
[YATO] I don't care
about previous Ebisus.

70
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,750
Far as I'm concerned,
there's only one,

71
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,791
and he's gone for good now.

72
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,750
[LADY 9A]
Well, all righty! Here we are!

73
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,041
[YATO]
Good choice! That looks tasty.

74
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,458
[EBISU]
Thank you for this food.

75
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,666
It's really yummy!

76
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,083
Oh, yeah? How yummy?

77
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,875
Does it bring back memories?

78
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,583
Hey! I'm talking
to you, kid. Well?

79
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,458
Geez.

80
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,458
This really is incredible.

81
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,500
I have never tasted
anything so delicious before!

82
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,625
That's not exactly true.
From what you had told me,

83
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,250
it sounded like you seriously
liked the food here.

84
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,375
Well, this me likes it, too.

85
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,291
Reincarnation doesn't
change everything, huh?

86
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,208
You're still as clumsy
as ever, that's for sure.

87
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,166
[YATO] So, kid. You really
don't remember anything?

88
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,333
[EBISU]
Nothing.

89
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,000
Not the fight we had
in the underworld?

90
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,500
Or our mad dash
to escape Izanami?

91
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,541
No, but did I really
fight you, Mr. Yato?

92
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:01,916
[sighs] I guess memories aren't
passed down at all, huh?

93
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,333
I don't know.

94
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,250
I was just suddenly here.

95
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,166
From the shrine I could
see the beautiful sea

96
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,500
and a quiet, peaceful
town full of people

97
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,708
who were hard at work.

98
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:22,000
I fell in love with this
incredible world at first sight.

99
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,750
I knew right away
that I wanted to make

100
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,666
the people here happy.

101
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,583
A strong desire to
make everybody happy.

102
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,583
That must be the natural
instinct of the Ebisu god.

103
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,791
[EBISU] What do you mean?
Aren't all gods like that?

104
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,583
Wow, good question.

105
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,708
So you're a war god,
aren't you Mr. Yato?

106
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,875
What's that like?

107
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,916
I bet you must be a
really good fighter.

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,166
[YATO] Yeah, I am.
Seems to be all I'm good at.

109
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,625
[EBISU] That's so cool!
I'm really clumsy.

110
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,500
I bet I'd be bad at fighting.

111
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:56,333
Did I at least do okay
in the underworld?

112
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,500
Remember?

113
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,000
You said that you
and I fought one time.

114
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,291
Fighting a war god,
I can't believe it!

115
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,666
And what about my Regalia?

116
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,625
Was I good friends with them?

117
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,666
Was I the kind of god
that made people happy?

118
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,750
I hope so! But maybe I wasn't.

119
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,958
Everyone says the
heavens executed me.

120

[gasps]

121
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,083
So, I guess...

122
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,083
I must've been a pretty
bad guy if that happened.

123
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,083
That isn't true!

124
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,333
[gasps]

125
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,666
[YATO]
You were a righteous man!

126
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,500
You were willing to
sacrifice your life

127
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,541
for the sakes of others!
And your strength--

128
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,833
It was unbelievable. I don't
even begin to compare to you!

129
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,750
But still, you...

130
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,125

that you behave with more
discretion in your next life.

no reason to be scared.

Don't worry. It's okay to die.

stay strong, man!

couldn't stop it. I'm sorry!

Uh, but, Mr. Yato,

169
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,833
what happened wasn't your fault.

Please.

171
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,583
Let me apologize.

172
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,166
As you may know,
the heavens issued

173
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,125
an official sanction.

174
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:28,333
Along with my reincarnation,
my exemplar Iwami was expelled.

175
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,083
In exchange, they were
willing to leave

176
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,041
the rest of the
Mi Clan unpunished.

177
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,375
So I thought about it.

178
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,875
And have I decided to make
Kunimi my new overseer.

179
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,375
I don't want anything
bad to happen to Iwami.

180
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,666
He's been with me
for a long time.

181
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,916
Thanks to all your help,

182
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,625
the heavens haven't been
able to find him yet.

183
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,000
I would like to keep it
that way, if possible.

184
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,000
In order to do so,
I think it would be best

185
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,750
for him to remain here.
If that's acceptable to you.

186
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:55,833
[BISHAMON]
It is.

187
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,166
Thank you so much,
Ms. Crazy Chick!

188
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,541
[KAZUMA, TENJIN,
OKUNINUSHI gasp]

189
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,791
That name. Where did
you hear it, Ebisu?

190
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,250
Oh, is it wrong?
I learned it from Mr. Yato.

191
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,083
I thought it was weird, but he
said it was your real name.

192
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,750
Did he?

193
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,291
[KUNIMI]
You must be curious.

194
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,458
Allow me to recount
the facts for you.

195
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,833
The young master
entered Izanami's realm

196
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,500
in order to find an
underworld Locution Brush.

197
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,458
What does such a thing do?

198
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,083
[KUNIMI]
It gives one the ability to name

199
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,958
and employ Phantoms.

200
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,500
[KUNIMI]
Over many incarnations,

201
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,583
he studied methods
of controlling them.

202
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,416
He was very thorough and
dedicated to his work.

203
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,666
[KUNIMI]
But he was never able to achieve

204
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,583
satisfactory results.

205
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,666
So that's why he was gettin'
so sick all the time.

206
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,458
And this Locution Brush.
Does he have it now?

207
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,666
[KUNIMI]
Actually, it's gone missing.

208
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,750
I am certain he brought
it back with him, though.

209
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,750
To be honest, if I had my way,

210
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,791
it would stay missing.

211
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,500
I hope he never touches
that damn thing again.

212
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,000
Look, what I don't get,
is why he was so obsessed

213
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,666
with using Phantoms
in the first place.

214
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,125
[KUNIMI] As you are all
aware, the young master

215
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,625
is a god of commerce.

216
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,125
But inevitably, his
incarnations realize

217
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,583
that wealth alone is not enough
to bring people happiness,

218
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,583
and so he eventually becomes
obsessed with conjurers

219
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,708
and the power to
control Phantoms.

220
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,083
He convinces himself
that he can curb disaster

221
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,750
and use Phantoms for
the benefit of humanity.

222
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,708
[OKUNINUSHI]
This is news to us.

223
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,541
All this time, and we had
no idea what he was up to.

224
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,208
He only wanted to help people.

225
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,250
Could we have
prevented his death?

226
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,916
Things could have turned
out quite differently

227
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,125
had we known more.

228
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,583
Yeah, maybe.

229
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,458
[KUNIMI] I'm sure the
desire to help humanity

230
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,416
will be passed on to the
newest young master as well.

231
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,333
[laughing]

232
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,416
[DAIKOKU] Yato's at it again,
sponging off us and actin'

233
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,708
like he owns the place. Tch.

234
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,291
He just sits around
all damn day.

235
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,166
We're not running
a charity here.

236
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,875
Would it kill him to wash dishes
or fold laundry sometime?

237
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,208
If he did some chores,
it might help him

238
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,750
work up an appetite.

239
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,708
We make him all that food
and it just goes to waste

240
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,958
while he pines away.

241
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,375
[KOFUKU giggles]

242
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,250
These complaints,
coming from you?

243
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,291
The man who swept the
attic every day Yatty

244
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,291
was gone so it would be ready
for him when he came back?

245
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,791
[DAIKOKU grunts]

246
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,833
[KOFUKU] Admit it, you big
softy. You missed him. Right?

247
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,416
[DAIKOKU grumbles]

248
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,500
[KOFUKU] I understand.
I want him to get better, too.

249
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,625
He'll have help. He's
got Yukine and Hiyori.

250
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,666
You're right, he does.

251
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,250
I'm sure the three
of them will be fine.

252
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,833
Yukine. Come with me.

253
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,000
[HIYORI inhales]

254
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,375
I recognize that smell.

255
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,750
Well, out with it. If you've
gotta talk, then talk.

256
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,666
Okay then.

257
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,125
From the time I was little,

258
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,750
I used Nora to kill
people. So many people.

259
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,791
That's in the past.

260
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,041
[YATO]
No, I kill people.

261
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,166
It's what I've always done
whenever I was told to.

262
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,916
Even just recently.

263
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,791
[gasps]

264
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,708
[YATO]
Disgusting, huh? But...

265
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,708
I really want it to stop.

266
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:49,208
I don't want that
to be me anymore.

267
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,625
You have the determination
that marks a good god.

268
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:55,583
The kind of god that
can make people happy.

269
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,083
[YATO] I keep asking
myself: "What can I do?

270
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,250
How can I be like Ebisu?"

[NORA] You're terrible, Yato.
Leaving me behind like that.

275
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,791
But I suppose I can forgive you.

276
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,458
You completed your
task, after all.

277
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,208
You rescued Ebisu
from the underworld

278
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,750
like you were told to.

279
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,250
[YATO]
Tell me something.

280
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,750
Was it a set-up?

281
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,541
Was Ebisu killed in
place of my old man?

282
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:46,416
[NORA giggles] Are you only
now figuring that out?

283
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,625
The heavens were
relentlessly investigating

284
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,333
their conjurer. Someone
needed to take the fall.

285
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,250
Ebisu happened to
share an interest

286
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:58,166
in controlling Phantoms,
so he was the perfect choice.

287
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,333
All it took was one tiny
little nudge from Father,

288
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,666
and the heavens
sprang into action.

289
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,416
They got their conjurer,
and he got to live.

290
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,208
A happy ending for all!

291
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:13,041
[giggles] Now, come.
Let's go home, Yato.

292
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,666
Father will be so proud of you.

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,041
Like hell he's going with you!

294
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,000
Are you still here?
I don't see why.

weaklings like you.

00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,375
Say. Do you know the
sounds a human body

298
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,875
makes as it dies?

[gasps]

300
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,916
Do you know the color blood
turns when it dries?

301
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,916
The smell of flesh as it
grows colder and harder?

302
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The feel of bones as they're
crunched beneath a blade?

303
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,083
Don't you see?

304
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,000
You don't have what it takes
to carry Yato's burden.

Y'know something?

This is how you've always been.

You always smile just like that.

No matter who weeps or who dies.

00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,416
That Storm's huge!

349
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,000
Come, Sekki!

350
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,708
[gasps]

351
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,041
[YUKINE] By killing Phantoms,
you can save the people

352
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,750
who would become their victims.

353
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,958
And you can keep others
from going astray.

354
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,166
I'm certain of it.

355
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,750
So, Yato, your job is to
find disaster and slay it!

356
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,291
[YATO] This is the land
of the Rising Sun.

357
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,333
Your desecrations
shall not be allowed.

358
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,958
Hear me. I am the god, Yato.

359
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,458
I now lay thee waste
with the Sekki,

360
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,958
and expel thy vast defilement!

361
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,166
I cleanse thee!

362
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,583
[YATO]
Rend!

363
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,208
I never knew you had such
a way with words, kid.

364
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,041
Oh, shut up. Just do
your job right, okay?

365
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,000
Sure thing, O' Wise Exemplar!

366
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,833
[YUKINE]
I don't need your attitude!

367
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,625
[NORA]
I'm back, Father.

368
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:47,083
So, that weakling actually
released you, Mizuchi.

369
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,875
[chuckles] Looks like he's
hit his rebellious stage.

370
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,125
Well, isn't that just adorable?

371
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,083
[SEKI]
Fujisaki, you ready?

372
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,125
Yeah!

373
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,250
What was so interesting?

374
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,291
[FUJISAKI]
Hm?

375
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,458
[panting]

376
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,833
[FUJISAKI]
Nothing, really.
