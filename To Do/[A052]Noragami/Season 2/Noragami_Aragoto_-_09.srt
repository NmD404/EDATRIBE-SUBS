1
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,875
[YATO]
The entrance to the underworld.

2
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:29,000
And it's open, so he
must already be inside.

3
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,500
Hey.

4
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,125
Are you sure we'll be able
to get back out once we go in?

5
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,708
Entering the underworld
is like jumping into a vent.

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,416
It's basically asking
to get eaten by Phantoms.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,416
[NORA] Phantoms are the
least of our worries.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,083
Or have you forgotten?
This is where Izanami dwells.

9
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,291
She's very different
from other gods, right?

10
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,000
Deathless as she is.

11
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,458
The eternal queen
of the underworld.

12
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,041
As long as life and
death exist, she lives.

13
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,583
If she catches you,
there's no escape.

14
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:01,375
You'll be stuck in the
underworld for eternity.

15
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,583
Frightening, isn't it?
But don't worry.

16
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:08,000
You've got me by your
side. I'll protect you.

17
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,041
And if I rescue this conjurer,

18
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,833
you'll give me my freedom,
as promised, right?

19
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,708
[YATO]
Hiki.

20
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,791
I can act as a protective
barrier as well.

21
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,416
Don't tell me that precious
Blessed Vessel of yours

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,458
can do this.

23
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,833
[YATO]
Let's go.

24
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,958
Hey there, ladies! Have I
got a sweet deal for you!

25
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,708
I'll pass.

26
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,541
Hear me out, okay?

27
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,666
My uncle gave me a bunch of
free tickets to Capypa Land,

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,416
and I was thinking it would
be the perfect chance

29
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,250
to hang out with you-know-who.

30
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,791
Who are you talking about?

31
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,958
Oh! You mean that guy you like.

32
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:16,958
[YAMA]
Who else?

33
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,458
The joys of adolescence.

34
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,041
[YAMA] So, I need you
guys to come, too.

35
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,208
What do ya say?

36
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,958
You want us with
you on your date?

37
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,208
Actually, it's gonna be
more of a triple date.

38
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,416
[AMI, HIYORI]
A triple date?

39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,083
Yeah, he's bringing
some friends with him.

40
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,916
So that's where you two
come in. Pretty please?

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
[AMI]
Mm...

42
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,583
What is it about Capypa Land?

43
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,625
[YATO] Aw! But I wanna go!
I wanna go to Capypa Land!

44
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,416
I wanna! I wanna!
I wanna! I wanna!

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,291
I couldn't say anything then,
but I actually wanna go, too.

46
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,791
[YAMA]
Are you in, Hiyori?

47
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,875
Uh... I don't think I can.

48
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,666
I made plans to go
with someone else.

49
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,541
With who?

50
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,750
[HIYORI]
Uh, with...

51
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,083
Great, then it's decided!

52
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,291
We're going next Sunday.

53
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,041
Huh?

54
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,666
Okay, fine. Count me in.

55
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,708
[YAMA] Youthful escapades,
here we come!

56
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,375
[HIYORI] But I don't wanna
go on a date with someone

57
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,583
I've never even met before.

58
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,208
[YAMA] Don't worry!
We'll be there, too.

59
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,333
It'll be fine.

60
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,541
Hey, Hiyori! Have you
seen Yato late--

61
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,916
[MAYU]
What is it, my lord?

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,916
Just let her go. She'll be
much better off this way.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,250
Well. I should be
leaving for the Colloquy.

64
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,500
I'll see you when I return.

65
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,875
I dunno if I'm up for
a date this weekend.

66
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,875
[OKUNINUSHI groans] Wasting my
time with another damn Colloquy!

67
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,541
Didn't we just have one?

68
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,125
I'm a busy god, ya know?

69
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,083
I gotta take my wittle
Inaba for a wabbit walk!

70
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:38,250
[KOFUKU]
Nushi! I missed you so much!

71
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,666
[screams]

72
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,416
[REGALIA 9A]
It's Lady Ebisu Kofuku!

73
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,250
[REGALIA 9B]
The infamous god of poverty?

74
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,916
[REGALIA 9A]
He's done for.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,041
[DAIKOKU]
Kofuku!

76
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,458
Her enthusiasm can
get the best of her.

77
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,583
As her exemplar, you
should train her better!

78
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,666
And what the
hell're you thinking,

79
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,791
using our names
without permission, huh?

80
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,708
Ebisu and I'll sue the
pants off you, just wait!

81
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,333
Aw, now I wanna
kiss you even more!

82
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,750
Such a big, burly god.

83
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,208
and he's afraid of
little Lady Kofuku.

84
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,708
Poor Okuninushi's
always been like that.

85
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,208
Very superstitious.

86
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,000
Hi, Bisha. Hi, Kazu.
How're you doin'?

87
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,750
[BISHAMON]
We're fine. But I'm surprised.

88
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,208
It's rare to see you here.

89
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,333
Yeah, it is.

90
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,208
Hey, have you seen
Yatty by any chance?

91
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,458
Yato?

92
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,750
That's right.

93
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,333
Since he's become a
resident of Takamagahara,

94
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,833
he should've received
today's summons.

95
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,500
Exactly. That's what we
were hoping for, anyway.

96
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,958
[BISHAMON]
Has something happened?

97
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,041
Seem's Yatty's done
a disappearing act.

98
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,458
He's been in the Lower Realm
for a whole month now.

99
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,750
[KAZUMA]
A month? But what about Yukine?

100
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,166
It's strange.

101
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,875
Yatty was so happy he'd finally
become an official god.

102
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,208
He was even excited
about the Colloquies.

103
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,333
That's why we're here.

104
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,541
Maybe he came, too, you know?

105
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,458
[grunts]

106
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,375
[NORA]
Careful not to make eye contact.

107
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,375
They'll spot you.

108
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,875
Yeah, I know.

109
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:59,083
[NORA] Do you see that
water? Bathe in it.

110
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,083
Gross!

111
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,625
[NORA]
Endure the stench.

112
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,166
It'll keep the nasty Phantoms
from picking up your scent.

113
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,541
This brings back
memories, doesn't it?

114
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,916
Of all the time
we spent together.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,125
All the things we did.
We were unstoppable.

116
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,541
Together, there was
nothing we feared.

117
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,416
Well, you remember.

118
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,208
[YATO] How many days have
passed on the outside?

119
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,333
I've heard time flows
differently here,

120
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,041
just like in Takamagahara.

121
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,291
Could they have
forgotten me already?

122
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:28,916
[NORA]
Yato.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,958
[gasps]

124
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,916
[YATO grunting]

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,083
[YATO]
A mask. Is the conjurer here?

126
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,791
[YATO grunting]

127
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,708
Ebisu?

128
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,000
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
I've gathered you all here

129
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,666
with good reason. There
has been an important

130
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,250
development regarding
the conjurer.

131
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,583
[gasps]

132
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,333
[GOD 7B] Have you learned
the conjurer's identity?

133
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,666
[GOD 7C]
Who is it?

134
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,583
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] To change
a Phantom into a puppet,

135
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,458
it must be granted a name.

136
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,916
[GOD 7D]
Giving names to those?

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,125
[GOD 9A]
What a terrible thought!

138
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,250
[GOD 9B] It would mean
instant corruption!

139
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,416
[GOD 7A]
Quiet, all of you!

140
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,166
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
As you've said, this conjurer

141
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,166
must endure a great deal.
Which indicates a god.

142
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,500
A highly revered one, at that.

143
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,291
[GODS gasping]

144
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,500
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

145
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,416
[GOD 7A]
The Seven Gods of Fortune?

146
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,166
No! You're wrong. It isn't us!

147
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,916
What's more, how could
you expose us like this?

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,500
Anonymity is guaranteed
at a Colloquy!

149
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,458
Uh-huh!

150
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,833
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
Fear not.

151
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,916
I am not implying that
any of you is the conjurer,

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,291
but why are there
only six of you here?

153
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:34,875
[gasps]

154
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,125
[BISHAMON gasps]

155
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,625
[GOD 7A] We've received
a written tip, in fact.

156
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,291
It reads as follows:

157
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,291
"I have witnessed
someone naming Phantoms

158
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,666
in the Lower Realm.

159
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,541
The granter's name is Ebisu."

160
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,708
Liar!

161
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,833
Whoever wrote that
phony tip is full of it!

162
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,250
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
Therefore.

163
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,416
Ebisu and Iwami, his
overseer, are under arrest.

164
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,333
[OKUNINUSHI] Ridiculous!
He's on his deathbed!

165
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,750
Leave him alone.
He would never--

166
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,208
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] His residence
is to be cordoned off

167
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,583
and searched at once.

168
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,875
Furthermore, all his Regalia
are to be interrogated.

169
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,041
[FUKUROKUJU]
Unbelievable!

170
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,625
[GOD 7A]
Given this matter's sensitivity,

171
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,041
we kindly ask that the rest
of the Gods of Fortune

172
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,041
remain here. That will be all.

173
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,166
[EBISU] What are you
doing here, Yato god?

174
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,375
[YATO]
Just what I was wondering.

175
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,083
What brings you
to the underworld?

176
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,708
[EBISU]
Is that Yukine you wield?

177
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,875
No. This is Hiiro.

178
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,833
[NORA]
What a relief.

179
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,708
I was hoping we'd
catch up to you.

180
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,666
Now we can fulfill
Father's request.

181
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,750
You're the conjurer
we were sent to rescue.

182
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,958
[gasps]

183
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,333
Hold on. The old man's
connected to Ebisu?

184
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,458
What old man? I'm lost.

185
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm afraid I don't know what the
two of you are talking about.

186
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,958
Is this "old man" you speak
of your father, Yato god?

187
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:50,416
Hm. Your refusal to answer
only makes me more curious.

188
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,875
And when I'm curious
about something,

189
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,500
I can be very
difficult to deter.

190
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,708
Regrettably, I don't have
time to spend on this now.

191
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,375
Ah. I know.

192
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,208
We can talk further
on the outside.

193
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,000
When would be a
good time for you?

194
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,291
[YATO]
You're missing the point.

195
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,625
I came down here to rescue you.

196
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,416
You came all this
way to rescue me?

197
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,750
Well that's very kind of you.

198
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,000
All right. I've had about
enough of this cesspool.

199
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,708
Let's get outta here.

200
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,333
Hey, where the hell
are you going?

201
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,500
[EBISU]
I can't leave just yet.

202
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,125
The Phantoms have
increased in number.

203
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,708
Don't make eye contact!

204
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,958
Oh, look at that.

205
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,916
There appears to be one
heading right for you.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,666
--[growling]
--[YATO screams] Hiki!

207
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,291
[BULL PHANTOM 9A roars]

208
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,541
Oh, here's another one.

209
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,750
[YATO]
Stop looking at them, will you?

210
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,125
[YATO]
Hey! There's one behind you!

211
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,666
My, that was excellent work.

212
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,291
I can see that you'll come
in very handy down here.

213
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,583
I'm terribly
uncoordinated, you see.

214
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,625
In fact, I can't even
tie my own shoes.

215
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,541
Tell me,

216
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,875
are you any good
with a bow knot?

217
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,500
Well. I'm better
with bondage knots.

218
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh? That's very impressive.

219
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,375
Are you for real?

220
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,333
I'm entirely reliant
upon my Regalia.

221
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,541
How rude. I should have
introduced them by now.

222
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:07,083
Please forgive me.
Kuni. Tatsu. Uta.

223
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,250
You brought your
Regalia with you?

224
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm Kunimi.

225
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:11,750
I'm Tatsumi.

226
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm Utami.

227
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,166
Incidentally, Kunimi
ties the best bow knot

228
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,541
you'll ever see.

229
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,375
Next time, let's give these
"bondage knots" a try.

230
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,500
Of course, Young Master.

231
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,708
What's with you people?

232
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,708
It seems the path splits here.

233
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,458
This guy's gonna make
my head explode.

234
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,041
[EBISU grunts]

235
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,083
Young Master!

236
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,916
What is it? What's wrong?

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,416
Whoa, hold on! Are you blighted?

238
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,541
It's nothing to worry about.

239
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,541
Guessing it was your conjured
Phantoms that did this.

240
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,416
Unfortunately, my
invocations are still

241
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,958
far from perfect.

242
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,291
For now, I merely control
Phantoms using masks

243
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:52,625
I've collected. This system
does have its merits, however.

244
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,333
It may sound odd, but there
is a certain satisfaction

245
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,083
in naming and
employing a Phantom

246
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,958
as one would a Regalia.

247
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,041
Although, I must admit that
it has been far from easy.

248
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,583
I am tainted by
each failure, you see.

249
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,125
Masked Ones demand
even greater strength.

250
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,166
They're far beyond
me at present.

251
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,458
Not for much longer, though.

252
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,541
Soon I will have
the necessary power.

253
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,125
[YATO]
You're in bad shape.

254
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,708
We need to get you
out of here soon.

255
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,250
No, thank you.

256
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,625
These Phantoms are nothing.
Not compared to what's ahead.

257
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,208
You don't wanna go
any further, trust me.

258
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,375
Why, because of Izanami?

259
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,666
[EBISU]
She's the reason I'm here.

260
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,333
I came to see Izanami
and get a Locution Brush.

261
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,583
Now if you don't mind,
let's be on our way.

262
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,708
[gasps]

263
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,750
[EBISU, YATO grunt]

264
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,541
[gasps]

265
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,583
Where are we?

266
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,750
[HIYORI chuckles]

267
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,375
I haven't had guests in ages!

268
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,583
Wha--? Hiyori?

269
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,250
Well? Come in, come in!

270
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,541
No! It can't be her.

271
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,833
The woman from the Olive Tavern?

272
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,416
Make yourselves comfortable!

273
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,583
What, are you blind?

274
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,541
That is clearly a
high school girl!

275
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,708
High school girl? You're crazy.

276
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,333
Hey, I see the way you're
looking at her, you old pervert!

277
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,708
The woman from the Olive Tavern

278
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,625
is definitely not
a high school girl.

279
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,208
No mere teenager can make
steaks as good as hers are.

280
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,416
[YATO] What the hell
are you talking about?

281
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,958
Would you care for
some refreshments?

282
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't eat or drink
anything here.

283
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,250
If you do, you'll never leave.

284
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,875
Please have some.
There's plenty.

285
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,041
Oh, what's wrong?
Do you not like me?

286
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,541
Don't be shy now,
of course you do!

287
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,833
[grunts]

288
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,166
[HIYORI] You're not alone.
Everybody likes me.

289
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,208
Can I tell you a secret, though?

290
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:44,083
I think I like you best
of all. Let me show you.

291
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:44,916
[grunts]

292
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,125
[NORA]
Get away from her!

293
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,583
[EBISU]
Ah, I understand now.

294
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,583
She must alter her appearance
based upon the person

295
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,333
looking at her.

296
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,208
She dons the guise of
someone close to you

297
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,125
to make it easier to
trap you down here.

298
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,666
[YATO] The queen of
the underworld. Izanami.

299
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,333
You should know I
have no intention of

300
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,250
negotiating fairly with her.

301
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,666
That would be a
waste of my time.

302
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,750
Huh?

303
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,416
[YAMA]
Um, hi. I'm Akira Yamashita.

304
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,916
It's nice to meet you.

305
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,583
I'm Aimi Tabata.

306
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,000
And I'm Hiyori Iki.

307
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm Seki.

308
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,458
My name's Abe.

309
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,458
This girly version
of you is so cute!

310
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,375
So... who is he?

311
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,333
Which one of them's your guy?

312
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,625
He isn't here yet.

313
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,208
[FUJISAKI]
Sorry I'm so late.

314
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,000
Hi. I'm Fujisaki.

315
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,291
[YAMA]
Don't worry about being late.

316
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,541
I'm just glad you could make it.

317
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,708
Really, thanks for coming!
This'll be so fun!

318
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,916
Where would you
like to go first?

319
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I hate waiting in line.

320
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,541
Let's get some Fast Tickets.

321
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,791
Whoa, what's that you've got?

322
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,125
Limited edition
Hundred Archfiends swag!

323
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,750
You've heard of the
Hundred Archfiends?

324
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,875
Uh, yeah! Hasn't
everybody? Hun... dred...

325
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:46,666
[ABE]
Arch...

326
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,666
[ABE, YAMA]
...fiends!

327
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,833
Uh... So much for
cute and girly!

328
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,500
Any idea what
they're talking about?

329
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,750
[laughs] It's this obscure
band nobody's ever heard of.

330
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,583
[ABE, YAMA] Plenty of people
know who they are!

331
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,625
I'm sorry.

332
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,083
You kinda got
dragged along today.

333
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,375
Oh, no. I'm sorry!

334
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,958
I guess Yama can be
kinda flaky sometimes.

335
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,416
It's okay.

336
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,291
She mentioned you would
be coming, too, so...

337
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,875
Well, where should we start?

338
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,458
I'm a little lost.
I've never been here before.

339
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,666
Heh.

340
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,041
[EBISU]
Lady Izanami.

341
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,500
I was told that I could find
a Locution Brush here.

342
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,916
One that is able
to control Phantoms.

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,416
I have come to humbly request
that you give it to me.

344
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,916
[IZANAMI]
How rude.

345
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,958
I'm sure you meant to say
that you came to see me.

346
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,791
You are the second
one to come asking

347
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,791
for a brush, though.

348
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,375
Huh?

349
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,916
These are the
objects in question.

350
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,833
No way...

351
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,666
Enki.

352
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,666
We would like some
tea please, Enki.

353
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,416
[ENKI]
Right away.

354
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,750
[IZANAMI]
I created these myself.

355
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,458
I made them because
I wanted friends.

356
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,958
Friends who wouldn't
leave me. You see...

357
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,041
Everyone who looks upon
my true form leaves.

358
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,125
Always.

359
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,750
You want this badly, don't you?

360
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,791
If I give it to you,
will you be my friend?

361
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,166
[EBISU]
Your friend?

362
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,833
Unfortunately, being
your friend is not

363
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,625
something that I can do.

364
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,916
However--

365
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,958
[EBISU, YATO grunt]

366
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,708
[NORA] Yato. Don't
fight her. I mean it.

367
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,041
She's on an entirely
different level than us.

368
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,958
Not even I am sharp
enough to harm her.

369
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,916
[IZANAMI]
My offer is a simple one.

370
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,166
I will give you
the Locution Brush.

371
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,333
In exchange, one of you will
stay here and be my friend.

372
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,791
That part is up to you.

373
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,208
You should think
hard before deciding.

374
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,500
The agreement will be binding.

375
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry it worked
out this way.

376
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,416
[YATO]
Wait, what are you saying?

377
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,458
You're the one who will
remain here in the underworld.

378
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,791
I came for the brush.
I mean to leave with it.

379
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,291
I came to save your ass,

380
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,583
and this is how
you say "thank you"?

381
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,166
[yells]

382
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,583
[EBISU, YATO grunt]

383
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,000
[ALL screaming]

384
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,500
[ALL laughing]

385
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,458
[ABE]
Yay!

386
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,791
[AMI, SEKI giggle]

387
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,166
[FUJISAKI]
Awesome!

388
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,708
I always wanted to
get my photo taken

389
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:16,750
with one of those.

390
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,125
I know, me, too!

391
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:22,916
I wanted to get one
with me and, uh, me and...

392
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,708
[KAZUMA]
Restraint!

393
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,500
Borderline!

394
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,166
[YUKINE panting]

395
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,833
[KAZUMA]
Excellent!

396
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:35,916
[YUKINE]
It's just you!

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,166
Hello! Thirsty?

398
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,416
[YUKINE] Quit ambushing
me like that, will you?

399
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,500
It's my version of a pop quiz.

400
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,208
So the Colloquy's over, then?

401
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,750
No, they sent all the
attendants home early

402
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,958
for some reason.
That almost never happens.

403
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,041
Huh. What about Yato?
Was he there?

404
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:54,833
[KAZUMA]
No.

405
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,083
Okay.

406
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,791
So, Yukine. I heard
Yato's disappeared.

407
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,375
Is that really true?

408
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:04,333
[YUKINE] Yeah. Apparently,
it happens all the time.

409
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,583
[KAZUMA]
He seems a lot calmer

410
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,833
than I would expect him to be.

411
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,250
I know all too well
how a troubled Regalia

412
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,333
can harm its master.

413
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,791
He's staying calm
for Yato's sake.

414
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,291
You've made great progress.

415
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,541
[YUKINE]
Huh?

416
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,750
Okay, then. Today,
we'll practice Restraints.

417
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,250
[YUKINE]
Great! I'm ready!

418
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,333
[YATO grunts]

419
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,458
[EBISU]
Kunimi is a rare type of Regalia

420
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,791
that can control its
master's movements.

421
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,166
Unarmed combat is his specialty.

422
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,666
[EBISU] Tatsumi and Utami
are very capable, too.

423
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,416
I may not be a god of war,
but I am a god of fortune.

424
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,333
And as such, I have great
confidence in my luck.

425
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,083
Oh.

426
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,958
I hear you reincarnate
all the time.

427
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,416
Sounds real lucky.

428
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,666
[EBISU]
My Masked Ones come at a prince.

429
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,458
They've devoured many of
my previous incarnations.

430
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,583
Tch. You talk about
reincarnating like it's nothing.

431
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,791
Why are so bent on
being a conjurer?

432
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,208
Let me ask you.

433
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,583
Why do you exist, Yato god?
Why are you still here?

434
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,833
I did some research
before I came to visit you.

435
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,416
I like to be informed.

436
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,916
Formally, you're
considered a god of war,

437
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,375
but some stories say
you're a god of calamity.

438
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,208
Those instances aside,
I've only heard

439
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,458
your name in a few
oral traditions.

440
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,750
If you're so close to
vanishing already, then why--?

441
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,375
Stop talking!

442
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,291
I was born from people's
wishes, just like you!

443
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,875
So I don't wanna disappear.

444
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,208
Tell me what's wrong
with that, huh?

445
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:36,083
I wanted to make them
happy, that's all. Okay?

446
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,250
[grunts]

447
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,416
[pants]

448
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,750
[YATO]
You're not lookin' so good.

449
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,625
That blight must
be pretty painful.

450
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,500
I envy you.

451
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,458
[YATO]
Huh?

452
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,791
The way you care
about your life.

453
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,875
It's not something I've
experienced. Such passion.

454
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,208
You have the determination
that marks a good god.

455
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,291
The kind of god that
can make people happy.

456
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,708
Hurry! You can't take much more.

457
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,833
[grunts]

458
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:03,916
--[YATO groans]
--[EBISU] It's a mistake

459
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,083
to underestimate my men.

460
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,250
Come, Hi--

461
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,291
[EBISU]
Come, Toki!

462
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,791
[IZANAMI giggles]
That was such an exciting fight.

463
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,166
And it looks like you get to
stay and be my friend, Yato!

464
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,833
I have what I came for.
Shall we go now, Yato god?

465
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,750
Bastard! You planned
this all along?

466
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,291
I did tell you
I had no intention

467
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,958
of negotiating fairly.

468
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,625
And you, Hiiro!

469
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,458
[NORA giggles]

470
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,625
What gives?

471
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,083
You didn't tell me
you served Ebisu, too.

472
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:39,958
[NORA]
Sorry.

473
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,333
Small world, isn't it?

474
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,750
Kunimi says I named her
five incarnations back.

475
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,500
Is that right, Tsutsumi?

476
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,083
Yes. It's been awhile.

477
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,458
This is sort of an
awkward reunion, isn't it?

478
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,958
I mean, I know you're
a Nora and all,

479
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,583
but this is a lot to take.

480
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,125
It's strange, but I suddenly
feel much closer to you.

481
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,333
Stop! Ew!

482
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,583
You're leaving?
You can't do that.

483
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,208
You were supposed to
stay and be my friend!

484
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,708
We need to hurry.

485
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,875
Hiki!

486
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,541
[YATO]
What are you doing? Come on!

487
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:15,500
I'm glad I was able to
see you. Goodbye, Mother.

488
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,125
Hold on. Mother?

489
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,333
[IZANAMI] Please don't
leave me! I'm so lonely.

490
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:27,541
So very lonely. I won't let you.

491
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,291
You'll stay here with
my other friends!

492
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,791
I suspect it would be best
if we got out of here

493
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,958
as quickly as we can.

494
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,958
Uh-huh.

495
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,750
Hiyori and Yukine are
out there waiting for me.

496
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,916
I will make it back to them.

497
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,416
It's so strange.

498
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,416
I feel like I'm close
to remembering something,

499
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,958
but I don't know what it is.

500
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,208
Oh! A Capypa with a crown.

501
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,000
They'll love this little guy!

502
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,416
Of course, they won't
share, so I'll get two.

503
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,958
Or maybe one for
all three of us!

504
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,458
[FUJISAKI] Three for you, too?
They for your family?

505
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,250
No. Actually, they're for...

506
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,333
[heartbeats]

507
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,708
[HIYORI]
They're for... Who?

508
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,708
[heartbeats]

509
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:18,166
[HIYORI] What's going on?
Something feels wrong.

510
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,208
The parade's starting
in a second.

511
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,458
We should get going.

512
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,000
[HIYORI]
What is it?

513
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,291
I feel like I'm
forgetting something.

514
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,666
Something that's
really important.

515
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,916
Ready? We--

516
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,583
[HIYORI] So many glittering,
colorful lights.

517
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,291
Fireworks flooding the sky.

518
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:45,166
A sparkling parade procession
illuminating the night.

519
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,208
Even the people's smiles
seem to shine brightly,

520
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,250
giving off a rosy,
cheerful glow.

521
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,291
But to me...

522
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:57,291
To me it all seems
distant and dull.

523
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,958
The light feels so far away.

524
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,250
It seems like someone's missing.

525
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,333
Someone who should be
next to me, smiling.

526
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,791
Who did I wanna
get a picture with?

527
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:12,958
Who did I want to give a
present to? Who isn't here?

528
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,708
Or am I wrong?
Am I imagining things?

529
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,000
You okay?

530
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,625
[FUJISAKI gasps]

531
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:27,416
[HIYORI]
Why? Why can't I remember?

532
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,875
I wanted to come here with him.
To get a picture together.

533
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:35,916
I... I wanted to stay
by his side, but now...

534
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,166
[EBISU] Oh, dear.
I forgot my hand cream.

535
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,500
[YATO] Hand cream?
That's very dainty of you.

536
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:22,958
[EBISU] It's very
difficult to count money

537
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,833
with dry fingertips, you know.

538
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:28,125
On the next Noragami Aragoto:
"A Certain Desire."

539
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,625
[YATO]
Yeah, of course I know!

540
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,583
I know all about money!
