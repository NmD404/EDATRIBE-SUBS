1
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,041
[EBISU] It seems that
Regalia are limited

2
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,041
in their use of Masked Ones.

3
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,208
They do not have the power
to turn Phantoms into puppets.

4
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,916
Only a name-bestowing god
is able to do that.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,666
[door clicks]

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,083
Have you captured a Phantom?

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:36,958
[IWAMI]
Yes.

8
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,625
Good. Then let's begin at once.

9
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,500
[growling]

10
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,750
[EBISU]
My Earthly name is Ebisu.

11
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:48,041
Bearing a posthumous name,
I don this mask,

12
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,750
and proclaim myself
a spirit vessel!

13
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,291
Ye names that assemble
cannot defy me.

14
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,875
You are bound and beholden
to my every order!

15
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,083
Submit yourself to me,
and obey the mask!

16
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,208
Yield now, Ryoki!

17
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,166
What're you doin'?

18
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,666
Who the hell do
you think you are?

19
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,875
The guys who're gonna
take you down, that's who!

20
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,166
Ah, kiss my ass!

21
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,041
Like hell I will!

22
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,750
[PUNKS]
We're gonna kill you!

23
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,625
[YATO]
All right, that's enough!

24
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,208
This is the land
of the Rising Sun.

25
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,791
Your desecrations
shall not be allowed.

26
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,208
Hear me. I am the god, Yato.

27
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,833
I now lay thee waste
with the Sekki,

28
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,666
and expel thy vast defilement!

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,000
I cleanse thee!

30
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,291
Rend!

31
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,958
[PUNKS]
Uh...?

32
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,041
And thus, it's done, boys.
May our fates intertwine.

33
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,041
[YATO] Make way!
Hiyori is coming through!

34
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,125
Yeah, that's right,
I'm talkin' to you, shorty!

35
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,500
Outta the way!

36
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,041
Look out, there's some
gum there, watch your step.

37
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,833
Dandelion fuzz incoming!
Quick, cover your ears!

38
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,000
[yelps]

39
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,458
Enough! Can't I walk
to school in peace?

40
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,916
[YUKINE]
Sorry about that, Hiyori.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,166
He's been a little
overexcited lately.

42
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,250
[YATO] 'Course I have!
See! Get a load of this, yo!

43
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,000
[HIYORI]
Resident registration card?

44
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,083
That's right!

45
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,208
Takamagahara has
officially recognized

46
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,458
this lil' beauty as my shrine!

47
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,083
Seriously? They actually
approved that thing?

48
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,333
Well, of course they did!

49
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,833
[YATO] Come on, guys,
please! Have a heart!

50
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,291
I visited the office
every day right before

51
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,458
closing time until
they finally caved!

52
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,833
[YUKINE]
Man, talk about lax!

53
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,083
[HIYORI]
I guess government officials

54
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,708
are the same everywhere.

55
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,750
[YUKINE] Does this new
status come with any perks?

56
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,250
[YATO]
It sure does.

57
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,208
I can attend things
called Colloquies now.

58
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,708
I'm licensed to sell
official merchandise.

59
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,375
And I even have my very
own holy book and song.

60
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,875
Which you wrote yourself!

61
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,125
It doesn't seem much
different than before to me.

62
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,708
Oh, but wait! I saved
the best perk for last!

63
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,625
Tad-ah! My own plot of
land in Takamagahara!

64
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,916
[YUKINE]
It's tiny!

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,375
You know what this
means, don't you?

66
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,916
We'll always have
somewhere to sleep.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,208
Yeah, I think I'll stick
with Kofuku's place.

68
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,625
And now that we've got a shrine,

69
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,041
we can visit the Heavenly
Realm whenever we want to!

70
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,041
Not bad!

71
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,583
That is pretty cool!

72
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,541
And all of it's thanks to you.

73
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,708
Really. I'm glad you
didn't give up on me.

74
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,000
Sure. You're welcome.

75
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,666
[YATO] Hello there!
Nice to meet you, I'm Yato!

76
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,250
I just moved into
the neighborhood.

77
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,833
[NEIGHBOR GOD 8A]
I have some young Regalia,

78
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,291
and they need their sleep.

79
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,750
I hope you boys don't make
too much noise after dark.

80
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,666
Nope! Quiet as mice,
don't you worry.

81
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,208
[REGALIA 8D] You didn't hear
it from me, but apparently...

82
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:05,291
Oh, my! Positively
appalling! Really!

83
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,791
[AMI]
Guess what, guess what!

84
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,208
Yama's got a crush on someone!

85
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,375
[YAMA]
Say it a little louder.

86
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,125
I don't think the whole
school heard you!

87
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,083
--Geez, Ami!
--[HIYORI] Tell me more!

88
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,291
--Geez, Ami!
--What's he like?

89
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,666
I don't really know
much about him except

90
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,166
that he's in a
higher grade than us.

91
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,166
Oh-ho! An older man, huh?

92
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,416
What else? What else?

93
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,041
[YAMA]
He transferred here last spring.

94
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,416
And his voice!

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,833
He sounds just like the
Hundred Archfiends' singer!

96
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,291
[MANABU]
Hey, Iki!

97
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,458
[HIYORI] Hi, Manabu!
How've you been doing?

98
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,166
Getting along any better with
your classmates these days?

99
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,333
A little bit.

100
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,958
At least, I'm not
getting bullied anymore.

101
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,041
But still, I'm basically
invisible to everybody.

102
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,583
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

103
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,250
School can be rough, huh?

104
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,708
Nah, it's no big deal.

105
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,291
When I do get down though,
I remember what you said:

106
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,875
"Find one special person
and you're set," right?

107
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,833
[gasps] Did I say that?

108
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,000
[MANABU]
Yeah.

109
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,375
You gave me a lot
of really good advice.

110
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,916
Use this, sweetie.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,583
but remember, if you're
gonna fight rough,

112
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,416
then your opponent
should be armed, too.

113
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,583
Wha--? I never said
anything like that!

114
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,333
No way!

115
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,791
You mean Yato.

116
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,666
It was him who gave you advice.

117
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,875
[MANABU]
Yato?

118
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,458
Yeah, you know, the
guy in the tracksuit.

119
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,166
He and Yukine were
in the girls' bathroom,

120
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,583
so I beat them up, remember?

121
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,208
No idea. Sorry.

122
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,250
[gasps]

123
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,541
Well, a-anyway.

124
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,875
you were really there
for me when I needed it.

125
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,541
And... there's something
I've been wanting

126
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,000
to tell you since then.
I don't know how to say this.

127
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:31,291
The thing is, I--
I... Like... Like...

128
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,791
I like your shoes!
They're really nice!

129
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,291
Bye!

130
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,458
[HIYORI]
Why doesn't he remember Yato?

131
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,875
[door clicks]

132
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,833
[HINAHA] Excuse me, my lady.
You have a visitor.

133
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,125
[KAZUMA]
Yukine?

134
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,625
Hello, Lady Bishamon.

135
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,750
I'm sorry to bother you.

136
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,500
[BISHAMON]
What do you want? Are you alone?

137
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,958
[YUKINE]
Um, yes.

138
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,083
I've come to say hello
for my loser of a master.

139
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,000
We've just been granted land
in Takamagahara, you see.

140
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,750
[BISHAMON]
Here? The Yato god?

141
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,250
[YUKINE]
Yes...?

142
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,666
A-Actually. That's not all.

143
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,916
I have a personal
request. For Kazuma.

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,291
[KAZUMA]
Uh--

145
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,500
[YUKINE] Could you teach me
how to use invocations?

146
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:19,041
Say yes. I'm Yato's exemplar.
I wanna keep getting stronger.

147
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,583
Please help me do that!

148
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,041
Well, I...

149
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,625
[sighs]

150
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,458
Yes. I would be happy to.

151
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,708
[YUKINE] All right! I'll
work really hard, I swear!

152
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,041
[BISHAMON] Please don't
let them live nearby.

153
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,125
[KOFUKU]
You're awfully quiet.

154
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,625
Whatcha lookin' at, Yori?

155
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,916
[HIYORI sighs] Yato's been
acting really weird lately.

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,750
If we're not together,
he sends me a text

157
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,750
like every five minutes.
Look at this!

158
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,416
Whoa! There're hundreds!

159
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,791
And this isn't even
the half of it.

160
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,916
Looks like a good
parade. We should go.

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,250
They've got a
couple's room here.

162
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,583
What do you think, huh?

163
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,875
A gondola ride, ooh!

164
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,958
I was just callin' to say hi!

165
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,375
[HIYORI groans]

166
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,708
[KOFUKU giggles] That kind of
behavior's only natural.

167
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,500
You are Yatty's first.

168
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,083
[DAIKOKU] That may not be the
best way to put it, Kofuku.

169
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,250
There aren't many
people out there

170
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,958
who even know Yatty exists.

171
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,416
And nobody was ever so
determined to stick with him

172
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,625
before you came along.
Honestly, I'm relieved.

173
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,708
This means he can lead
another long life.

174
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,041
What?

175
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,708
[KOFUKU]
Yatty has always had a hard time

176
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,083
attracting long-term believers
and dedicated Regalia.

177
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,166
He's had to survive
within people's broken,

178
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,791
scattered memories.

179
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,250
I can only imagine how
difficult that must have been.

180
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,166
Famous gods like me
and the Seven Gods

181
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,500
of Fortune are lucky.

182
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,791
We don't have to worry
about that stuff.

183
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,375
It's totally different for
unknown gods like Yatty.

184
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,333
Once they've been forgotten,
they vanish from existence.

185
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:49,375
[HIYORI gasps]
Like forever?

186
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,791
[KOFUKU]
Yeah.

187
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,666
A god is born from the
wishes people make, you know.

188
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,291
When those wishes stop coming,
he loses his purpose.

189
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:02,541
He vanishes for good.
No reincarnation or anything.

190
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,250
That's why this is so great.

191
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,333
'Cause Yatty has someone
to remember him.

192
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,000
A believer he can
really count on.

193
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,250
I get his reaction now.

194
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,125
[HIYORI]
Wait! What if I do forget him?

195
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,166
Will he vanish?

196
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,208
No, no.

197
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,625
I wouldn't worry
about it too much.

198
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,583
After all, he's survived
this long, hasn't he?

199
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,833
I'm guessing he's got some
other believers out there.

200
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,000
[DAIKOKU] I've always
wondered that about Yato.

201
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,416
How could such an unknown god
endure for centuries?

202
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,791
He should've vanished long ago.

203
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,750
[DAIKOKU]
Bit of a mystery, really.

204
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,750
Now, in order for
an invocation to work,

205
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,708
it needs to be tied to a name.

206
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,458
Which leads us to
Rule Number One:

207
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,166
know the name of your target.

208
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,666
But your name's
right on your hand

209
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,208
where anyone can see it.
Isn't that sorta risky?

210
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,708
Yes. Rule Number Two:

211
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,166
invocations won't work on
those of greater status.

212
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,250
To use an invocation
is to impose submission.

213
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,416
It's actually a terrible act.

214
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,708
As such, it could even
harm your own master.

215
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,625
So think carefully
before using one.

216
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,500
Right.

217
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,583
When you act, do so
with confidence.

218
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,916
You're a Blessed Vessel.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,125
Make sure your
opponent knows that.

220
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,500
[YUKINE]
What do you mean?

221
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,916
How should I put it?

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,500
Always treat your opponent
with... contempt, I guess.

223
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,000
Uh...

224
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,333
And Rule Three:

225
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,083
there is no such
thing as practice.

226
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,666
--Border--
--[KAZUMA] Restraint!

227
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,750
Too slow!

228
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,666
You need to draw more quickly.

229
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,416
Till you're called or it
wears off, you're stuck.

230
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,958
Uh-- Huh?

231
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,333
Just keeping score.

232
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,125
Now, let's go again. Yukine.

239
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,416
[KOFUKU]
That's hilarious!

240
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,666
Kazuma needs to find a
new way of keeping score.

241
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,833
I don't like this one!

242
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,750
Ah! Don't take pictures!

243
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,708
You did your best.
That's what matters.

[YUKINE whimpers]

245
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,750
Oh, come on. Don't cry.

246
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,833
How 'bout I take
you to Capypa Land?

247
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,208
Hell no, you freak!

248
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,166
Aww! But I wanna
go to Capypa Land!

249
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,500
I wanna! I wanna!

250
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,875
[YUKINE] You don't need
to drag me along with you.

251
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,125
Just go by yourself!

252
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,291
No way! I can't go on
all the rides all alone!

253
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,375
[YUKINE]
Shut up!

254
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,125
[YATO]
Please! I wanna see the Capypas!

255
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,291
It'll be fun, I swear!

256
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,125
But seriously, I think
the three of us should go.

257
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,708
You, me, and Hiyori.

258
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,041
We all gotta go to Capypa Land
and get our picture together!

259
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,291
I don't think
I've ever seen you

260
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,416
look so happy before.

261
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,083
You are unusually chipper.

Well, whaddya expect?

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,875
My centuries-long dream
has finally come true.

264
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,208
I have a shrine of my own.

265
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,041
I was told I didn't need one.

266
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,958
I almost gave up hope
entirely after that.

267
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,291
If only my kid self
could see me now.

268
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,000

actually a kid once?

270

something like that to him?

Easy, there. He must
be real drunk.

277

a schoolgirl all the time,

you're not.

287
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,041

I've decided.

00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,541
I'm gonna make Hiyori the
happiest girl in the world.

the way it sounded.

293
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,750
[KOFUKU] It's totally different
for unknown gods like Yatty.

vanish from existence.

it is to hear you say my name?

345
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,958
His Regalia used to show up
here a lot, looking for him.

346
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,250
[YUKINE] Still not back?
That's my master for ya.

347
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,333
Well, anyway, see ya, I'm
gonna go meet up with Kazuma.

348
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,916
Training's a good way
to start the morning.

349
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,625
[HIYORI] You're working so
hard to improve your skills.

350
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,833
In the meantime,
what's Yato doing?

351
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,166
[YUKINE]
How should I know?

352
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,375
He's probably with Nora.

353
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,041
He seems upset.

354
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,625
I'm afraid Yato
hasn't been by here.

355
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,375
[HIYORI]
Oh, okay.

356
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,666
[TENJIN]
Just a moment.

357
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,083
Uh?

358
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,958
It's fine for you to be
concerned about Yato, Hiyori.

359
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,500
Understandable, even.

360
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,583
But please try to keep your
devotion in check, won't you?

361
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,541
Are you attending school?

362
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,125
You aren't spending more
time with gods and Regalia

363
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,375
than with your friends
and family, are you?

364
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,625
Uh... No, not at all.

365
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,958
[TENJIN] Really? And what
about your hobbies?

366
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,041
Are you engaged in
ordinary teenage pursuits?

367
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,250
Do you even have a
boyfriend, young lady?

368
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,250
Lord, that's quite rude.

369
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,583
[TENJIN] Go forth and
enjoy your adolescence!

370
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,791
Um, okay.

371
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,541
[HIYORI]
I can't believe Yato!

372
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,666
He hasn't even told
Yukine what he's up to!

373
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,833
Well, he better not blame me
if everyone forgets him!

374
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,958
Not that that's likely to...

375
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,416
[gasps]

376
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,583
[HIYORI] Manabu forgot.
Could that happen to me, too?

377
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:56,916
No! I won't forget!
There's no way!

378
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,125
[YATO] I hope that doesn't
turn out to be a lie.

379
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,583
[yelps]

380
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,625
Whoa! Are you okay?

381
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,000
That's dangerous.
Better watch your step.

382
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,833
[HIYORI]
Hey! Thanks for catching me!

383
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,708
[MOTHER 8A sobbing]

384
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,916
[MOTHER 8A]
My daughter was murdered.

385
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,958
But they won't seek
capital punishment

386
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,500
because it was the
killer's first crime.

387
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:30,291
I saw him in the courtroom.
He was smiling.

388
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,666
Please! My sweet
daughter deserves justice!

389
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,041
Will you avenge her?

390
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,291
I've heard that you do that
sort of thing. Say yes!

391
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,875
Please!

392
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,875
[YATO]
Keep it.

393
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,500
[MOTHER 8A]
For what I'm asking...

394
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,625
[YATO]
This will be plenty.

395
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,291
[snoring]

396
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:58,833
[NORA] So what's the plan?
Cut him up on the inside?

397
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,916
[CRIMINAL 8A grunts]

398
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,458
Huh?

399
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,333
[giggles]

400
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,958
[screams]

401
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,958
[YATO]
Come, Hiki.

402
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,625
[CRIMINAL 8A]
Who-- Who are you? Stop!

403
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,125
[groans]

404
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,625
[sirens]

405
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,458
[MOTHER 8A] I just received a
call from the prison officials.

406
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,791
He died from
"undetermined causes."

407
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,208
Now my daughter
can rest in peace.

408
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,166
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much!

409
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,875
[NORA] See? People
appreciate this type of job

410
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,125
a lot more than
cleaning bathrooms.

411
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,791
The Yato god could never
perform such great deeds

412
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,166
with Yukine as his Regalia.

413
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,833
You didn't actually
think you could stand

414
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,500
on your own two feet?

415
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,708
I don't know what that
girl may have told you,

416
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,791
but it was nonsense.

417
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,500
Nothing's changed,
can't you see that?

418
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,291
It's been this way forever.

419
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,500
Everyone has always
abandoned you.

420
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,291
You're a god of calamity.

421
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,708
Hiyori and Yukine will
never really accept

422
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,916
that aspect of you.

423
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We do.

424
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,250
You see, we understand
what you are.

425
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,208
We'll never betray you.
Or stray from you.

426
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,916
Because we love you, Yato.

427
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,833
Well, what happened this time?

428
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,833
I've never known a god whose
health was so fragile.

429
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:20,916
Easy.

430
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,416
[IWAMI] Lord Okuninushi,
Lady Bishamoan.

431
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,666
We are most honored.

432
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,333
We're the two pillars
of the Gods of Fortune,

433
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,375
so it'd be nice if you would
quit slackin' off, Ebisu!

434
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,083
A little quieter, please.

435
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,791
Shut up. I'm tired of
visiting your sick ass.

436
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,541
Get better and come
to my Hawaiian shrine

437
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,625
so we can catch some waves.

438
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,250
[EBISU]
I'd rather go fishing.

439
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,041
[OKUNINUSHI]
No problem, I've got a boat.

440
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,583
We'll go catch some
mahi-mahi or somethin'.

441
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,333
What happened?
Were you blighted?

442
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,666
Did you hold an ablution?

443
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,750
I'm tired now.

444
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,458
[BOTH gasp]

445
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,500
[IWAMI] Pardon me, Lord
Okuninushi, Lady Bishamon.

446
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,333
I truly hate to ask
this, but perhaps...

447
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,125
[OKUNINUSHI]
Yeah, all right, we get it.

448
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:04,750
We'll come back later.
Don't let him die.

449
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,041
[OKUNINUSHI] I don't trust
those fools any further

450
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,458
than I can throw 'em.
How many more times

451
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,708
are his Regalia gonna
pull this kinda crap?

452
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,000
Ebisu does reincarnate
with disturbing frequency.

453
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,458
I know!

454
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,541
Do those bastards even care
about their master at all?

455
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,708
[OKUNINUSHI] Why does he
bother to keep them around?

00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,541
Where have they gone?

460

[IWAMI] Your visitors
have left, my lord.

461
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,333
Turn away anybody else
who comes by as well.

462
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,583
I need to be alone for
a while, thank you.

463
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,416
[IWAMI]
No one shall disturb you.

464
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,541
What a shame.

465
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,708
It seems I'm not very
compatible with Ryoki.

466
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:53,166
All the Phantoms I turn into
puppets eventually taint me.

467
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,916
I must rectify that.

Yes, who's there?

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,625

There you are, Father.

504
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,791
Yato's saying that
he wants to leave.

505
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,791
I don't understand.
He's never said that before.

506

Really? Are you sure, Father?

Yato. We have a job for you.

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,291
He says you're free to do
as you wish once it's done.

00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,000
We need to travel
