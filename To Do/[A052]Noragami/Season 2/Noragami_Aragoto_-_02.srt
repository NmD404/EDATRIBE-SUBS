1
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:28,416
[KUGAHA] Hm. Yes. This one
absorbs water the best.

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,458
Hope you don't mind, tree.

3
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,125
Your sap is what I need.

4
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,333
For making pills,
there's none better.

5
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,291
[gasps]

6
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,875
[NORA]
So. We meet again, Kugaha.

7
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,791
[KUGAHA]
Ah. Hello, Norry.

8
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,916
[NORA] Don't call me by
that name. I don't like it.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,125
Really? What should I
call you instead, then?

10
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,833
There are plenty of options.

11
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,833
[KUGAHA]
You have quite a sense of humor.

12
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:03,000
By the way, that Yato fellow.
I paid him a visit.

13
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,583
And? Your conclusion?

14
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,625
I think he'll be useful.

15
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,875
What's going on?

16
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,416
Those two usually
don't act so serious.

17
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,458
Yato, I need to talk to you.

18
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,458
Oh, yeah? About what?

19
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, no! Are they breaking up?

20
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,416
Has Yukki finally
had it with Yatty?

21
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,416
Try not to cry for him.
Yato deserves this.

22
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,250
I have no doubt he
brought it on himself.

23
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,708
I...

24
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,333
Go on.

25
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,208
[YUKINE]
I...

26
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,000
I think...

27
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,250
I think I made a new friend!

28
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,708
Aw! How sweet!

29
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,083
[DAIKOKU groans]

30
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,750
Oh? Good for him.
That's wonderful!

31
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,041
Is this his first
friend as a Regalia?

32
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,916
Are they about the same age?

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,041
[YATO] I don't know how
thrilled I am about this.

34
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,583
The kid is just too
easily distracted.

35
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,583
[TENJIN] I'm relieved to see
that Yukine is thriving,

36
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,291
even with a subpar master.

37
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,541
[gasps]

38
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,958
[MAYU] Maybe he looks
to Yato as an example

39
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:39,916
of what not to do.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,416
[yelps]

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,291
Well, good for Yukine.

42
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,916
Who does this friend
of his serve?

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,375
Oh. Good question.

44
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,375
[MAYU]
As on the ball as ever, I see.

45
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,541
Do you always have
to insult me, Tomone?

46
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,166
You know it's Mayu now!

47
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,000
And I'm not insulting you,
just stating the truth.

48
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,875
Anyhow. What an
excellent development.

49
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,916
Yukine had a rough
time of it at first.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,958
He seemed like a rather
troubled young man.

51
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:08,291
No kidding. He's got
father issues of his own.

52
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,375
His own issues?

53
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,916
[OCTOPUS PHANTOM 2A growls]

54
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,333
[YATO]
Rend!

55
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,500
[OCTOPUS PHANTOM 2A roars]

56
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,625
Great job! It only took one hit!

57
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,041
[YATO]
Revert, Yuki.

58
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,000
She's right, that
was a good job.

59
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,666
I can tell you're really--

60
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,791
Hey! Listen to me
when I'm praising you!

61
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,416
[YUKINE]
Sorry! I'll listen later!

62
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,916
[YATO]
Where are you going?

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,125
To see my friend!

64
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,500
Don't forget about
your homework, Yukine.

65
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,250
[YUKINE]
I'll do that later, too.

66
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,625
That punk. Ditching his master.

67
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,083
Aw, just let him go.

68
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,875
You finished your subcontract
work for Lord Tenjin.

69
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,625
Don't call it that, okay?

70
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,083
We helped him. Helped him.

71
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,708
[HIYORI]
Sure, sure!

72
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,916
Just look at him.
He's so happy lately.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,416
[YUKINE]
Suzuha!

74
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,375
Hey! How are you?

75
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,333
[YUKINE panting]

76
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,416
Sorry I'm so late.

77
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,583
Don't worry about it.

78
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,416
You're the one helping me out.

79
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,166
How 'bout I get you
my master's autograph

80
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,041
as a thank you?

81
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,250
[YUKINE]
Nah! That's okay!

82
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,541
[SUZUHA] What's your master's
name again? Lord Yato?

83
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:16,125
I'll have her make it out:
"To Yato and Yukine, with love!"

84
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,208
[YUKINE]
Uh, no, seriously!

85
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,250
--I'm good.
--[SUZUHA] Aw!

86
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,125
--I'm good.
--Don't be like that!

87
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,166
[SUZUHA laughing]

88
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,833
[YUKINE]
If he'd ever heard of Yato,

89
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,458
he wouldn't be suggesting that.

90
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,833
[YUKINE] Wow. Your master
gave you all of this?

91
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,166
Sure. All the fertilizer
and seedlings I want.

92
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,500
[YUKINE] Man! You've really
got it good, you know that?

93
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,666
My stupid master
never gives me stuff.

94
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,083
He actually stole
money from me once!

95
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,458
A real jerk move,
but I got back at 'im!

96
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,708
[SUZUHA chuckles]
You guys are close, huh?

97
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,208
How d'you figure that?

98
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,375
My master is totally amazing,
but she's got lots of us.

99
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,291
Including her
super-talented go-to team.

100
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,208
Kuraha, the divine beast!
Akiha, the knife.

101
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,458
Karuha and Kazuha, the handguns!

102
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:59,291
Yugiha, the great sword!
Kinuha, the whip!

103
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,625
And Tsuguha, in
charge of defense.

104
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,166
Jeez, that's a lot.

105
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,041
Of course, there's also
the Blessed Vessel

106
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,250
and exemplar. Kazuma holds
them all together!

107
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,166
Blessed Vessel, huh?

108
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,041
They're all elite
soldiers ready to rush

109
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,166
into battle at
a moment's notice.

110
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,416
Together, they're the
ultimate team of Regalia

111
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
for the ultimate
god of war, Bishamon!

112
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,041
They're the top, but the master

113
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,666
is still really nice
to all the rest of us.

114
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,666
Even with so many,
she treats us like family.

115
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,583
That's the sort of god
she is. Powerful and kind.

116
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,166
Sounds like a great master.

117
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,916
I can tell you
really respect her.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,041
[SUZUHA]
Of course I do!

119
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,916
But, considering how
many Regalia she has,

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,833
I haven't been
called up in years.

121
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,375
[YUKINE]
Oh.

122
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,750
[SUZUHA] Hey, I know!
You wanna see something cool?

123
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,833
[YUKINE]
It's huge!

124
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,208
[SUZUHA] This cherry tree was
uprooted during a typhoon,

125
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:59,375
and it got sick. I've
been taking care of it.

126
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,541
The hollow's finally
growing roots again. See?

127
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,916
That is cool!
You did this yourself?

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,166
I did have a little
advice from an expert.

129
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,541
This is a pretty big tree,
too. It must've been tough.

130
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,541
I guess. A friend and
I made a promise, though.

131
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,708
That we'd see its
blossoms together.

132
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,541
[YUKINE]
Oh. Another Regalia?

133
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,250
[SUZUHA]
No, actually.

134
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,291
She was a living person,
but she could see me.

135
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,791
[YUKINE]
How long ago was this?

136
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,250
It's been about 30 years now.

137
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,166
[YUKINE gasps]

138
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,125
[TOMOKO] The flowers around
here are so big and pretty!

139
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,750
Are you the one who takes
care of them, mister?

140
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,166
[SUZUHA]
Hm?

141
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,958
[TOMOKO]
These are sunflowers.

142
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,833
And those are morning glories.

143
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,458
Not bad! You know
your flowers, kid.

144
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,458
[TOMOKO]
Don't call me kid! I'm Tomoko!

145
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:52,000
[chuckles] Okay, Tomoko.
What's this red one here?

146
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,625
[TOMOKO]
A doodle-doo!

147
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,041
I don't think so.

148
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,625
I'm pretty sure these flowers
are called hollyhocks.

149
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:03,166
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

150
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,625
[TOMOKO] The flower garden
here is always so pretty!

151
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,583
Are you the one who
looks after them, mister?

152
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,833
Hello, Tomoko!

153
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,166
Huh?

154
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,958
How do you know my name--
have I met you before?

155
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,583
[TOMOKO] These flowers are
so beautiful every year!

156
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,708
So, is this your garden?

157
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,291
[SUZUHA] Tomoko's
grandmother lived nearby.

158
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,500
So she came to visit
every summer vacation.

159
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,125
[TOMAKO]
...a butterbur cup...

160
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,875
...and a thistle basket!

161
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,333
[SUZUHA] You're really good
at remembering flower names.

162
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,333
Is there anything
else you remember?

163
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,541
[TOMOKO]
Doodle-doo!

164
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,833
[laughs]

165
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:48,291
[SUZUHA]
But she could never remember me.

166
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,041
She only ever came to
visit during the summer.

167
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,500
But one time,

168
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,250
she said she wanted to see
the cherry blossoms with me.

169
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,666
So we carved a promise
into the tree.

170
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,333
I haven't seen her since.

171
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,875
[SUZUHA]
That's how it goes.

172

[YATO] Well, if I came
in through the door,

I'm already dead.

I might as well never existed.

help somebody like me?

205
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:46,041
I mean, really. Why bother?
What's the point, anyway?

206
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,791
She's gonna keep getting
older, isn't she?

207
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,250
She'll go off to
school, get a job.

208

Someday, she'll get married.

209

She'll keep changing,
and I'll always be the same.

00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,791
A Phantom must have manifested

343
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:40,000
on the body of the one
responsible for the blight.

344
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,458
I ask you to show yourself.

345
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,916
[sighs] All right.

346
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,666
Then we'll have
to inspect everyone.

347
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,458
Please cooperate.
For our lady's sake.

348
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,875
Dr. Kuga, if you will?

349
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,000
[KUGAHA]
All clear. Next.

350
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,666
[KUGAHA]
All clear.

351
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,333
[KUGAHA]
You're clear, Aiha.

352
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,416
You're clear, too.

353
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,458
Well, I examined everyone.

354
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,250
Not a Regalia among us
seems to be tainted.

355
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,791
Are you satisfied,
then? Are we done?

356
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,041
Actually. There's
still one left.

357
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,708
You haven't been checked.

358
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,291
Ah. Of course. You're right.

359
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,416
Well, that's easy
enough to remedy.

360
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,083
[TSUGUHA]
Uh...

361
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,083
[REGALIA scream]

362
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,250
[KUGAHA]
There!

363
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,625
--Feast your eyes!
--[KURAHA] Dr. Kugaha!

364
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,750
--Pristine, isn't it?
--There are ladies present!

365
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,083
Kinuha! Stop staring!
Cover your eyes!

366
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,958
But then who has blighted her?

367
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,125
I don't know.

368
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,708
But I can't believe
you suspected us.

369
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,875
I'll agree that she has
seemed exhausted lately,

370
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,541
and no one can blame you
for being concerned.

371
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,083
But don't forget
your responsibilities

372
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,500
as our master's
exemplar, Kazuma.

373
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:09,958
We can't afford to have you
distracted or suspicious of us.

374
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,000
When we see your
confidence begin to waver,

375
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,833
it shakes us all.

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,416
[BISHAMON]
What's going on here?

377
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,833
My Lady Bishamon!

378
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,458
Oh, err, we were just...

379
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,666
The blight is gone. But how?

380
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,083
[BISHAMON]
Mm?

381
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,250
[REGALIA 2F] Wait. So he had
it wrong the whole time?

382
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,916
[REGALIA 2G]
I'm glad Lady Bishamon is okay,

383
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,458
but I can't believe Kazuma
had so little trust in us.

384
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,083
[YATO]
I knew it.

385
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,791
It's not much,
but it's stormy here.

386
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,666
So, what happened?
If it's what I suspect...

387
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,375
[YATO] You really reek
of dog. Did you kill him?

388
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,125
[KUGAHA] It isn't good
to be so suspicious

389
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:07,416
and mistrustful all the time.
Such traits can prove fatal.

390
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,666
Especially for denizens of
the Far Shore, like us.

391
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,750
Wouldn't you agree?

392
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,291
[YATO]
Who are you?

393
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,958
[KUGAHA]
Oh, nobody special.

394
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,166
Just someone who wanted to
meet the great Yato in person.

395
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,416
[YATO]
Not gonna give me a name?

396
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,916
What for? I'm just
an ordinary Regalia.

397
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,041
Do you really need my name?

398
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,041
[YATO]
I'll ask a different question.

399
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,625
Why don't you tell me
whose pet you are.

400
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,833
There's some real fire
in you, isn't there?

401
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,541
That said, Lord Yato.

402
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,041
It doesn't matter how many petty

403
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,083
wishes you grant.
You're a nobody.

404
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,416
No one will ever remember you.

405
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,791
I bet you must live
in constant fear.

406
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,208
Without a Regalia, what are you?

407
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,958
Just a pathetic
excuse for a god!

408
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,750
[KUGAHA grunts]

409
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,750
[KUGAHA grunts]

410
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,250
Did your master
teach you to greet

411
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,583
an unarmed person
with a Borderline?

412
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,500
That's really horrible
manners, you know.

413
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:18,458
[laughs] You don't have
a single shrine,

414
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,166
but you're that powerful?

415
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,791
You must have a particularly
strong tie to the Near Shore.

416
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,250
[KUGAHA] Bonds with the
Near Shore can be fleeting.

417
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,708
Also remarkably fragile,
as I'm sure you're aware.

418
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,375
Ephemeral. I think perhaps
that's the best way

419
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,458
to describe it, don't you?

420
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,041
I hope we'll meet again
sometime, Lord Yato.

421
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:47,750
And please, until we do,
try not to fade away, all right?

422
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,375
That's no problem!
I'm not gonna disappear!

423
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,916
Not as long as there's
someone out there who still--

424
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,875
[YATO]
...remembers who I am.

425
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,250
[NORA] Well, it looks like
somebody taught you a lesson.

426
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,666
[chuckles] Oh, yes.

427
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,083
I think Yato's exactly what
I've been looking for.

428
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,583
Everything is falling
into place perfectly.

429
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,083
The Regalias' bonds
are already unraveling

430
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,708
and growing hollow.

431
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,291
Many are ready to fall

432
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,041
with only the
slightest of nudges.

433
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,541
Bishamon is known for
being a violent god of war.

434
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,375
Unfortunately, she is
no longer living up

435
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,958
to her reputation.

436
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,708
Like it or not, you're going
to help me, Yato god.

437
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,041
Oh, really? It's happening?

438
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:43,250
[KUGAHA] It is. The end
is near for Bishamon.

439
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,041
Very near, indeed.

440
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,208
[HIYORI]
Can you tell me how to solve

441
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,500
this equation, Mayu?

442
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,666
[MAYU]
Of course I can!

443
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,500
I do serve the god
of learning, you know!

444
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,791
[HIYORI]
Great, thank you!

445
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,250
I think I'll call you
Lady Mayu from now on!

446
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,708
[MAYU] On the next Noragami
Aragoto: "False Bond."

447
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,541
[YATO] You've never once
called me Lord Yato!
