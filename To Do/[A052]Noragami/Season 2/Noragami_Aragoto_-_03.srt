1
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,541
[AIHA]
Dr. Kuga. I need help.

2
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,791
Can I have a bit more
of that medicine?

3
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,958
[KUGAHA] Hm. This one looks
deeper than the last.

4
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,625
What did you do to Tsuguha?
Did you lose control again?

5
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:41,208
You can't blame me!
Tsuguha's a glory hog!

6
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,708
I fought honorably as
our lady's Divine Garment

7
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,625
for a half-century.

8
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:50,625
Until that four-eyed loser
showed up and took my spot!

9
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:54,875
I want to help the
master, that's all!

10
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,500
[KUGAHA]
Actually...

11
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,916
If you're willing, there is
a way you can help her.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,458
Can I count on you, Aiha?

13
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,041
[CLERK 3A]
Thank you! Have a good day.

14
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,416
I better get going.
See you guys tomorr--

15
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
[YAMA] Wait just a second.
Why two cheese buns?

16
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,625
You can't be that hungry.

17
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,791
[HIYORI]
Huh?

18
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:45,916
[AMI] You know, you
have been going off

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,750
on your own a lot
lately. Why is that?

20
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,541
Do you have a boyfriend?

21
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,250
Wha--? No, of course not!

22
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,875
Such a vehement denial.

23
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,250
Yep. Suspicious!
Very suspicious!

24
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,291
Well, you'll have to
introduce us to him sometime.

25
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,041
[HIYORI]
Huh?

26
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,208
He'd better be hot!

27
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,416
[HIYORI]
Wait!

28
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,916
[AMI] Give your love
a smooch for us, okay?

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,333
Oh, come on. It's not like that!

30
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,166
[HIYORI]
I know that smell.

31
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,416
[YATO grunts]

32
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,250
Why are you always following me?

33
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,416
Huh? Stalker Boy?

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,375
I'm not stalking you,
I'm watching you!

35
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,375
It's a totally
legitimate job duty!

36
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,000
[HIYORI]
Nothing better to do, huh?

37
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,958
Giving you divine
protection isn't nothing!

38
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,291
That's blasphemous!

39
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,708
[HIYORI]
Here, take it.

40
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,875
Make sure you give
some to Yukine.

41
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:40,916
You asked me to get you

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,333
a Four-Cheese
Melty Bun, remember?

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,541
[sighs]

44
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,083
[HIYORI] I don't know
what's got you acting

45
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,875
like this lately, but it's
really getting out of hand.

46
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,833
Tell you what.

47
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:01,166
How about I make it a point
to see you every day?

48
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,500
Will that make you feel better?

49
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,541
Maybe then you can stop
sneaking around like a...

50
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,750
[gasps] Hey! Don't get
the wrong idea, okay?

51
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,125
You just still haven't done
the job I paid you to do!

52
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,291
So, I...

53
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,333
[sighs]

54
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,708
Look. Unlike you,
I keep my promises.

55
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,958
And I promise. I'm not
going to forget you!

56
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,041
[HIYORI]
Uh...

57
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,541
I hope that doesn't
turn out to be a lie.

58
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,916
Huh? What's that?

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,791
[YATO] Your panties
were showing just then.

60
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,666
Ah!

61
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,000
[yells]

62
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,875
[hisses]

63
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,375
[KAZUMA]
I owe you an apology.

64
00:04:56,458 --> 00:05:00,041
Lady Bishamon has been
in poor health recently.

65
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,791
And in my desperation,
I acted rashly.

66
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,083
[KUGAHA] You haven't heard
the latest news, have you?

67
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,583
Huh?

68
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,416
[KUGAHA]
It seems Suzuha has died.

69
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,625
[KAZUMA gasps]

70
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,166
I also wondered
why Lady Bishamon

71
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,250
had been feeling
so poorly lately.

72
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,500
I checked to see if a
Regalia had gone missing.

73
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,541
Suzuha descended
to the Lower Realm

74
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,416
on a daily basis
to care for his tree.

75
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,916
I can only assume Phantoms
in the area preyed on him.

76
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,583
[KUGAHA] The pain of losing
a Regalia in such a way

77
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,458
must be incredible.

78
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,708
I doubt it is something that you
or I could ever comprehend.

79
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,875
What torment!

80
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,583
For her to suffer alone,
and in silence...

81
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,333
That's her way.
Always so strong.

82
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,875
Could you stay by our lady's
side until I return?

83
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,916
I need to find out more about
what happened to Suzuha.

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,291
[groans] My back is
completely destroyed again!

85
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you wanna move?
I'm cleaning, here!

86
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,041
[coughs] Would it kill you
to show your master respect

87
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,083
once in a while?

88
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,125
Yeah, it might.

89
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,708
Listen, I was gonna
go see Suzuha

90
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,916
after I'm done
with these chores.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,541
That's cool, right?

92
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,375
No. It's not.

93
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,125
[gasps] What do you mean?

94
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,875
You had no problem
with it the other day.

95
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,291
So what changed?

96
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,375
[YATO] Forget Suzuha. You won't
be seeing him anymore.

97
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,458
Huh?

98
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,125
Yeah, you and
Bishamon have issues,

99
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,250
but that's got nothing to do
with us. Suzuha's my friend.

100
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,625
I don't know what
the big deal is--

101
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,750
[YATO]
Yukine.

102
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,958
Stay away from that cherry tree.

103
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,541
[KUGAHA]
Pardon me, Lady Bishamon.

104
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,250
I've brought your medicine.

105
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,000
Who--? Oh, Kugaha.

106
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,041
[BISHAMON]
I'm a bit dazed. I was dreaming.

107
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,125
[KUGAHA]
Oh? Of what?

108
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,875
Of a boy who loved
to grow flowers,

109
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,000
and the day that I named him.

110
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,333
Never mind. I'm rambling.

111
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,416
I've been feeling so very
weak and run-down lately.

112
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,333
At least I haven't
been corrupted, though.

113
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,458
[KUGAHA]
It's too bad Kazuma isn't here.

114
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,416
I know what a help he is to you.

115
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,041
[BISHAMON]
Yes. He's very busy these days.

116
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,916
[KUGAHA] He just left
for the Lower Realm.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,958
He seemed to be in a hurry.

118
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,416
Oh, really? I wonder
what he's up to.

119
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,458
You wouldn't happen to know?

120
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,458
[KUGAHA]
Well, I don't have any details.

121
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,041
I really shouldn't say.

122
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,375
Oh, what is it?

123
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:31,000
[KUGAHA] I hate to gossip,
but, I saw something.

124
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,916
I saw Suzuha and the
Yato god's Regalia together.

125
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,750
[KUGAHA] I hope you haven't
burned yourself, my lady!

126
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,541
I'll brew some more
right away. Excuse me.

127
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,083
No, it can't be. Surely.

128
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:52,833
[panting]

129
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:53,958
That did it.

130
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,000
I think I finally
ditched my stalker.

131
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,750
Whoops! I dropped
my snack stick!

132
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,458
[YATO]
Oooh!

133
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,666
[YUKINE]
That ought to buy me 45 minutes.

134
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,041
[YATO]
Heaven!

135
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,458
Man, what's his problem, anyway?

136
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,750
All I want is to go see
my friend. He's such a jerk.

137
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,958
I hope Suzuha's around today!

138
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,625
Kazuma's here?

139
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,250
[YATO]
Yukine.

140
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,208
Stay away from that cherry tree.

141
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,791
[YUKINE panting]

142
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,416
It isn't safe there.

143
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,208
[YUKINE panting]

144
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,375
Suzuha?

145
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,083
[YATO groans]

146
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,125
Yukine.

147
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,083
Nora.

148
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,083
[NORA giggles] Humans carry
so many emotions with them,

149
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,458
even in death.

150
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,916
Joy. Anger. Heartache. Pleasure.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Look. See how
easily it unravels?

152
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,000
Once a bond has come unraveled,

153
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,208
there's no mending it.

154
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,875
Careful not to become entangled,

155
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,708
or it will choke you
as a Scourge.

156
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,416
You know, Yato.

157
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,666
If something holds you back,

158
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,875
you're better off
just cutting it down.

159
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,125
[KAZUMA] It was faint,
but I could sense a Storm

160
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:33,750
had been there. Phantoms really
must have attacked him.

161
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,333
I was so focused on Veena,

162
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:39,583
I forgot about everyone else.
I failed as their exemplar!

163
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,708
[YUKINE]
Kazuma! Wait!

164
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,750
[groans]

165
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,416
[KAZUMA, YUKINE groan]

166
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
[REGALIA gasp]

167
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,833
Oww.

168
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,541
Yukine?

169
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,291
Huh? Hey, what happened?

170
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,541
What is this? Where am I?

171
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,166
[KAZUMA]
Are you crazy?

172
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,750
This is Lady Bishamon's manor!

173
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,000
Whoa. Is it, really?

174
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,416
Well, that's perfect!
Suzuha! I know you're here!

175
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,541
--Suzuha!
--[KAZUMA] No! Yukine, stop!

176
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,125
Suzuha is--

177
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,666
He's gone. Suzuha is dead.

178
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,958
He's... dead?

179
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,583
[KAZUMA] Never mind that!
You need to hide!

180
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,083
If Veena should find you here--

181
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,916
[footsteps]

182
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,750
[BISHAMON]
Gaiki!

183
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
[gasps]

184
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:24,916
[REGALIA gasp]

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,083
[KURAHA]
No! Milady!

186
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,250
You mustn't shed
blood here! Please.

187
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,166
Well, Kazuma. Do you
care to explain?

188
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,500
What are you doing
with his Regalia?

189
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,083
It's complicated.

190
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,375
Please, I know you hate Yato,
but I'm a friend of Suzuha's.

191
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,083
Suzu...

192
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,958
[YUKINE] Please, Lady
Bishamon, will you tell me

193
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,875
how he died? I want to know
what happened to my friend!

194
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,125
Yukine. He was attacked.

195
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,916
Phantoms got him
in the Lower Realm.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,541
[YUKINE]
What the hell?

197
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,416
I asked you. You're his
master, aren't you?

198
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,583
You named him, didn't you?!

199
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,916
Then why couldn't you
answer me? I get it!

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,250
You have so many, what does

201
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,916
one measly Regalia
matter, right?

202
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't you care that he's dead?

203
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,416
It hurt him to be ignored,
but I bet you didn't know that!

204
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
[SUZUHA] Considering how
many Regalia she has,

205
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,541
I haven't been
called up in years.

206
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,208
[YUKINE]
But he still smiled.

207
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,333
Whatever else he felt,
he kept inside.

208
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,041
He smiled so that
you wouldn't suffer.

209
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,458
Always. Always.

210
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,958
He always, always, always
forced himself to smile.

211
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,625
For decades!

212
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,833
Together, they're the
ultimate team of Regalia

213
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,541
for the ultimate
god of war, Bishamon!

214
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,791
[YUKINE]
Ultimate god, my ass!

215
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,250
You couldn't be bothered
to protect one Regalia,

216
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,583
and now he's dead. Some god!

217
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,125
[SUZUHA] Even with so many,
she treats us like family.

218
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,083
It's just one big,
happy family, huh?

219
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,291
Looks like hell to me.

220
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,833
[cries]

221
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,500
[gasps]

222
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,333
Veena!

223
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,958
[ALL sobbing]

224
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,791
[groans, pants]

225
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,166
Stay calm!

226
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,250
We all must stay in
tune with each other.

227
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,208
[BISHAMON]
Is it true?

228
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,791
There was a rumor about you.

229
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,041
That you helped with an
ablution that saved Yato!

230
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,500
Have you been in contact
with him? Tell me!

231
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,041
Oh, Veena.

232
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,250
He isn't your mortal enemy!
He is your savior!

233
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,041
Huh?

234
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,333
You're wrong!

235
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:38,291
He is the monster who
slaughtered my family.

236
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,833
How could you do this to me?

237
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,333
You... traitor!

238
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,791
[REGALIA 3A]
He drew a line...

239
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,625
[REGALIA 3B]
...against the master!

240
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,583
Choki!

241
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,083
I, the god Bishamon...

242
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,458
...hereby revoke your--

243
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,666
[BISHAMON]
Consider yourself exiled.

244
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,083
Be a Nora for all I care.

245
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,666
Help the new girl.

246
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,666
It's really sad about
Kazuma getting kicked out,

247
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,500
but I guess I don't get
why it's that big a deal.

248
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,208
I mean, these things
happen, right?

249
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,541
Regalia get fired all the time.

250
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,291
It's not like we
can't replace him.

251
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,125
He was just a navigator.

252
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,458
[KAZUHA]
No. He's not "just a navigator."

253
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,583
What do you mean, Kazuha?

254
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,250
You know Karuha and I
are the lady's guns.

255
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,375
We may be powerful, but we
have a hard time aiming.

256
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,791
Kazuma's the one who
helps us hit our targets.

257
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,416
Without him, we'll actually
be a lot less accurate.

258
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,291
Whoa! Seriously?

259
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,708
That goes for me, too.

260
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,541
Yugiha, no way!

261
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,166
[YUGIHA]
My blade is really sharp.

262
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,875
It can cut almost anything,

263
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,875
but I'm terrible at
drawing Borderlines.

264
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,833
So, I end up cutting things
of the living world, too.

265
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,583
It's Kazuma who
helps hold me back.

266
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,666
With him gone, it'll be
more hit-or-miss.

267
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,208
[TSUGUHA]
Our awesome war god is starting

268
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,125
to sound more like a plain
old god of destruction!

269
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,416
What are we gonna do?

270
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,375
[KUGAHA]
Calm down, everyone.

271
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,291
There's no point moaning
about Kazuma's absence.

272
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,500
We need to stay strong
and believe in ourselves.

273
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,291
[KAZUHA]
You might be right.

274
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,833
First, touch base with
all the other Regalia.

275
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,541
Tell them not to spend
their time dwelling

276
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,250
on Kazuma's betrayal.

277
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,708
Lady Bishamon has enough
heartache as it is.

278
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,166
I don't want any of us
causing her more pain.

279
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,083
I'm lost. So, Kazuma
was working with Yato,

280
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,916
who killed a bunch
of us years ago?

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,250
But what exactly
happened back then?

282
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,041
Who were the Regalia he killed?

283
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,625
[KURAHA] No one really
knows the answer to that.

284
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,250
None of us, anyway.

285
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,833
The only ones who
were actually there

286
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,458
when it happened were
Milady and Kazuma.

287
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:23,666
They speak of it
very rarely. But...

288
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,291
He isn't your mortal enemy!
He is your savior!

289
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,750
What did he mean?
How is Yato her savior?

290
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,250
--[KUGAHA] Stop that.
--[KURAHA] Huh?

291
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,208
Kazuma's a traitor and we
mustn't pay heed to his words.

292
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,125
It's true we have
lost our leader.

293
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,291
but our goal remains the same.

294
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,416
We must gather our strength
and protect our master.

295
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,291
[KAZUHA, KARUHA]
Yes, Dr. Kuga.

296
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,375
[KINUHA] That's the only
thing we can do now.

297
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,375
[DAIKOKU] Oh, good.
Another stray to take in.

298
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,125
I'm sorry. I couldn't think
of anywhere else to go.

299
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,833
We give Yukine
a room to study in,

300
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,458
and this is what happens.

301
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,625
We aren't running a bed
and breakfast here, people.

302
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,083
[YATO]
What's the harm in letting

303
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,500
Yukine's friends sleep over?
Lighten up, Daddy Daikoku!

304
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,875
[growls]

305
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,750
You call me that again
and I will break your face!

306
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,458
This is all your
fault, as usual!

307
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,041
None of it would have
happened if you weren't

308
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,375
so easily distracted
by your stomach!

309
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,125
Eat before it gets cold,
Kazu. Go on, take it.

310
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,291
Waste any and I'll kill you!

311
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,125
It smells delicious.
You're so kind.

312
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,625
I'm sorry. I've been so
worried about Veena.

313
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,041
And the Regalia I let die.

314
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,041
A Regalia? What,
you mean Suzuha?

315
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,875
It isn't like you
killed him, though.

316
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,750
I didn't protect him.
It's close enough.

317
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,125
No, it's not.

318
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,291
Quit blaming yourself
for everything.

319
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,791
That really affects
us, you know!

320
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,875
Yukine's hurting,

321
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,166
First, he loses his friend,

322
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,250
then he gets you in
trouble with your master.

323
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,125
He's taking it hard.

324
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,458
[YATO]
I don't blame him.

325
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,958
It's got me feeling
like crap, too.

326
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,166
Why stay here?

327
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,000
There must be safer
places for you to go.

328
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,750
Aren't you risking
Veena discovering you?

329
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,958
[YATO]
Yeah. I guess I am.

330
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,500
[HIYORI]
No change. He's still crying.

331
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,458
How are you holding up, Yato?

332
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,625
I'm okay.

333
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,083
Hey! You're drinking
at a time like this?

334
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,666
Don't you care about Yukine?

335
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,291
I am pretty sure they say
booze is the best medicine.

336
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,625
You've had enough!

337
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,875
[yells] Wait, give it back!
Please! It helps me!

338
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,000
--You don't understand!
--[HIYORI] Quit pulling on me!

339
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,708
[KAZUMA] Oh, I see. So that's
the reason he stays.

340
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,708
[NORA] Looks like
everything worked out.

341
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,291
[KUGAHA]
Yes.

342
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,333
Yato's kid Regalia showing up
like that was a nice surprise.

343
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,916
He fit into the plan perfectly.

344
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Kazuma didn't get
his name revoked...

345
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:53,041
But I would bet Bishamon
won't use him again.

346
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,416
So, does that mean it's time?

347
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,791
[HIYORI] You look like
you're in a lot of pain.

348
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:07,208
[YATO] Yeah. Yukine's been
depressed since it happened.

349
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,791
He won't even get out of bed.

350
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,250
[HIYORI]
How is Kazuma?

351
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,750
[YATO]
Fine, I think.

352
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,416
He's got something on his mind,
but I don't know what.

353
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,166
Poor guy. I wonder
what'll happen to him.

354
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,208
Actually, what about you?

355
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,666
Isn't your big
advancement exam tomorrow?

356
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,958
I've got a great idea!

357
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,250
You should pray to
me you'll pass it!

358
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,291
[sighs]

359
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,333
Well, why not?
It's only five yen.

360
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,958
[wings flap]

361
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,083
Hey. Need help with something?

362
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,166
[HIYORI]
Hm?

363
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,375
I'm one of Bishamon's
Regalia. Aiha.

364
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,541
--[HIYORI gasps]
--[YATO] A scourged staff.

365
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,958
Not the kind of weapon
you see every day.

366
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,541
Your master gives you
some dangerous toys.

367
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:54,500
[AIHA] Be quiet! You are
my master's sworn enemy.

368
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,250
Everything I do here is for her!

369
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,583
Get away!

370
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,125
Yato! Are you okay?

371
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,916
[YATO] Damn you, Bishamon!
Sending a Regalia!

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,958
Did you lose it after
throwing Kazuma out?

373
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:11,833
[gasps]

374
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,500
Let me help you out with this.

375
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,041
[YATO]
What the--? Hiyori!

376
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,541
Really? Again!

377
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,208
Hey! Stop! This is my fight!

378
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,583
[yelps]

379
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,250
There, you see?

380
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,875
She's been given a weapon.

381
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,916
This is nothing like
fighting a Phantom!

382
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,333
You let me handle this.

383
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:41,666
But you're not feeling so well,
and Yukine isn't here.

384
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,458
I can't use my Sekki now.

385
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,541
That's probably
why she attacked.

386
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,375
[YATO]
Guess I'll ask.

387
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,500
Hey!

388
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,125
You wouldn't kill
me! I'm a girl!

389
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,500
[YATO]
Like I care.

390
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,666
Women and children are
nothing special to a god.

391
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,166
Did you wait until
I was alone to strike?

392
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,625
Did you think I would
be helpless unarmed?

393
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,041
And the way you looked at me.

394
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,333
You really hate me, don't you?

395
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:24,083
You've heard all about how
I killed your comrades--

396
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:24,958
Stop!

397
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,291
[HIYORI]
Yato! Don't follow--

398
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,291
[AIHA, YATO panting]

399
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,666
[YATO]
A Phantom?

400
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,958
[YATO grunts]

401
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,625
[SPIDER PHANTOM 3A]
Smells nice.

402
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,375
Great. Just what I need.

403
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:44,250
[SPIDER PHANTOMS]
Smells nice... Smells nice...

404
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,625
There are so many of them!

405
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,083
Where'd they come from?

406
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,083
An ambush! Damn!

407
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,875
[HIYORI grunts]

408
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:58,791
[HIYORI whimpering]

409
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,791
[clapping]

410
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,833
[KUGAHA]
All right. That's enough.

411
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,791
Hiyori. Hi there.

412
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,791
How are you today?

413
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,083
[HIYORI]
Those are Phantoms!

414
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,083
[AIHA panting]
Dr. Kuga! Hurry!

415
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,708
[KUGAHA]
Yes, yes. I'm coming.

416
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,583
All this effort will be for
nothing should Yato return.

417
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,541
[KAZUMA]
Kugaha! Aiha!

418
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,166
[gasps]

419
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,500
Restraint!

420
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,291
Ah! I'm glad to see you!

421
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,291
Are you okay?

422
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,541
Yes, but what are
you doing here?

423
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,750
I still had some
questions about Suzuha.

424
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:40,791
So I came looking for Yato.
I never expected to find this!

425
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,833
Where did you get this?

426
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,250
Scourges corrode Regalia!

427
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,791
[KAZUMA] You've used the
names your master gave you

428
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:53,166
to employ Phantoms and interfere
with the living world!

429
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,291
Do you even realize
how demeaning this is

430
00:21:55,375 --> 00:22:00,166
to our master? A name is proof
of a Regalia's humanity!

431
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,958
No! Restraint!

432
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,208
[KAZUMA]
Kugaha! Restraint!

433
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,666
You can't move!

434
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,916
Not when I've
restrained your name!

435
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,875
I was disappointed when
she didn't get rid

436
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:18,083
of you entirely, but now I
see it's worked in my favor.

437
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,250
Because if you were nameless,

438
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,041
you would be immune
to my invocations.

439
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,500
Kazuma. Slumber.

440
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:32,666
[YATO panting]

441
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,666
[KUGAHA] What are you going
to do about this, Yato?

442
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,166
Hey! Wake up!

443
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,291
[KUGAHA]
The human you cherish so much

444
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,291
has been taken from
you by Bishamon.

445
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,083
[DAIKOKU] Organic daikon,
dye-free mouthwash,

446
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,458
all-natural shampoo... Huh?

447
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,666
What are you
grinning for, Kofuku?

448
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,250
[KOFUKU] It's so sweet
of you to do Kazu's

449
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,833
shopping for him, Daikoku!

450
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,125
On the next Noragami
Aragoto: "Wish."

451
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,541
[DAIKOKU]
That's it! No more freeloaders!
