1
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,666
[BISHAMON] Kazuma. Is there
anything to report?

2
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,875
[KAZUMA]
No activity from the heavens.

3
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,583
We should be the first
to arrive on the scene.

4
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,833
Aiha, listen.

5
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,375
I know we haven't fought
together much lately,

6
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,333
but I'll need your
strength today.

7
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,625
I hope I'm not asking too much.

8
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,083
No! You can count on me.

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,500
[KURAHA]
Milady.

10
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,000
Pardon me, but if Lord Ebisu
really is the conjurer,

11
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,166
as the heavens
allege him to be--

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,750
It's possible his Masked
Ones attacked our clan.

13
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:52,875
No, I don't think so.

14
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,208
It isn't the sort of
thing he would do.

15
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,666
He is unconventional,
I'll grant you that.

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,916
but he would never disrupt
the heavens without good cause.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,375
I have faith in him as a
fellow God of Fortune.

18
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,375
I won't let him die needlessly.

19
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,916
Let's keep moving.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,750
[KAZUMA, KINUHA, AIHA]
Yes, my lady!

21
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,875
[grunts]

22
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,083
[BISHAMON]
A Vent?

23
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,125
[YUKINE]
A Vent? Now what's going on?

24
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,166
It's been a while,
but if I remember right--

25
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,458
Don't Vents open
into the underworld?

26
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,375
[gasps] Let's go
get a closer look.

27
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,000
This could be our chance
to find a way in.

28
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:17,375
[HIYORI]
Yato. Please be all right.

29
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,291
[bell jingles]

30
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,458
[YUKINE] Okay, listen,
when we get there--

31
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,625
Where is she?

32
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:35,041
[HIYORI] I-- I can't move.
I'm being restrained.

33
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:40,041
[KUGAHA] Oh, my. What a
surprise, meeting you here.

34
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,666
But maybe we've come
on similar errands.

35
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,291
Do you have business to
settle with Yato as well?

36
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:50,333
[HIYORI]
Kugaha! What's he doing here?

37
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,625
You see, I owe him for this.

38
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,958
Do you know how annoying it is
to live with only one hand?

39
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,791
The simplest tasks
become so difficult.

40
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,000
I mean to change that,

41
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,416
and your hand will do nicely.

42
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,666
[HIYORI]
Yato!

43
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,416
[YUKINE]
Hiyori!

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,750
[HIYORI gasps]

45
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,208
You stay the hell away from her!

46
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,000
[YUKINE]
Kugaha! Restraint!

47
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,625
[KUGAHA]
Hm...

48
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,416
[gapss] It didn't work.

49
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,125
Of course it didn't work.

50
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,291
I am not Kuga anymore.

51
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,375
An invocation requires
your target's name.

52
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,083
So it's fairly easy to determine

53
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:35,208
who has the upper
hand here, Yukine.

54
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,500
What do we do now?

55
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,458
[YUKINE]
You just stay back!

56
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,625
Wait, what?

57
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,916
[laughs] Hear the
shock in her voice?

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,333
She's surprised a Blessed
Vessel could be so weak.

59
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,791
[YUKINE gasps]

60
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,333
Say what you want.

61
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,083
You're just a backstabbing Nora.
Whose dog are you this time?

62
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,083
[KUGAHA chuckles]
Listen to the feisty little boy!

63
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,458
You put on a good show,
but I bet you're panicking

64
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,583
because you don't know my name.

65
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,500
I've heard it all before.

66
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,625
Gods and other Regalia are
constantly insulting us Noras.

67
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:12,250
But do you even know the
real reason why they do it?

68
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,625
Because we Noras
are so powerful.

69
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,250
To use an invocation
against someone,

70
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,291
you must first know their name.
But Noras have multiple names.

71
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,375
You are now experiencing how
unsettling, even terrifying,

72
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,833
that fact can be to those
who aren't like us.

73
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,125
That's why everyone despises us.

74
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,666
Because they hate uncertainty
and fear the unknown.

75
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,833
Because they cannot name
you, they despise you?

76
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,416
Don't listen to him.
He's messing with your head!

77
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,833
[laughs] Understand now,
Blessed Vessel?

78
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,125
Others like you may enjoy
fame and the worship

79
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,208
of many believers, but
they amount to nothing.

80
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,708
Not even Kazuma
can equal my power.

81
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,125
Truth is, the strong are
strong, blessed or not.

82
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,041
Look at little Hiiro.
She's a perfect example.

83
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,583
Who is Hiiro?

84
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,416
You know, the one Yato
always goes back to.

85
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,708
Little lady Hiiro,
dressed in white.

86
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,916
Nora?

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,250
You mean you didn't
even know her name?

88
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,291
Did your master keep it
a secret from you? How sad.

89
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,125
And if he took her with
him into the underworld,

90
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,833
he must trust her a lot
more than you, huh?

91
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:21,666
Shut up!

92
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,666
Yukine!

93
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,666
Really? Let's see
what you've got!

94
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,083
[grunts]

95
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,291
[KUGAHA]
Nope! Not good enough!

96
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,708
[grunting]

97
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,083
[YUKINE]
No way! He's overpowering me!

98
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,666
But I'm a Blessed Vessel!

99
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,750
[YUKINE grunts]

100
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,916
[yelps]

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,541
Pathetic. Just pathetic.

102
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,708
[HIYORI]
Hurry! Let's get out of here!

103
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:49,958
[cackles]

104
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,916
You can't beat a Nora!

105
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,458
Don't let him get to you, okay?

106
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,708
You have to remember!
You're a Blessed Vessel.

107
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,041
Yeah, I know that!

108
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,375
You're the one Yato
made his exemplar.

109
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,875
I know! I know! But still...

110
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,458
He took her! Why not
take me, damn it?

111
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,333
Don't think like that.

112
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,125
Come on, let's play some more!

113
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,958
I'm still having fun!

114
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,083
[YUKINE]
You know how hard I've worked

115
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,708
trying to get stronger.
It's all been for him.

116
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,666
I wanted to make sure
Nora never became

117
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,416
his exemplar instead.

118
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,708
Now this!

119
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,541
[laughing] There's no use
running away, kids!

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,458
[HIYORI, YUKINE panting]

121
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,333
He chose Nora.

122
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,250
Look, you should know,

123
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,375
Yato told me something once.

124
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,375
And I knew he meant it. Listen.

125
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:51,500
He told me he'd always wanted
to find someone like you.

126
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,166
[YATO]
Thank you, Yukine.

127
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,208
As long as I've lived,
you're the first Regalia

128
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,708
to change for me. I'm so gonna
brag to everybody about this.

129
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,708
Don't you get it?

130
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,000
You're Yato's one
special person.

131
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,416
[YUKINE]
His... one special person?

132
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,166
It's the truth! Yukine--

133
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,166
[HIYORI, YUKINE yelp]

134
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,041
[KUGAHA]
I found you!

135
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:16,333
[HIYORI] You have to listen
to me! Have faith in Yato!

136
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,666
[YUKINE growls]

137
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,708
Borderline!

138
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,125
Borderline!

139
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,125
[KUGAHA gasps]

140
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,958
[KUGAHA groans]

141
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,666
[panting]

142
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,916
Wow! Amazing! You did
it. You beat him!

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
[YUKINE] Let's go, Hiyori.
Let's find Yato.

144
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:56,333
[YATO groaning]
Damn it.

145
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,458
[NORA]
Hold on! Stay strong, Yato.

146
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:07,625
[laughs] I did it.
I actually did it!

147
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,041
I managed to save Ebisu!

148
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,750
And I didn't do it
for my old man.

149
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,833
I did it because I wanted to.

150
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,500
Don't you dare die, Ebisu!

151
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,333
If you give up now, I'll
kick the crap outta you.

152
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,333
Hear me? That's a promise!

153
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,541
[yelps]

154
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,125
[EBISU]
Is this right?

155
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:36,000
Do all of these names
belong to me? So many.

156
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,958
If you include the local
and historical variants.

157
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,750
[EBISU]
I'm almost like a Nora then.

158
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,291
And it looks like the name Ebisu

159
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,500
has many different meanings.
Including "drowned corpse."

160
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,333
With all these possibilities,
who am I, really?

161
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,125
[IWAMI] One story claims
that you are Master Hiruko,

162
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,125
the first child of Lord
Izanagi and Lady Izanami.

163
00:09:59,208 --> 00:09:59,958
[EBISU]
Hiruko.

164
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,291
[IWAMI]
Yes, that's right.

165
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,750
Though, I now call you
Lord Ebisu because

166
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,541
it is the name you are most
widely known by these days.

167
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,500
I see.

168
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,250
I wonder why my parents
didn't want me.

169
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,375
[BISHAMON]
Ebisu. Ebisu!

170
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,333
Come to your senses!

171
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,708
[KAZUMA]
He's awake!

172
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,875
[BISHAMON]
Are you all right?

173

00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,291
Thank goodness.

175

With the way you
were lying there,

176
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,416
I thought you had been executed!

177
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,333
[KAZUMA]
Can you stand, Lord Ebisu?

178
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,750
[YUKINE]
Lady Bishamon! Kazuma!

179
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,916
[KAZUMA]
You two! Why are you here?

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,666
I told you to stay away!

181
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,416
Who is that man?

182
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,583
Lord Ebisu.

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,208
Be careful! You're still weak.

185
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:54,208
The Yato god.
He didn't make it out.

186
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,416
He's still in the underworld.

187
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,875
[EBISU] The Yato god is
still in the underworld.

188
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,083
You must hurry.

[HIYORI, YUKINE, BISHAMON gasp]

190
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,250
I don't understand.
What would he be doing there?

191
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,458
He came to the
underworld for me.

192
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:15,875
To bring me back.
I-If we don't help him,

193
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,625
he'll be Izanami's forever.

194
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,583
Hold on! Why would
Yato go save you?

195
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,166
None of this makes any sense.

196
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:29,166
Bishamon, please
help him. For...

197
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,416
Did he die?

198
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
He's passed out, that's all.

Will you be all right?
Here, hold on.

Let me wrap this up for you.
There, all better.

You'll be fine now. Right?

Yeah, sure.

I don't know how you're so calm.

215
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,833
We're gonna die down here
if we don't find a Vent.

216
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,083
You realize that, don't you?

217
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:58,250
Yes. But as long as I'm
with you, I don't mind.

different from other people.

It's like she's
totally fearless.

222
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:13,416
Nothing seems to faze her.

223
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,125
And as a Regalia, she's
never once tainted me.

224
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,666
Maybe...

225
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,375

I'm gonna find a Vent,
if it kills me.

And cut ties with the old man.

How can we get
into the underworld?

sealed. Now so's the Vent.

That's right! Help us!
You can open up a Vent.

You absolutely cannot
go into the underworld.

250

It's no place for humans.
You'll never leave alive.

into the underworld!

do this. I have to save him.

If you're that determined,
there's only one option.

You must enter the underworld
as someone else's Regalia.

to become a Nora?

for you to sully your name,

difference where he hides.

The heavens will find him.

272
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,125
Hopefully, he will
recover enough to explain

273
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,166
what he's been up to.

Stop it! We need to stay calm.

Why do you suppose Yato
entered the underworld?

00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,625
Ebisu claims Yato
went there to save him.

295
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know what his
true goal might have been.

296
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,875
But there's one thing
I'm certain of.

297
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,625
The Yato god has people
waiting for him.

298
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,916
So we must make sure he returns.

determine his location?

[KAZUMA] Do you see a
thread-like substance?

306

It stretches down
toward the cave.

307
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,333
It's not thread, it's hair!

assume it belongs to her.

[DAIKOKU]
Whoa. What happened?

310
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,041
I did try to hold back a little,
but even so, no Vent of mine

311
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,416
should close up so quickly.

00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,125
Impressive.

345
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,250
It's no wonder she's known
as the supreme war god.

346
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,583
Still...

347
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,916
[KINUHA gasps]
Nothing happened?

348
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,333
But how is that possible?

349
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,791
A blow that strong
and it did nothing?

350
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,208
We're in big trouble!

351
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,458
Everyone focus!

352
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,708
We all need to
work together now!

353
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,833
[KAZUMA, AIHA, KINUHA]
Right!

354
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,333
Fools! You shouldn't have come.

355
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,208
Hurry! Get outta here!

356
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,000
If you're looking for Ebisu,
he left. I helped him.

357
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,166
He should be safe.

358
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,541
[BISHAMON]
Be quiet! You suicidal maniac!

359
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,458
Don't you want to be rescued?

360
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,000
Rescued? What are you...?

361
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,291
[BISHAMON]
Yato god.

362
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:06,500
I have hated you to
the core of my being.

363
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,375
I loathed you,
and I loathed myself

364
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,250
for being saved by you.

365
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,500
But whatever I've said before,

366
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,375
you weren't to blame for the
deaths of the Ma and Ha clans.

367
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,750
I have actually
known that all along.

368
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,041
Their deaths were my fault.

369
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,166
Yato god!

370
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,208
I hated you because it was
all I could do to keep going!

371
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,583
In spite of that,
you've saved me twice.

372
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,750
Are you telling me
you came all this way

373
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:42,083
to say "thank you"?
You're freakin' crazy!

374
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,250
You can say whatever
you want about me,

375
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:48,791
but I always pay my debts.
That is why I am here!

376
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,875
[yells]

377
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,750
[IZANAMI screams]

378
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,916
You famous gods are
only so brave and daring

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
because you can reincarnate!

380
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,291
Do not think me so complacent!

381
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:10,500
I don't wish to die. I'll
fight to remain who I am!

382
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,208
Veena.

383
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,416
Yato god, hear me well!

384
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,333
Your friends await you outside.

385
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,083
Yukine and Hiyori Iki.

386
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,708
[gasps]

387
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,833
[BISHAMON] That's right!
So don't you give up!

388
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,583
[YATO]
They're waiting...

389
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:34,833
[YATO] Hiyori and Yukine.
They're waiting for me!

390
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,250
[grunting]

391
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,750
[yelling]

392
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,583
My lady, let's try again.

393
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,833
[KOFUKU]
Bore!

394
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,333
[KOFUKU gasps]
It's no use!

395
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,583
The Vent is just
closing right back up.

396
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,625
[DAIKOKU] Damn it!
They won't have a way out!

397
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,166
Please, Milady.

398
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,625
[HIYORI]
Yato.

399
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,875
[KOFUKU]
Bore!

400
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,791
[grunts]

401
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,583
Yato.

402
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:19,625
[EBISU] A Blessed Vessel
and a human girl.

403
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:25,666
I see. They are his purpose.
They are why he keeps fighting.

404
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,416
He's awoken!

405
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,916
[KOFUKU]
Ebi! Are you okay?

406
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,458
You can help Yato.

407
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,000
If you wish to bring him
back from the underworld,

408
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,375
there's a way.

409
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,916
[BOTH gasp]

410
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,833
However, not just
anyone will do.

411
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,125
It requires a human.

412
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,500
[KAZUMA]
Hm.

413
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,916
[BISHAMON]
What's wrong, Kazuma?

414
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,041
[KAZUMA]
I can't decide if your bath

415
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,041
should be 105 or 106 degrees.

416
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,333
[BISHAMON]
On the next Noragami Aragoto:

417
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,791
"Your Voice Calls Out."

418
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,166
[KAZUMA]
What do you think?

419
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,625
[BISHAMON] Honestly? I don't
much care either way.
