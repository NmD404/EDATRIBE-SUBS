00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:23,916
[TEACHER 10A]
I'm sure you already studied

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
basic factorization
in junior high.

3
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,541
Good news: the method
remains the same.

4
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,333
Think of the
process as splitting

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:34,000
an expression into smaller,
more manageable expressions.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,708
[STUDENT 10A]
No way. Seriously?

7
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,833
[STUDENTS giggle]

8
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
[ABE] Things went pretty
well at Capypa Land,

9
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:45,041
so I invited her to a
Hundred Archfiends concert.

10
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,291
Wait, Hiyori!

11
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:54,458
[HIYORI panting]

12
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,625
[HIYORI cries]

13
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,000
[sighs]

14
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,708
[YUKINE]
Hiyori! It's been awhile!

15
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,416
Oh, you've switched uniforms.

16
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,708
Is it that time of year already?

17
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,958
[HIYORI]
Uh...

18
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,291
[YUKINE] It's easy to
lose track of that stuff

19
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,750
in Takamagahara.

20
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,125
Anyway, I've been
really busy studying

21
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,916
invocations with Kazuma.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,458
So I haven't exactly had time
to finish the homework

23
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,083
you assigned me.

24
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,833
I'm so sorry!
You understand, right?

25
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,750
Maybe I could get an extension?

26
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,375
I, uh...

27
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:20,083
Wait, that says Yuki... Yukine.

28
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,708
Yep. That is my name.

29
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,791
[HIYORI]
Yukine!

30
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:24,958
[YUKINE]
Whoa, hey!

31
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,708
[HIYORI]
This smell, this nice smell.

32
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,791
I remember everything!

33
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:35,958
Yukine, Yato,
the promise I made!

34
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,000
I can't believe I
almost forgot all of it!

35
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,500
[YUKINE]
Hey! What's up with you?

36
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,500
[YUKINE] Geez! You're an idiot!
What were you thinking?

37
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,708
Don't ever do
that again, Hiyori!

38
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,750
'Kay. Sorry.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,375
[HIYORI] So, anyway. What's
Yato been up to these days?

40
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,916
How should I know?

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,125
It's been more than a month now
since I heard from the guy.

42
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,791
I wouldn't waste my time
worrying. What a big jerk.

43
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,083
[HIYORI]
Gone a whole month?

44
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,833
My lady hasn't
come back yet either.

45
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,416
Hi, Daikoku.

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,875
Oh, hey, Hiyori.
Long time no see, huh?

47
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,083
She still isn't back?
Hasn't it been awhile?

48
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,375
Yeah.

49
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,083
I haven't heard from her
since I was sent home

50
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,083
from the latest Colloquy.

51
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,541
It's weird, too.

52
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,000
They usually can't stand
the sight of her there.

53
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,666
I don't like this.

54
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,125
I know. Kazuma feels
the same way.

55
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:33,250
He says it's strange there've
been all these meetings.

56
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,250
[HIYORI] There are so many
entries in my date book

57
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:40,166
about them. And then they
just suddenly stopped.

58
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,666
I hope everything--
What're you doing?

59
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,458
[HIYORI] I'm gonna go
out and look for Yato.

60
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,125
[YUKINE]
Wait, you're gonna do what?

61
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,958
Hold on! Hiyori!

62
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,916
[HIYORI]
I almost forgot him once before.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,750
But I was so stupid
and cocky this time.

64
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,083
Yato!

65
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,750
[HIYORI] Idiot! I was so
sure I would never forget.

66
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,041
Like I was different
or special somehow.

67
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:12,333
Because our ties
hadn't been cut.

68
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,708
But I'm not an exception at all!

69
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,916
[KOFUKU] It's totally different
for unknown gods like Yatty.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,166
Once they've been forgotten,
they vanish from existence.

71
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,000
Yato!

72
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,375
[HIYORI]
I don't even know where to look.

73
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:39,041
Because, the truth is,
I don't know Yato at all.

74
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,291
Stay with me! Stay!

75
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,916
[YATO] Damn it! What are
these creepy things?

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,500
They must be Izanami's Beldams.
They're under her control.

77
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,875
Don't let them
catch you, understand?

78
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,708
You'll be trapped here forever.

79
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,291
[EBISU]
Yuki! Hold them off.

80
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,916
[YUKI]
Sir.

81
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,750
That was incredible.

82
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,125
The brush really does work.

83
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,500
It allowed me to summon
a Phantom using only a name.

84
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,125
That's enough "ooh-ing"
and "ah-ing"!

85
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,750
We need to get away from them!

86
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,375
How do we even get outta here?

87
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,125
It's almost
labyrinthine, isn't it?

88
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,666
I think it's more than that.

89
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,458
It's like the whole
place is expanding.

90
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,500
[IZANAMI]
Why are you running away?

91
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,541
We'll be good friends
if you'll stay with me.

92
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,833
[YATO] Hey! Earlier, when
we first tried to leave,

93
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,416
you called her "Mother."

94
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,541
If you're her son,
can't you do something?

95
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,208
I wanted to discover more
about my own origins,

96
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,583
so I consulted
the old literature.

97
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,291
One story says that
she abandoned me.

98
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,000
If that's true, then she
clearly didn't want me.

99
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,500
So I don't know
how our relationship

100
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,375
will make any difference.

101
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,583
It's got me!

102
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,708

103
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,791
They can't be cut!

104
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,958
Just let go, damn it!

No, he's mine!

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,958
[BELDAM LADY 10C]
I saw him first!

112
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,125
[YATO]
Come on!

113
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:18,083
[EBISU panting]

114
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,625
Hiiro. How could you?

115
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:24,750
He got away, didn't he?
You should be thankful.

116
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,708
[NORA] Now we can
fulfill Father's request.

117
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,916
You're the conjurer
we were sent to rescue.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,625
[YATO] I have to get
Ebisu out at all costs.

119
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,375
Why do you want him
so badly, old man?

120
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,625
What's your game?

121
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,791
[EBISU]
Yato god.

122
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,916
I should be all right
now. Let's go.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,916
All the previous
Ebisus died for this.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,458
I must leave here with
the Locution Brush.

125
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,833
Why are you so obsessed with it?

126
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,000
Your other
incarnations are dead.

127
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,208
Their work can die with them.

128
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,583
This is what I am meant to do!

129
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,125
It's my purpose.

130
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,416
Is that something
you can understand?

131
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,916
[EBISU] The world is filled
with senseless violence

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,500
and unnecessary pain. That's
why we gods are so important.

133
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,583
But with this Locution Brush,

134
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,708
I'll be able to restrain
Phantoms and prevent

135
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,291
at least some of the
misfortune they cause.

136
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,958
I can use it to make
the world a better,

137
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,833
less painful place to live.

138
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,958
Does that answer your question?

139
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,166
[EBISU grunts]

140
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,500
[panting]

141
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,333
[YATO]
All this, for humanity's sake?

142
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,250
I didn't think guys like
that actually existed.

143
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,375
[IZANAMI]
Where are you?

144
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,791
Where did my friends go?

145
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,333
[YATO]
This whole time I assumed he was

146
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,875
doing it for power.

147
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,041
[YATO] Such a fierce will.
I'll never have that.

148
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,708
[NORA]
You're a god of calamity.

149
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,916
Don't you see?

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,666
This is the sort of work
you should be doing.

151
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,083
[MOTHER 8A]
Thank you...

152
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,583
[NORA] People appreciate this
type of job a lot more.

153
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:15,083
[NORA]
Well done. Very well done, Yato.

154
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,500
[EBISU grunts]

155
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,041
[BELDAM LADIES, IZANAMI]
Found you!

156
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,083
[YATO] I've always done
everything I was told to do.

157
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,750
It just seemed easier that way.

158
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,041
But that's gonna change.

159
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:40,166
I wanna be someone
people respect.

160
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,083
Someone who she can be
proud to have in her life!

[BELDAM LADIES screaming]

162
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:53,125
Kunimi! Go! Take Ebisu
and get outta here!

163
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:57,500
What? Wait. You
can't kill Izanami.

164
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,500
Don't have to kill her.

165
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:03,166
I just have to hold her off.
That much I can do.

[HIYORI]
Yato-no-Kami.

167
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,583
His name is similar,
but he can't be our Yato.

168
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,583
He has a shrine and
even appears in stories.

[gasps]

170
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:22,000
[HIYORI] It looks like
Ebisu has multiple names.

171
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,250
Huh.

172
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,500

also goes by Vaisravana?

173
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,375
Huh. Strange.

174
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,833
I wonder if Yato has
another name, too.

175
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,958
There are so many gods
described in these books,

176
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,000
but I can't find anything
that even mentions him.

177
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,958
There's nothing online, either.

178
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,666
All I can see are his
social network pages.

179
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,125
I know! I'll ask Mayu.

180
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,166
[MAYU]
The heavens are in disorder?

181
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,875
Yes. I just returned
from Lord Ebisu's estate.

182
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,250
They have the whole
area cordoned off,

183
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,125
and I was even threatened
by armed Sentinels.

184
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,416
[REGALIA gasp]

185
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,291
Wait, what's a sentinel?

186
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,666
They're the Regalia
that serve the heavens.

187
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,458
But Sentinels aren't
usually armed.

188
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,375
Something really big
must be going on.

189
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,791
We were there recently.

190
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,875
So I know Lord Ebisu
has been corrupted.

191
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,416
It's likely he'll perish again.

192
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,000
[gasps]

193
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,625
[KAZUMA] The heavens
have always tolerated

194
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,791
his excessive corruptions
and reincarnations.

195
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,875
But not this time. For some
reason, this is different.

196
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,333
Yeah, no doubt.

197
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:31,458
[KAZUMA] Hm. I was hoping
to ask for your help, Tsuyu.

198
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,750
You can find out
what's happening

199
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,583
in Takamagahara, and with
more certainty than I can.

200
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,916
Will you please
consider helping us?

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,583
No, Sir Kazuma.

202
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,916
I cannot afford to jeopardize
my lord's standing.

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,125
We should wait to receive
word before doing anything.

204
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,041
Or do you mean to
antagonize the heavens?

205
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,208
They have the Gods of Fortune.
They're likely being questioned.

206
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,583
Perhaps even being tortured.

207
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,875
I understand.

208
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,500
I know how it is to fear
for one's master. Very well.

209
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,000
What? What's this?

210
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,625
[MAYU] Tsuyu is speaking
with the trees.

211
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,333
She isn't a Regalia, you know.
She's the spirit of a plum tree.

212
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,875
[YUKINE gasps]

213
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,250
[MAYU] It is said that, long
ago, she traveled all the way

214
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,000
to Dazaifu to be
with Lord Tenjin.

215
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:36,416
She's been his companion since.
For more than 1,000 years.

216
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,041
Her affection for him is deep,
and it will not ever wither.

217
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:45,583
[TSUYU]
Conjurer. Masks. Phantoms.

218
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,333
Echoes of discord
among the gods.

219
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:52,916
The heavens are searching for
Lord Ebisu and his exemplar.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,125
Really?

221
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,541
[gasps]

222
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,083
[TSUYU] There is a peach tree
located near the Verge.

223
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,666
It saw Lord Ebisu head
into the underworld.

224
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,708
The underworld?

225
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,125
What could possibly
send him there?

226
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,125
[TSUYU]
He had pursuers.

227
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,291
[DAIKOKU, KAZUMA gasp]

228
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,541
[TSUYU] A young male god
with a lean frame

229
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,750
and a short girl in
white wearing a crown.

230
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,708
That's--

231
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:18,250
[HIYORI]
Nora. It must be, right?

232
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,083
That sounds like Yato and Nora.

233
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,791
[OKUNINUSHI]
Oshi!

234
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,583
Just how long you
gonna keep us locked up

235
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,041
in this damn place?

236
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,291
[OSHI] We have just discovered
that Lord Ebisu is,

237
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,875
indeed, the conjurer. An edict
has been issued for his death.

238
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,708
Punishment for
disrupting the heavens.

239
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,375
What?

240
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,083
[FUKUROKUJU grunts]

241
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,625
[JUROJIN, HOTEI gasp]

242
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,958
How are you so sure it's him?

243
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,833
[OSHI] We conducted a
search of his residence

244
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,750
and found a large
number of masks there.

245
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,333
He also had many Phantoms
in his care, evidently.

246
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,208
Furthermore, we discovered
that most of his Regalia

247
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,375
are actually Noras. Disgraceful.

248
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,333
But what of Ebisu?

249
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,291
[OSHI] Lord Ebisu
appears to have ventured

250
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,583
into the underworld.

251
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,125
Likely to procure more
Phantoms, we suspect.

252
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,458
That sounds like
a bunch of crap.

253
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,541
I don't believe it.

254
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,291
[OSHI]
It is fact, I assure you.

255
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,791
Lord Ebisu is guilty.

256
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,583
His Regalia confessed everything
after being interrogated.

257
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:16,416
Interrogated? What did you do?

258
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,833
That's none of your concern.

259
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,166
The heavens now intend
to call upon the gods.

260
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,416
Lord Ebisu's behavior
must be punished.

261
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,791
By death?

262
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,666
Why go straight to
capital punishment?

263
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,791
It won't be easy
to help him now.

264
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:33,041
Not with the edict in place.
It's over. He'll die.

265
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,583
[OKUNINUSHI]
I'm not givin' in that easily.

266
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,875
Huh?

267
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,750
I won't argue with you
about your damn edict.

268
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,958
But if anybody is gonna
kill him, it's gonna be me.

269
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,708
Okuninushi?

270
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,041
[OSHI]
I'm afraid that won't do.

271
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,833
You will remain here until
the situation is resolved.

272
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,000
This way we can
assure your innocence.

273
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,250
You must see that cooperation
is in your best interest.

274
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,875
[OKUNINUSHI]
Outta my way.

275
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,208
Go on. You heard me, now, move.

276
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,833
I'm bein' nice and
respectful to you

277
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,166
at the moment. But remember,

278
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,708
I have gone to war
with the heavens before.

279
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,333
They called me the Bear!

280
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,666
The Spider! Everyone feared me!

281
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,083
Do something!
You have to stop him!

282
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,458
[laughs nervously]

283
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:23,833
[OKUNINUSHI] Is this what
you want? Another fight?

284
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,708
A god without a
Regalia is helpless.

285
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,125
[KAZUMA]
Restraint!

286
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,916
[grunts]

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,333
Forgive my tardiness.
Are you well, my lady?

288
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,250
Kazuma! I'm glad to see you!

289
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,875
[KAZUMA] I wouldn't
expect reinforcements.

290
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,833
They seem a bit
under the weather.

291
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,958
A god without a Regalia
is helpless, you say?

292
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,125
That's a dangerous
thing to assert.

293
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,125
Really, High Sentinel Oshi.

294
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,833
[gasps]

295
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,000
[KAZUMA] I may be willing
to forget you said it.

296
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,541
Assuming that you withdraw now.

297
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,583
I believe she gets
the point, Kazuma.

298
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,375
Benzaiten. Can you handle
things here without me?

299
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,750
Go!

300
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,541
While Fukurokuju sacrifices
himself to Okuninushi!

301
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,791
We may become the
Six Gods of Fortune.

302
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,291
Wait! I didn't agree to this!

303
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,208
[yelps]

304
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,166
We need to get to
Ebisu quickly. Choki!

305

[KURAHA roars]

306
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,750
[HIYORI]
Let's see.

307
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,083
The Underworld Entrance
is that way.

308
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,958
It's 20 minutes on foot.
You up for a walk?

309
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,500
The entrance to the
underworld is a tourist spot.

310
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,583
Pretty crazy, huh?

311
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,791
[HIYORI] You're being really
quiet. You still upset?

312
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,500
Yato passed through
here, I'm sure.

313
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,708
The others said there was
no guarantee it was him,

314
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,666
but I think it must have been.
Besides, it's our only lead.

315
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,041
Something's going on with him,

316
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,791
and I wanna know what.
I want to hear it from him.

317
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,791
[sighs]

318
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,458
Like I said before,
I really don't think

319
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,166
you should come with me.

320
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,958
You can be majorly stubborn
sometimes, you know that?

321
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,375
[HIYORI sighs]

322
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,541
[YUKINE] What are you
waiting for? Let's go.

323
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,625
[gasps] You're letting me come?

324
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,791
[YUKINE] Yes. But don't do
anything dangerous, you got it?

325
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,833
You're really important to Yato.

326
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,125
To both of us, honestly.
No matter what.

327
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,333
I swear I'm gonna keep you safe.

Something to eat?

332
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,166
Come. We'll have a nice chat.

333
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,458
We need to split apart
and purge the Beldams.

334
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,583
But what about Izanami?

335
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,666

I don't need to kill her.

336

Just be sure you
maintain your blade!

We need to buy him enough time

340
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,875
to get outta here
with that brush!

341

[KUNIMI] Young Master,
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

342

I'm fine, I think. But you
must be in pain, too, though.

I'm little more than
an encumbrance now.

344
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,125
I owe the Yato god
a great debt for this.

345
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,875
You'll help me remember
that, won't you?

346
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:26,833
[EBISU] Wha...? What's this
smell? Salty, like blood.

347
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:31,000
[KUNIMI]
No. Not blood. It's the sea!

348
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,791
We're nearly outside.

349
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,791
Iwami will be waiting for us.

350
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,666
[EBISU panting]

351
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,000
[gasps]

352
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,041
[BELDAM LADY 10A]
Oh, dear.

353
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,625
It seems all the
exits are sealed.

354
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,833
[BELDAM LADY 10B]
Come, let's return

355
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,041
to Lady Izanami now.

356
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,500
I can't fight so many.
This is the end.

357
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,833
[REGALIA 10A]
The new young master certainly

358
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,916
loves playing by the water.

359
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,458
[REGALIA 10B] What little
boy doesn't love fishing?

360
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,250
I only hope he'll live
long enough that we won't

361
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,166
need to call him the
young master anymore.

362
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,583
[EBISU]
Hm?

363
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,000
[REGALIA 10C]
True.

364
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,833
He reincarnates so frequently
compared to other gods.

365
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,041
I wonder why.

366
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,541
[EBISU]
What's reincarnate?

367
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,541
[REGALIA 10A]
To go away and then come back.

368
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,250
[EBISU]
I don't understand.

369
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,208
It's what happens
when a god dies.

370
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,125
[REGALIA 10A]
It's okay, don't worry.

371
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,958
You are a very
famous god, Lord Ebisu.

372
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,916
[REGALIA 10B] A god like
you will always be reborn

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,250
after he dies.

374
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,083
[REGALIA 10C] See? There's
no reason to be scared.

375
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,666
Young Master.

376
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,750
Borderline!

377
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:46,958
It won't open.

378
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,041
I don't get it.

379
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,500
This should be
the entrance. Damn it!

380
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,083
--Borderline! Borderline!
--[HIYORI] Yato...

381
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,666
[IZANAMI chuckles]
It's over. I've caught you.

382
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,250
There's no escaping,
precious one.

383
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,625
You fool.

384
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,500
Didn't I warn you not
to let her catch you?

385
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,708
[IZANAMI]
Now, then. Have a little taste.

386
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,666
[YATO]
This is it. I'm dead.

387
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,208
[EBISU]
Lady Izanami!

388
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,291
[YATO gasps]

389
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,125
[EBISU]
Please, release him. Take me.

390
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,583
I'll remain here
with you instead.

391
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,916
[gasps] You will?
That's wonderful!

392
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,791
[YATO grunts]
Hey, what are you doing? Ebisu!

393
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:29,500
[EBISU] Yato god.
Take the Locution Brush.

394
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,208
I know that I can trust you.

395
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,875
Just make sure Iwami
gets this, all right?

396
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,083
Huh?

397
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,541
[EBISU] Kunimi is in
dire straits as well.

398
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,750
I'd appreciate it if
you'd take him with you.

399
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,833
Wait, what about you?

400
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,416
[EBISU]
I imagine I'll die before long.

401
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,250
[YATO gasps]

402
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,416
[EBISU]
It's okay.

403
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,250
I'll simply be born again,
as I always am.

404
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,125
So, please.

405
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,541
I don't accept that.

406
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,791
All of this will be completely
pointless if you die!

407
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,833
I wanna help you.
Do you understand?

408
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,333
And not because
someone told me to!

409
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,041
Why do you wanna die so badly?

410
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,208
I don't actively want to die,

411
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,125
but since I just reincarnate,
what does it matter if I do?

412
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,125
What about you as an individual?

413
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,666
Is dying here really
what you want?

414
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,583
Is it really what
this you wants?

415
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,500
[EBISU]
This me? What do you mean?

416
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,833
[YATO]
Isn't there anyone you'll miss?

417
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:24,000
Someone you wanna see again?
Something you wanna do again?

418
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,541
[EBISU]
Something I want to do again.

419
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,250
I'm not sure.

420
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,958
I suppose I'd like
to eat another meal

421
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,000
at the Olive Tavern.

422
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,291
[YATO]
That'll do.

423
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,250
You have made a wish,
and it has been heard

424
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,500
loud and clear. You can
pay me five yen later.

425
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,416
[growls]

426
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,541
Curse you!

427
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,500
[EBISU] We can't escape
her. We're trapped.

428
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,208
The exits have all been sealed.

429
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,708
[YATO] Don't you wanna
master controlling Phantoms?

430
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,458
How can you be ready
to give up so easily?

431
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,625
[grunting]

432
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,833
[YATO]
If there's no exit, make one.

433
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,291
Drill yourself a
hole outta here!

434
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,958
That's completely crazy.

435
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,916
Don't blame me for
whatever comes next.

436
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,541
Uki! Tekki! Shuki!
Sakki! Gaki! Senki!

437
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,500
Go open a Vent, now!

438
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,958
[PHANTOMS]
As you wish!

439
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,958
[gasps]

440
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,458
[EBISU grunting]

441
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,333
Damn, he actually
opened a Vent. Ha!

442
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:31,833
[coughs] I'm burning up.
I can't breathe.

443
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,541
[YATO]
Ebisu!

444
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,666
[EBISU]
Yato god?

445
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,500
[yelps]

446
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,791
[gasps]

447
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,041
[YUKINE]
Meow! Meow!

448
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,458
[HIYORI]
Um, what are you doing, Yukine?

449
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,125
[YUKINE]
Practicing cat language.

450
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,916
I'm gonna ask Yato if I can
have a pet cat someday.

451
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,250
[HIYORI] On the next
Noragami Aragoto: "Revival."

452
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,541
[YUKINE]
Meow. Mew-meow!
