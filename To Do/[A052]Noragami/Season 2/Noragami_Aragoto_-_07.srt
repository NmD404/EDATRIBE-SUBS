1
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,833
[MAYU gasps]

2
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,750
[KOFUKU crying]

3
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,208
[KOFUKU]
Welcome home!

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,250
You made it! Oh, I'm so happy!

5
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,958
I thought you were
goners for sure!

6
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:44,750
And the rest?

7
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,833
Lady Bishamon and the others?

8
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,375
They're safe, too.

9
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,708
They got some things
out in the open.

10
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,833
Hopefully, that means
she'll stop hounding me.

11
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,041
None of this has been easy.

12
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,375
But, personally,
I couldn't be happier.

13
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,083
No more crazy
war god on my tail!

14
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,041
And even better than that...

15
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,833
I've finally got myself
a Blessed Vessel.

16
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,250
[TENJIN, REGALIA]
Wha?

17
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,416
[KOFUKU]
Really?

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,166
--[MAYU] Seriously?
--[DAIKOKU] No way!

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,458
[TENJIN]
For that wretch?

20
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,041
--[YATO laughs]
--[YUKINE laughs nervously]

21
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,208
[MAYU] No one has
ever deserved it less!

22
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:17,083
That kid's too
good for you, Yato.

23
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,958
A Blessed Vessel?

24
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,250
It's something pretty rare.

25
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,708
Yukki risked his name
to protect his master.

26
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,833
Just like what Kazu
did for Bisha.

27
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,250
They're very special Regalia.

28
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,291
So, you've finally
found the one for you.

29
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,541
That must make you happy.

30
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,416
Kinda.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,833
[DAIKOKU]
All right!

32
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:44,791
We're celebratin' tonight!
Let's go prep for a party!

33
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:45,500
[KOFUKU]
Woo-hoo!

34
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,791
That reminds me...

35
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:47,875
Uh-oh!

36
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,208
Oh, no! My advancement
exam is today!

37
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,458
I'm sorry! I really have to go!

38
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,458
[TENJIN] If you'd wait
a moment please, Hiyori.

39
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes, what is it?

40
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,625
Well, Yato?

41
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:02,583
About our agreement.
I trust you remember.

42
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,583
[YATO]
Please, Tenjin.

43
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,958
Just take us up there.

44
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,291
This is for Hiyori.

45
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,458
[TENJIN] I'll agree to help
you on two conditions.

46
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:45,000
First, no one is to know
I was involved in any way.

47
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,000
 As for the second...

48
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,250
I assume you know.

49
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,875
[TENJIN]
Now that you've returned safely,

50
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,708
you are to sever your ties
with her once and for all.

51
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,333
No...

52
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,625
You actually agreed to that?

53
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,208
[TENJIN] It's become
painfully obvious that

54
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,166
Yato's involved you too
much with the Far Shore.

55
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,458
That entanglement has
repeatedly placed you

56
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,625
in unnecessary danger.

57
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,791
Lord Tenjin, I don't think--

58
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,541
[TENJIN]
You are not yet one of the dead.

59
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,500
You must send her back where
she belongs now, Yato.

60
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,708
It is the right thing to do.

61
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,916
You know it is.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,291
Sekki.

63
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,250
You're going to cut our ties?

64
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,125
Are you sure, Yato?

65
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,625
I'll forget you, though.

66
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:40,000
It'll be like we never even met.
And you're okay with that?

67
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,750
Well, I'm not.

68
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:45,458
Don't do it. You can't!
It's not fair!

69
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,000
Please! Yato!

70
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,541
I'm not ready to lose you yet!

71
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,416
[YAMA]
I gotta say.

72
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,666
These uniforms are a whole lot
cuter than our old ones were.

73
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,916
Yeah!

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I wasn't sure I liked
them that much at first,

75
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,750
but I think they're
growing on me.

76
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,666
You know, Hiyori,
for a little while there

77
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,833
it looked like you weren't
even gonna graduate.

78
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,666
You only barely woke up
in time to take the exam.

79
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,625
[laughs nervously]

80
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,958
What about you?

81
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,500
You were wide awake,
and you still almost failed.

82
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,708
Yeah, I don't wanna
talk about it, thanks.

83
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,250
Heh.

84
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,125
So, what club
are you gonna join?

85
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,916
[YAMA]
I still haven't decided.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,708
[AMI] Tennis or basketball...
Or a Culture Club, maybe.

87
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,000
What do you think?

88
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,458
Hm. I'm not really sure.

89
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,625
[YATO]
What'll she join?

90
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,541
The Yato Club, of course!

91
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,416
[YAMA]
What's up, Hiyori?

92
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,041
Join now and guess what?

93
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,541
You can get your very
own fluffy-fluff scarf!

94
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,541
[HIYORI grumbles]

95
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,041
Hey, where's the fire?

96
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,416
Maybe she's joining
the Track Club.

97
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,458
Yato Club! Yato Club!
Yato Club, Yo!

98
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,958
[AMI, YAMA scream]

99
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,041
[AMI]
There it is!

100
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,291
Her first Insta-Snooze
in this grade!

101
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,541
Yo! Where you goin'?

102
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,291
The Yato Club is
looking for you!

103
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,458
Will you please
stop following me?

104
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,208
Come on, you idiot!
What are we doing?

105
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,250
[YATO]
Yato Club! Yato Club! Yato Club!

106
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,750
[HIYORI groans]
Leave me alone!

107
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,916
[YUKINE]
Listen to her!

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,666
If I had to guess, I'd say...

109
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,541
...they haven't
severed their ties.

110
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,666
[sighs] Yato's hopeless.

111
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,875
Honestly, Mayu, I don't
know why I even bother.

112
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,291
What does he intend to do now?

113
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,250
[TSUYU]
My lord.

114
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,291
Huh?

115
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,125
It's time.

116
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,833
We must be on our way soon.

117
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,416
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
Lady Bishamon.

118
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,125
God of war though you may be,

119
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,708
your recent actions
are unacceptable.

120
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,958
[GOD 7A]
This isn't the Month of Gods!

121
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,375
To have a Colloquy now?
It's unheard of!

122
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,875
[GOD 7B] Your corruption
and its aftermath

123
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,250
have caused a tumult.

124
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,750
You have shaken
the very heavens.

125
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,666
How do you explain
your behavior?

126
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,958
The Yato god's attack
was unexpected.

127
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,958
I admit, I responded poorly.

128
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,583
[GOD 7C]
Do you mean the snake god?

129
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,458
Yato-no-kami?

130
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,625
Certainly not!

131
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,000
I've no part in this.

132
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,333
A charlatan must
be using my name!

133
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,375
Indeed, you're right.
It was not you I meant.

134
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,125
I speak of a nameless
god without a shrine.

135
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:13,958
[GOD 7C]
Oh, yes.

136
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,666
There are some like that.

137
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,041
Wretches who seek to
benefit from others' status.

138
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,875
[GOD 7D]
True. As a matter of fact,

139
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,166
I believe a god of poverty
is using Lord Ebisu's name.

140
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,416
[GOD 7B]
What I would like to know

141
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,416
is how a shrine-less one
was able to ascend here

142
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,291
in the first place.

143
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,250
[coughs]

144
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,958
Never mind this nameless god.

145
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:36,333
He's of no concern.
The Masked Ones are, however.

146
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,625
Masked Ones...

147
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,291
Phantoms employed
using Scourges.

148
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,750
Never before has one appeared
here in Takamagahara.

149
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,541
What of this Kugaha
who brought them?

150
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,166
Why did you decide
to release him?

151
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,500
[GOD 7A]
Indeed.

152
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,875
From him, we could have
learned about the conjurer

153
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,083
who created the Masked Ones.

154
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,916
Perhaps I acted hastily.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,625
However, you may be
interested to know

156
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,750
that I have since
learned he was not bound

157
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,791
by the name "Kuga." I presume
he was the conjurer's Nora.

158
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,666
[GODS gasping, murmuring]

159
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,291
A Nora, you say?

160
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,750
You believe someone here
granted him a name.

161
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,416
Is that your accusation?

162
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,750
Nothing like that!

163
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,291
It isn't my intention to
accuse anyone of anything.

164
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,708
What troubles me is
this conjurer's ingenuity

165
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,333
and ability to deceive the gods!

166
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,708
This incident has unsettled

167
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,291
both Heaven and Earth.
There will be consequences.

168
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,375
Phantom numbers will increase.

169
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,708
You are to carefully observe

170
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,583
every Phantom's behavior.
I expect timely reports

171
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,833
regarding any
Masked Ones you find.

172
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:42,500
I will issue a search
notice for this Kugaha.

173
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,583
The Colloquy is adjourned.

174
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,250
[REGALIA 7A whispering]
So, she really was corrupted?

175
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,041
[REGALIA 7B whispering]
And he's still her exemplar?

176
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,333
Even after failing her twice?

177
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,958
[BISHAMON]
I'm finished. Finally.

178
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,125
You must be exhausted.

179
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,791
[BISHAMON sighs]
I admit, it is fatiguing.

180
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,250
I know I am at fault
for what happened.

181
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,375
But as a god, I cannot afford
to bow down to others.

182
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,708
I understand their
displeasure, though.

183
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,583
There's no trace of Kugaha.

184
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,625
No one knows where he is.

185
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,250
If he truly is a Nora,
as we suspect,

186
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,416
he may already have
returned to another master.

187
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,416
Most likely the one
who created the masks.

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,250
Naming and employing Phantoms...

189
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,083
Who would do such a thing?

190
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,875
It's essentially like
asking to be corrupted.

191
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,208
That's inconceivable.

192
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,333
[BISHAMON]
Truly.

193
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,333
How could such a god
continue to exist?

194
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,958
Unless... the one
responsible is already

195
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,208
something that shouldn't exist.

196
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,625
[OKUNINUSHI]
Bishamon!

197
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,750
--[BISHAMON] Hm?
--Good to see ya!

198
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,083
How's it goin'?

199
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,375
[BISHAMON]
Okuninushi! Everyone!

200
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,541
[REGALIA 7C]
Oh! All Seven Gods of Fortune!

201
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,041
Those grouchy bastards.

202
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,416
Glad that's over.

203
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,666
Thought those geezers would
never leave you alone!

204
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,625
My ears need a break after that.

205
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,958
Yours, too, Inaba?

206
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:58,958
[INABA squeaks]

207
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,500
[BISHAMON]
Everyone can hear you.

208
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,291
Let 'em listen!
Anyway, forget all that.

209
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,125
Since we've got the
whole gang together again,

210
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:09,500
I'm throwin' a party at my
shrine in Hawaii! Wanna come?

211
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,791
Where's Ebisu?

212
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:16,250
He was just here a second ago.
Anybody know where he went?

213
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,750
Ah, go figure.

214
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,625
I don't know what that guy's
up to half the time, anyway.

215
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,208
Well, drop by if you can.
You know where we'll be.

216
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,250
It's gonna be awesome! Aloha!

217
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,166
A party. Will you go?

218
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,083
No. I'll pass.

219
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,375
[EBISU]
It's a pleasure to meet you.

220
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,041
I'm Ebisu, of the
Seven Gods of Fortune.

221
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,333
I'm here today because I have
heard some stories about you.

222
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,583
I have a proposition to make.

223
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,500
Iwami.

224
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,875
Sir.

225
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,291
[EBISU] I would like to
purchase your Blessed Vessel.

226
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,333
[IWAMI]
Is it insufficient?

227
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,125
I can bring you another
briefcase, master.

228
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,750
[UTAMI, KUNIMI, TATSUMI gasp]
Boss!

229
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,541
Wake up, Yato god.

230
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,375
I want Yukine. I am
willing to pay any price.

231
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,625
Uh... Any price at all?

232
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,416
You're not really gonna sell me!
Even you wouldn't do that!

233
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,791
Yukine.

234
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,708
If you do join me, I'll pay
you one million a month.

235
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,625
Ow.

236
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,625
I know that sting!

237
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,916
You're feeling
greedy, aren't ya?

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,291
Don't you try to
hide it from me!

239
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,416
Maybe it was just
a static shock.

240
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,750
You are behaving
distastefully, Sir Yukine.

241
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,208
You should not be so
easily swayed by money.

242
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,416
It's unbecoming of an exemplar.

243
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,750
An exemplar? Who? Wait, me?

244
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,125
That's correct.

245
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,000
You are Lord Yato's unique,
irreplaceable Regalia.

246
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,083
And that makes you
the same as an exemplar.

247
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,875
An exemplar leads the way.

248
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,458
He serves his god
as a guide of virtue.

249
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,625
In short, he is a half-god.

250
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,083
Lose your way, and your
master will surely perish.

251
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,791
You must be steadfast.

252
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,333
Indeed. Your position is vital.

253
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:56,125
It is you who protects
Lord Yato's name.

254
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,708
Perhaps you could
see about acquiring

255
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,125
the services of a
different exemplar.

256
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,791
Or perhaps we
could share Yukine.

257
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,375
I would welcome his
talent, even as a Nora.

258
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,416
Uh...

259
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,458
It's rather sad.

260
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,916
A god residing
in another's abode.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,208
And surely a Blessed Vessel
deserves better than that.

262
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,708
Have you no shrine
of your own, Yato god?

263
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,458
[phone vibrating]

264
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,791
[sighs]

265
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,500
[HIYORI groans]

266
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,416
[HIYORI]
Enough!

267
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,333
I'm not joining the Yato Club!

268
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,125
Um, where did all
of that come from?

269
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,625
Oh, you mean the money?

270
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,625
[HIYORI gasps]
Don't tell me...?

271
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,041
What do you take me for?

272
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,375
That stone-faced creep, Ebisu,
randomly showed up here.

273
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,000
He wanted to buy Yukine from me.

274
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,666
Told me to take the money
and build a shrine.

275
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,875
Real nice guy.

276
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,833
[HIYORI]
How could you do that to him?

277
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,166
I didn't sell Yukine!

278
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,125
Have some faith in me, will ya?

279
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,791
I don't need somebody else's
help to build my shrine.

280
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,166
But, you know, it's possible

281
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,000
Yukine will decide he'd
rather go with Ebisu.

282
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:09,875
It's a confusing time.
Kid's all mixed up inside.

283
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,583
[YUKINE] So, I learned something
from Lord Ebisu today.

284
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,833
[gasps] Yeah? What was it?

285
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,583
[YUKINE] Apparently...
I'm Yato's exemplar.

286
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,750
Crazy, huh?

287
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,791
[DAIKOKU]
Not that crazy. I'm one, too.

288
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,916
[YUKINE, HIYORI]
What? You are?

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,666
[DAIKOKU]
Uh-huh.

290
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,500
[YUKINE] But I thought
exemplars were like, you know,

291
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,708
leaders and stuff.

292
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,333
Really respectable,
upstanding Regalia...

293
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,291
[DAIKOKU]
Unlike me?

294
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,416
It's true that an exemplar
sets the standard

295
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
for righteousness when
there are lots of Regalia,

296
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,291
but I'm Kofuku's only one.

297
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,583
Just like you're
Yato's only Regalia.

298
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,625
Right. His only one.

299
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,750
[DAIKOKU] And remember,
Kofuku's a god of poverty

300
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,458
who spreads disaster.
She isn't helpless.

301
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,375
She doesn't need much
protecting, so she says.

302
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:07,041
My lady is always telling me I
shouldn't risk my name for her.

303
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,291
All I need to do is raise
her when she reincarnates.

304
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,750
That's my duty as her exemplar.

305
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,041
It's how I protect her.

306
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,000
Now, Lord Ebisu relies
on his exemplar, Iwami,

307
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,208
to see that his
wishes are passed on.

308
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,375
His reincarnations
and Regalia changes

309
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,583
tend to be pretty intense.

310
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,000
And then there's Kazuma.

311
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,916
You know how devoted
he is to Lady Bishamon.

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,625
Exemplars all have their own way

313
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:35,583
of protecting their masters.
And none of them are wrong.

314
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:40,250
Question is, how do you
want to protect Yato?

315
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,208
So, um.

316
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,708
What are you gonna
do with the money?

317
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,250
I'm gonna give it all back!

318
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,375
What else would I do?

319
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,500
[phone rings]

320
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,250
Hello and thank you for calling!

321
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,875
Fast, affordable, and reliable.

322
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,083
Delivery God Yato
at your service!

323
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,041
So, how can I help you?

324
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,250
[BOY 7A]
S-Sorry, I, um...

325
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,166
Uh... Hey, um.

326
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,041
I'm pretty sure
this is a job offer,

327
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,458
but it sounds kinda dirty,
if you know what I mean.

328
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,875
You can't afford to
be picky about work!

329
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,125
--You slacker!
--[YATO yelping]

330
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,500
--[yelping]
--Oh please, God! Don't hurt us!

331
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,541
Please, God. Please,
God. Please, God.

332
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,750
What the--?

333
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,791
[YATO]
The client's grandmother

334
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,041
was the victim of a
bank transfer scam.

335
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,791
[YUKINE] Wouldn't she be better
off just going to the police?

336
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,666
[YATO] She doesn't wanna make
a big deal of it, apparently.

337
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,958
Hey. Five yen isn't
a lot of money.

338
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,250
You ever think about raising
your rate a little bit?

339
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,166
What, and stop getting
clients altogether?

340
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,458
Forget that!

341
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,083
I'm trying to get
my name out there.

342
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,875
I want people who believe
in me. Not money.

343
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,750
[sighs] A little money
wouldn't hurt, though.

344
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,458
You, too? Typical!

345
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,666
My Regalia are always
quitting because of money.

346
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,041
I don't get it.

347
