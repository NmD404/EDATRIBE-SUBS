00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,083
[BISHAMON sobbing]
It's happened again.

2
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,958
How many members of
my family are dead?

3
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't know if I can bear this!

4
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,166
I don't get it.

5
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,416
Yato hasn't killed
anybody tonight.

6
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,416
So who did kill them?

7
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,916
The mastermind of
this little scheme.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,333
[YUKINE]
Huh?

9
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:14,708
[YATO] A Regalia who conspired
against his own master.

10
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,875
We know you're there.

11
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,458
No reason to keep
lurking in the shadows.

12
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,541
[bell jingles]

13
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:26,250
[footsteps]

14
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,250
[KUGAHA]
Aww, poor things!

15
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,541
They're barely clinging to life.

16
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,708
You should put them
out of their misery.

17
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,041
Eh? Go on, Lord Yato.

18
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,500
Doctor... Kuga...?

19
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,000
Kuga, huh? So that's your name.

20
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,041
Thought I'd be seeing you again.

21
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,625
Quite an elaborate
plan you cooked up.

22
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,000
[KUGAHA] This would've
happened eventually,

23
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,625
one way or the other.

24
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,208
Bishamon hounding
you all the time

25
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,000
has to have gotten old by now.

26
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,958
Here's your chance
to be free of her.

27
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,458
I don't understand why
you would hesitate.

28
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,208
Haven't you already massacred
a clan of Regalia?

29
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,416
What's one more?

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,958
It was you? Why?

31
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,041
You're still a little
out of it, aren't you?

32
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,750
Maybe I should explain
what's happening.

33
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:17,083
The fact of the matter is
you caused this. You.

34
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:21,250
By needlessly granting names
to Regalia after Regalia.

35
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:25,041
You're a failure as
both master and god.

36
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,750
Knowing that,
do you truly believe

37
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,791
you can continue as you are?

38
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,375
The name Bishamon is supposed

39
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,666
to belong to the
noblest, fiercest,

40
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,458
and mightiest god of war.

41
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,791
A model of godhood who uses
only the finest Regalia

42
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,458
to expel evil from the world.

43
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,583
But instead, we have you.

44
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,458
A god who strokes her own
ego by granting names

45
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,541
to worthless, broken souls
and is then forced

46
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,875
to drug herself so that
she can endure their pain.

47
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,875
A god obsessed with
a personal grudge,

48
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,666
dragged her Regalia into it,
and then shamefully,

49
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,166
disgracefully, was corrupted.

50
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,208
Takamagahara has been desecrated

51
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,458
by your defilement.
You've become detestable.

52
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,250
Evil.

53
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,875
Look at what
you've done tonight.

54
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,375
You destroyed your
own Blessed Vessel.

55
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,791
No one will ever willingly
follow you again.

56
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,291
I can see your tears,
but tell me this,

57
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,333
Lady Bishamon:
for whom do you weep?

58
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,083
Do you weep for yourself?

59
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,375
If so, you're
utterly despicable.

60
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,166
However, if it is for the sake

61
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,166
of your Regalia that
you shed those tears,

62
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,791
then I don't need to tell
you what must be done.

63
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,541
You already know.

64
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,458
[KURAHA]
You filthy, traitorous snake.

65
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,000
You're actually asking
our master to die?

66
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,583
To end her own life?

67
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,500
Of course I am.

68
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,916
I'm hurt that you would
call me a traitor, though.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,416
Through it all, I have
only ever had Bishamon's

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,333
best interest in mind.

71
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,500
Our master deserves the
chance to be born anew.

72
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,666
And the proper guidance
that I will provide.

73
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,625
Yeah?

74
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,958
[YATO] You know what I think
you're really saying?

75
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,708
"Look at me. Pay more
attention to me, Mommy!"

76
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,333
That's what I'm hearing.

77
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,500
What?

78
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,208
[YATO] If you want
your master's approval,

79
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,458
then do your job well. If you
wanna oppose your master,

80
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,916
then take it up
with your exemplar.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
People distinguish
between right and wrong,

82
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,375
but those concepts
don't apply to gods.

83
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,041
And do you know why that is?

84
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,166
Because every action that
a god takes is the right one.

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,708
[KUGAHA grunts]

86
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,416
You know what it's like,
you forcing her reincarnation?

87
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,458
It's like a spoiled kid
trying to kill his parents.

88
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,041
You are something
less than human.

89
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,750
You'll pay for what
you've done, Kugaha.

90
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,125
I promise that.

If you're not going to kill
her, then I will kill you.

96
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,375
I'll end your very existence.

[SKELETON PHANTOM 2A growls]

98
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,083

We should get out of here.

What are you waiting for?

If we can get to the
master's purifying spring,

I think we'll be safe.

[FUMIHA]
Why bother?

103
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,125
You saw what happened.

All my friends are dead.
Our master's gonna die, too.

105

I don't wanna live anymore,
either. What's the point?

What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

107
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,958
Our master saved us.

108
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,791
We owe it to her to
survive if we can.

109
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,375
She gave us names.
She carried our pain.

110
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,500
She made this place
a home for us.

[FUMIHA] It won't ever

as our curer,

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,083
you competently looked
after my health.

177
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,583
[sneezes]

178
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,333
[BISHAMON] Your ministrations
often helped me

179
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,583
to forget my pain.

180
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,041
But that was wrong of me.

181
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,250
I shouldn't have forgotten it.

182
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,625
The root of my pain
was your own.

183
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,750
How could I lose sight of that?

184
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,583
I am truly sorry.

185
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,625
What? I don't want your apology!

186
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,708
This is disgraceful! Bishamon.

187
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,250
I swear on your name.

188
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,625
I've never once
tainted you. Not ever!

189
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,875
He's really trying
to play innocent,

190
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,875
after all he's done?

191
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,250
Except he isn't lying.

192
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,208
She would have been
stung if he was.

193
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,375
[BISHAMON] You seem to be
telling the truth.

194
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,291
You truly believed that,
by forcing me to reincarnate,

195
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,166
you would be doing
the just thing.

196
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,583
In which case, you've
acted righteously.

197
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,750
[KUGAHA]
Yes! Exactly!

198
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,458
I've done nothing wrong!
My actions were just!

199
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:39,708
[AKIHA] Lady Bishamon!
Please, we need you inside!

200
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,958
A masked Phantom is
attacking everybody!

202
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,125
You know who brought it here.

203
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:50,000
Him. "Just actions?" He called
a freakin' Phantom here

204
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,875
and you're gonna let him live?

205
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,583
[BISHAMON]
Truly?

206
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:01,125
[BISHAMON gasps]
I feel an ache in my heart.

207
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,083
Is this your pain, Kugaha?

208
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,875
Enough. Out of my way!

209
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,291
[BISHAMON]
What you asked before.

210
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,291
If I could really
continue on like this.

211
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,791
To be honest, I'm not sure.

212
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,708
But for now at least,

213
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,458
I will do what
must be done. Rokki!

214
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,625
I'd forgotten.
You're a balance scale.

215
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,875
Please don't!

216
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,416
I apologize for putting
you to so little use.

217
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,041
Wait! No! Don't do this!

218
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,666
It was for you! Everything I
have done has been for you!

219
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,375
It's over now.
Rokki! I release you!

220
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,500
Stop! No!

Lady Bishamon!

222
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,125
[YATO]
After all that, you let him go.

223
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,166
[BISHAMON]
It was my decision.

224
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,625
Now go. Do as you wish.

225
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,000

00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,083
I will.

You're just gonna run away?

I am not.

Please, Yato. Let's leave.

230

Not yet.

231
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,833
There's still a Masked One
here to deal with.

232
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,416
Let her go.

233
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,833
She needs to do it herself.

Yeah.

must've told Hiyori.

[YATO]
Hey! Bishamon!

239
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,666
You shouldn't feel
bad about this, okay?

Not at all. Listen to me.

00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,666
[BISHAMON]
You are all so kind.

349
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,291
When you hurt me,
you feel hurt in turn.

350
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:16,375
That's why I've always
tried to hide my pain.

351
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,041
I worried that
complaining about it

352
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,708
would only increase the
guilt you already felt.

353
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,625
I need to change
that, but honestly,

354
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,333
I don't know where to start.

355
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,541
This is how I've
always done things.

356
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,750
I need you. Be my
guide, Kazuma.

357
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,333
I'll lose my way
again. I know I will.

358
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,250
You're allowed to make mistakes.

359
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,875
Can't you accept that?

360
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:41,666
My lady...

361
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,000
[knocking]

362
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,916
[TSUGUHA] We brought it,
my lady. Sorry it took so long.

363
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,583
[KINUHA] Oh! Kazuma's
awake! That's wonderful.

364
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,166
I should let everyone know.

365
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,791
[TSUGUHA] He looks so different
without his glasses, doesn't he?

366
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,875
[AIHA] Oh, yeah! Ten years
younger at least.

367
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,708
[MINEHA]
What if he wore pink glasses?

368
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,000
[AIHA giggles]
I don't think so!

369
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,666
[TSUGUHA] Hey, we started
an exchange diary

370
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,375
that we take turns writing
notes in. Here, see?

371
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,833
I think you should write
something in it, too.

372
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,625
[BISHAMON]
Eh-hem. Don't laugh, all right?

373
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,041
It's just an idea I had.

374
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,000
To get to know you all better.

375
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
[AIHA]
Tsuguha! Why'd you write that?

376
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,541
What's wrong with
my romance stories?

377
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,833
[TSUGUHA] Like I said in
the diary, they're obnoxious.

378
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,000
I just tell it like it is.

379
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,833
[AIHA]
They're not obnoxious!

380
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:34,708
[TSUGUHA]
You know what's worse?

381
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,166
The awful pun someone attempted.

382
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,541
That's not an appropriate
response, Master.

383
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,625
What? Really? It isn't?

384
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,916
[KAZUMA laughs]

385
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,041
[ALL but KAZUMA]
Huh?

386
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:48,291
[laughs] No, it most
definitely is not.

387
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,791
[chuckles] There, you see?

388
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,708
I'm simply lost
without my guide.

389
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:02,500
Kazuma. I hereby
lift your exile.

390
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,916
Come back. Say you'll
be my exemplar again.

391
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,083
[KAZUMA]
I will.

392
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,916
[NORA] Kugaha turned
out to be a failure.

393
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,041
What a shame.

394
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,875
All he could manage
was a jingle.

395
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,208
Never any real music.

396
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,708
[gasps]

397
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,166
[bell jingles]

398
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,625
I'm to bring Yato here?

399
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,541
Yes. I'll do that, Father.

400
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,458
[KAZUMA]
An exchange diary, huh?

401
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,041
I wonder what I should write.

402
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,750
Let's see, "Dearest Veena"...
No, I can't say that!

403
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,916
[TSUGUHA]
On the next Noragami Aragoto:

404
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,250
"How to Worship a God."

405
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,041
[KAZUMA] Tsuguha! How
long've you been there?

406
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,541
[TSUGUHA]
The whole time.
