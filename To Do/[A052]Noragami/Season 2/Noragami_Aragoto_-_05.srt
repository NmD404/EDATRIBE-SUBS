Being here in her ethereal

If we don't lift
the Scourge soon,

her physical body will die.

This is my fault.

I played right into
Kugaha's hands.

understand the agony

Impossible...

This is what
happened with Kazuma.

44
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,875
He wasn't much as a new Regalia.

45
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,958
Just a small nail.

[BISHAMON]
But rarely, very rarely,

47
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,041
a Regalia will transform.

I'm not sure how,

Everything happened so fast.
I guess I got carried away.

As long as I've lived,
you're the first Regalia

[KAZUMA]
I knew it.

230
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,416
He's doing this to
force a reincarnation.

231
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,083
[KURAHA]
So it would seem.

232
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,541
Apparently, he used some
sort of medicine to conceal

233
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,791
the blight until
the opportune moment.

234
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,083
I apologize.

You were right to be suspicious.

00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,125
What a fool I was.

237
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,333
I blindly trusted him because
he was our master's curer.

238
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,791
I was an idiot not
to see through his ruse.

239
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,791
[KAZUMA] Choosing trust is
usually the best course.

240
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,875
We Regalia cannot afford
to mistrust one another.

241
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,458
Such discord is
toxic to our master.

242
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,833
In extreme cases,
it can even be fatal.

243
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,416

continue to smile.

That's what I've always
taught our family.

246
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,625
Always. But now we
have disgraced her.

247
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,416
Once again.

248
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,333
[HIYORI] Umm. Are you
sure that really helps?

249
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,125

Huh?

00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,791
It sounds like
Bishamon handles things

252
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,458
a lot differently than Yato.

253
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,583
He has no trouble complaining
whenever he's in pain.

254
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,416
And Yukine's not
usually shy about

255
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
sharing his feelings, either.

256
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,625
That can lead to a
whole lot of bickering,

You can tell they're actually
close to each other.

But Bishamon and her Regalia

to keep up appearances.

00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:31,291
[YATO] It's okay, kid.
Killing a god's no big deal.

353
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,666
[HIYORI whimpers]

354
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,666
[BISHAMON gasps]

355
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,541
[screams]

356
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,875
[gasps]

357
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,333
[BISHAMON gasps]

358
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,833
[YATO grunts]

359
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,541
[KAZUMA]
Veena. Listen to me.

360
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,875
There's something...
I've never told you.

361
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,333
The Ma Clan's death
wasn't Yato's fault.

362
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,250
It was mine.

363
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,291
I asked him to do it.

364
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,583
[KAZUMA] I betrayed them.
They died and I survived.

365
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,666
I wanted so badly
to tell you the truth.

366
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,708
[KAZUMA]
I can't protect you, master.

367
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm just a little nail.

368
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,833
Please, you must find other
Regalia to serve you.

369
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,208
Better ones.

370
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,875
[BISHAMON] No. I never wanna
go through that again.

371
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,708
I don't need
any other Regalia!

372
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,875
All I need is you!

373
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,375
[KAZUMA] In the end,
I wasn't able to say it.

374
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:19,250
Nor could I stop you
from hating Yato.

375
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,208
You needed that hatred.

376
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:25,166
It's what gave you new strength.

377
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,458
So you see, I'm a coward!

378
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:32,416
I only wanted to be with you.

379
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,708
Your words that day were bitter,

380
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:38,125
but they filled me with
joy. I reveled in it.

381
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,958
And now...

382
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,291
I've made you weep yet again.

383
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,541
Blessed Vessel? That isn't
a title I deserve.

384
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:50,041
I've failed you in every way.

385
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,833
Just look at us now.

386
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,666
This is where my
guidance has led us.

387
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,458
I've put you through
such anguish.

388
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,083
I don't deserve your
forgiveness, but I am sorry.

389
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,458
[BISHAMON groans]

390
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:25,916
[sobs]

391
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:35,958
[sobs]

392
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:41,958
[sobs]

393
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,916
Oh, Milady.

394
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,708
[sighs]

395
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,750
[HIYORI]
So much pain.

396
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,625
She must have been holding
this in for years...

397
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:01,666
For centuries. She's
sobbing like a child.

398
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,375
It's done, Bishamon.
Time to end this.

399
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,875
You have to let your Regalia go.

400
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,416
Yugi.

401
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:24,458
[BISHAMON]
Kinu. Tsugu. Kazu. Karu. Kura.

402
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:31,291
Kazuma. I'm sorry. So sorry.

403
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,958
It's happened again.

404
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,541
How many members
of my family are dead?

405
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,833
I don't know if I can bear this!

406
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:38,958
I don't get it.

407
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,208
Yato hasn't killed
anybody tonight.

408
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,333
So who did kill them?

409
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,583
The mastermind of
this little scheme.

410
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,291
[YATO] I can't believe you're
a Blessed Vessel now!

411
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,750
Let's have a party to celebrate.

412
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,500
We'll dress all in white,
buy a huge cake,

413
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,041
and throw rice at each other!

414
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,875
[YUKINE] Uh, no. You're
thinking of a wedding!

415
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,500
[YATO]
On the next Noragami Aragoto:

416
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:29,708
"What Must be Done."

417
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,583
[YUKINE]
I'm not marrying you, dude!
