00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,833
[GODS murmuring]

2
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,916
[GOD 7A] It was always odd
how often he reincarnated,

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,916
but this is simply shocking!

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,833
[GOD 7B] To think that
Ebisu is the conjurer

5
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,333
that they've been hunting.

6
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,875
[GOD 7D] I hear that he controls
some formidable Phantoms.

7
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,041
[GOD 7A] And did you know
that most of his Regalia

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,541
were actually Noras?

9
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,375
[GOD 7B] A God of Fortune,
a Nora-keeping conjurer?

10
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,458
It's practically unthinkable!

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,708
[GOD 7A] I wonder why he would
ever do something like this.

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,625
That is entirely irrelevant.

13
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,291
Taboos are taboos.

14
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,791
The heavens' disorder begets

15
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,375
humans' disorder.
Time is of the essence.

16
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,291
Ebisu has been
revealed as a Phantom

17
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:59,291
conjurer and devotee.
So, we set forth to slay him.

18
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,208
[yells]

19
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,083

Aiha!

23
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,083
[KAZUMA]
Oh, no!

24
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,833
Hey! You okay?

25
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,958
Stay very still, Veena.
She'll take your head off.

26
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,833
So I assumed.

27
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:12,375
[IZANAMI]
Oh, look! This is pretty!

28
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,833
Give him back! Right now!

29
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:18,375
[IZANAMI] What excellent luck!
It's nearly dinner time.

30
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:22,125
Come, everyone. We'll
have a feast tonight.

31
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:26,416
Look at this scrumptious dish.
Plenty for all, ladies!

32
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,416
[BELDAM LADY 10A]
Ooh, yes please!

33
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,458
[BELDAM LADY 10B]
That does look delicious!

34
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:34,500
[IZANAMI] Come, come.
Eat as much as you'd like.

35
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:40,083
What are you doing?
Stop! Get away from me!

36
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,833
[BISHAMON screams]

37
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,875
No! Veena!

38
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,458
--Stop!
--[BISHAMON] Get off!

39
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,125
Damn it! Can't get out!

40
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,750
Struggling against it
will only hurt you more.

41
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,750
I've had enough of this!
Lemme go, you old hag!

42
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,833
[EBISU]
Kunimi. Are you all right?

43
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,041
I'll live, but just barely.

44
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,958
If it wasn't for the Yato god...

45
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,375
[sighs]

46
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,875
[KUNIMI]
I hope he'll be okay.

47
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,958
Lady Bishamon just went into
the underworld to save him.

48
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,791
That's something.

49
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,750
Though I don't think even she
is a match for Izanami.

50
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,791
But hold on.

51
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,083
Didn't you just say
there was a way

52
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,375
we could bring him back?

53
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,791
What were you talking about?

54
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,500
[EBISU] It's a method
known as a Soul Call.

55
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,375
[YUKINE]
I don't understand.

56
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,625
[EBISU] You peer into the very
depths of the underworld

57
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,708
and call out someone's
name to fasten them

58
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,416
to the Near Shore. I believe
that's the only way left

59
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
to bring him back
from Izanami's realm.

60
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,666
So we just gotta call his name?

61
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,875
You really think
that will do it?

62
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,791
If it doesn't, nothing will.

63
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,583
But it must come from a Near
Shore being with ties to him.

64
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,958
Gods and the deceased
are unable to do it.

65
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,791
Only a human can.

66
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,416
You.

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,583
[EBISU] To be honest, I've
never heard of this technique

68
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,833
being used on a god before.

69
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,208
But we've no other choice.
It's worth a try.

70
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,750
[YUKINE]
Good luck. Be careful.

71
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,541
[inhales] Yato!

72
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,791
[IZANAMI]
Go on!

73
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,166
Go on!

74
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,041
You only have to take one
little bite of the food

75
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,250
of the underworld.

76
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,291
Then you can stay
with me forever!

77
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,250
Won't that be nice?

78
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,041
Go on. Have some!

but it's time for us to leave.

00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:30,041
She disappeared. Wait,
could that have been...?

99
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,958
[IZANAMI]
A Soul Call.

100
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,875
It was a Soul Call? So...

101
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,666
I can get outta here if
someone calls my name?

102
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,583
Yes, it would seem so.

harmed in any way?

to me down there?

Yato! Yato!

108
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,791
Why? He's not coming.

I don't get it!

111
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,750
It worked on Lady
Bishamon but not him?

112
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,875
What's wrong? Why can't
we Soul Call Yato?

113
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,208
That was a Soul Call?

114
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,041
[EBISU]
Well, let's think.

115
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,375
Is it possible that's
not his true name?

116
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,250
[DAIKOKU, KOFUKU,
YUKINE, HIYORI gasp]

117
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,375
So he borrowed one?
Like in the same way

118
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,625
that my lady goes by
Ebisu Kofuku you mean?

119
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,958
That is a possibility.

120
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:28,041
I do it to obscure my
identity as a god of poverty.

121
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,541
So then, who is Yato?

122
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,666
Damn! Using an alternate name?

123
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,250
He's never talked about that!

124
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,250
That's why it didn't work.

125
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,791
You must call his true name
to bring him back successfully.

126
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,250
Any idea what it could be?

127
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,541
No.

129
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:50,166
I can't think of anything.
I'm very sorry.

130
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,666
If we don't do
something swiftly,

131
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,250
Yato will be trapped forever.

All they have to do
is call my name?

138
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,333
Great! Any minute,
we'll be outta here!

139
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,750
[NORA]
Will we?

140
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,583
Do they know your real name?

141
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,750
Did you ever tell them?

142
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,375
[YATO gasps]

143
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,291

00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,208
[coughs]

146
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:42,625
[YATO] She's right.
I never told them anything.

147
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,958
I couldn't bring myself to.

148
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,208
[YATO] I knew if I told
them, they'd hate me.

149
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,875
They'd abandon me for sure.

150
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,833
So I stayed silent.

151
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,083
I revealed nothing
about my past.

152
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,416
And that means...

153
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,625
They don't know my real name.

154
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,333
They can't call me
back. I'm trapped.

155
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,625
So it's all over.

156
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,000
If the heavens have chosen to
reject me, then I'm finished.

157
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,875
Who are they? The
heavens' Punishers?

158
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,083
It looks like they're all gods.

159
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,583
The bastards are
hiding their faces.

160
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,916
I guess they don't want anybody
knowing the identity

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,833
of Lord Ebisu's killers.
That's disgusting.

[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
Ebisu!

163
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,958
You've already returned
from the underworld, I see.

00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,208
[GOD 7C]
A Vent!

165
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,666
[GOD 7A] You've opened a

give Ebisu a chance

173

with our task?

176
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,791
Is it not natural
for me to stand

177
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,750
in support of a
fellow God of Fortune?

178
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,750
I had hoped we might
hear Ebisu's reasons

179
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,958
before resorting
to senseless murder.

180
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,541
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] We are
standing in front of a Vent

181
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,416
that he opened.

182
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,000
We have no need of explanations.

183
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,791
[BISHAMON] Say what you will,
but he has done no wrong!

184
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,500
Bishamon, wait.

185
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,833
I have complete faith in him.

186
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,625
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI] The heavens'
decree is not a matter

187
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,000
for debate. If you insist
on protecting him,

188
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,416
you do so at your own risk.

189
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,625
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
Conjurer Ebisu!

190
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,041
You have violated a taboo and
caused disorder in the heavens.

191
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,541
You are to be cleansed and kept
in the Shrine of Passing!

192
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,000
Once, I would have given in.

193
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,750
But... I am no longer so
accepting of my own death.

194
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,916
How can you be ready
to give up so easily?

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,500
Isn't there someone you'll miss?

196
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,666
or maybe something
you wanna do again?

197
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,833
[EBISU] I've finally realized
that there are some things

198
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,208
I'm willing to fight for.

199
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,416
My name will endure
past my death.

200
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,875
For that reason, I have long
taken my lives for granted.

201
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,791
But I'm not ready
to give this one up yet.

202
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,416
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
Fire!

203
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,833
Defend me, Senki!

204
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,875
[SENKI]
Yes!

205
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,208
[GOD 7A] There's the proof!
He does employ Phantoms!

206
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,916
You've shown yourself
for what you are, conjurer!

207
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,458
Come, Uki! Come, Tekki!

208
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,833
Quickly! Shuki! Sakki! Gaki!

209
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,000
[BISHAMON]
Kinki!

210
00:11:59,041 --> 00:11:59,833
[KURAHA roars]

211
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,875

00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,458
[yelps]

214
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,458
The Vent!

215
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,583
Kofuku!

216
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,958
Kokki!

217
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,958
Let's give this one
everything we've got!

218
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:19,958
Yeah!

219
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,166
Bore!

220
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,666
It's no good.
It's still closing!

221
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,458
Please! You need to call
Yatty's real name and quickly!

222
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,041
She can't call it
if we don't know it!

223
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,458
--Whoa, hey!
--[HIYORI] Yato!

224
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
[HIYORI] Yato! Please,
you have to come back!

225
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,208
Borderline!

226
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,333
Come on! You'll get
shot, Hiyori!

227
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:48,500
Yato! Yato!

228
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,708
[HIYORI]
Yato! Yato! Yato!

229
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,791
That obviously isn't his name!

230
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,833
It has to be!

231
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,625
[BOTH gasp]

232
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,416
Remember? That shrine
I made Yato...

233
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,458
He was so happy when he got it.

234
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,000
He said it was what
he always wanted.

235
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,875
I carved his name on it.

236
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,041
How could that name
be the wrong one?

237
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:29,250
He was so happy, he cried.
I did carve "Yato," right?

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,541
[HIYORI gasps]

239
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,250

[gasps]

00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,833
[YATO grunts]

246
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,750
You... called me.

247
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,541
I did.

248
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,583
[HIYORI, YATO, YUKINE sigh]

249
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,500
It really worked! You're here.

250
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,666
I'm here. Thanks to you.

251
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:55,333
[IZANAMI] Alone again.
Will no one ever stay with me?

252
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,333
[GOD 7B]
He summoned something

253
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,416
from the underworld!

254
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
[GOD 7D]
Dispatch it quickly!

255
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,041
Are you okay?

256
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,458
[YATO]
I think so.

257
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,333
You came all this way
to look for me?

258
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,791
[grunts]

259
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,791
Ebisu! You're in bad shape.

260
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,791
You and the others fall back.

261
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,083
You don't stand a chance
against the Punishers.

262
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:28,958
I can still fight.

263
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,958
Get moving. I'll hold them off.

264
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,583
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
You shall not escape. Come, Oki!

265
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,500
[KIUN roars]

266
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,375
That's Kiun,
Takemikazuchi's Regalia.

267
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,541
Young Master!

268
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,250
Kiun is also known
as the Thunder Blade,

269
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,708
and for good reason.

270
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,416
Your Phantoms won't be
able to stand before him.

00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,958

What's with them?
They're pissed.

275
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:16,083
I'm sorry for this.
Are you okay?

276
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,166
You're still alive!

277
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,166
How did you do that?

278
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,875
Ebisu, just go!

279
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,208
[KURAHA roars]

280
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,916
Thanks, my friend.

281
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,833
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
Running will do no good.

282

[yells]

283
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,541
[BISHAMON]
Where'd everyone go?

284
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,958
[KAZUMA]
Into the forest.

285
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,291
[BISHAMON]
All right. Kazuma.

286
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,958
Push Kinuha's Borderlines
to maximum power.

287
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,291
We're going to take out Kiun.

288
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,833
[KIUN growls]

289
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,000
What? We can't take him out!

290
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,208
[KAZUMA]
Are you certain?

291
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,666
Kazuma?

292
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,208
Yes, I am.

293
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,541
Demonstrate your dominance,
my Blessed Vessel.

294
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,291
Yes.

295
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,583
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
You may be a Blessed Vessel,

296
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,416
but I am not threatened
by a mere earring.

297
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,958

We really hit him!

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,208
[KAZUMA]
Not enough.

302
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,750
I need to reach
further than that.

303
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,708
[KAZUMA] I must exceed his
Borderlines and strike deeper.

304
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,458
I must believe that I am
the dominant Regalia here.

305
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,416
[KAZUMA, BISHAMON]
And seize control!

308
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,291
[EBISU sighs]
A frightening display.

309
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,166
That is what true
power looks like.

her Blessed Vessel.

Is it bad?

[YUKINE]
Yato!

314
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, Yukine?

315
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,625
[YUKINE]
Who the hell is Yaboku?

316
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,041
And since when is "Yato"
not your real name, huh?

317
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,500
How could you have lied
to us this whole time?

318
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,875
It's complicated.

319
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,041
Can we do this later?

320
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,583
I have to know.

321
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,791
Why'd you go into the underworld

322
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,083
without saying a
single word to us?

323
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,333
You just disappeared one day

324
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,416
and went and got yourself
beaten to death!

325
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,916
With all we've been though,

326
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,291
you still don't trust me.
You're an idiot, you know that?

327
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,416
And a terrible master.

328
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,416
Okay, that's enough.
Listen to me, I...

329
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:57,541
[YATO gasps] No. Let go of me!
You'll get blighted, too!

[YUKINE]
I know I haven't always been

332
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:06,041
the best Regalia, but,
but I made an oath.

333
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,750
In case you've forgotten,
I swore I would

334
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,500
risk my name to protect you!

335
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,750
I haven't forgotten.

336
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,458
You're his Blessed Vessel.

[ALL screaming]

340
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,833
Is that what I think?

341
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,416
A Pacification Ring!

342
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,083
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
There you are.

343
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,166
The next one won't miss, Ebisu.

344
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,958
[GODS] How pure is the
brightness of thy soul.

345
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:02,708
How pure the brightness of
thy heart. How pure it is.

346
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,375
In the name of Takagi-no-kami,

347
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,291
we wield the
heavenly wax-tree bow.

348
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,833
Incredible.

349
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,333
I can't believe they're actually
using a Pacification Ring!

350
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,666
I've never heard of that before.

351
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,000
It's something used to quell

352
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,791
the enemies of the heavens.
A very ancient art.

353
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,833
One hit from that thing
and we're all dead.

354
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,541
I can't believe how far
they're willing to take this.

355
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,333
This is insane!

356
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,583
There's no reason for them to
drag the mortal world into it.

357
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,666
[YATO]
Sekki!

358
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,583
What are you doing?

359
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,500
[YATO] You're the one they're
going to all this trouble for.

360
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,541
The thing is, you made a wish
and I haven't granted it yet.

361
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,083
Another meal at the
Olive Tavern, remember?

362
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,291
[gasps]

363
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,583
You're kidding!

364
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,166
But you're not in
any condition to be--

365
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,416
[YATO] I refuse to let
them have their way!

366
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,541
I know that I can trust
you. Now, let's go!

367
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,458
[GODS] Should thou be of
pure heart, god Ebisu.

368
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:17,125
Should thou be pure of soul,
the arrow shall miss.

369
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,458
Should thou be dark of heart,

370
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,375
the arrow shall
tear thee asunder.

371
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,916
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
Farewell, Ebisu.

372
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,916
Look out! It's coming!

373
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,666
[yelling]

374
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,791
Rend!

375
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,458
[GODS screaming]

376
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,541
[TAKEMIKAZUCHI]
He cut through it? Impossible!

377
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,000
[YATO grunting]

378
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,458
[KOFUKU yelps]

379
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,791
[HIYORI yelps]

380
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:16,958
[grunts, coughs] That was
incredible! Yato god!

381
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:21,291
He truly is fearless.
And so is his Blessed Vessel.

382
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,166
Veena, look!

383
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,333
No! Run, Ebisu!

384
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,666
[cackles]

385
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,166
[YATO] Today, we'll
teach you how to make

386
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,958
fluffy-fluff accessories.

387
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,541
[YUKINE]
First, get some cotton fabric.

388
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,250
[HIYORI] Then you just
take it and rip it up.

389
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,083
[YATO]
On the next Noragami Aragoto:

390
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,541
"The God of Fortune's Message."

391
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,041
[YUKINE]
Here. You take it, Yato.

392
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:28,958
[YATO]
You're not gonna wear it?

393
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,583
But it's so stylish! Come on!
