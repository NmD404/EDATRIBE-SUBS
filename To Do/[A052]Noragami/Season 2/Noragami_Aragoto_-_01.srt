Good morning, Mom.

Good morning, Dad.
Did you sleep well?

Not too bad.

Yes, thank you, dear.
Now, come eat.

00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,875
I hear that you did well

Hey, where's Yama?

She headed in early,
the poor thing.

48

Why's that?

the answer to this one?

Oh, this is a hard one.

Thank you.

With your help, maybe
I'll actually pass.

Be careful, though.

61

Trying to learn too much, too
quickly, can backfire on you.

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,333
Yeah, you're right.

63
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,250

Oh, wow.

80
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,000
You mean you actually know
how to change diapers?

81
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,416
That was nothing compared to

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,041
changing a cloth diaper.
Are you that surprised, though?

83
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,875

a long time, you know.

are sleep deprived

93
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,416
because he cries all the time.

94
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,541
Really? He's not crying now.
He seems perfectly happy.

[YATO] Actually, it's pretty
normal for animals

Don't forget,
there's a baby in here!

144
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,583
[YATO] I commend you
for being concerned.

145
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,958
We must take care not
to cause undue harm

146

You'll need to hold back.

Great. How do I do that?

up to you. Understand?

But how?

160
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,625
[YATO] The mirror. This
Phantom is just an image.

161
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:12,291
One created by the kid himself.
See what he's doing?

162
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,333
He probably wanted
somebody to play with.

163
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:18,666
So he kept reaching out to his
own reflection in the mirror.

164

The longing and vulnerability

Unless we do
something to stop it,

00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:30,000
it will eventually possess his

this thought energy

Okay, then. What do we do?

178
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,708
Hear me. I am the god, Yato.

179
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,833
I now lay thee waste
with the Sekki,

180
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:10,000
and expel thy vast
defilement! I cleanse thee!

181
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,416
Rend!

182
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,000
That was incredible, Yukine!

183
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,041
That's my Regalia for ya!

184
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,166
See, I knew you could do it.

185
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,291
[YATO]
He should be safe now.

186
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,958
[HIYORI]
Well, that's a relief.

187
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,458
But... What do we
do about all this?

188
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,875
We scram, obviously.

189
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,458
[YUKINE, HIYORI]
Huh?!

190
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,833
--[HIYORI] That's horrible Yato!
--[YUKINE] I can't believe you!

191
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,333
[HIYORI] Especially when
you're supposed to be

192
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,791
setting a good
example for Yukine.

193
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,541
[YATO]
A mask?

194
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,875
[KAZUMA] You called
for me, Lady Bishamoan?

195
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,541
Yes I did, Kazuma.
Please, come in.

196
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,333
[KAZUMA]
How may I help?

197
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,625
[BISHAMON] How much time
do we have remaining

198
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,708
until our next patrol?

199
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,875
It's today.

200
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,625
We have it planned
for the Fiendish Hour.

201
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,666
[BISHAMON]
I see. It's almost time then.

202
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,875
[KAZUMA]
Is something troubling you?

203
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,208
Well, as a matter of fact,

204
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,750
I had an old nightmare
this morning.

205
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,791
Clashing with Yato again
after all these years

206
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,666
may be to blame.

207
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,125
I'm sorry to hear it.
Are you all right?

208
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,625
Yes, I'm quite fine.

209
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,291
However, I'll need you
to locate him again for me.

210
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,791
I must know if we've
overlooked anything.

211
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,750
[KAZUMA] Right. Shall I inform
the curer, to be safe?

212
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,208
Yes.

213
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,666
[KOFUKU]
What? No way!

214
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,166
[HIYORI]
It's true.

215
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,791
But... I'm sure you cleaned up
in the end though, right?

216
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,666
Of course! I insisted.
We couldn't leave it like that!

217
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,750
[YATO] You can guess who she
made do all the cleaning!

218
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,583
[DAIKOKU]
Must've been terrible.

219
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,583
[screams]

220
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,916
Show some respect
for the working class!

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
You can start by feeding me.

222
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,375
I think I'll have
grilled eel today.

223
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,250
You don't place orders.

224
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,833
You'll take whatever I
give you, and you'll like it!

225
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,500
[YATO] Ah! I think
you punctured a lung!

226
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,833
[HIYORI] Here, Yukine.
You'll need to do this over.

227
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,791
And check your work using
a dictionary this time, okay?

228
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,333
Uh-- Okay.

229
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,208
You're such a strict teacher!

230
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,541
Really? Am I?

231
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,833
How's he doing, anyway?

232
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,541
Does Yukine have
some book smarts?

233
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,833
It kinda varies.

234
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,916
He's better at some
subjects than others.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,875
Overall, I'd say he's
an eighth grader.

236
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,125
[HIYORI] Wait! Eighth grade
is only one below me!

237
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,958
Oh, jeez. What
about that time--?

238
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,708
[HIYORI] It's been a while
since I slept with someone...

239
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,041
[HIYORI]
Uh-oh!

240
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,291
Maybe he thought I meant
slept, slept with someone!

241
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,958
[YUKINE]
What? Is something the matter?

242
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,291
Oh, no. Nothing!
Everything's fine.

243
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,708
It's just dandy.
Nothing's wrong at all!

244
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,583
Heh. You try to act mature,
but you're still young

245
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,083
in so many ways.
Good thing I'm here.

246
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,875
Somebody has to look
out for you two.

247
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,458
You should be thankful.

248
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,125
I may not be a big deal now,
but just you wait!

249
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,083
Before much longer, the whole
world will know my name!

250
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,791
Yeah! I'll have my own
shrine and everything!

251
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,083
Yeah, I dunno.

252
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,958
You've been saying that for
over a century now, Yatty.

253
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,541
You're skeptical. I get that.

254
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:13,291
But it's different this time.
'Cause now, I have this!

255
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,000
I give. What's it do?

256
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,041
A miraculous lucky cat
made of magic gemstone!

257
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,750
Its beckoning power
is guaranteed

258
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,750
to draw people to the bearer.

259
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,083
It was given to me by
one Master Ishizaki,

260
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,875
a fortuneteller who
once appeared on TV.

261
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,500
The bottom says it's
"made of plastic."

262
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,625
Huh?

263
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,083
[HIYORI]
And it's not beckoning.

264
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,500
Look at the paws.
It's doing a "hurrah" pose.

265
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,375
[YATO]
What?

266
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,458
Talk about a gullible consumer.

267
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,166
[YUKINE] How much did that
fortuneteller charge you?

268
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,208
Two hundred thousand.

269
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,541
Wha--?!

270
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,875
How could you blow
that much money?

271
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,041
[YUKINE]
That kind of cash...

272
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,833
[YATO] Wait! Please!
I bought it for us!

273
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,125
If my luck improves,
so does yours!

274
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,208
Poor Yukki.

275
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,541
It must be rough
being Yatty's Regalia.

276
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,791
Yup.

277
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,083
[YATO screams]
My spleen! You got my spleen--

278
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,500
[HIYORI] Aren't you supposed
to be putting your money

279
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,458
towards a shrine, Yato?

280
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,208
[YATO]
Anyone need the Delivery God?

281
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,791
God-like powers,
at your service!

--[YUKINE] Ah, jeeze.
--Any job--mildew scrubbing,

00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:13,625
Even Phantom slaying.
Any job at all, just five yen!

285
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,250
[YUKINE]
Yato. Look.

286
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,458
[YATO]
Huh?

287
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,291
There's a Storm brewing.

--Hey! What was that f--
--[YATO] Shh!

291
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,708
Hey, that's Bishamon. Right?

292
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,500
Whew. that was a close one.

293
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,500
We would be in for a world
of hurt if she saw us.

294
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,333
Let's just go this way.

295
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,750
[YUKINE]
So, I've kinda been wondering.

296
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,333
How long do we have
to keep avoiding her?

297
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,583
Huh?

298
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,875
[YUKINE] I mean, I owe
Kazuma for helping me

299
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,375
with the ablution.

300
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,958
I'd like to talk
to him and, you know,

301
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:49,666
maybe say thank yo--

303
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,166
You will stay away
from Bishamon.

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,791

What is it now?

312
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,166
You mean to save another spirit?

313
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,541
[BISHAMON]
Of course I do.

314
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,791
We failed to save
her life before.

315
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,708
If I fail her again,
what kind of god am I?

Hear me, I am the god, Bishamon.

00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,208
I now lay thee waste
with the Saiki,

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,791
There. That should be all of it.

350
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,083
[GIRL whimpering]

351
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,500
Spirit, you are lost and adrift.

352
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,208
You have nowhere to go
and nowhere to return to.

353
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,916
Thus, I grant you
a place to belong.

354
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,125
My name is Bishamon.

355
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,708
Bearing two names,
you shall remain here.

356
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,041
With these names,
I make thee my servant.

357
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,791
With these names, I use my life

358
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,333
to make thee a Regalia,
fit to be wielded by a god.

359
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,708
Thou art Mine!

360
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,666
As Regalia, Ryoki! Come, Ryoki!

361
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,125
I don't understand.
Why is she a broken mirror?

362
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,375
Once it has been torn,
the unfortunate spirit

363
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,625
cannot become a proper Regalia.

364
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,041
[TSUGUHA]
Oh.

365
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,375
[KINUHA] That's part of
the reason she goes

366
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,875
out of her way to save them.

367
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,125
[TSUGUHA]
Wow. She's such a kind god.

368
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,000
[BIRD PHANTOM 1J roars]

369
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,958
Look out, my lady!

370
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,166
[KURAHA roars]

371
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,750
[BISHAMON]
Whenever you're ready.

372
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,875
[YUKINE]
I'm so sick of Yato's crap.

373
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,458
Always giving orders
without bothering

374
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,250
to listen to me or
ask how I feel. Ugh.

375
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,583
[STUDENT 1A]
No way! Are you serious?

376
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,791
[STUDENT 1B]
Yeah!

377
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,458
Come by my place if
you don't believe me.

378
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,958
[STUDENT 1A]
Okay, I will!

379
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,416
[STUDENT 1B] I'm telling you,
man, this game is killer.

380
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,458
[YUKINE sighs]

381
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,833
[SUZUHA]
Hey.

382
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,208
Hey. Don't ignore me, kid.

383
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,708
Huh?

384
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,416
Find someplace else to sit.
You're smashing the flowers.

385
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,958
Huh? U-Uh? Hold on a second.
Are you talking to me?

386
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,666
Who else would
I be talking to?

387
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,083
But, that means you
can see me, though.

388
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,416
How is that even possible?

389
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,416
You're a Regalia,
like me, aren't you?

390
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,958
Oh.

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,583
Small world, huh?

392
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,333
[BISHAMON]
Revert, Mine.

393
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,791
[MINEHA]
W-Where are we?

394
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,666
[KAZUMA]
You're in Takamagahara.

395
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,791
This is Lady Bishamon's manner.

396
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,666
[BISHAMON] And as of today,
this is where you live, as well.

397
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,458
Huh?

398
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,166
You are part of the
family now. Welcome home.

399
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,250
[REGALIAS laugh, cheer]

400
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,000
[BISHAMON]
From this day forward, Mineha,

401
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,458
you're one of us. I expect
everyone to treat her warmly.

402
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,208
[REGALIAS]
Yes, Lady Bishamon!

403
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,250
[whimpers]

404
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,625
Perhaps we ought
to have somebody

405
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,541
give you a little tour
of the manor. Anybody?

406
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,250
[TSUGUHA]
Sure! I'll do it.

407
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,458
Tsuguha.

408
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,083
I'm still new enough
that getting the chance

409
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,416
to explore the manor
is fun for me.

410
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,416
[BISHAMON]
I see. Well, thank you.

411
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,916
[TSUGUHA]
Let's go!

412
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,583
[BISHAMON sighs]

413
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,791
[KAZUMA]
Are you all right?

414
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,916
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

415
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,500
This is all part
of being a master.

416
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,000
Regalia are former humans.

417
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:01,166
Although their flesh is gone,
their spirits remain.

418
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,625
Fear, suspicion,
envy, resentment.

419
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,125
They feel all these things.

420
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,458
And the pain of a Regalia

421
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,083
with a clouded mind is
also borne by its master.

422
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,000
You mean you've been stung?

423
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,083
I believe I told you
not to worry about me,

424
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:17,958
didn't I?

425
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,041
Let me worry a little, at least.

426
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,333
You have so many Regalia--
maybe it's time to slow down.

427
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,875
With each new
weapon you take on,

428
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,500
you endanger your
health that much more.

429
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,875
[BISHAMON]
Anyway, moving on.

430
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,583
What news is there on Yato?

431
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,916
Uh.

432
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,625
[BISHAMON]
Have you found him?

433
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,916
[KAZUMA]
No, not yet.

434
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,083
He's a god of calamity.

435
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,458
I can't let him live.

436
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,541
Yuck.

437
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,708
It's very bitter.

438
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,041
You should take it more slowly.

439
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:50,541
[knocking]

440
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,000
Enter.

441
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,875
Yes, Kugaha?

442
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,291
[KUGAHA] I've readied your
ritual bath, my lady.

443
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,291
[BISHAMON]
I appreciate it.

444
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,708
[KAZUMA]
If you will excuse me, then.

445
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,250
[sighs]

446
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,833
[KUGAHA]
You're looking quite pale today.

447
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,916
Shall I prepare
a medicinal bath?

448
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,041
[BISHAMON]
Please.

449
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,333
[KUGAHA]
Lady Bishamon.

450
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,041
[BISHAMON]
What is it?

451
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,625
[KUGAHA] I've heard a rumor
that I find rather troubling.

452
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,083
Some time back,
Kazuma left the manor

453
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,708
following a meeting
without informing

454
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,708
anyone he was doing so.

455
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,000
Perhaps you recall the occasion?

456
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,375
Yes. I do remember
that happening.

457
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,000
[KUGAHA]
The rumor I spoke of concerns

458
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,333
where he went that day.

459
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,750
[KUGAHA]
An ablution ritual.

460
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,458
That was apparently held
by the calamity god, Yato.

461
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,541
[laughs] Absurd.

462
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:52,625
Yes, of course it is.
What a ridiculous idea.

463
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,041
[KOFUKU]
Uh-huh. Yeah, sure. Okay!

464
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:00,583
I'll let him know
for you. Hey, Yatty!

465
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,791
That was Yukki calling.

466
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,583
He says he'll be
back a little late.

467
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,791
Huh?

468
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,166
That darn kid is always
goin' off someplace.

469
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,208
And it's not very long
before dark, either.

470
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,708
[HIYORI]
Yato.

471
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,000
Could you do me a favor

472
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,041
and give this homework
to Yukine for me?

473
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,708
I've labeled a few assignments
he still needs to do.

474
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,458
Sure, but does that
mean you're leaving?

475
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,416
Yes. I need to get home.

476
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,875
I've still got some prep
to do for tomorrow.

477
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,416
So, uh, Hiyori.

478
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,625
Have you seen those new
Four-Cheese Melty Buns

479
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,958
by any chance? They sure
look tasty, don't they?

480
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,166
--Huh?
--[YATO] Mm-mm!

481
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,791
They're the kind of
thing you have to try

482
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,041
before they're gone forever.

483
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,666
You know what I'm talking about!

484
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,958
Yeah. I'll look into it for you.

485
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,458
Cheese bun, score!

486
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,708
You haven't forgotten
what you're

487
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,791
supposed to be doing
for me, have you?

488
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,041
Huh?

489
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,041
I hired you to fix that
little issue I'm having.

490
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,250
You know, how my soul
slips out of my body!

491
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,833
You said you'd take
care of it, remember?

492
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,083
You even took my five-yen coin!

493
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,666
[YATO] Oh, yeah. I'm on it!
Totally! No worries.

494
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,833
[HIYORI]
You made me a promise, Yato!

495
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,666
You'd better find
a way to fix me.

496
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm sticking with
you till you do.

497
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,541
[gasps]

498
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,375
[HIYORI]
Well, see you tomorrow!

499
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,000
Tomorrow, then.

500
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,250
[YUKINE, SUZUHA laughing]

501
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,666
Your name's cool. I like it.

502
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,791
Yeah? Thanks.

503
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,791
So, whose Regalia
are you, anyway?

504
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,125
His name's Yato.
He wears a tracksuit.

505
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,666
Yato, huh? Never heard of him.

506
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,541
He's such a minor god,
he might as well not exist.

507
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,500
And you?

508
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,958
Me?

509
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,250
Not bragging or anything,
but my god is totally major.

510
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,583
[YUKINE]
Yeah?

511
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,875
[SUZUHA] I serve one of
the Seven Gods of Fortune.

512
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,125
I'm Lady Bishamon's Regalia!

513
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,333
Ah--

514
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,500
Wow. Seriously?

515
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,041
Seriously!

516
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,125
[YATO]
Ya-ho! It's me, Yato!

517
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,333
A soon-to-be major god and
a snappy high school senior!

518
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,916
[HIYORI]
You? In high school?

519
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,166
[YATO] The tracksuit won't
be weird if I'm a student.
