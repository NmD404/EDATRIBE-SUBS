1
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:30,416
[water rushing]

2
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,541
[BISHAMON] From what I could
see, he was ailing badly.

3
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,416
I shouldn't have let
him go like that.

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,833
[water rushing]

5
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,166
[BISHAMON]
Kazuma.

6
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,416
[KAZUMA]
I am here.

7
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,083
[BISHAMON]
Come outside.

8
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,125
[blinds rolling]

9
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,166
[water rushing]

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,208
[BISHAMON]
Report.

11
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,583
[KAZUMA]
Yes.

12
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,916
Three days have passed
since the Vent was opened.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,708
With the help of affiliated
and unaffiliated shrines,

14
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,583
we have erected a barrier
that has halted its growth.

15
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,916
However, the Phantoms
that have already come out

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,083
will need
to be dealt with.

17
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,125
[BISHAMON] Have you
located Yato yet?

18
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,958
My Lady, I...

19
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,458
[BISHAMON]
Well? Yes?

20
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,250
We're alone here.
Speak your mind.

21
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,666
You really shouldn't leave
your hair wet like this.

22
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,125
You'll catch cold.

23
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,625
[BISHAMON sighs]

24
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,666
As you wish.

25
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,208
What kind of battle
was that, Lady?

26
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,375
[BISHAMON gasps]

27
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,458
[KAZUMA] You acted
on a personal grudge,

28
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,916
without thinking
about others.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,375
As a master it was completely
irresponsible, Veena.

30
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,416
[BISHAMON]
That's enough.

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,250
[water splashing]

32
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,500
[water dripping]

33
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,000
[BISHAMON] Dealing with
the fallout from the Vent

34
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,083
is our priority now.

35
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,916
It was my fault the
damn thing was opened.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,875
I am duty-bound to
exterminate those Phantoms.

37
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,750
Prepare to go hunting.

38
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,791
Now that is the
lady I follow.

39
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,166
[BISHAMON]
Kuraha! Kinuha! Yugiha!

40
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,583
Akiha! Karuha!
Kazuha! Tsuguha!

41
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,625
Let's go!

42
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,083
[knocking]

43
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,041
[HIYORI]
Yukine?

44
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,625
Are you awake yet?

45
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,291
[plastic rustling]

46
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,125
I brought breakfast,
so I hope you're hungry!

47
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,083
[YATO]
Thanks, Hiyori.

48
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,541
Sounds great.

49
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,958
[HIYORI shrieking]
What the--?

50
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,875
What are you
doing here, Yato?

51
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,208
You weren't invited!
Where's Yukine?

52
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,250
[YATO]
Oh, he ran away.

53
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,375
He's probably over
at Tenjin's place.

54
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,416
[HIYORI] He ran away,
and you didn't stop him?

55
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,875
Why would I?

56
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,083
It's not like I need
him right now, anyway.

57
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,583
[HIYORI grunts]

58
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,750
[plastic rustling]

59
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,000
[chip crunches]

60
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,958
[footsteps tapping]
HIYORI panting]

61
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,458
[HIYORI shrieks]

62
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,500
[TENJIN] Ah, hello
there, dear.

63
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,083
[HIYORI]
Hi, Lord Tenjin!

64
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,333
[TENJIN] Whatever
is the matter?

65
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,208
Having school
troubles?

66
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,333
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,833
I'm looking
for Yukine.

68
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,375
Ah. I saw him.

69
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,541
He came by
this morning.

70
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,958
[YUKINE] I'd like to work
for you instead of Yato.

71
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,000
Can I do that?

72
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,333
[TENJIN] 
Hm.

73
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,208
[MAYU] So, the new kid only
lasted a month, huh?

74
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,375
[AYU] That doesn't
seem like long.

75
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,791
How long were you
Lord Yato's Regalia?

76
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:58,666
[MAYU]
Three whole months.

77
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,625
[MIYU]
Wow!

78
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,666
I don't know how you did it!

79
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,958
[MOYU]
No way I'd be able to.

80
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,125
[NAYU] That sounds
impossible.

81
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,750
That's enough,
ladies.

82
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,416
It does seem early
to have decided

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,833
you no longer want
Lord Yato as your master.

84
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,875
Is there
a specific reason?

85
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,291
I can't stand the guy.
Isn't that enough?

86
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,958
He doesn't have
a shrine, he's broke,

87
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,375
he's obnoxious, he has
a screwed-up past.

88
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:22,333
And besides, he already
has a Regalia.

89
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,875
So, there you go.

90
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,500
Why should I waste time hanging
around with a guy like that?

91
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,125
[TENJIN]
Hm.

92
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,541
While I'm flattered
and delighted

93
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,916
you would ask for my help,

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,500
I fear it wouldn't be
appropriate for me to agree.

95
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,625
You wouldn't want me

96
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,208
to give you a name
right now, child.

97
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,666
Doing that would make
you a Nora, you see.

98
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,333
[HIYORI]
Nora.

99
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,291
Sorry, but what does
that mean, exactly?

100
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,666
Until now I thought it
was just someone's name.

101
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,250
How should
I explain?

102
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,666
Noras are embarrassing.

103
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,208
Private parts of a god's
life, you know.

104
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,833
Get it?
Private parts.

105
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:58,666
Huh?

106
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,333
[TENJIN giggling]

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
[TSUYU]
My lord.

108
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,708
Perhaps you should
restrain yourself.

109
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,500
[TENJIN] It's only a figure
of speech, Tsuyu.

110
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm not trying to
scandalize the girl!

111
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,041
[TENJIN coughs]

112
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,458
What is a Nora?

113
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,000
A Nora is a Regalia
with many owners.

114
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,375
Not unlike a stray
cat, for comparison.

115
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,333
But those who choose
to go by many names

116
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,916
are seen as less reliable

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,083
and more likely to
betray their masters.

118
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,666
As such, they are looked
down upon, despised.

119
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,083
[HIYORI grunts]

120
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,333
Think of
it his way.

121
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,250
What if I offered
to become your godfather?

122
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,458
I'll give you a pretty
new name and everything.

123
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,333
It'll be fun.

124
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,250
I would make
a great godparent!

125
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,333
Huh?

126
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,750
[TENJIN] Now, what
would be a good name?

127
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,833
Yumi, maybe?
Or Tomo? Yuko?

128
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,750
Um, thanks
a lot, but no.

129
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,125
See?

130
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,125
It feels disrespectful,
even a bit wrong, doesn't it?

131
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,500
Yeah...

132
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,041
The kind of idea that people
instinctively recoil from.

133
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,791
And that's how
Noras are seen.

134
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,666
Why they are regarded
with such hate.

135
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,666
They're that bad?

136
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,916
[water drips]

137
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,833
Oh, yes.

138
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,250
Normally, a Regalia has but one
name and serves only one master.

139
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,166
[TENJIN] It is commonly accepted
that to serve a new master,

140
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,208
one must first be "unnamed"
by the previous master.

141
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,333
Just as
Mayu was.

142
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,666
[HIYORI] If they're so reviled,
why do Noras even exist?

143
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,000
For unsavory
tasks.

144
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,875
To put it another way, they're
generally used to perform jobs

145
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,375
you wouldn't give
to your own Regalias.

146
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,041
[HIYORI gasps]

147
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,500
[HIYORI] Um...
Lord Tenjin.

148
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,541
I wonder if you know a girl
Nora I met a little while ago.

149
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,125
About the same age
as Yukine, I think--

150
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,041
[MAYU]
Please, that's enough.

151
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,208
We don't like
to talk about Noras.

152
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,416
[TSUYU] The very mention of them
sends shivers down our spines.

153
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,958
[HIYORI]
Oh.

154
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,958
[TSUYU] Though my lord does
seem to speak freely of them.

155
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,833
[TENJIN chuckling]
No need to worry.

156
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,958
I've never made use of one
before, nor do I intend to.

157
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,708
I have no wish
to entangle myself

158
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,833
with such wretched
creatures as Noras.

159
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:03,875
[water dripping]

160
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,125
[YATO groans]

161
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,166
[water drips]

162
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,833
[water rushing]

163
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:14,083
[NORA] Don't forget that you
can always use me.

164
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,541
[YATO]
Nora.

165
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,333
I've never stopped watching
you in all this time,

166
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,166
and yet you never
call for me anymore.

167
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,791
I've been so lonely.

168
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,458
[water bubbling]

169
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,333
That new boy
is unstable.

170
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,125
You should just
get rid of him.

171
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,291
[water bubbling]

172
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,958
[clothes rustling]

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,833
It's not like you
don't have options.

174
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:38,708
I can be useful.

175
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,625
Much more useful than he can.

176
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,291
[clothes rustling]

177
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,125
[HIYORI]
I've looked all over.

178
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,791
Where is he?

179
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,875
[HIYORI gasps]

180
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,583
I smell someone,
but it isn't Yato.

181
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,958
[HIYORI gasps]

182
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,875
[HIYORI]
It's Bishamon!

00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,541
[HIYORI whimpering]

184
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,125
[HIYORI gasps]

185
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,291
That confirms it.
You can see us.

186
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,708
[HIYORI] You're one
of Bishamon's people!

187
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,041
And you're that strange
living spirit.

188
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,916
The half-Phantom
from before.

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,208
Yato has many
odd acquaintances.

190
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,083
I don't know why
I'm surprised.

191
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,625
[HIYORI]
I'm going to die!

192
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,791
[HIYORI grunts]

193
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,125
[HIYORI panting]

194
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,208
Restraint.

[chains clanging]

196
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,541
[HIYORI gasps]

197
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,750
[HIYORI] I can't
move a single inch.

198
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,000
[KAZUMA]
Umbra.

199
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,458
[HIYORI whimpering]

200
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,875
[HIYORI gasps]
[lion roaring]

201
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,541
[HIYORI]
Okay. Okay.

202
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,833
Maybe a god will
come to my rescue.

203
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,833
Aaahh! Yep!
I'm totally dead!

204
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,041
[BISHAMON]
Progress?

205
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,875
Do you have a location
on the next Phantom?

206
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,333
[KAZUMA]
No.

207
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,833
[KURAHA] There aren't
any here, milady.

208
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,208
Or none that I can
smell, anyway.

209
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,916
Kuraha's correct.

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,708
We have pretty much cleared
out this entire area.

211
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,583
All that remains is the
south-southeast region.

212
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,333
Oh?

213
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,708
[HIYORI]
Wait a sec.

214
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,166
They don't even
realize I'm here?

215
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,500
[BISHAMON] It's a bit soon,
but let's try widening the area.

216
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,041
[KAZUMA]
Indeed.

217
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,375
I'll catch up with you once
I've conducted one final search.

218
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,916
[BISHAMON]
Very well, then.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,166
I'm sorry, Kuraha.

220
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,250
I know your wounds
haven't healed yet.

221
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,458
[KURAHA]
Don't worry, milady.

222
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,125
This is nothing.

223
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,166
Look after her.
I'll follow soon.

224
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,041
[KURAHA roaring]
Right!

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,250
[HIYORI]
Interesting.

226
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,208
They're nothing like
Lord Tenjin or Kofuku.

227
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,166
They work as one big team.

228
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,541
I didn't know that was possible.

229
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,208
[KAZUMA] I wouldn't meddle
if I were you, Hiyori Iki.

230
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,041
It could
be dangerous.

231
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,333
[HIYORI gasps]

232
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,250
Hey!

233
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,041
How do you know
what my name is?

234
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,916
And, uh, what did
you just do to me?

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's a talent
of mine:

236
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,250
manipulating the
things around me.

237
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,958
It often comes in handy,
given my line of work.

238
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,500
Would you like
this back?

239
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,333
[HIYORI] Hey!
You have my wallet!

240
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,458
But when could
you have...?

241
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,708
[HIYORI grunts]

242
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,875
You should
be more careful.

243
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,083
If you cross paths with Bishamon
again, keep your head down,

244
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,375
or things could
go badly for you.

245
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,875
I still don't understand
why you helped me.

246
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,291
I was under the impression
you hated Yato.

247
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,791
[KAZUMA]
Make no mistake.

248
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,208
He is certainly
our enemy.

249
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,750
However...

250
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,791
I also owe him
a great deal.

251
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,166
Speaking of which,
is he doing alright?

252
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:03,916
[HIYORI]
Huh?

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,916
[KAZUMA]
He was blighted.

254
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,458
It looked
to be pretty severe.

255
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,458
It's that bad?

256
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,250
The blight's source
wasn't external.

257
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,291
It most likely came
from the inside.

258
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,958
Yato's Regalia.

259
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,375
"Sekki" in that
form, right?

260
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,416
It should be disposed
of as soon as possible.

261
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,375
[HIYORI gasps]

262
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,333
What do you mean?

263
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,916
There's nothing
to worry about!

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,250
Yukine's a good kid.

265
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,000
He used to be human!

266
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,541
Isn't killing Regalias
like killing people?

267
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,916
[KOFUKU]
It was a long time ago,

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,041
but Yatty did kill
a Regalia once.

269
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,041
He kills people,
too, sometimes.

270
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,958
[HIYORI gasps]

271
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:42,291
[KAZUMA] Something must
be done before it's too late.

272
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,541
If a Regalia
repeatedly does wrong.

273
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,541
Its master will
fall seriously ill.

274
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,500
[KAZUMA] If left untreated,
the pain will intensify.

275
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,291
The blight will spread
throughout the body,

276
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,166
growing ever worse.

277
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,625
[KAZUMA sighs]
Honestly.

278
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,333
Why is he even using
such a Regalia?

279
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,333
[HIYORI]
Huh?

280
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,041
You appear to be his
close companion.

281
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,291
Has he not mentioned
anything about it to you?

282
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,375
Uh, no,
he hasn't.

283
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,458
I know this may seem
an odd request.

284
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,125
But please look
after Yato.

285
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,375
I'd hate to lose
him like this.

286
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:22,791
Right.

287
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,583
I'll see what
I can do.

288
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,958
Yukine must
be dealt with.

289
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,666

happen soon...

This is an honest job
for an honest client.

to close its doors

How'd you even know
where I was, though?

341
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:22,750
Um... actually,
it's your sm...

342
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:23,750
Same thing
when we asked.

She won't
cough it up.

[YATO]
Well? Whatcha doin' here?

347
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,791
[DAIKOKU] We got a job
that's not our style.

348
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,500
So we were gonna see
if you wanted it.

349
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,958
You do want it,
don't you?

350
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,541
I guess
I could take it.

Hey, uh, you're looking
a little pale.

352
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,500
How do you feel?

[DAIKOKU]
Aw, man.

356
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,958
Couldn't afford dinner again?

[HIYORI gasps]

358
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,333
[YATO]
Yukine.

359
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,833
What'd you do this time?

360
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,541
What?

361
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,250
[change rattling]

362
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,125
[YUKINE] You don't really think
I stole money, do you?

363
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,791
That's messed up.

364
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,250
Oh, come on, man.

365
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,291
Even a god's given up on me.

366
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,541
Great.

367
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,375
[YUKINE] I was better off
being dead than working for you.

370
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,875
[DAIKOKU]
So Yato was right.

371
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,541
You did steal it.

372
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,000
[YUKINE panting]

373
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,958

Oh dear. That's bad.

[clothes rustling]

375
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,375
I'll take that
job, thanks.

376
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,291
You guys'll stay and look
after the shop, right?

377
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,291
[DAIKOKU]
Huh?

378
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,500
Wait! Get back here!

379
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,166
[KOFUKU]
That'll be 582 yen, please!

380
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,833
Thanks fer your business, sir.

381
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,291
[MAN shrieking]

382
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,541
[YATO] All
it says is to

383
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,750
"eliminate the Phantom that
has appeared above Kamiido."

384
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,666
That's a simple
enough job.

385
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,958
Yeah.

386
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,125
I'll bet branch shrines
are getting lots of these

387
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,958
types of requests since
the Vent was opened.

388
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,125
[HIYORI]
Yato.

389
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,375
About Yukine--

390
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,625
[YATO]
I'll find him.

391
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,291
Can't do much Phantom
slaying without a Regalia.

392
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,708
That's why you really gotta keep
track of the things, you know?

393
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,625
No. I wasn't asking--

394
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,250
I mean,
what I wanted--

395
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,500
How do I
say this?

396
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,791
[YATO] I know.
I get it.

397
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,125
This problem needs
to be put to rest.

398
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,375
[HIYORI gasps]

399
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,250

of as soon as possible.

00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,291
You've finally lost it,
haven't you?

Yato.

Uh, yeah?

412
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,208
Regalias
aren't tools.

413
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,750
"Gotta keep track
of the things"?

414

[YATO]
Huh?

415
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,708
Yukine isn't
some thing.

416
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,708
You have to treat
him like a person.

417
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,041
If you're not
willing to do that,

418
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,708
how can you expect
him to act like one?

419
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,958
Think about it, okay?

420
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,208
Sure. I will.

[NORA] You have such
pretty eyes for a boy.

424
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,208
They remind me of the fruit
on hawthorn plants.

425
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,083
You know.

426
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,541
Not even birds will eat
the hawthorn fruit.

[YUKINE gasps]

428
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,958
[NORA]
Not because of their taste.

429
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,208
They aren't
poisonous or anything.

430
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,000
They're just empty, is all.

431
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,041
Useless, empty fruit.

432
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,666
They offer nothing.

433
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,166
And of course nobody
bothers to pick them.

434
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,958
So they're left on the plant
to wilt, wither, and die

435

as pointlessly
as they lived.

On that.
