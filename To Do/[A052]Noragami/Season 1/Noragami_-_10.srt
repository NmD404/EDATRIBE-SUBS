00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,375
[YUKINE panting]

2
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,791
[DAIKOKU]
Yukine.

3
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,625
[DAIKOKU] Tend to the shop
once you're done in there.

4
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,291
[YUKINE]
'Kay!

5
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,583
[patting fabric]

6
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,333
[liquid flowing]

7
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,041
[slurping]

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,166
[YUKINE]
Nice.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,583
The oden's
ready now.

10
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,833
[DAIKOKU]
Great.

11
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,916
Glad to see you're off
to such a good start.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,875
[HIYORI]
Hey!

13
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:49,916
[HIYORI]
Good morning, you two.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
[YUKINE]
Hey!

15
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,625
Good to see you!

16
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,125
[HIYORI] So you really did pick
up a part-time job here, huh?

17
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,250
[YUKINE]
Well, it's just.

18
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,375
I need to.

19
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,000
I wanna pay back the
money I took, y'know?

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,750
Aw, Yukine.

21
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,750
[DAIKOKU] I may be
made out of stone,

22
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,125
but even I coundn't say
no when he told me that.

23
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,625
You were on the
wrong path,

24
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,458
but it looks like you've finally
staightened yourself out. 

25
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,250
Uh.

26
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, that is
part of it.

27
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,916
But it's also because
Yato doesn't ever

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,166
make any damn money! 

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,708
[YATO shrieking]

30
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,041
[DAIKOKU]
Oh, yeah.

31
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,125
Don't you have a favor you were
gonna ask Hiyori?

32
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,833
I said that wasn't
a big deal!

33
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,083
What is it?

34
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,666
Um, well, uh.

35
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,083
[DAIKOKU] You're getting set to
move onto a new grade, right?

36
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,958
He was hoping you
wouldn't mind passing

37
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:34,541
your old textbooks on to him if
you still have them around.

38
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,875
[DAIKOKU] He wants to start
acting like a normal kid again.

39
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,375
It's cool if you
don't want to-

40
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,083
[HIYORI sobbing]

41
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,750
Of course
I don't mind!

42
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,541
You can have
them all!

43
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,333
Huh?

44
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,500
[BOTH sobbing]

45
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,375
[YUKINE] What is wrong with
you guys lately?

46
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:49,750
[KOFUKU]
Oh, there you are!

47
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,625
[KOFUKU] I've been
looking for you two.

48
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:52,958
[KOFUKU] Just so
you don't forget.

49
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,541
You owe me 
money, too.

50
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,208
[YATO stuttering]
[HIYORI gasping]

51
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,250
[KOFUKU]
Oh, c'mon, Yori.

52
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,458
Don't tell me you
already forgot

53
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,666
that you asked us
to save Yatty for you.

54
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,125
Cuz we did the work.

55
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,583
And this is how
much we charge.

56
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,458
[HIYORI]
Five yen?

57
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,833
I can do that.

58
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:13,666
5 million, and we
did help you twice.

59
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,791
Ten million?

60
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,166
[KOFUKU] Oh, don't
you worry.

61
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,708
A girl as cute and smart
and capable as you are,

62
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,291
I'm sure you can earn that
amount it in no time at all.

63
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,958
[YATO]
Wait, Kofuku.

64
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,083
Hiyori's still
in school.

65
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,541
What about the
student discount?

66
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,166
Oh, good point.

67
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,958
So.

68
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,000
We'll call it
one million.

69
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,125
[YATO]
Good deal!

70
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,041
90 percent off!

71
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,000
That is one
serious bargain!

72
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,041
[YATO] And this is why
it pays to do business

73
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,000
[YATO]
with the god of poverty.

74
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,333
[HIYORI] You still haven't
even fixed my body yet!

75
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,958
And now you've
put me in debt?

76
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,666
[HIYORI]You will
help me pay this off!

77
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,333
[DAIKOKU] Man, what fighting
federation does she belong to?

78
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,291
[YATO]
Tenjin!

79
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,083
I wanted to drop by and say
thanks for your help!

80
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,541
[TENJIN] I heard you
really let yourself

81
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,666
get put through
the ringer. 

82
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,458
Yeah, I guess so.

83
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,000
[MAYU]
What, you guess so?

84
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,958
How could you ever let your
blight get that out of control?

85
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,958
Your Regalia had you
on the verge of death.

86
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,041
[YATO] Well, the Sekki
has incredible potential.

87
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,125
I couldn't just throw away
his talent like that.

88
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,333
And besides that, I wanted
to reforge him properly.

89
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,708
I intentionally let
my condition get that bad.

90
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,041
just to give him
a stern wake-up call.

91
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,000
[TENJIN]
Well.

92
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,625
I suppose I understand
your method.

93
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,375
Yeah,
but regardless.

94
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:01,500
You guys really saved
my butt, especially you, Tomone.

95
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,250
I guess we're
still friends.

96
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,833
That's Mayu for you.

97
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,750
She is a gutsy,
dependable girl.

98
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,333
All thanks to a certain
lowlife who took her in.

99
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,166
Well, I am one
hell of a teacher.

100
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,208
Oh, yes, and your method
follows the four Cs, I believe.

101
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,541
[TENJIN] Crass.
[HIYORI] Are they friends now?

102
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,625
[TENJIN] Childish.
[HIYORI] Are they friends now?

103
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,875
[TENJIN] Crude.
[YUKINE] I can't tell.

104
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:20,791
[TENJIN] And Clueless.
[YUKINE] I can't tell.

105
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:21,958
[MAYU] Come, come.
[YATO] No!

106
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,500
[MAYU] Why don't we 
[YATO] Cool, classy,

107
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,041
[MAYU] talk somewhere else?
[YATO] confident, and cultured!

108
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,166
[HIYORI]
Hey.

109
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:25,958
Aren't you missing
one of the Regalias?

110
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:30,291
I think her name was Miyu?

111
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,666
[MAYU]
Unfortunately.

112
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,166
She was kicked out
for stinging Lord Michizane.

113
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,833
[YUKINE]
She was corrupted?

114
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,750
[MAYU]
You see.

115
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,208
What happened
to you, Yukine,

116
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,708
is actually
very contagious.

117
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,375
Just seeing or hearing
about it can affect others.

118
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,250
[liquid splatters]

119
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,916
[MAYU] A single sting to a
master results in banishment.

120
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,083
[MAYU] Lord Michazane
has never once made an exception

121
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,458
[MAYU] to this rule.
[MIYU] I'm sorry!

122
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,208
[MAYU] To harm others
or yourself, [MIYU] I'm sorry!

123
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,416
[MAYU] whether intenional
or not,

124
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,666
is to betray the
master who named you.

125
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,458
Banishment is actually
seen as an act of generosity

126
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,625
after an ablution.

127
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,708
Because a new master
might take you in.

128
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,916
If you're lucky that is.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,583
Otherwise.

130
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,583
[YUKINE]
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,958
It's all my fault.

132
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,916
It simply
couldn't be helped.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,833
But please.

134
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,125
You mustn't let
this bother you,

135
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,041
no matter how upsetting
it may be.

136
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,708
It might have an effect
on Yato.

137
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,750
Believe me when
I tell you this, Yukine.

138
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,416
We understand
how you felt.

139
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,250
[MAYU] Regalias are
easily corrupted

140
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,708
if they don't maintain
their borderlines.

141
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,208
Ultimately, we're still
Far Shore beings

142
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,083
who dwell alongside
Phantoms.

143
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,458
You must be careful.

144
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,333
The darkness
is always with you.

145
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,083
[YUKINE]
The darkness.

146
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:02,125
[MAYU] Despite everything,
Yato refused to banish you.

147
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,291
And now
it's your turn.

148
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,166
Swear on your name.

149
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,833
to always protect him.

150
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,083
[YUKINE]
Of course.

151
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,750
I swear on my
name: Yuki.

152
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:13,833
[HIYORI giggling]

153
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,500
What's funny?

154
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,625
[YATO ]
By the way, Tenjin.

155
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,041
I could use some advice
if you've got it to give.

156
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,625
[TENJIN]
Hmm?

157
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,875
It actually has to do
with Hiyori.

158
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,208
Ya see, after
her accident, she kinda

159
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
slips in and out
of her spirit form.

160
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,666
[TENJIN]
Oh.

161
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,125
[YATO] The thing is, I accepted
her request to fix it;

162
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,333
which would be fine.

163
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,416
If I knew what
in the hell to do!

164
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,166
But I've just
kept on putting it off.

165
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,708
I've gotta do it,
though.

166
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,208
She's helped me out several
times now, so it's only right!

167
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,833
Now's the time to finally
tackle her job!

168
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,500
[TENJIN] It's remarkable how
much of a lost cause you are.

169
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,541
Have you considered maybe
cutting her ties with you?

170
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,791
Huh?

171
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,625
[TENJIN] It's just a guess,
but doing so might 

172
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,166
actually fix
her condition.

173
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,166
[YATO]
Wait, cut her ties?

174
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,291
[TENJIN] It seems to me that
the connection between you

175
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,416
grants her too much
of a focus on our world.

176
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,375
Try cutting that connection
as a test.

177
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,250
Shouldn't be hard
for you.

178
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,833
[AMI] Studying at the library's
so much better

179
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,250
than studying
at home.

180
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,291
[HIYORI]
No kidding.

181
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,041
[YAMA] Another day
of solid studying!

182
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,250
I'm feeling good!

183
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,750
[AMI] It can only do so much
with the exams we've got coming.

184
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,375
We really need to pick
a shrine to pray at.

185
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,166
Yeah!

186
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,416
We've gotta
pray to a god!

187
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,208
I wish to graduate
and be popular and be healthy

188
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,416
and be popular
and for my family to be safe!

189
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,333
You wished
to be popular twice.

190
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,958
Well, it's that
important.

191
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,541
[HIYORI giggling] That
sure is a lot of wishes.

192
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,583
Don't burden
the gods.

193
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,125
Isn't it pretty much
the gods' job

194
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,416
to hear people's
wishes, though?

195
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,750
I mean, why should I care
about their schedules?

196
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,000
Right.

197
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:44,875
Oh, yeah.

198
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,291
Speaking of wishes.

199
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,041
There's one god people
have been talking about lately.

200
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,333
Oh, yeah, I know.

201
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,000
Wait, which god?

202
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,208
They say that if you
tell him the name

203
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,666
of someone you
want gone,

204
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,208
he'll actually make them
disappear for you.

205
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,708
"Lord Rabo,
Lord Rabo.

206
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,125
I humbly beg of you!"
That's it, right?

207
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,416
[AMI]
That's how it goes.

208
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,375
His name's Rabo?

209
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,416
[HIYORI] That's the first I've
ever heard of that god.

210
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,708
[YAMA]
It's just a dumb fad.

211
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,958
[AMI]
Exactly.

212
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,416
What's with the school
books, Hiyori?

213
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,041
Yeah, those
are our old ones.

214
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,083
What are you luggin'
those around for?

215
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,750
I'm giving them
to a friend of mine.

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,291
[DAIKOKU]
What's up, kids!

217
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,750
You workin' hard in here?

218
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,625
[YATO]
Daikoku!

219
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,958
I'll take one of
those snacks!

220
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,458
[DAIKOKU] What the hell
are you doing in our home?

221
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,291
[YATO]
Oh, c'mon, man.

222
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,416
Don't be so cold.

223
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,875
[DAIKOKU] This room
is for Yukine!

224
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,583
Not your lazy ass!

225
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,083
Go suck on some tea leaves
if you're hungry!

226
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,000
[DAIKOKU] Jeez.
[YATO groaning]

227
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,041
[HIYORI]
It's still not right.

228
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,708
Do it again.

229
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:42,958
[YUKINE]
Hiyori.

230
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,125
You're kind of strict.

231
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,583
[HIYORI] It's easy to mess up
this part and this part.

232
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,500
Try to stay
focused.

233
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,458
Okay.

234
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,125
[YATO]
Hold on!

235
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,333
Let me see.

236
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,541
The real trick
to learning.

237
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,958
You've gotta
draw the stuff!

238
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:55,875
[YATO]
There!

239
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,041
The Pillow Book's

00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,125
Hojoki's Kamo-no-Chomei.

241
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,000
and Tsurezuregusa's
Yoshida Kenko.

242
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,291
[BOTH]
You're good!

243
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,291
I know,
it's impressive.

244
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,458
It took work.

245
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,375
But with as long as I've
been a god, it ju--

246
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,458
[YUKINE]
Don't ruin my stuff!

247
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,291
I didn't ruin it!

248
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,458
I graced it
with my talent!

249
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,500
Why don't you
use that talent

250
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,125
to earn some money
for a change!

251
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,958
[YUKINE] Why have you always
gotta butt in, huh?

252
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,625
[YATO] What's
that supposed to mean?

253
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,083
[HIYORI]
What's wrong?

254
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:21,750
Uh. Nothing.

255
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,333
Don't worry about it.

256
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,125
[HIYORI'S MOM] Hiyori!
Could you add the black beans

257
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,833
[HIYORI'S MOM] to these for me?
[HIYORI] Okay!

00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,416
[FEMALE NEWS BROADCASTER]
The person responsible for 

259
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,958
the street slashings yesterday
morning has yet to be found. 

260
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,375
Despite having taken place in
plain sight of others, no --

261
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,583
[HIYORI'S MOM] There've been a
lot of stories 

262
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,000
about this slasher on the news
lately. 

263
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,000
I know it's New Year's but--

264
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,000
I wish you'd stay home tonight.

265
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,416
[HIYORI]
It's just a shrine visit.

266
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,250
And I'll have
Yama and Ami with me.

267
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,375

I still can't help but worry.

271
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,500
[YUKINE] I can't believe
you took a dumb job like this 

272
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,166
on New Year's Eve
of all nights.

273
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,458
[YATO] Hey, you gotta take
the work when the work comes.

274
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,625
And end-of-year cleaning
can be pretty lucrative.

275
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,875
But I've gotta ask.

276
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,333
Does a dog really need
its own mansion?

00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,375
[YUKINE]
I know, it's huge!

No way!

a heated floor!

be wasteful.

345
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,625
That's not why
I'm wearing it!

346
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,333
So...

347
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,541
I uh...

348
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,916
I wanted to let
you guys know

349
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,625
that someone might
join us later.

350
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,375
If that's cool.

[YAMA shrieking]
What?

352
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:40,916
Is it a guy?

353
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,416
Is that why
you're dressed up?

354
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,416
[AMI]
Hm!

355
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,833
So you're scheming
to win his heart

356
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,041
by convincing him you're
a different person this year?

357
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:47,875
[HIYORI]
Huh, no!

358
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,958
I swear
it's not like that!

359
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,208
[YAMA] You've got some serious
ambition for the new year.

360
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,583
Full blast
out of the gate.

361

you, it's not like that!

371
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,458
I used to visit shrines

[AMI]
Hey, Hiyori.

377
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,166
You gonna buy some?

[HIYORI]
Oh--

[YUKINE] I can't believe we
missed ringing in the new year

389
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,083
just to clean
a dog mansion.

390
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,750
[YATO] You
have no work ethic!

391
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,500
If I get hired to clean, I'm not
leaving until the job is done!

392
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,791
I just hope Hiyori

Hey, wait, according

I am the god Yato.

412
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,916
I now lay thee waste
with the Sekki.

413
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,916
And expel thy

Stay calm, Yukine.

That was the perfect
chance to revoke his name.

squandered it.

You want to know why?

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,208
Stop existing.

524
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,458
[YATO grunts]

525
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,250
[YATO]
C'mon, come get me!

526
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,250
[YATO grunting]
[sword slashing]

527
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,291
[YATO grunting]

528
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,291
[YUKINE]
Alright.

529
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,791
You've got 'em all rounded up.

530
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,041
[YATO]
That's right.

531
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,833
Now show me the power
of your ragged heart.

532
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,000
Let your rage out.

533
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,500
The same rage that drove you

534
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,291
to break those school windows
and hurt all you touched!

535
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:01,791
[YUKINE]
Fine! Okay! 

536
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,041
Shut up!

537
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,333
[YATO] Harness that rage
and we'll take 'em out!

538
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,333
[chime rings]

539
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,250
This is the land
of the Rising Sun.

540
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,833
Your desecrations
shall not be allowed.

541
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:12,583
Hear me.

542
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,250
I am the god Yato.

543
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,000
I now lay thee waste
with the Sekki.

544
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,916
And expel thy
vast defilement!

545
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,041
I cleanse thee!

546
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:22,875
Rend!

547
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,625
[sword slashing]

548
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,500
[phantoms exploding]

549
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,458
[twinkling]

550
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,708
[YATO sighs]

551
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,291
[phantom grunts]

552
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,500
[phantom groans]

553
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,958
[twinkling]

554
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,791
[YATO] And that's all
there is to it.

555
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,458
Well done.

556
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,875
[YATO]
Now let's go find Hiyori!

557
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:44,750
[YUKINE]
Yeah!

558
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,875
I can't wait!

559
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,041
[YATO singing]
Candied fruit!

560
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,541
Candied fruit!

561
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,583
I'm gonna buy candied fruit
with Hiyori's money-- what the?

562
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,875
[YUKINE] Don't you
owe her enough?

563
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,291
[phantoms whining]

564
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,541
[jar shattering]

565
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,791
[RABO]
That's it?

566
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,041
That's Yato's strength now?

567
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,083
That's what he's become?

568
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:07,083
[YAMA] Please don't pass out
while walking home, alright?

569
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,125
[HIYORI giggling]
I'll be okay.

570
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,083
[YATO]
Hiyori!

571
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,458
[YUKINE] Hey, happy new year,
sorry we're so late.

572
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,250
[YATO]
Happy New Year!

573
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,125
Whoa, hold on.

574
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,666
You're not goin' home,
are ya?

575
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,083
C'mon, the food stalls
are still open, let's go!

576
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,916
It'll be the first
food offering of the year!

577
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,083
Unless.

578
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,708
You'd rather make
your first money offering.

579
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,375
[HIYORI]
Uh...

580
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,750
Huh?

581
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,625
I um.

582
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,416
Somethin' wrong,
Hiyori?

583
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,541
Do we know
each other?

584
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,416
Who are you?

585
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,291
[cars driving]

586
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,208
[KAZUMA] What's wrong, Veena?
Have you caught a cold-

587
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,208
[KAZUMA sneezes]

588
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,458
[BISHAMON]
Actually, it looks like

589
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,375
I'm not the only one sneezing
here, Kazuma. 

590
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,791
[KAZUMA] Next time on Noragami:
"Abandoned God"

591
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,416
Huh? Are these hairballs?

592
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,416
[BISHAMON] Oh, Kuraha must
be shedding.
