Say something!

180
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,458
[FEMALE BYSTANDER 1A]
Is she still breathing?

181
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,666
[MALE BYSTANDER 1C]
I called for an ambulance.

182
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,583
[HIYORI]
Huh?

183
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,541
Huh?!

184
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,625
Huh?

185
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,750
Huh?!

186
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,083
[ambulence siren wailing]

187
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,000
[HIYORI'S MOM]
Hiyori?

188
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,625
Please be okay!

189
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,500
Hiyori!

190
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,000
Her eyes are opening!

191
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,208
[HIYORI'S DAD]
Thank goodness you're awake!

192
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,208
We were so worried!

193
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,125
How do you feel?

194
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,333
Are you in pain?

195
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't just stand there,
dear, examine her!

196
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,583
Oh, of course!

197
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,791
Good, everything
looks normal.

198
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:27,583
[GIRLS and MOM sigh]

199
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,833
[GIRLS]
Unbelievable!

200
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,041
So I'm okay, Dad?

201
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,750
Well, your CAT scan
looked just fine,

202
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,750
and your EEG
appears normal, too.

203
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,458
Considering you
were hit by a bus,

204
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,583
it's a miracle you only
wound up with a few scratches.

205
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,291
A bus hit me?

206
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,166
Whatever the tests say,
I'm still worried.

207
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,291
If anything should happen
to our precious Hiyori.

208
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,375
We should keep her here
for observation.

209
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,875
It is our hospital.

210
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,250
Come, now, dear.

211
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,166
There's a list of patients
waiting to be admitted.

212
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,416
Even so.

213
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,458
[HIYORI]
What about the other guy?

214
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,625
What happened to him?

215
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,833
Yeah another person.

216
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,375
I think I saw someone.

217
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,250
What?

218
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,916
Nobody else was there, though.

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,375
Hiyori was just suddenly
lying in the street.

220
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,541
Are you sure?

221
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,333
[HIYORI's dad] You've
been through a trauma.

222
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,500
Maybe your memory's
still a bit hazy.

223
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:16,458
I'm sure there
was somebody there!

224
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,958
[HIYORI's MOM]
Oh, my poor dear.

225
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,500
You must be exhausted.

226
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,333
Why don't you get some rest?

227
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,541
[HIYORI thinking]
He was there.

228
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,541
He was.

229
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,250
I'm sure of it,
and there's more.

230
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,375
I remember.

231
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,791
Another me, like
I was outside my body.

232
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,541
[MALE VOICE 1A]
I don't want to die.

233
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,833
It's not fair!

234
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,500
[MALE VOICE 1B]
Where is she?

235
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,250
[FEMALE VOICE 1A]
Please let me see him!

236
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,958
[GIRL VOICE 1A] When will I get
to leave? I hate it here!

237
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:04,458
[GIRL VOICE 1B]
I'm really scared... Mommy!

238
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,791
[GIRL VOICE 1B]
It hurts.

239
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,250
It hurts so much!

240
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,666
[GIRL VOICE 1B] Please
just make it stop hurting!

241
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,166
[FEMALE VOICE 1C] We can leave
when you're all better, okay?

242
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,333
[Hiyori thinking]
These voices.

243
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,291
What are they?

244
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,833
[GIRL VOICE 1A]
I can't breathe!

245
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,416
[GIRL VOICE 1B]
It hurts, Mommy!

246
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,750
[FEMALE VOICE 1B] I just want
to go outside for a little bit.

247
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,916
[MALE VOICE 1A]
It's hopeless.

248
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,875
[YATO] You hear the
voices of the Far Shore?

249
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:41,875
[HIYARI screams]

250
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,833
Doesn't look like you
got hurt too bad, huh?

251
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,625
[HIYARI] The guy
from earlier!

252
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,708
Thanks for that,
by the way.

253
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,875
'Course, I didn't need
help avoiding that bus,

254
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,041
but no human has ever
tried to save me before.

255
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:57,750
I don't get it.

256
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,625
Who are you?

257
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,708
That's easy.
I'm a god.

258
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,416
Hello, police?

259
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
There's an intruder
in my hospital room.

260
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,708
I think he
might be crazy.

261
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,750
He says he's a god--

262
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,125
Wait, hang up the phone!
I'm not crazy.

263
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,125
I really am one
of the gods, okay?

264
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,416
I am the god Yato.

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,041
A god called Yato?

266
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,208
What are
you playing at?

267
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,500
I've never heard
of that god.

268
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,041
Not once in
my whole life!

[YATO exhales]

271
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,541
Well, that's understandable.

272
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,458
I'm still what you might
call an up-and-comer.

world will know my name!

highest god in the land!

It's gonna be
real stormy tonight.

This place is already
crawling with 'em,

and I'm Regalia-less,
so I can't stick around.

288
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,875
Somebody else is
already using Nora tonight.

Hey! That's one of
my get-well gifts!

290
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,375
By the way,
what's your name?

291
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,791
Uh, it's Hiyori.

Hiyori Iki, huh?

295
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,541
I came to make
sure you're okay,

296
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,041
and you seem to be just fine.

297
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,125
So, we're even now.

298
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,791
Huh?

299
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,625
See ya!

300
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,291
Wait!

301
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,791
[HIYORI thinking]
My body feels so heavy...

302
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,208
Can't stay awake...

00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,708

[AMI]
Hiyori!

00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,875
Ami! Yama!

306
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,958
Hey, you guys!

307
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,041
[YAMA] So, you're
all healed up, then?

308
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:56,625
Yep!

309
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,541
You scared us!

310
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,916
Glad you didn't
die or anything.

311
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,125
I'll try never to
do it again, I swear.

312
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,041
Yeah, stay away
from buses from now on.

313
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,666
Or you'll see my version
of a Jungle Savate!

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,666
I bet she wouldn't mind

315
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,291
a good smack
from her dear Tono!

316
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,208
You're probably right!

317
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,500
Whoa, hey,
easy there!

318
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,083
Whoops. I'm sorry.

319
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,208
I've just started getting these
sudden attacks of drowsiness.

320
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,333
Huh?

321
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,791
Don't stay up so late
playing video games.

322
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,083
[HIYORI laughs uncomfortably]

323
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,583
[HIYORI thinking] I don't know,
maybe it was just a dream.

324
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,166
[HIYORI sighs]

325
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,333
It felt so real,
that night in the hospital.

326
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,458
I could have
sworn I met somebody.

327
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:41,541
[whistle blowing]

328
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,375
Tracksuits...

329
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,000
[AMI] You sure
you're okay, Hiyori?

330
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,083
[YAMA] Yeah,
what's going on?

331
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,791
You've been kinda
out of it all day.

332
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,625
[HIYORI] Sorry, like I said
before, I'm just sleepy.

333
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,541
Maybe you should
still be in the hospital.

334
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,583
It hasn't been long
since the accident.

335
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,125
What is it?

336
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,708
Why'd you stop?

337
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,833
[AMI] Hmm? Oh,
that cat again?

338
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,833
[HIYORI thinking]
That's right.

339
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,000
That day, there
was some strange guy

340
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,750
in a tracksuit chasing a cat.

341
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,375
Milord, where are you?

342
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,666
I'm sorry, you guys.

343
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,583
Go on without me.

344
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,500
Huh?

345
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,250
[AMI and YAMA]
Huh?

346
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,458
[HIYORI]
I shall stay.

347
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,541
I must endeavor to
locate Milord forthwith.

348
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,625
What?

349
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,333
[AMI and YAMA]
What?

350
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,208
[HIYORI]
Come here, Milord!

351
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,250
Who's a good kitty?

352
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,000
That's not him.

353
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,666
Not there, either.

354
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,541
Milord, where are you hiding?

[HIYORI thinking]
If I can just find the cat,

356
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,583
maybe it'll trigger
a buried memory.

[HIYORI yelling]
Milord! Here, boy!

358

Come on out now, kitty!

Come on!

367
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,291

00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,916
Better find him fast.

Hold on, just stay there!

377
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,083

Smells nice...

382
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,791
Just small ones,
but there are too many of them.

The numbers aren't
on my side, here!

You provoked them,
didn't you?

385
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,416

[HIYORI] I'm glad I was able
to track you down, Yato.

but you just
suddenly ran off on me.

Does this mean
that I'm dead?

That's not it exactly.

That has to be it.

What's going on with me?

I don't understand
any of this.

468
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,041
It must be a result
of the accident.

469
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,583
There's the Near Shore,
where the living reside,

470
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,791
then there's the Far Shore.

471
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,583
Somehow or other, you've wound
up in the divide between them.

and the Far Shore?

Yeah.

00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,750
As for the Far Shore,
what would you humans call it?

See, you're still
technically alive,

477
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,833
but you're also a Phantom.

What's a Phantom?

479
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,166
Basically, they're incarnations
of emotional energy.

480
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,041
They possess people
and cause a lot of trouble.

mean I'm like that thing?

Well, no, not
exactly like it.

486
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,083
Actually, I'd describe
you more as "on the fence."

487
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,333
And that means what?

488
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:47,000
All this is
way over my head!

489
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,416
Well, for one thing, you'll
probably lose your body a lot.

Okay, and how do
I make that stop?

00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,333
Well... I'm not
sure you can.

00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,958
This is just
the way you are now.

493
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:58,958
Best accept it.

Accept it?

You keep on saying
you're a god, right?

So help me!

500
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,500
All right. Pay up.

501
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,458

502
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,666
Of course we do!

503
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,666
Nobody's gonna
grant a wish for nothing!

rate for one wish.

I can't afford that much!

Tch. Stupid mortal.

I am a god, you know?

509
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,708
And what do you offer
when you petition the gods?

510
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,416
That's right!

511
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,291

00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,500
What? 5?

513
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,000
Uh, okay.

514
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,500
You have made a wish,

515
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,125
and it's been heard,
loud and clear!

may our fates intertwine.

come up with a new chant
for litter-bearers.

[HIYORI] Why won't the
regular old "heave-ho" work?

521
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,041
Instead of "heave-ho"
let's go with "ya-ho."

522
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,125
Next time on Noragami:
"Snow-like."

Remember, it's
"Ya-ho, Yato!"
