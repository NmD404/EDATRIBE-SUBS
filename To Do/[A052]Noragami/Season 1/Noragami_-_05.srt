1
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,958
See! Here we have
a little Phantom.

2
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,375
[PHANTOM squealing]

3
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,125
[BOTH gasp]

4
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,666
What are you
doing, Yato?

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,958
[YATO] Good! We want
that reaction.

6
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,875
Hate and fear will help
you draw a borderline.

7
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,416
[YUKINE]
And what's that?

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,375
[YATO] A borderline is what
serves as a Regalia's shield.

9
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,916
It's also his
only weapon.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,083
Now, then.

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,041
You did some pretty nice
work the other day.

12
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,750
I think you're
ready for this.

13
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:45,750
Humph!

14
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,458
Flattery won't get
you anywhere.

15
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,333
[HIYORI giggles]

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,375
It's real simple.

17
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,291
Make your fingers
into a halberd.

18
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,791
Then use them to draw a line
like this between you and it.

19
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,333
[PHANTOM squealing]

20
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,791
Uh, okay.

21
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:01,625
[YUKINE]
Here goes!

22
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,250
[PHANTOM shrieking]

23
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,291
Amazing!

24
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,250
So that's what you
were talking about?

25
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,916
[YATO]
Yep. Useful stuff.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,291
Phantoms can't cross it.

27
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,291
It acts as a boundary between
"self" and "other."

28
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,375
[HIYORI] Is it something
you can do, too?

29
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,416
Or-or even me?

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,458
No. You and I
can't do this.

31
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,000
Borderlines are
a Regalia power.

32
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,125
Any Regalia should
be able to make one.

33
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:28,750
But creating one that's this
strong without practice...

34
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,166
[YATO] I've never known
a Regalia who could do that.

35
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,166
It's a first.

36
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,750
[YUKINE gasps]

37
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,541
[HIYORI] Speaking of
the Regalias that he knows...

38
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,000
[water drips]

39
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:41,916
So, um.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,708
That girl we ran into
down by the water. Nora?

41
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,458
She's a Regalia, too?

42
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,416
Oh, Nora, huh?

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,333
[YATO]
How to put it...

44
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,333
I guess you could call
her a friend with benefits.

45
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,583
Eh...

46
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,083
I've decided that I'm
going to look after Yukine.

47
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,458
[BOTH] Huh?

48
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,750
[YATO] You are?
That's crazy.

49
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,958
He can't stay with you.
It would never work.

50
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,166
[HIYORI] It makes
more sense

51
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,458
for him to stay with
me than with you.

52
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,958
You don't have
a place to live

53
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,333
or what even resembles
any sort of stable life.

54
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,458
It's all ex-girlfriends,
affairs,

55
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,916
and friends
with benefits.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,625
You're depraved,
irresponsible,

57
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,208
and unfit to be
anyone's guardian!

58
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,541
[YATO groaning]

59
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,666
Yukine is obviously
better off in my care.

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,166
You'll just corrupt him!

61
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,458
[YUKINE gasps]

62
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,458
Get away
from her!

63
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,458
Stop that!

64
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,000
What are you doing
to the poor thing?

65
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,375
[YUKINE gasps]

66
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,833
[YATO]
Ahh! Come on!

67
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,708
I'm getting stung
like crazy here!

68
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,541
[HIYORI] Quit it! Can't you
see you're hurting him?

69
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,458
You're gonna pull his arm
out of the socket!

70
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,208
[YATO] You think he's
hurting, look at me!

71
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,791
I'm getting seriously stung!

72
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,666
[BOTH panting]

73
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,125
Jeez!
Are you crazy?

74
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,083
What's your problem?

75
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,625
I told you!

76
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,375
When he has naughty thoughts,
I'm the one who pays for it.

77
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,416
Every one of
'em stings me!

78
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,791
What do you mean
naughty thoughts?

79
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,125
Ugh, please!

80
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,208
You were just talking
about him living with you.

81
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,083
At his age, that's
basically guaranteeing

82
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,041
a whole crap ton
of dirty thoughts!

83
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,166
The answer is no!

84
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,041
He'll be staying
with me!

85
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,916
You know, I think
it's really someone else

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,750
who has his mind
in the gutter.

87
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,708
[HIYORI] Unlike you,
he's a good boy.

88
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,458
There's nothing to worry about.

89
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,208
Now, come with
me, Yukine.

90
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,125
No, Yukine!

91
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't you dare!

92
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,833
[HIYORI humming]

93
00:04:55,916 --> 00:05:01,250
[YATO sobbing]

94
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,250
[YUKINE] Your house
is freakin' huge!

95
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,416
You must be really rich
or something, huh?

96
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
[HIYORI] Don't be silly. I'm
just an ordinary teenager.

97
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,291
[YUKINE] Yeah, well,
this doesn't look

98
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,833
very ordinary to me.

99
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,000
Are your parents around
here somewhere?

100
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,333
[HIYORI giggling]
We got lucky.

101
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,625
[HIYORI] It looks like they're
actually out late tonight.

102
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,500
Huh?

103
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,625
You mean it's just you and me?

104
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,625
We have the whole place to our--

105
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,666
Oh, no! Sh!

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,791
[SASAKI] Ah, I thought
I heard you, Hiyori.

107
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,291
Yeah, it's me, Sasaki.

108
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,166
Nice evening, isn't it?

109
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,750
I have a bath drawn for you.

110
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,416
Feel free to hop in whenever
you're ready, dear!

111
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,833
[door creaking]

112
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,541
[BOTH giggling]

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,833
[YUKINE]
Whoa!

114
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,833
This is awesome!

115
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,250
[HIYORI] Go ahead
and make yourself at home

116
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,875
you can stay
in here. 

117
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,125
Huh? Really?

118
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,291
Isn't this your
room, though?

119
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,750
No. It's my
big brother's.

120
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,166
Your brother?

121
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,791
[HIYORI] Yeah. He's
a lot older than me.

122
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,666
He doesn't live here anymore,
so the room's all yours.

123
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,208
Oh, okay.

124
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,750
It's great.
If you're sure.

125
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm not far. My
room's next door.

126
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,875
Let me know if you
need anything.

127
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,958
[HIYORI]
Well, see you in a bit!

128
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,583
[door creaking]

129
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,333
[YUKINE sighs]

130
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,041
Looks like Hiyori's really
living a dream life, isn't she?

131
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,250
[HIYORI]
Everything went as planned.

132
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,750
We made a stealthy entrance,

133
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,375
unnoticed by our housekeeper
or my parents.

134
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,833
Oh! Hi, you guys!

135
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:50,500
Surprise!

136
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,208
We're early!

137
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,083
Lookie!

138
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,208
We brought home
a tasty snack!

139
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,833
Well. I think I'll
have a nightcap

140
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,125
if it's okay with you, dear.

141
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,791
Oh! You're absolutely
incorrigible!

142
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,083
[BOTH gulping]

143
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,500
[BOTH grunting]

144
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,708
This is the best
part of my day!

145
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,500
[HIYORI'S DAD]
And now for a little snack.

146
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,875
[HIYORI'S MOM]
Don't eat too much, now.

147
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,541
Have you washed
your hands, dear?

148
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
What are you doing?

149
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,666
[HIYORI'S MOM]
You know you're

150
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,291
supposed to be watching
your cholesterol!

151
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,666
[HIYORI'S DAD] But I
was just having a little.

152
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,791
[YATO muffled] Your mom sure
doesn't miss much, does she?

153
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,583
[HIYORI] What are you doing
here? This is my house!

154
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,958
[YATO] Jeez what's the big deal?

155
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,833
It's not like they're gonna
notice that I'm here.

156
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,083
[HIYORI]
The whole point

157
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,416
was to separate Yukine
from your bad influence!

158
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,750
[HIYORI sighs]

159
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,458
[YATO] Speaking of,
how's he taking it so far?

160
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,416
How do you think?
He's thrilled, of course!

161
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,875
Do you think he really
enjoys sleeping

162
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,958
in a different, random shrine
every night with you?

163
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,583
[YATO]
Unlike this house,

164
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,833
shrine grounds and buildings
are sacred territory.

165
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:57,166
Which means they keep
us safe from Phantom attacks.

166
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,666
[HIYORI]
Even so.

167
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,750
[YATO]
Haven't you ever heard

168
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,250
that things go bump
in the night?

169
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,000
That's the Phantoms'
favorite time.

170
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:08,666
Poor kid. I doubt
he'll be able to handle it.

171
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,416
Huh?

172
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,083
[YATO]
The thing about him...

173
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,333
[YATO]
You see,

174
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,916
Is he's afraid of the dark.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
[water splashing]

176
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,083
Aw, man, I don't even
know how long it's been

177
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,500
since I've had a hot bath.

178
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,958
[YUKINE sighs]

179
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,500
What now?

180
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:34,916
I wonder what Yato'll do if
I decide not to go back to him.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,375
Maybe he'll switch.

182
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,666
Start using that girl instead.

183
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,416
[YUKINE] But if he does,
what happens to me?

184
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,291
[YUKINE sniffing]

185
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,375
[YUKINE]
Huh?

186
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,875
Why do I feel like
I know that smell?

187
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,083
[YUKINE] Ah!
[water splashing]

188
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,958
[YUKINE] Hold on,
is it, is it because.

189
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,583
[YUKINE] D-d-d-d-d-d-d--

190
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:02,791
Did Hiyori just take
a bath in this water, too?

191
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,666
[door rolling]
[YUKINE gasping]

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,083
[HIYORI'S DAD]
Ah!

193
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,041
Here you are. I've
been looking for you.

194
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,583
Hey, Hiyori!

195
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,250
I found what I needed!
Don't worry about it!

196
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,416
[HIYORI groggy]
Gotta train harder.

197
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,083
Build stronger quads.
Gotta master the Jungle.

198
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:31,375
[knocking]
[door creaking]

199
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,333
[HIYORI] You need
something, Yukine?

200
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,958
I woke you up. I'm sorry.

201
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,708
[HIYORI]
It's okay. Is something wrong?

202
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,250
[YUKINE] Well, um.
It's going to sound stupid,

203
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,708
but your dad turned off
the lights in my room,

204
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,375
and I, well, y'know.
I don't like the dark much.

205
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,583
[HIYORI]
Oh...

206
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,833
I get it.

207
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,625
Well, want to sleep with me?

208
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,375
Huh?

209
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,375
It's okay, see? Come on in.

210
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh no I can't really--

211
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,958
[HIYORI] Hurry up already,
it's getting cold.

212
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,958
[YUKINE]
B-b-b-b-but I!

213
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,750
[YUKINE shrieking]

214
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,791
[HIYORI giggling]
Yeah, it's been a while

215
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,041
since I slept with someone, too.

216
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,000
[HIYORI]
You don't smell like a boy.

217
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,541
You smell nice.

218
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,208
I like this.

219
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,000
Lying next to someone.

220
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,208
It's soothing.

221
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,083
[HIYORI] It's kinda nice not
to be alone at night, you know?

222
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:39,875
[clock ticking]

223
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,375
[heart beating]

224
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:58,250
[YUKINE panting]
[heart beating]

225
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,583
[YATO] Young man, just what
do you think you're doing?

226
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,125
[YUKINE muffled grunting]

227
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,291
[door creaking]
[YUKINE muffled grunting]

228
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,375
[YUKINE]
You jerk!

229
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,791
What are you doing here?

230
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,500
[YATO] Don't give me that,
you little punk!

231
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,916
What were you about to do?

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,458
No, I--

233
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,250
Listen, Hiyori said
I could be there!

234
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,666
[YATO grunts] You're not ready
to have girls in your life yet.

235
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,208
So behave. For now,
I'm all you need.

236
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,541
[YUKINE] When you say stuff like
that, it makes me wanna puke.

237
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,500
[YATO sputters]

238
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,333
And anyway,
you've got a girl.

239
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,000
A Regalia like me,
but she's a chick.

240
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,541
[YUKINE] So what do you
even need me for?

241
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,041
[door creaks]

242
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,083
[YATO] Gonna be another
stormy night.

243
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:51,791
[PHANTOM groaning]

244
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,791
[PHANTOM groaning]

245
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,833
[twinkling]

246
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,500
[KAZUMA]
Closing in on downtown.

247
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,500
Location reached.

248
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,250
[lion roaring]

249
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,166
[KAZUMA]
Incoming: six o'clock!

250
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,833
[PHANTOM groaning]

251
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,291
[PHANTOM groans]

252
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,541
[twinkling]

253
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,083
We're done here.

254
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,458
[HIYORI] I'm glad
you came. This is fun.

255
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:39,041
[YUKINE grunts] Didn't have
anything else to do, so.

256
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,708
Those look nice.
You want a pair?

257
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:41,791
Uhh...

258
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,750
[HIYORI] It is getting
colder outside.

259
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,375
Let's see how much I have.

260
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,000
[YUKINE] No! It's okay. I don't
need anything, I promise.

261
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,291
[HIYORI] Oh, come on.
I want to get them for you.

262
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,583
But I'm fine, really!

263
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,041
I mean, it's not like anyone
can see me, right?

264
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,916
So, if I want something,
I can just borrow it.

265
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,833
[YUKINE laughing]

266
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,458
[HIYORI]
Hey!

267
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,125
You should know
better than that!

268
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,416
What you're doing's
no different than stealing!

269
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,000
What? I said I'm
just borrowing it.

270
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,041
I'll give it right back.

271
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,791
[HIYORI]
Well, it's still wrong.

272
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,833
Here, give it to me.

273
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,625
[HIYORI] The next time
you want something like this,

274
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,500
just tell me okay?

275
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,375
[HIYORI]
Where did he go?

276
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,625
[YATO]
Hey.

277
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,500
[HIYORI]
Yato? What are you doing here?

278
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:42,666
[YATO] Getting a little R and R.
I'm not feeling so good today.

279
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,625
[YATO] You are looking after
him like you said, aren't you?

280
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,791
'Cause it seems like he's
been gettin' in trouble.

281
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,708
[HIYORI] How could you
possibly know that?

282
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,166
[YATO]
Like I said before.

283
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,083
Master and Regalia
share mind and body.

284
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,791
I feel it when Yukine gives in

285
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,041
to the temptation
to behave badly.

286
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,000
[YATO] That's just how things
work for us.

287
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,000
We're closely connected.

288
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,041
[HIYORI] In that case,
is the opposite true?

289
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,541
Did Yukine get stung

290
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,791
when you swiped some of my
dad's drinks from the fridge?

291
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,750
[YATO]
No, it's not like that.

292
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,458
The pain only goes in one
direction, you see.

293
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,916
From Regalia to master, which
actually makes sense,

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,458
if you think about it.

295
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,125
[YATO] After all, Regalias
used to be people.

296
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,625
And people sin.

297
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,291
Some more than others.

298
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,375
[YUKINE gasps]

299
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:31,791
[kids murmuring]

300
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:40,208
[YATO] Resentment, fear, envy,
desperation, sadness, greed.

301
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,250
Those emotions tempt Regalias

302
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,291
to do what they
otherwise might not.

303
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,541
Acting on them brings pain.
We gods feel that pain,

304
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:53,083
and from it we learn something
of what it is to be human.

305
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,625
Listen, Hiyori.

306
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,250
I think there are some things
I ought to clear up for you.

307
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,500
People decide what's
right and wrong,

308
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,250
but those concepts
don't apply to gods.

309
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,416
To put it in simple terms,

310
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,625
Gods get to do
whatever they want.

311
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,500
Even if that includes hurting
someone, or taking a life.

312
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,708
[HIYORI gasps]

313
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:16,916
[YATO] Someday, Yukine
may need punishment.

314
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,625
Divine punishment.

315
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,291
Yato.

316
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,500
[KOFUKU] But Yatty
did kill a Regalia once.

317
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,958
He kills people, too, sometimes.

318
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,958
I-I have to go.

319
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,833
I need to find Yukine!

320
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:39,916
Again?

321
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,375
Of all the things
to leave behind.

322
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,666
[YUKINE]
I screwed up.

323
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,750
I wonder if she's
still mad at me.

324
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,125
[bells ringing]

325
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,000
Crap! It's that late?

326
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,250
[YUKINE panting]

327
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,916
[YUKINE]
Damn it!

328
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,375
Hurry!

329
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,833
[YUKINE panting]

330
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,375
Faster!

331
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,416
I hate the dark!

332
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,208
[GIRL]
I'm scared.

333
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,333
[YUKINE gasps]

334
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,000
[GIRL]
It's dark.

335
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,916
I don't like the dark.

336
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,958
Mommy.

337
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,833
Please come and get me!

338
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,625
You stopped walking.
You can see me?

339
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,000
[YUKINE gasps]

340
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,250
Oh no.

341
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,958
You can see me!

342
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,166
[GIRL sobbing] Everybody else
out here just ignores me!

343
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,916
Well, these eyeball
things try to talk to me,

344
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,875
but they're weird and scary.

345
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,625
[YUKINE]
This girl...

346
00:16:55,708 --> 00:17:00,583
[GIRL] I'm waiting for my mommy,
just like I'm supposed to.

347
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,833
She comes to pick me up after
my tutoring session is over.

348
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,833
[YUKINE]
Oh, she does, huh?

349
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,958
She shouldn't be much longer.

350
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,791
Will you please
wait here with me?

351
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,666
[GIRL]
Just 'til six o'clock.

352
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,166
[YUKINE]
Sure.

353
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,625
[HIYORI grunts]

354
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,041
[HIYORI]
Where is he?

355
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,916
[GIRL]
I'm really sorry.

356
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,083
I guess my mommy's running late.

357
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,125
Your family's probably worried
about you, too, huh?

358
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,166
[YUKINE]
Family?

359
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,750
I don't really
have one of those.

360
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,958
[BOTH gasp]

361
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,500
Hey, I know!

362
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,500
When my mommy gets here, you can
come home with us too, okay?

363
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,666
Don't worry.

364
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,458
[GIRL] I'm sure
she'll get here soon.

365
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,708
Really.

366
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,208
[YUKINE]
No, she won't.

367
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,916
[YUKINE] Hey! Come back here!
[GIRL sobbing]

368
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,041
[HIYORI]
There you are!

369
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,750
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

370
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,541
Wait, don't go that way!

371
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,541
Huh?

372
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,000
[PHANTOMS]
You must be so scared.

373
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,708
[YUKINE gasps]

374
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,166
[PHANTOMS]
Poor little girl...

375
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,125
All lost and alone...

376
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,416
[PHANTOMS]...in the dark.
[GIRL sobbing]

377
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,208
[PHANTOMS] But don't worry.
[GIRL sobbing]

378
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,833
[PHANTOMS]
It'll be okay.

379
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,666
Your mommy is over here.

380
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,750
My mommy?

381
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,791
[PHANTOMS]
Come this way.

382
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,083
Come to us.

383
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,166
Yukine!

384
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,541
[HIYORI]
Use that thing Yato taught you!

385
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,208
First I have to make
my hand into a halberd.

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,375
[YUKINE]
Damn!

387
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,833
Border!

388
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,833
[PHANTOMS shrieking]

389
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,083
[YUKINE panting]

390
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,541
[YUKINE]
I'm sorry.

391
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,666
I shouldn't have said
your mom's not coming.

392
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,208
[GIRL whimpers]

393
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,458
[YUKINE]
It's okay now.

394
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,708
They'll stay back.

395
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,458
They can't cross that line.

396
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,208
[PHANTOMS chanting]
Smells nice.

397
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:09,625
Smells nice.

398
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,333
[GIRL] Smells nice.
[YUKINE gasps]

399
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,166
[GIRL]
I just noticed.

400
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,916
You actually smell really nice.

401
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,916
[YUKINE yells]
[PHANTOMS] Smells nice.

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,708
[PHANTOMS]
Come here.

403
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,333
[GIRL]
You smell really nice.

404
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,791
Want to smell more.

405
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,583
Yukine!

406
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,708
[HIYORI shrieks]
[PHANTOM growling]

407
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,166
More smell, please. More.

408
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,000
Can I have?

409
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,458
[YUKINE whimpering]

410
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,000
[PHANTOMS shrieking]

411
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,666
More smell, please--

412
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,208
[YUKINE whimpering]

413
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,875
[YUKINE screaming]

414
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,750
[PHANTOM moaning]

415
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,583
[PHANTOM grunting]

416
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,833
[PHANTOMS]
Boy smells nice.

417
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,541
Mommy? Where?

418
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,666
[HIYORI grunts]

419
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,583
Yato!

420
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,583
[YATO]
Yukine, you all right?

421
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,541
[YUKINE softly]
That big Phantom...

422
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,541
A girl, went into it.

423
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,375
[YUKINE] Help Her!
[PHANTOMS] Boy smells nice!

424
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,041
[YUKINE] You have
to help her, Yato!

425
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,916
Please help her!

426
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,041
[YATO]
Very well.

427
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,416
[YATO]
Come Sekki!

428
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,875
This is the land
of the rising sun.

429
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,958
Your desecrations
shall not be allowed.

430
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:37,833
Hear me.

431
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,625
I am the god Yato.

432
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,208
I now lay thee
waste with the Sekki

433
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,333
and expel thy vast defilement.

434
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,083
I cleanse thee.

435
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,541
[PHANTOM grunts]

436
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,000
No!

437
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,250
Yato!

438
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,750
[YUKINE gasps]

439
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,083
[YUKINE]
Stop!

440
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,083
[YATO]
Rend!

441
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:02,583
[PHANTOM groaning]

442
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,083
[YUKINE] What the hell
are you doing?

443
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,041
You were supposed to save her!

444
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,583
[YATO groaning]

445
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,000
[YATO]
It's too late for that.

446
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,708
Can't you see? She's
been completely possessed!

447
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,916
[YUKINE]
What are you saying?

448
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,916
Killing her is the only
choice we have now.

449
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,541
[YATO grunting]

450
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,000
[YATO]
Yukine.

451
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,000
[YUKINE gasps]

452
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,333
[YATO]
Once it has been corrupted

453
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,333
and consumed by a Phantom,
a soul is utterly lost.

454
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,916
Its existence can be nothing
but a living hell!

455
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,833
[YUKINE whimpers]

456
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,416
[YATO]
You must do this.

457
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,458
Show her mercy and free her!

458
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,416
[YUKINE whimpering]

459
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,583
Yukine!

460
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,333
[YUKINE whimpering]

461
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,500
[sword rattling]

462
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,416
Rend!

463
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,958
[YUKINE whimpering]

464
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,000

[YATO panting]

467
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,958
[YATO groaning]

468
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,375
[HIYORI gasps]

469
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,666
[KAZUMA] We've received
word from Kuraha,

470
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,166
who's patrolling the city.

471
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,583
[water rushing]

472
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:35,750
[KAZUMA] It seems that he saw
Yato, slaying a Phantom.

473
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:39,166
He appears to have
obtained a new Regalia.

474
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,458
[BISHAMON]
I see.

475
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,875
[water splashing]

476
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,166
[HIYORI] How was
your bath, Yukine?

477
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,291
Nice and relaxing?

478
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,125
[YUKINE]
Yeah.

479
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,666
Oh, and I used some shampoo.

480
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,875
I think it was rose-scented
or something.

481
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,208
I'm guessing it
was yours, right?

482
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,250
[HIYORI] Actually, it's my
dad's hair-growth cream.

483
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,583
[YUKINE]
Your dad's?

484
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,458
[HIYORI] Next time on
Noragami: "Scary Person."
