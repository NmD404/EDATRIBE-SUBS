Hey, Yukine?

You awake?

[clock ticking]

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,791
[HIYORI] I baked some
cookies for you.

6
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,250
I'll just leave them
by the door with some cocoa.

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,125
[YUKINE] Why am I
freaking out so much?

23
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,083
It's Yato's fault.

24
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,125
Forcing me to kill that girl.

different than stealing!

[YUKINE]
Damn!

32
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,583
They won't get
off of my ass!

[HIYORI]
Not in there, either.

41
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,416
Yukine's been so down
since that last encounter.

42
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,958
And Yato hasn't even
spoken to him.

43
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,500
I guess it's only natural
for him to feel this way

44
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,375
after what happened.

45
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,000

Oh, hey! Hiyori!

00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:46,833
[HIYORI]
Hey!

47
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,791
Ami! Yama!

48
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,750
[YAMA] Don't you think that you
should be at home studying

49
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,500
instead of wandering around?

50
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,583
[HIYORI]
What about you?

51
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,291
We all have to take the exam.

52
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,875
[AMI] Yeah, but we don't sleep
through class all the time,

53
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,708
so we're pretty sure
we'll be moving on

54
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,500
to the next grade
with everybody else.

55
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,916
[YAMA giggles] But we're
starting to worry about you.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,666
I'm doing plenty of studying,
thank you very much.

57
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,291
Oh, hey. Have either of you seen

58
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,958
a boy wearing a green
parka around anywhere?

59
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,583
He comes up to about here.

60
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,791
[BOTH]
A boy, huh?

61
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,916
[HIYORI]
Yeah!

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,583
He's kinda young.

63
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:18,500
[BOTH]
Hm.

64
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,166
Oh, hello, Mrs. Iki?

65
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,458
Your daughter is in
a torrid relationship!

66
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,958
[YAMA] And we're smack dab
in the middle of exam season!

67
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,583
Ahh! No, don't
listen to them, Mom!

68
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,333
It's not like that,
I promise you!

69
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,916
And you got a thing
for ugly guys!

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,541
I bet he's hideous!

71
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,208
Just look at your beloved
Tono after he lost!

72
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,208
Don't show me that!

73
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,916
I haven't gotten
to that fight yet!

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,125
[HIYORI moaning]

75
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,416
You better introduce
us to your boyfriend!

76
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,708
Here's hopin' he looks
like just like Tono!

77
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,375
[HIYORI] Seriously,
it's not like that!

78
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,708
[YAMA]
Oh, man!

79
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,375
I don't even know
if the gods can help her now.

80
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,125
[HIYORI] I actually would
like to introduce them

81
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,750
to Yato and Yukine sometime.

82
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:55,833
Of course,

83
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,375
there's not much point.

84
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:01,375
They'd probably forget they met
them as soon as it happened.

85
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,625
And then...

86
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,958
I can't really pretend
like I know Yato

87
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,000
all that well myself.

88
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:12,791

Man, that was
too easy! Heh, hah!

[skateboard rattling]

92
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:25,375
Ha, ha! I can pretty much
do anything I want!

[YUKINE yells]

95
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,083
What the hell's
your problem?!

96
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,125
[YUKINE gasps]

97
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,375
[YUKINE]
Yato!

98
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,791
[YATO sighs]

99
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,833
[YATO] Wanna tell me
where you got this?

100
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,375
[YUKINE gasps]

101
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,708
Um, well, Hiyori
bought it for me.

102
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,166
[YATO sarcastically]
Uh-huh.

103
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,333
[HIYORI]
Yukine!

104
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,083
You've been
with Yato?

105
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,125
Oh, man,
that's a relief.

106
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,583
[YUKINE gasps]

107
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,291
[YATO] Hiyori, that was real
nice of you to buy this for him.

108
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,541
Huh?

109
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,416
[HIYORI grunts]

110
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,041
Uh. Oh, sure.
I'm nice like that.

111
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,500
[YUKINE gasps]

112
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,166
[YATO sighs]

113
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,583
Man, I really
can't stand kids.

114
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,458
That's one deep
crimson sky.

115
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,166
[YUKINE AND HIYORI gasp]

116
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,541
[YATO] Twilight serves as the
boundary between day and night.

117
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,916
The people of this world,

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,250
they fear the darkness,
and hide from it.

119
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,250
[BISHAMON] While the
inhabitants of the other world

120
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,166
blend into the darkness
and run wild.

121
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,666
[YATO]
With its reddish hue,

122
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,833
the setting sun blurs the
distinction between the worlds.

123
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,875
[BISHAMON] As the evening
shadows grow deeper

124
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,500
and harden into
pervasive darkness.

125
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,958
[YATO] This is the time when
those lost in the divide

126
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,250
can most easily
cross the boundary.

127
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,541
[BISHAMON] People once referred
to this as the time of day

128
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,416
when the monsters emerged
from their slumber.

129
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,666
[YUKINE gasping]

130
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,416
[YATO] Yukine, this time
is known as...

131
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,083
[BOTH]
The Fiendish Hour.

132
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,583

[YATO grunting]

137
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,041
[YUKINE]
Oww.

138
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,083
[HIYORI gasping]

139
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,541
[YATO]
Shh.

140
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,375
The hell?

141
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,375
[YATO] Ya see what happens
when I explain things to you?

142
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,041
I'm blaming you for the trouble
that just landed on us.

143
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,541
[BISHAMON] I've found you
at last god of calamity.

144
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,208
Hi, Bishamon.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,875
[YUKINE]
Bishamon?

146
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,125
[YATO]
That's right.

147
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,916
The strongest war god
that I wish I never met.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,125
She's a god?

149
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,250
Well, aren't you
on the same side, then?

150
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,583
[YUKINE]
Why is she attacking us?

151
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,291
[YATO] We tangled once
a long time ago.

152
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,541
And she's been trying
to kill me ever since.

153
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,541
[BOTH]
Huh?

154
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,708
[BISHAMON exhales]

155
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,375
Then count me out
of this one!

156
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,708
You can fight her on your own.

157
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,875
[YATO]
I dunno.

158
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,958
I doubt she's gonna just
let you walk away.

159
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,166
[YUKINE gasps]

160
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,000
[YATO] This is a matter
of revenge for her.

161
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,833
She wants me and my Regalia.

162
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,166
Well thanks a lot!

163
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,375
[BISHAMON] My grudge may
drive me to slay you both.

164
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,083
But the punishment
of evil will make it just.

165
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,291
[YATO grunts]

166
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,750
Come, Sekki!

167
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,000
Huh?

168
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,625
Wait!

169
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,583
[YATO grunts]

170
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,958
[BISHAMON]
You won't escape me!

[HIYORI sighs]

173
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:02,958
Wait. The Bishamon,
the god that punishes evildoers?

174
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,708
[HIYORI]
Revenge against Yato?

175
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,750
She even wants
to kill his Regalia?

176
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,083
[YATO] If anything
happens to me.

177
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,416
I want you to go
straight to those two.

you to track him.

The area is lightly crowded,

in your attacks.

Only one Regalia,

Well, killing is the only
thing Yato's skilled at.

Get off my ass.

I'm so exhausted right now.

Quit bein' such a pansy.

202
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,250
What? I am not a pansy.

203
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,375

I can feel it!

[YUKINE gasps]

205
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,166
[YATO] You've been stinging
me nonstop with your crap!

206
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,541
How many times I gotta tell you

207
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,750
that your volatile emotional
state affects me too!

208
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,583
Get it together!

209
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,875
But that woman.

210
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,458
She's a god just like you.

211
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,916
Are you seriously
gonna fight another god?

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,083
She's the one
attacking us, okay?

213
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,250
And you're... gonna use me?

214
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,416
[YATO]
Obviously!

215
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,625

even her clothes and that beast.

219
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,958
They're all Regalias.

that lion's a Regalia?

221
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,166
[YATO]
You got it.

222
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,791
On top of that,
she's got Kazuma,

223
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,833
who handles her navigation and
coordinates the other Regalias.

224
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,166
His all-seeing guidance

225
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,916
makes Bishamon the mightiest
war god of them all.

Hey!

Why aren't you hiding?

228
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,875
She'll see us!

229
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,041
[YATO] She'll find
us no matter what!

230
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,583
I'm making a stand right here.

got some strength.

It was a long time ago,

[HIYORI grunts]

317

This is only between

But, Yato told me to
come to you for help.

he do without you?

for Yatty, don't you?

you then, isn't he?

worry, Yori!

you asked for this,

and don't blame
me for the fallout.

00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:54,791
[YUKINE]
Yato.

356
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,041
Huh?

357
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,041
That lady,

358
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,791
the one that's
chasing us.

359
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,208
Did you really
kill her Regalia?

360
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,958
Yeah.

361
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,833
Then it's only natural
she wants revenge on you.

362
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,500
[YUKINE]
Why'd you do it?

363
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,291
Because I wanted
to, alright?

364
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,458
Nothing more.

365
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,708
[twigs cracking]

366
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,875
[YUKINE] So it's that easy
for you then, huh?

367
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,458
Is what
that easy?

368
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,541
And me?

369
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,333
Are you gonna kill
me if I screw up?

370
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,625
Or if you just don't
need me anymore?

371
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,500
[YUKINE]
Not that I matter to him.

372
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,041
Even without me.

373
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,291
He's still got that
other Regalia, Nora.

374
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,541
[YATO groans]

375
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,208
You're stinging
me again, dammit.

376
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,333
Seriously.

377
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,916
Man up and get
your head straight!

378
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,916
What?

379
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,750
[YATO] Your fear
is killing me here!

380
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,166
It's put me
in a real slump!

381
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,625
Freakin' wimp!

382
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,500
Hey, you're just
as scared as I am!

383
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,958
[YATO]
What?!

384
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,416
Your hands are five times
sweatier than usual, Old Drippy!

385
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,250
Who the hell you
callin' old Drippy?

386
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,416
I'm talkin' to you,
aren't I, you moron!

387
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,958
Well it takes a moron
to recognize a moron!

388
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,625
You freakin'
moron!

[tree crashing]

395
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,458
You're like
a walking armory.

396
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,625
And c'mon.

397
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,333
Did you hav'ta take
out all those trees?

398
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,833
Did the forest kill one
of your Regalia's as well?

399
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,541
[BISHAMON] I can overlook some
immoral collateral damage

400
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,708
to purge evil.

401
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,958
[YATO] Well it's a
good thing you've got

402
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,708
the power of righteousness
on your side then.

403
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,958
Make you feel all warm
and fuzzy inside?

404
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,750
Those will be
your final words.

405
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,125
Whoa!

406
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,291
We can't fight that!

407
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,333
That monster will
tear me in half!

408
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,666

[KOFUKU]
Yatty!

412
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,125
Found you!

413
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,375
Kofuku?

414
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,791
Lady Kofuku?

415
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,666
Come to me, Kokki!

416
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,916
Now pay attention
to me, you two!

417
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,875
Is she?

418
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,208
Are you insane?

419
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,500
No more fighting!

[YATO yelling]

421
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,875
[YUKINE]
What's happening?

422
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,458
[YATO]
She blasted open a vent!

423
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,583
She can barely
control that thing!

424
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,166
She's always causing
Storms with her Kokki.

425
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,166
[KAZUMA] Phantoms are
pouring from the underworld!

426
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,208
Lady Bishamon!
We should retreat!

427
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,041
[BISHAMON growling]
Stay the course!

428
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,291

440
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,625
[BISHAMON]
Help Kuraha.

441
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,166
Bastard!

442
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,000
Lady Bishamon.

443
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,166
We need to
retreat for now.

444
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,333
He's right there!

445
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,791
Just forget
about the Vent!

446
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,000
I demand
justice!

447
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:28,708
Veena!

[BISHAMON gasps]

449
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,958
If you personally wish
to be eaten by Phantoms,

450
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,375
then go
right ahead.

451
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,583
But tell me.

452
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,000
Do you wish the same
for Kuraha and the others?

453
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,333
[BISHAMON scoffs]

454
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,208
Whoa, what in
the world is that?

455
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,958
[YATO] Dammit, Hiyori,
why'd you bring them here?

456
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,458
But wait, you told
me to go to them

457
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,916
if you were
ever in trouble!

458
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,166
Oh. But I didn't
mean this time!

459
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,791
I just never really expected
I'd run into Bishamon.

460
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,208
[KOFUKU shrieking]
Oh, no!

461
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,041
Well, regardless,
you should hide.

462
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:02,750
Huh?

463
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,208
And don't say
my name.

464
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,583
Bishamon can't find out you
have any connection to me.

465
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,833
Oh, right!

466
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,333
[YATO grunts]

467
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,500
Out of respect
for Lady Kofuku,

468
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,958
I'll let you live for today.

469
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,500
But I will kill you
the next time we meet

470
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,541
with my own hands.

471
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,208
So try not to get
any more blight.

472
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,458
[YATO grunts]

473
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,416
Let's go, Kazuma.

[DAIKOKU]
Hiyori!

476
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,500
It's dangerous
here, we've gotta go!

477
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,541
[HIYORI]
Right!

478
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,583
[YATO] Nice work
back there, Kofuku.

479
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,625
[KOFUKU giggling]
Pretty impressive, huh?

480
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,875
[YATO]
I'm being sarcastic!

481
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,125
You screwed everything up!

482
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,458
[DAIKOKU]
You ingrate!

483
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,666
She saved your sorry ass
from death! [punch lands]

484
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,916
[YATO]
Ow, jeez!

485
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,041
That hurt, Daikoku!

486
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,916
[DAIKOKU]
It was supposed to!

487
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,250
[HIYORI'S MOM] There were
some really high-force winds

488
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,333
blowing through
the city at sundown.

489
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,625
I heard a whole
patch of trees

490
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,500
in the woods were knocked down.

491
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,208
How frightening.

492
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,208
[YATO moaning]

493
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,458
No good.

494
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,500
It just won't cleanse.

495
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,875
Yukine,

496
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,375
is this just not gonna work?

00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,916
[water drips]

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,083
[NORA]
Yato.

499
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,875
Try not to look so down.

[chimes ringing]

501
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,208
Don't forget that you
can always use me.

[YATO]
Nora.

503
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,958
[YATO]
That's a deep crimson sky.

Hiyori.

505
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,125
The word crimson--

506
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,625
[HIYORI] "Crimson" originally
denoted the color of a dye

507
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,208
made from Kermes
vermilio, right?

508
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,708
[YATO]
Uh, yeah, sure.

509
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,375
[HIYORI] Next time on Noragami:
"Uncertainty and Destiny."

510
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,666
[YATO]
You sure do know a lot.

511
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,541
[HIYORI]
Well, this is exam season.
