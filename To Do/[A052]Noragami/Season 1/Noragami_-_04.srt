00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:26,666
[GIRLS laughing, shouting]

2
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,791
[FANGIRL]
Here, Lord Yato!

3
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,500
Will you say it? Please?

4
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,833
Ha! It is done. May
our fates intertwine.

5
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,000
[GIRLS shouting]

6
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,250
[YATO gulping]

7
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:43,000
Woo! Man, nothin'
beats a cup of saké

8
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,458
after a long day of work!

9
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,666
All these people.

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,041
You have so many
worshippers, my lord!

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,833
[MAIDEN] The streets are
just filled with Yatoites!

12
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,875
Hm. About time.

13
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,541
I knew the world would catch
up with me eventually.

14
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,083
[YATO] Still, there
is a certain emptiness

15
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,416
to having your
ambition fulfilled.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,625
The top is a lonely place to be.

17
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,000
Nobody understands!

18
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,500
How it chills my heart!

19
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,625
[ALL]
Oh, Lord Yato.

20
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,125
I am so very cold.

21
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,250
Won't someone come along to warm
this frozen heart of mine?

22
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,500
I will! Let me!

23
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,958
No! Me, Lord Yato!

24
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,708
[MAIDENS clamoring]

25
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:22,916
[YATO laughing]

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,125
[YATO]
Hey, take it easy, now.

27
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,375
There's plenty of Lord Yato
to go around, la--

28
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,708
[YUKINE]
Oh, just shut up!

29
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:32,791
[YATO grunting]

31
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,708
[YATO]
Hooray!

32
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,625
This looks great, thanks!

33
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,958
Eat all you want.

34
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,000
But in exchange, I expect
you to stop dodging me

35
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,541
and finally listen
to my request!

36
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,416
This is my favorite! Score!

37
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,875
Are you even listening?
You aren't, are you?

38
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,416
[YUKINE yawning] I'm tired.

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,750
I barely got any rest,

40
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,666
thanks to mister
talks-in-his-sleep over here.

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,333
Is that a normal thing for you?

42
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,333
Ah. that dream was
something special!

43
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,166
Please! Like there'll
ever be "Yatoites."

44
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,666
Yeah, you'll never get any
followers dressing like that.

45
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,333
No one wants to worship a slob.

46
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,333
Especially girls. No girl
would ever think that's cool.

47
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,833
Excuse me?

48
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,500
I mean, I wouldn't even give
you so much as a handshake.

49
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,791
You know, right? His
hands are always sweaty.

50
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,333
It's really gross!

51
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,750
[YATO groaning]

52
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,833
[YATO] I think it's time
for me to show you

53
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,750
what a god is capable of.

54
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,583
[BOTH gasp]

55
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,958
It is fated to happen.

56
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,500
My dream will become real,
and do you know why?

57
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,500
[BOTH grunt]

58
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,416
'Cause I bought this baby!

59
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,875
[BOTH] What's some
old pot gonna do?

60
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,291
It's not just any pot!

61
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,000
I got it from a lady in town
who read my palm

62
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,500
and declared she would sell
it to me and no one else!

63
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,750
All I have to do is chant

64
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,458
"happy-happy, cool-cool,
happy-happy, cool-cool"

65
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,875
every day while I rub
it back and forth, see?

66
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,250
[BOTH]
And you believed her?

67
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,166
And this'll make me
rich if I place it

68
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,708
on a west-facing wall.

69
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,958
And this bracelet will help
me build the home of my dreams.

70
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,166
And this pyramid is guaranteed
to boost my test scores!

71
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,458
With all these charms,

72
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,375
wishes I didn't even
know I had will come true!

73
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,541
I'll be happy-happy, cool-.

74
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,916
[BOTH growling]

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,250
Heads up, Hiyori!

76
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,791
[YUKINE grunts]

77
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,083
[HIYORI grunts]

78
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,166
[HIYORI]
Jungle Tornado!

[YATO moaning]

80
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,416
Try doing some work instead!

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,125
It's not my fault
things have been slow.

82
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,166
I want to work, but I'm not
getting any job calls.

83
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,583
No calls, no work.

84
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,333
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said.

85
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:07,458
How gods and Regalias are
together in mind and body.

86
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,166
[HIYORI] You were lucky
to find such a great Regalia.

87
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,125
Don't you think it's time
to clean up your act a little?

88
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,458
Pull yourself together.

89
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,500
Yukine's counting on you now.

90
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,875
[YATO sighs]

91
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,083
[YATO] Get up, Hiyori.
Go get your body.

92
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,333
[HIYORI]
Huh?

93
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,958
There's somebody I want
to introduce you to.

94
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,416
[HIYORI]
Uh...

95
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,583
[birds chirping]

96
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,166
Why'd we come here?

97
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,541
[YATO]
Kofuku!

98
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,916
Anyone here? Hey!

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,250
[YATO] Huh?
[footsteps pattering]

100
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,750
[KOFUKU squealing]
[YATO grunts]

101
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,791
[KOFUKU]
Yatty!

102
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,791
[BOTH laughing]

103
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,041
[YATO]
Hey, long time no see, huh?

104
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,041
[YUKINE] So, who do you
think she is, anyway?

105
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,458
From the way they're greeting
each other, you'd think that...

106
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,250
No way. That'd be impossible.

107
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,958
Guys, this is Kofuku.

108
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,333
She's my girlfriend!

109
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,666
Nice, huh?

110
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,791
Yatty and I go way, way back.

111
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,666
Nice to meet you!

112
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,750
Girlfriend? No way!

113
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,208
But she's a hottie!

114
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,333
Anyway, I've got a favor
to ask you, my dear.

115
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,625
I'll do anything you
want. You know that.

116
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,791
Here's the deal.

117
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,791
I recently made this
kid into a Regalia.

118
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,000
[YATO]
Which is great,

119
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,750
but work's kinda scarce
lately, you know?

120
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,083
Breaks my heart.

121
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,833
I'd like to get him a hot
meal in this weather.

122
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,291
But how can I when I
haven't even been able

123
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,041
to provide shelter for him yet?

124
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,375
I think that's the saddest
story I've ever heard!

125
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,083
Don't worry! I'll help you out.

126
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,000
Let me see what I have here.

127
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,000
[KOFUKU]
There.

128
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,875
Do you think this
will be enough?

129
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,291
You're a life-saver!

130
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,208
A real sweetheart,
that's what you are, baby!

131
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,875
Aw, do you really mean it?

132
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,958
I love it when you
talk to me that way.

133
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,083
[YATO] All right! Time
to hit the pachinko parlor!

134
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:18,916
[KOFUKU]
I'll come with you!

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
What a grade-A scumbag.

136
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:24,041
[DAIKOKU]
You dirty bastard!

137
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,916
[YATO groaning]

138
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,791
[YATO grunts]

139
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,583
[DAIKOKU]
What have I told you, huh?

140
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,208
Keep your hands off
my lady or I will end you!

141
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,791
[BOTH]
Whoa! It's an affair?

142
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,583
You hear me, ya rotten,
stinkin', little punk?

143
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,083
[KOFUKU]
Now! You gentlemen

144
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,583
don't need to fight
over little ol' me!

145
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,750
I'm Kofuku Ebisu's Regalia.

146
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,958
In weapon form the name's Koku.

147
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,083
As a person, I'm Daikoku.

148
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,416
[DAIKOKU sputtering]

149
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,833
This is cool. Ebisu's
a pretty big name, right?

150
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,583
Yeah, one of the
Seven Gods of Fortune.

151
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,000
[HIYORI] Sure looks different
in person, doesn't she?

152
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,666
What are you talking
about over there?

153
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,750
[BOTH gasp]

154
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,916
[HIYORI]
Oh, nothing, really! Just about

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,250
how cute of a couple
you are. That's all!

156
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,041
[DAIKOKU]
Couple?

157
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,500
Well, yeah. I mean, the two
of you are married, aren't you?

158
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,291
'Course not.

159
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,500
[HIYORI]
Huh?

160
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,083
But what you called
Goddess Ebisu earlier...

161
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,541
We're casual here.
Kofuku's fine.

162
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,875
[HIYORI grunts]

163
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,375
It's just that before, you
called Kofuku your lady.

164
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,125
My lady, like a title.
As in, she's my goddess.

165
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,083
Aren't you?

166
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,375
[KOFUKU]
Mm-hmm!

167
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,083
[DAIKOKU] I wonder what
my tea leaves will say.

168
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,166
[KOFUKU] Reading tea leaves
is a bogus practice.

169
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,458
What are you staring at?

170
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,291
Was there something
you wanted to say to me?

171
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,083
No! No, there's nothing
at all we'd like to say, sir!

172
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,583
[YATO] Be careful. Don't
look that guy in the eyes.

173
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,750
[BOTH]
Huh?

174
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,000
Doing that can
be dangerous.

175
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,750
You might never get away.

176
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,750
Despite his tough exterior...

177
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,291
He has a thing
for kids like you!

178
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,916
[BOTH whimpering]

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,833
Don't say it like that!

180
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,291
You make me sound sick!

181
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,458
[YATO yelling]

182
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,000
[BOTH whimpering]

183
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,875
[KOFUKU giggling] Don't get
the wrong idea, okay?

184
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,000
My Daikoku loves kids!
That's all Yatty meant.

185
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,583
Daikoku cares about children.

186
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,250
He could do nothing but sit and
watch them play all day long!

187
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,541
You see what ya did there?

188
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,958
Now I'm starting
to sound creepy again.

189
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,125
[DAIKOKU]
Now. Let's talk, kid.

190
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,250
[BOTH gasping]

191
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,666
[DAIKOKU] Quit it.
Don't be ridiculous.

192
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,208
All right, boy.
You're a Regalia?

193
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,583
What's your name?

194
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,666
Y-Yukine.

195
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,250
[DAIKOKU]
Been a Regalia long?

196
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,666
No, sir. Not long at all.

197
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,833
I just started, actually.

198
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,333
Hm. I see.

199
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,208
Young for such a responsibility.

200
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,625
Do you think he's too young?

201
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,500
[KOFUKU] What about you?
[HIYORI] Uh, sorry?

202
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,958
[KOFUKU]
Do you have a name?

203
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,541
Yes, I'm Hiyori Iki.

204
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,791
Oh! I'll just call
you Yori, okay?

205
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,250
That's fine.

206
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,791
You seem like you're just
a regular human girl, Yori.

207
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,541
What's your
relationship to Yatty?

208
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,333
[HIYORI]
What? Relationship?

209
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,250
I don't even care
about the jerk.

210
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,666
[KOFUKU]
Come on, now!

211
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,666
Why do you look so upset, huh?

212
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,541
[KOFUKU] What's wrong?
Tell me, tell me!

213
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,333
[DAIKOKU] I'm very sorry.
My lady can be crazy sometimes.

214
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,708
[KOFUKU] You're a B-cup,
aren't you? I can tell.

215
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,833
She looks so happy
like that, doesn't she?

216
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,250
She just loves
meeting new people.

217
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,416
So anyway.

218
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,916
Life good with Yato?

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,583
[YUKINE grunting]

220
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,750
Sounds about right.

221
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,750
He's not much
of a people person, huh?

222
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,375
I really want to change jobs.

223
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,583
Well, do it, then.

224
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,833
Could I work here?

225
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,708
My lady doesn't need
anybody's help but mine.

226
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,208
[YUKINE]
Of course not!

227
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,083
[KOFUKU] Hey, would you
like some advice, Yuki?

228
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,250
[YUKINE]
"Yuki"?

229
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,916
[KOFUKU] You should
really be careful.

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,458
Yatty and I are close and all,

231
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,125
but I've heard some nasty
rumors about him before.

232
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,208
Rumors? Like what?

233
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:55,875
Trust me. Despite how he might
look, he's a scary god!

234
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,875
[DAIKOKU] Oh, stop that.
There's no need to frighten him.

235
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,291
[HIYORI gasps]

236
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,541
Time to go!

237
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,500
I got a call for some
work! Come on, Yukine!

238
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,791
We're busy men!

239
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,333
[HIYORI] Hey! Aren't
you going to wait for me?

240
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,958
Thanks for having us. Sorry!

241
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,416
[KOFUKU]
Aw!

242
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,458
Leaving already?
But you just got here!

243
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,208
[DAIKOKU]
Yato...

244
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,250
What were you up to,
bringing those two here?

245
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,500
[URASAWA]
Mom, I'm sorry.

246
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,291
I hope you'll
forgive me someday.

247
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,541
[YATO] Thanks for calling
the Delivery God!

248
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,166
Yato, at your service!

249
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,416
[URASAWA groaning]

250
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,416
You pushed him, Yato!

251
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,875
My bad!

252
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,458
[URASAWA]
Hey, I didn't jump...

253
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,875
I fell?

254
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,791
Incredible. Everything
goes wrong for me. Even this.

255
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,916
[YATO]
No need to despair!

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Hello, sir.

257
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,875
Are you sick of the daily grind?
Depressed about your love life?

258
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,291
Hi there, ma'am!

259
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,750
Having trouble balancing your
career and your family?

260
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,291
What's that, kids? There
are some bullies in your class

261
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,458
that need to be taken
down a notch or two?

262
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,458
Well, good news! I can solve
any problem, big or small!

263
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,708
That's right, I'm fast
and affordable!

264
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,375
I am the Delivery God Yato.

265
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,125
Call anytime, ladies and gen--

266
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,208
[BOTH screaming]

267
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,625
[YATO]
What was that for?

268
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,666
[HIYORI] Skip the self-promotion
and save him already!

269
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,125
[YUKINE]
Hand-written, huh?

270
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,333
Oh, I'm sorry. I should
introduce myself, as well.

271
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,458
Here's my card. Or
what used to be my card.

272
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,041
Is everyone here crazy?

273
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,375
Ah. Let me see, here.

274
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,375
So it looks like you work
at an ad agency? Or did.

275
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,583
[URASAWA]
That's right.

276
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,166
However, the company
recently went bankrupt.

277
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,083
That's why I'm here now. I
didn't know what else to do.

278
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,708
[URASAWA]
I wanted to call my parents

279
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,666
to apologize for doing this.

280
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,625
but I guess I accidentally
dialed your number instead.

281
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,541
[YATO] That explains
the hang up, then.

282
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,750
I mean, anyway.

283
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,666
The hand of fate
is clear in this.

284
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,833
Start from the beginning.
How did this happen?

285
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,625
Maybe you should start
by saving him!

286
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,375
Well, I suppose it all
began last winter.

287
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,250
[HIYORI]
You're doing this now?

288
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,916
[URASAWA] I happened to come
across a young woman.

289
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,291
I couldn't take
my eyes off of her.

290
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,375
[HIYORI] Hey, why are we
using my face for this?

291
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,500
[URASAWA] You just popped
into my head. I guess because

292
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,875
you're right here. Sorry.

293
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,958
[YATO] Stripes, huh?
I wouldn't have guessed that.

294
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,291
[HIYORI] Don't look!
[YATO groaning]

295
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,041
[URASAWA] Thinking she
might be a runaway,

296
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,166
I offered to take her
to find some help.

297
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,833
[stomach growling]

298
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,250
You must be really
hungry, huh.

299
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,416
You want something to eat?
We can take care of that.

300
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,791
[GIRL] No, thanks. I'm
not allowed to go out to eat.

301
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,833
It's a strict rule. I'd
be scared to break it.

302
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,416
Although I do sometimes
sneak out into town anyway.

303
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,291
I can't help it.

304
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,958
[URASAWA]
The poor girl.

305
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,750
I could tell she was living
in a very controlling household.

306
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,125
She was barely even
allowed outside.

307
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,791
Like a lovely bird
trapped in a cage.

308
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,708
[GIRL gasps]

309
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,625
You could stand
a change of pace.

310
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,541
So where would you like to go?

311
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,583
[GIRL laughing]

312
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:09,000
[URASAWA] And that's it. That's
how we first started dating.

313
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,625
It was the happiest
time of my life.

314
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,958
[YATO]
I'm gonna vomit!

315
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,875
This guy takes advantage
of vulnerable young women.

316
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,583
Someone call the police!

317
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,708
It wasn't like that!
I cared deeply for her!

318
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,166
I never did anything indecent,
I swear on my life!

319
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,458
I don't believe
you, you perv.

320
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,500
[URASAWA] Anyway.
I came to enjoy spoiling her.

321
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,291
[GIRL giggling]
What do you think?

322
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,166
It looks fantastic on you!

323
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,916
[GIRL]
Promise?

324
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,083
You really don't mind
buying all this for me?

325
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,333
Well, everything looked
so good on you.

326
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,333
[URASAWA] Of course, I'm
broke until I get paid again,

327
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,250
but oh well.

328
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,875
[GIRL] Thank you
so much, Yusuke!

329
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,958
I love you!

330
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:44,875
Yep, gonna puke.

331
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,750
Stop picturing me. It's creepy!

332
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,750
How long have we
been falling now?

333
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,458
[URASAWA]
Wait. This is for me?

334
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,041
[GIRL]
Just a little present.

335
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,083
[URASAWA]
Oh, do you like Capypas?

336
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,208
They're my favorite! I've never
been to Capypa land, though.

337
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,375
It's called the
"Kingdom of Dreams and Hopes,"

338
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,083
so of course I'm
not allowed to go.

339
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,791
[URASAWA sobbing]
What a sad life!

340
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,333
I'll take you! We'll
see it together.

341
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,916
You mean it?

342
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,750
[URASAWA] It was around then
that things started to go wrong.

343
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't know how
else to explain it.

344
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,583
[KIDS sobbing]

345
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,041
[MOTHER]
It's okay, boys.

346
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,333
[URASAWA]
Huh?

347
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,583
[MAN panting]

348
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,041
[YATO shouting]
What's with that place?

349
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,666
Middle-aged men walking around
wearing Capypa skins?

350
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,625
That's twisted and
 jus-just plain wrong!

351
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,875
[URASAWA] They're
just suits, it's okay!

352
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,833
Here, you see,
there's a Capypa fairy

353
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,625
coming along to make
everything all better!

354
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,041
[HIYORI] Enough with
this stuff already!

355
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,375
[URASAWA] I don't
know what happened.

356
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:42,333
but we started to run into
all sorts of bad luck.

357
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,958
As things got worse, my job
performance steadily dropped.

358
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,833
I never got bonuses anymore,

359
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:51,708
and my meager savings dried up
almost before I knew it.

360
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,833
But I just couldn't imagine
not being with her anymore.

361
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,375
[URASAWA]
I was desperate.

362
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,958
[phone vibrating]

363
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,666
[REPO MAN]
I know you're in there!

364
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,250
[URASAWA] One thing led
to another and I went bankrupt.

365
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,333
I just wanted to be with her.

366
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,833
but with the hole
I had dug for myself,

367
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,333
I knew I would only
become a burden.

368
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,291
I wanted to spend our
lives together.

369
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,416
I had been planning
to propose to her.

370
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,875
Not now! I don't
deserve her anymore!

371
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,208
[YATO]
Hey, uh.

372
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,125
You got a pic of this girl
I could take a look at?

373
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,375
A picture?

374
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,958
There's something
familiar about this story.

375
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,958
[URASAWA]
Here she is.

376
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,458
[HIYORI]
That's Kofuku!

377
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,666
[URASAWA]
Huh? How do you know her name?

378
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,875
Shoulda guessed it sooner.

379
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,166
What? Why? How
could you possibly know?

380
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,083
Guess I didn't tell you
everything earlier.

381
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,916
Kofuku is the god of poverty.

382
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,583
[BOTH]
Huh?

383
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,000
The god of poverty?

384
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,333
Well, she doesn't go by
her title most of the time,

385
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,666
and I can't say that
I blame her, really.

386
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,416
It's not exactly the kind of
thing that makes you popular.

387
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Take my advice on this one, man.

388
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,583
Forget about that girl.
Seriously. Ditch her.

389
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,916
Huh?

390
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,666
[YATO] The god of poverty
only brings disaster.

391
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,708
Spend time with her
and you're basically

392
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,333
asking to have your life ruined.

393
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,666
Oh, and there's one more thing.

394
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,000
She has a guy in her life
you don't want to cross.

395
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,083
[URASAWA sputtering]

396
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,500
And if it helps at all,
she's not nearly

397
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,666
as young as she looks.

398
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,083
We're talkin' way older
than your grandma.

399
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,458
Way older than your grandma's,
grandma's, grandma,

400
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,125
for that matter.

401
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,541
[URASAWA groans]

402
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,916
All right, then!

403
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,125
We'll sever your ties to her
and then you'll be good.

404
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,375
[URASAWA]
Huh?

405
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,083
Sever his ties to her?
But doesn't that mean.

406
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,833
He'll forget everything
having to do with Kofuku.

407
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,166
I don't want to forget her,
though! No, I refuse!

408
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,291
You can't make me agree
to this, can you?

409
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,500
I strongly recommend
you do this.

410
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,500
If you don't, you'll
die very soon.

411
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,666
Well, I'll die then!
You don't understand!

412
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,375
I love her with my whole heart!

413
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,291
How stupid are you?

414
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,958
[URASAWA grunting]

415
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,208
[YATO] Someone who would
end his own life like this

416
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,875
doesn't know a damn
thing about love!

417
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,416
[URASAWA gasps]

418
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,833
[HIYORI] Think we could
hurry this up, please?

419
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,583
It just keeps getting
more and more insane.

420
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,291
[YATO]
All right!

421
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,958
Yukine! You're up, kid.

422
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:52,750
Huh?

423
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:53,916
[YUKINE]
Wait! Hold on!

424
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,750
I've never severed
anyone's ties before.

425
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,583
It'll be fine, don't worry.
I know you can do it.

426
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,458
Have a little faith, okay?

427
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,041
[YATO]
Come, Sekki!

428
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,875
[YATO] Anything you want
me to tell Kofuku?

429
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,083
Just this, please.

430
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:17,041
"I wish you the best.
Have a happy life."

431
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,041
Very well. I've heard
your wish loud and clear.

432
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:20,833
Hear me.

433
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,458
I am the god Yato.

434
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,083
I hereby sever ties.

435
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,541
Sekki!

436
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,708
Sunder!

437
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,875
Uh-Huh?

438
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,958
[KOFUKU]
Oh, wow! Are you serious?

439
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,250
He was really going to do
that just because of me?

440
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,375
I mean, it's not like
I was trying to hurt him.

441
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,416
I wanted to have
a little fun, that's all!

442
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
[ALL]
A little fun?

443
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,833
[DAIKOKU sobbing]
I'm hurt, Kofuku!

444
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,666
I can't believe you would
do that behind my back!

445
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,250
It's your own fault, you know.
I was so sick of you always

446
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,416
telling me where I couldn't
go and what I couldn't do.

447
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,333
[DAIKOKU]
Well, somebody has to!

448
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,333
Or else you'll spread
disaster everywhere!

449
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,666
[DAIKOKU sighing]
I'm too old for this.

450
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,250
Well, anyway,
you got skills, kid.

451
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,583
Severing ties while
you're still a rookie!

452
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,416
Oh. I didn't realize
it was a big deal.

453
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,250
Well, it is.
Severing a bond

454
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,500
is much more difficult
than making one.

455
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,708
And a Regalia's abilities
play a big part

456
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,250
in how well it works, too.

457
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,958
[YUKINE gasps]

458
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,500
It was so easy. I'm really
surprised to hear that.

459
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,458
[DAIKOKU chuckling]
That's the right attitude!

460
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,541
Yato! Looks like you found
yourself a good Regalia.

461
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,541
Yeah, I know.

462
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,875
When I picked him,

463
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,416
I had a feeling he was more
than a pretty face.

464
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,875
Isn't that right, Yukine?

465
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,000
Get off 'a me! Stop, you freak!

466
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,458
[YATO] Aw, no need
to be bashful!

467
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,916
[YUKINE] Quit it!
Leave me alone, sweaty hands!

468
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,250
Sorry about all this.

469
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,416
Thanks a lot for cleaning
up Kofuku's mess.

470
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,416
It was my pleasure!

471
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,333
Later!

472
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,666
[KOFUKU muffled]
Bye for now!

473
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,416
I hope you come back
and visit, Yori!

474
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,000
Sure!

475
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,583
And, um, about what
you said earlier.

476
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,875
[KOFUKU]
Hmm?

477
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,750
When you said Yato
was a scary god.

478
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,583
That was all just a joke, right?

479
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, no. It's true.

480
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,500
[KOFUKU]
It was a long time ago,

481
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,208
but Yatty did kill
a Regalia once.

482
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,833
Before I met him, I'd
only ever heard rumors.

483
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,291
And they weren't exactly
very nice ones.

484
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,291
[KOFUKU] I mean, you gotta keep
in mind Yatty is a god of war.

485
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,750
He kills people, too, sometimes.

486
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,250
[HIYORI]
He kills... people?

487
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,875
[DAIKOKU]
Quit it.

488
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,916
That was a long time ago.

489
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,416
Things were different
then, you know?

490
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,083
It was basically
kill or be killed.

491
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,416
Sorry, I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

492
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,958
The way things work for a god.

493
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,458
People's wishes are what give
gods the ability to exist.

494
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,750
[DAIKOKU] Powerful gods enjoy
constant worship and wishes.

495
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,916
That isn't true for
the obscure gods, though.

496
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,791
They have a hard enough
time even being remembered.

497
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,583
So, what do you do to keep
from being forgotten?

498
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,291
You grant any wish
that comes your way.

499
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,625
No matter what it is.

500
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,375
No matter who it came from.

501
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,250
[HIYORI]
Whatever it is? Really?

502
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,833
[YATO]
You were there a long time.

503
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,291
What were you chatting about?

504
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,375
[HIYORI]
Yato.

505
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,250
Why did you bring
me to meet Kofuku?

506
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,125
I know you had a reason.

507
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,625
[YATO]
Listen.

508
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,291
If anything happens to me.

509
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,250
I want you to go
straight to those two.

510
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,625
Do you understand?

511
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,083
Yeah. Got it!

512
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,541
[HIYORI]
Oh, wow.

513
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,041
Why does he smell so nice?

00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,958
[YATO]
When I picked him,

516
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,875
I had a feeling he was more
than a pretty face.

[NORA]
Hi.

519
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,083
You know, you have
really pretty eyes.

520
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,583
[YATO]
That's enough, Nora.

521
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,208
What do you want?

522
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:22,625
[NORA] For starters, you
could call me by my name.

523
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,875
Please, Yato.

524
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:27,458
It isn't so much to ask,
is it? I love that name.

525
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,791
[HIYORI]
Wait, is this girl...

526
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,166
Is she a Regalia of yours, too?

528
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,125
Remember, whenever you
need me, I'll be waiting.

[water drips]

530
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,958
[NORA] Just waiting for
you to call my name.

531
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:46,125
That's all you have to do.

532
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,958
[YATO] Say "Yato"
ten times, really fast.

533
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,291
[KOFUKU] Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato,
Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato!

534
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,750
[YATO] Now, who's
the coolest guy ever?

535
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,916
[KOFUKU]
Daikoku!

536
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,583
[YATO] Who's the best
god in the world?

537
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,416
[KOFUKU]
Kofuku!

538
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,666
[YATO]
Tch!

539
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,125
[KOFUKU] Next time on
Noragami: "Borderline."
