00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:30,375
[rain falling]
[thunder rolling]

2
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,833
[RABO] My shrine
has grown so neglected.

3
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,125
The world was once
ruled by strife

4
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,625
and filled with countless
vile wishes.

5
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,250
But the etchings here
are those that have

6
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:44,208
been long since fulfilled,
and callers come no more.

7
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,458
[NORA]
Rabo.

8
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,250
And yet... here I stand.

9
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,458
Still alive,
after all this time.

10
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,833
We two are gods
of calamity.

11
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,458
Where we are born
from chaos and suffering,

12
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:59,083
only to be reclaimed
by it.

13
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,000
[rock crumbles]

14
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,666
[RABO] Isn't that so,
Yato god?

Huh?

20
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,125
[BOTH]
What?

21
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,458
[YATO]
You.

22
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,083
[YATO] Why did you come 
along with us, you idiot?

23
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:21,750
[HIYORI]
Huh?

24
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,208
Where are we?

25
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,958
How did we 
get here?

26
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,916
[HIYORI shreaking] And why
do I have a tail?

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,166
What's going on
here?

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,333
[YATO groaning]
Oh, man.

29
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,000
[RABO]
I'm pleased you've come.

[YATO grumbling]

31
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,583
[YATO]
Rabo.

32
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,708
[NORA] They seem to have brought
one uninvited guest.

33
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,250
I swear...

34
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,916
[NORA]
You are nothing but a nuisance.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,708
[YATO]
Hiyori!

36
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,041
[HIYORI]
Huh?

37
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,708
[YATO] You need to get
far away from here!

38
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,541
[RABO]
Well, here we are.

39
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,916
Come at me!

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,291
[YATO]
Sekki!

41
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,333

48
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,750
[YATO] I will
make you return.

49
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,416
Hiyori's memories!

[YATO]
Dammit!

62
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,166
I can't break it
from the inside!

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,125
[RABO sighes]
Furuhime.

65
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:32,458
[RABO] The true Yato god has
yet to return to us.

[YUKINE]
Hiyori?

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,208
[HIYORI]
Ow, that hurt.

73
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,250
Hey, are you okay?

74
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,375
[YATO] Uh-huh. But what
the hell are you doing here?

75
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,041
Didn't I tell you to run?

76
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,791
[YATO grunts]

77
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,416
Still.

78
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,083
I appreciate it.

79
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,458
Sure.

80
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,291
[RABO] What is that
look on his face?

81
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,958
[RABO] That thawed, soft
expression.

82

[RABO]
Where is he?

86
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,541
[YATO]
Huh?

87
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,833
The god of
calamity I knew!

Tell me!

94
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,708
[RABO] With those eyes aflame
with beautiful depravity.

95
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,791
Where is that Yato god?

96
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,500
That's the god of
calamity worthy

97
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,208
of crossing swords
with me!

98
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,791

103

You don't have the
right motivation.

104

I told you
to shut up!

Well Rabo?

Kazuma.

[KAZUMA]
Yes?

127
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,916
[BISHAMON] What did
Lady Kofuku tell you?

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,500
[BISHAMON]
I've got a feeling

129
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,083
that a Vent didn't
cause this Storm.

130
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,708
[KAZUMA]
You're right, Veena.

131
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,083
A Storm like this.

132
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,750
It is the product of
a god of calamity.

133
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,416
[BISHAMON]
A god of calamity?

[YUKINE] What are we
gonna do here, Yato?

140
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,583
[YATO] I want you to take Hiyori
and get away from here.

141
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,000
[YUKINE] Huh?

142
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,291
[YATO] I'm the only one
that Rabo's concerned with.

143
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,708
I'll keep him busy while
you two get out of here.

144
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,416
[YUKINE] What,
you can't be serious?

145
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,250
[YUKINE] You're completely
unarmed without me!

146
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,291
[YATO]
Shut up!

147
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,000

[YUKINE]
What is that?

151
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,541
[YATO] It's the container
holding Hiyori's memories.

152

Huh?

[NORA] Oh, how tragic.

162
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,416
[NORA] The mortal life is
just too fragile.

Yato! There's something
wrong with her!

Hiyori.

[RABO] Forget the girl,
Yato god.

176
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,791
She's been reduced
to nothing more

177
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,583
than a mindless, hollow
container now.

178
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,541

[YATO'S fist clentching]

183
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,000
[YATO]
Rabo.

184
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,708
[RABO] Have I awakened
your hatred?

185
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,541
[RABO]
Finally.

186
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,250
[RABO] Show me your
loathing, fierce deity.

187
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,958
Accept and embrace your
maelstrom of hate.

188
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,333
God of calamity, Yato!

189
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,000
Be quiet.

190
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,666
[YATO]
Sekki!

191
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,083
[chime ringing]

[wet footsteps]

197
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,958
[RABO]
There they are.

198
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,625
Those are the eyes.

199
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,166
Come!

200
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,708
You come to me
 this time.

201
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,666
That grin on
your face?

202
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,333
I'm gonna carve it
into a frown.

203
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,875
[YUKINE]
Yato?

204
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,958
[RABO leaping]

205
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,000
[water splashing]

206
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:57,250

[RABO smirking]

216
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,208
[RABO]
This takes me back.

217
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:36,000
The sky is roiling above
us just as when we lived.

218
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,875
[swords slashing]

219
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,416
[RABO]
We are gods of calamity.

220
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,875
Fierce deities devoted
to heinous wishes and driven

221
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,750
to soak the Near Shore
in the blood of innocence.

222
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,375
[YATO]
Enough talk.

223
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,458
[RABO]
This is it.

224
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,416
The moment I've
been waiting for.

225
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,250
The moment that my very
own wish comes to pass!

226
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,500
[waves crashing]
[YATO yells]

227
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,208
[RABO] My earthly name
is Rabo.

228
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,125
Bearing a posthumous
name, I don this mask.

229
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,000
And proclaim myself
a spirit vessel!

230
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,541
[RABO] Ye names that assemble
cannot defy me.

231
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,083
You are bound and beholden
to my every order!

232
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,666
Submit yourselves
to me!

233
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,625
And obey the mask!

234
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,291
Now gather depravity!

235
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,375
[wind howling]

236
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,958
[YUKINE]
The Storm.

237
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,708
He's absorbing it!

238
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,333
[RABO grunting]

239
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,166
[YATO]
You damn fool.

240
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,875
Are you completely
insane?

241
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,291
Merging your being
with Phantoms?

242
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,375
[RABO demonic voice]
Insane?

243
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,625
Of course not.

244
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,500
I've taken
this action.

245
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,041
In order to fight you
to the death!

246
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,291

[YUKINE]
Look!

259
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,166

[HIYORI thinking]
What's happened to me?

267
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,708
Where am I?

268
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,958
Who am I?

269
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,958
Who am I?

270
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,125
I don't know.

271
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,583
I don't know anything.

272
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,875
This smell.

273
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,541
It seems so familiar.

274
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:32,958
[YUKINE]
Yato!

275
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,000
You okay?

276
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,000
Yato!

[YUKINE]
Rabo.

[YUKINE]
He's coming for us!

280
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:42,666
[YUKINE]
Yato!

281
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,500

Wake up!

[YUKINE echoing]
Yato!

283
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,208
[HIYORI thinking]
It smells so nice.

284
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:57,250
I know I've smelled it
somewhere before.

285
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,791
I know it because...

286
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,833
... it's my favorite smell.

287
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,833

Hey why are you crying?

292
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,583
[HIYORI]
Yato.

293
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,791
[YATO]
You...

294
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,458
You know me.

Hiyori!

298
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,583
[HIYORI]
Huh?

299
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,416
You're okay!

300
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,166
You're back!

301
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:36,833
Ha!

302
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,750
Hiyori!

00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,916
Thank you!

Wh-wh-wh-wha?

305
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,875
[HIYORI shrieking] Get off of me
you creepy deadbeat!

306

[YATO screaming]

307
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,500
[NORA] She broke my spell
completely on her own.

308
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,916
She shouldn't have been
able to uncork her memories

309
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,500
[NORA]
How did she?

310
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,875
[HIYORI]
You cretin!

311
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,958
I expected more
from you!

312
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,541
[YATO]
Hiyori.

313
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,875
You called me...

314
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,333
... by my name.

315
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,583
So?

316
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,666
[YUKINE]
Her memory's back!

317
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,958
[YUKINE]
She knows us!

318
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,416
Well yeah.

319
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,416
Why wouldn't I
know you guys?

[HIYORI screaming]

321
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:21,916

[chime ringing]

325
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,250
[RABO demonic voice]
What will it take

326
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,875
to make you return
to your old self?

327
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,458
We are gods
of calamity!

328
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,916
We grant depraved wishes

329
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
and feed upon
human greed and hate--

330
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,958
So what?

331
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,333
Quit bringin' up
the past!

332
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,291
It doesn't mean
anything now!

333
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,833
[YATO]
Let Hiyori go!

334
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,500
[RABO snarling]

335
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,791
[RABO demonic voice]
It's all your fault.

336
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,958
You're to blame
for his pathetic state!

337
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,291
A pitiful half-Phantom.

338
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,458
You will serve as a
sacrifice for my power!

339
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,708
[YATO]
Sekki!

340
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,500
[chime rings]

341
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,541
We're taking
him out.

342
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,583
[YUKINE]
Huh?

343
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,041
We'll hit Hiyori
from this distance-

344
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,500
It's just like
a Borderline.

345
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,083
[YATO] Rabo's absorbed
a Storm and merged

346
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,875
[YATO] with the
Phantoms within.

347
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,791
It's up to you to draw
the line between

348
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,875
who gets killed
and who survives.

349
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,958
[YUKINE]
What?

350
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,458
It's up to me?

351
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,958
[HIYORI whimpers]

352
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,375
[YATO grunts]

353
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,041
[YATO] You can
do this, Yukine.

354
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,666
[YUKINE grunts]

355
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,125
[YATO]
We can do this.

356
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,708
Together!

357
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,958
[RABO snarling]

358
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,666
[YATO] This is the land
of the rising son.

359
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,250
Your desecrations
shall not be allowed.

360
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,166
Hear me.

361
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,708
I am the god Yato.

362
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,833
I now lay thee waste
with the Sekki

363
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,000
and expel thy
vast defilement!

364
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,666
I cleanse thee!

365
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:53,791
[RABO grunts]

366
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,458
[sword slashes]

367
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,916
[water splashing]

368
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,250
[YATO]
Rend!

369
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,000
[water bubbling]

370
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,541
[twinkling]

371
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,833
[thunder]

372
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,166
[HIYORI screams]

373
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,291
[RABO grunting]

374
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,958
[RABO screaming]

375
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,833
[twinkling]

376
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,916
[HIYORI coughing]

377
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,625
[HIYORI sobbing, running]

378
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,791
[HIYORI]
Yato!

379
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,791
[YATO]
Hiyori!

380
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,458
You alright?

381
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,625
Let's go home.

382
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,416
Let's go home.

383
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,375
Please take me home.

384
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,041
[HIYORI]
Yato!

385
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,875
[RABO]
Yato.

386
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,166
[YATO] You have
made a wish.

387
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,250
Ya-Yato.

388
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,916
And it's been heard
loud and clear.

389
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,208
[RABO]
Yato god!

390
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,375
[chime echoes]

391
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,041
[water splashes]

392
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,000
[RABO faintly]
Yato god.

393
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,000
[YUKINE]
His face!

394
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,750
[YATO] Just
as I thought.

395
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,583
You used a curse
to maintain

396
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,625
your disintegrating
form.

397
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,708
But why?

398
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,708
[RABO] It doesn't matter
how many wishes we grant them.

399
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,500
People always loathe
gods of calamity,

400
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:34,875
and ultimately,
they forget about us.

401
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,875
[RABO] For better
or worse, humans

402
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,541
will always
be fickle creatures.

403
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,416
That is the way
of things.

404
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,208
It is our
inescapable fate

405
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,625
to be slain
by their disregard.

406
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:50,500
And so, when I awoke
from my 500 year slumber...

407
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,166
...I yearned to be killed.

408
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,916
Not by the ignorance
of man,

409
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
but by the hand of one
who does truly know me...

410
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,166
...by you.

411
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,875
[YATO] You've always
been such a downer.

412
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,458
And now,
Yato god...

413
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,500
I go first.

414
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,583
First into the depths
of fate

415
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,291
that you and I
are bound to share.

416
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,541
Except that I'm
nothing like you.

417
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,291
[faint booming]

418
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:24,500
[wind rushing]

419
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,166
[BISHAMON]
A god has been slain.

420
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:33,375
[TENJIN]
Another god lost.

421
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,041
[water drips]

422
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,958
[NORA sighs]

423
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,583
[NORA] Well,
that was a massive failure.

424
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:46,708
[NORA] I guess I'd better go
home and speak with Father.

425
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,500
[YUKINE] So you remember
everything?

426
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,000
[YUKINE]
You remember me and Yato?

427
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,416
[HIYORI]
Yep!

428
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,833
[YUKINE laughing] 
I've gotta ask though.

429
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,125
How did you just suddenly
get your memory back?

430
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,083
[HIYORI]
Huh?

431
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,416
It was because of
Yato's... 

432
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,291
...his smell.

433
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,625
[YUKINE]
His what?

434
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,708
[HIYORI]
Uh.

435
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,291
Never mind, forget it,
it's nothing!

436
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,583
Yeah, I don't know how!

437
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,208
I can't remember
at all!

438
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,291
[HIYORI laughing]

439
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,958
[YUKINE slowly]
Okay.

440
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,708
What's up?

441
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:17,916
[YATO]
Hiyori.

442
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,458
Okay, you're all
serious now.

443
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,250
Just listen.

444
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,208
I think it's for the best
if you cut all ties with us.

445
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,375
That's the only way you'll
really live a happy life.

446
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,291
So.

447
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:35,958
[YUKINE]
What?

448
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:36,833
Hey, hold on!

449
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,958
No, I'm not
gonna do that.

450
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,375
We're friends.

451
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:45,041
There's no way I'd be happy
without you guys in my life.

452
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,791
[KOFUKU]
Wow!

453
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,083
[KOFUKU] Yatty and Yukki really
mean that much to you?

454
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,666
[KOFUKU]
Are you sure about that?

455
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,458
[YATO] She's just being stubborn
for the sake of being stubborn.

456
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,500
[HIYORI]
That is not true.

457
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,375
[HIYORI]
I mean it.

458
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm not turning
my back on you.

459
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,666
I wanna be with
you forever.

460
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,333
You're the only one who wants
to cut ties here, Yato.

461
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,875
[KOFUKU laughing]
How romantic!

462
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,375
[DAIKOKU]
We need booze!

463
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,583
It's time to celebrate!

464
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,000
[HIYORI]
Uh, wait!

465
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,583
I didn't mean I wanna
be with you forever like that,

466
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,250
not in that way!

467
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,791
[YATO] I'll grant
your wish... 

468
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,750
...for five yen. 

469
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,416
Pay up!

470
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,250
[HIYORI giggles]

471
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:41,583
You've made a wish and it's
been heard, loud and clear.

472
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,166
Hiyori Iki.

473
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,916
May our fates
forever intertwine.
