[YATO wailing] What the hell
is going on here?

20
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,791
[KOFUKU muffled] 
Sounds like Yatty and Yukki

21
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,666
have finally made
their way home.

22
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,083
[DAIKOKU] Yeah, when
exactly did those two

23
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,541
become a part 
of our household?

24
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,875
[YATO shouting] This doesn't
make sense, what's happening? 

25
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,041
[YUKINE]Think you
could try to calm down?

26
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:09,916
Seriously.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,833
Calm down? 

28
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,291
But what's wrong 
with Hiyori? 

29
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,166
[HIYORI] 
Uh, Yukine.

30
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,958
This guy you're with...

31
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,291
Who is he?

32
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,791
[YUKINE] 
What do you mean?

33
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,333
[YATO laughing] Nice one,
Hiyori, now quit jokin' around.

34
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,458
C'mon, it's me, 
ya dummy!

35
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,916
Meyadummy.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,208
That's your name?

37
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,583
Yeah!

38
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,583
[YATO in Italian accent]
Mister Meyadummy!

39
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,875
That's'a me! 

40
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,833
Well that was 
a stupid accent! 

41
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,000
[YATO laughing]

42
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,500
So, Yukine?

43
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,875
He's a friend 
of yours?

44
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,583
Is he a comedian 
or something?

45
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,250
[BOTH]
Huh?

46
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,166
[YUKINE] It's gotta be
some form of amnesia.

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,125
[YATO wailing]
It must be!

48
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,500
The really weird
thing about it is that

49
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,833
the only thing she seems
to have forgotten is you.

50
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,541
[YATO wailing]
What do we do?

51
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,500
For starters,
quit freaking out.

52
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,500
I bet it's just
a temporary condition.

53
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sure she'll
remember you soon.

54
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,791
[YATO] 
No.

55
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,333
No what?

56
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,000
I will make Hiyori
normal again.

57
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:12,166
[YATO blowing whistle]

58
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,250
[YATO]
That's it!

59
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,333
Follow me this way!

60
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,958
[HIYORI] I was actually
just dropping by

61
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,333
to give you these
old reference books to study.

62
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,000
[YUKINE] I know, but just
humor him, will ya?

63
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,791
If I can direct your
attention to the left.

64
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,541
This street!

65
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,125
This famous street.

66
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,083
This is the very location
where the god Yato

67
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,416
met a certain girl
while rescuing Milord!

68
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,625
[ALL] Huh?

69
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,500
[HIYORI] A lord used to
live around here?

70
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,916
That's cool.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,250
I had no idea there was
so much history to this street.

72
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,000
[YATO and YUKINE
exasperated sighing]

73
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,833
[YUKINE] I don't think that's
jogging her memory.

74
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,291
[YATO growling]

75
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,166
Do you know his name,
Mr. Yato?

76
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,333
The lord.

77
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:47,791
"Mr. Yato"?

78
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,166
It's Yato!

79
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,541
There's no "mister"!

80
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,541
You only call me
Yato!

81
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,041
[HIYORI]
Okay.

82
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,916
It just seems kind of rude
to call you that right away.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,583
[YATO frustrated grunting]

84
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,458
I'll show you,
Hiyori!

85
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,416
Hey!

86
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,833
Quit drawing
in my books!

87
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,083
[YATO]
This is Milord!

88
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,000
He's a cat!

89
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,958
Oh, wow.

90
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:10,791
That's great!

91
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,541
You're talented,
Mr. Yato.

92
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,750
[YATO] I'm trying to show you
the drawing, not my artistry!

93
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,500
Oh, that's right.

94
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,083
Milord was the name
of the cat that you drew.

95
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,333
You remember
the cat?

96
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,750
So, do you 
remember me then?

97
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,458
Let me think.

98
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,833
You're a
manga artist?

99
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,500
[YATO groans]

100
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,458
I'm sorry, but
I really need to get going.

101
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,625
[HIYORI]
Do you mind if we

102
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,500
do your lessons
another time, Yukine?

103
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,000
I've put your homework
assignments in here 

104
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,500
until we can meet.

105
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,541
[YUKINE]
Sure.

106
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,708
Thanks.

107
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,875
See ya.

108
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,541
Wait!

109
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,916
Please, Hiyori.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,833
Do you really not
remember me?

111
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,625
Just try to think.

112
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,541
Is there 
nothing there?

113
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,666
In that case...

114
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,166
[HIYORI gasps]

115
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,208
[YATO whispering] Let's get
into bed together.

116
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,333
That just might help
you remember when

117
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,375
we met at 
the hospital--

118
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:10,666
[HIYORI shouting]
Pervert!

119
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,833
[YATO wailing]

120
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,458
[KOFUKU] Yatty and Yukki
wanted us

121
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,666
to put some dinner aside
for them to eat later.

122
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,916
[DAIKOKU] Right.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,083
Meals are the one thing
they never seem to miss.

124
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,208
[YUKINE] A picture book
of her memories?

125
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,166
After everything else,

126
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,750
you really think
that's gonna work?

127
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,666
[YATO]
Yes!

128
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,833
It will!

129
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,333
You saw how she
reacted earlier!

130
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:36,291
The drawing of Milord clearly
woke something inside her!

131
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,666
Now quit naysaying and
help me here!

132
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,666
Whatever.

133
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,500
You can make your own
coloring book.

134
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,958
[water splashing]

135
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,625
[HIYORI sighing]

136
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,291
[HIYORI thinking]
It's weird.

137
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,333
That guy seemed so desperate.

138
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,041
I wonder why it's
so important to him.

139
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,708
[HIYROI sighing]

140
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,375
[water dripping]

141
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,500
[YATO] Alright!

142
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,625
I've got all the tools
for a vivid picture book!

143
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,708
It won't be long now!

144
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,208
[YUKINE] Man, I can't believe
you threw away

145
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,416
what little money you had
on some stupid art supplies.

146
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,541
Anything for the
sake of Hiyori!

147
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,416
Now that I
think about it.

148
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,583
Maybe something specific
caused this.

149
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,583
[water dripping]

150
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,250
Yato?

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,166
What's wrong?

152
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,875
[chimes ringing]

153
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,541
[YUKINE gasps]

154
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,375
I should have known

155
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,250
you were somehow
behind this. Nora.

156
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,916
[YUKINE gasps]

157
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,250
[NORA] Behind what, Yato?

158
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,291
Erasing Hiyori's
memories of you?

159
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,416
It was actually
rather easy.

160
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
There's no reason for her
to retain memories

161
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,708
of Far Shore denizens
in her simple mind.

162
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,958
It seems that people are

163
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,000
quick to forget
that they've ever met you.

164
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,541
Wouldn't you agree?

165
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,875
No matter how much
you grant humans' wishes,

166
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,166
their behavior is always
so fickle and erratic.

167
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,000
Poor Yato, don't you ever
get tired of being hurt so much?

168
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,208
Why keep putting
yourself through it?

169
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:20,583
Wouldn't it be easier to
simply embrace your true self?

170
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,833
Yato!

171
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:22,875
Snap out of it!

172
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,083
Don't let her
mess with your head!

173
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,750
You're right.

174
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,625
Fine, Nora
just what the hell

175
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,125
are you scheming
this time?

176
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,708
[NORA giggles]

177
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,625
I only wanted
to get your attention

178
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,333
to make sure that you
haven't forgotten us, Yato.

179
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,791
[YATO gasping]

180
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,458
[RABO]
Reiki.

181
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,541
[chimes ringing]

182
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,625
[BOTH gasp]

183
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,791
You.

184
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,208
It can't be.

185
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,875
[YATO]
Rabo!

186
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,541
How are 
you alive?

187
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,250
[RABO] It's been a
long time, Yato god.

188
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,583
[YUKINE]
Who is he?

189
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,041
That's a cute sun visor
you're wearing.

190
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,625
[chimes ringing]

191
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,291
Let's begin.

192
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:10,875
[wind rushing]

193
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,250
[YATO shouting]
Come. Sekki!

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,333
[markers clattering]

195
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,000
[swords clanging]

196
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,958
[swords slashing]

197
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:29,416
[YATO grunting]

198
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,416
[YUKINE] Whoa!

199
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,541
You actually wanna
kill this guy?

200
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,666
[YATO] If I hold back
even a little bit

201
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,333
he'll kill me right away. 

202
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,541
[water bubbling] 

203
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,208
[water rushing]

204
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,416
[YATO grunting]

205
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,083
[YUKINE grunting]

206
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,125
[YATO panting]

207
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,583
[YATO grunting]

208
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,250
[leaves rustling]

209
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,625
[sword slashing]

210
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,500
[RABO smirking]

211
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,166
[water bubbling]

212
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,250
[YATO]
Damn!

213
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,916
He's as fast as always!

214
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:24,291
[swords clanging]

215
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,583
[swords rattling]
[YATO groaning]

216
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,625
[RABO]
Yato god.

217
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,625
What has become of you?

218
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,833
[RABO] This is not the power
of the god I once knew.

219
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,458
You must remember.

220
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,833
[YATO gasps]

221
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,541
[RABO]
You must remember.

222
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:46,666
You must remember...

223
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,750
[RABO shouting] 
You must remember!

224
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,250
[YUKINE shouting]
Yato!

225
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,916
[sword grinding]

226
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,625
[YUKINE]
Yato, are you okay?

227
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,666
[YUKINE]
Yato!

228
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,333
[chimes ringing]

229
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,333
[KAZUMA]
As for the next report--

230
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,125
[BISHAMON]
What is this?

231
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:17,083
[suspenseful music]

232
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,250
[TENJIN]
What's happening?

233
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,125
[swords clanging]

234
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:25,583
[YATO shouting]

235
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,250
[YUKINE groaning]
Yato.

236
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,083
[YATO]
Yukine!

237
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,750
[sword scraping]

238
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,458
[RABO]
There's no doubt.

239
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:38,000
The Yato god I knew
is a thing of the past.

240
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,500
Furuhime.

241
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,458
[chimes ringing]

242
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:46,458
[NORA]
I know, but now you see.

243
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,333
Listen, Yato.
[thunder and wind rushing]

244
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,541
I'd like to see you defeat Rabo.

245
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,833
If you do.

246
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,291
[NORA] I'll return
Hiyori Iki's memory to her.

247
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,791
[YATO and YUKINE gasping]

248
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,083
[NORA] And that's a promise.

249
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,875
[NORA laughing]

250
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,541
[wind rushing]

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,250
[KAZUMA] So, as far as this
sudden storm goes?

252
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,875
[DAIKOKU]
Nope.

253
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,500
[DAIKOKU] I'm afraid my lady's
got nothin' to do with it.

254
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,750
You're the first
god I come to

255
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,000
when a Vent 
randomly opens.

256
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,416
I never would've thought
Yato was involved.

257
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,958
[YUKINE]
It was brutal.

258
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,166
We couldn't even come close
to taking down this Rabo guy.

259
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,500
[KOFUKU]
Rabo, huh?

260
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,250
[DAIKOKU] I've never
heard of the dude.

261
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,291
A god of calamity.

262
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,208
Nobody has spoken
his name in ages now.

263
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,791
[KAZUMA] But he was apparently
well-known long ago.

264
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,583
[MAYU] Then you
know him, master?

265
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,375
[TENJIN] Rabo was in fact
originally human.

266
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,750
As I recall, in his life,
he served as a Herald.

267
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,041
What's a Herald?

268
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,166
A minion who
sneaks into enemy land.

269
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,875
A thug who carries out
dirty work.

270
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,625
[TENJIN] Once a Herald
finishes his work,

271
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,791
his master kills him
to ensure his silence.

272
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,500
Seriously?

273
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,833
[KAZUMA]
Apparently.

274
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,083
He was deified
after he was murdered,

275
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,333
and turned into
a god of calamity.

276
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,083
[YUKINE] Wait, what's a
god of calamity?

277
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,833
People don't always ask
the gods for good things.

278
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,208
There are bad wishes.

279
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,083
[YUKINE]
Really?

280
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,416
Like what?

281
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,791
The destruction of someone
you hate, for example.

282
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,500
A god of calamity hears
these wicked requests.

283
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,250
[KAZUMA] 
and fulfills them.

284
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,875
[TENJIN] Rabo favored
senseless murder

285
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,916
[TENJIN] as his particular
method in granting these wishes.

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,208
[TENJIN] There's no
discernment to his actions.

287
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,500
[TENJIN]
He kills Phantoms.

288
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,583
[TENJIN]
He kills humans.

289
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,083
[KAZUMA] And he's even
been known to kill gods.

290
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,083
[KAZUMA]
On request.

291
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,541
[YUKINE]
Wha--?

292
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:47,625
[YUKINE] What does someone
like that want with Hiyori?

293
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,041
[DAIKOKU] I'm guessing
he's an old pal of Yato's?

294
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,125
I have heard
certain rumors.

295
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:59,875
[KAZUMA] Yato did allegedly
partner with a god of calamity.

296
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,833
[YATO] Rabo hasn't
changed at all.

297
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,333
He's just as powerful.

298
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,333
If I'm not careful,
he might kill Yukine.

299
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,458
[TSUYU]
How is he?

300
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,208
Shouldn't simply
existing be a struggle

301
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,125
for a god of calamity
like him?

302
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,000
[YUKINE]
What?

303
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,333
[YUKINE]
Hold on a minute!

304
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,541
You're telling me
that those two worked together?

305
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,500
Does that mean--?

306
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,166
Is Yato a god of calamity too?

307
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,833
I didn't even know--

308
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,208
[KOFUKU] Yori knows
something about it.

309
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,916
[KOFUKU] I mentioned it
to her once before.

310
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,458
[DAIKOKU]
That's right.

311
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,625
And she didn't seem to have
any problems with it, either.

312
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,541
That girl.

313
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,166
She's one tough cookie, ya know?

314
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,375
Yatty's different
than he used to be.

315
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,958
Which is why Yori's
stuck by his side.

316
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,750
I think it's pretty
obvious at this point

317
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,416
that Yori really
loves you and Yatty.

318
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,916
[YUKINE]
I...

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,041
I have to get
her memories back for her.

320
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,583
[YATO]
She'll never remember me.

321
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,041
Not at this rate.

322
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,083
[TENJIN] Perhaps it's
for the best if she doesn't.

323
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,333
As I've said before, you should
 cut your ties with her.

324
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,583
[TENJIN] Your connection
gives her too much

325
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,708
of a direct focus on
the events of our world.

326
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,750
It will eventually keep
her from living in her own.

327
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,625
Forgetting you could be
the best thing to happen to her.

328
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,791
She'll likely revert
back to her fully human state.

329
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,625
And she'll never
be happy as a half-Phantom.

330
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,958
[YATO walking]

331
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,625
[TSUYU] He appears to have
made up his mind.

332
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,708
[MAYU]
Poor Yato.

333
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,541
[water rushing]

334
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,125
[YUKINE]
Yato!

335
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,666
Where have you 
been all night?

336
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,625
Listen to this.

337
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,791
I was thinking about
Hiyori's mem-

338
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:40,041
[YATO]
Forget it.

339
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,166
Just forget 
about Hiyori.

340
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,125
What?

341
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:43,791
Hey!

342
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:48,458
Yato! Yato!

343
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:53,708
[hydraulics moving]

344
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,000
[RABO]
We must act quickly.

345
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,500
The longer we wait,
the more remorseless

346
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,291
the passage of 
time becomes.

347
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,541
[NORA]
You worry too much.

348
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,541
[NORA] Yato will
return very soon.

349
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,208
I'm sure of it.

350
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,625
[KOFUKU]
And then!

351
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,458
[door slams]

352
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,375
Yukki!

353
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,041
Have you seen 
Yatty yet?

354
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,750
[YUKINE]
What the hell?

355
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,458
What's wrong
with Yato now?

356
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,125
This doesn't make sense.

357
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,791
Why now?

358
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,750
[page flapping]

359
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,250
[HIYORI thinking]
I drew this.

360
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,750
But how?

361
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,291
The only way I could have
is if I do know him.

362
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:50,083
But if I do,
why can't I remember him?

363
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,250
[phone vibrating]

364
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,916
[HIYORI out loud]
It's Yukine.

365
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,625
[YUKINE]
Hiyori!

366
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,208
[YUKINE panting]

367
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,250
Hey.

368
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,208
Sorry I'm late.

369
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,083
[HIYORI]
No big.

370
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,750
So what's up?

371
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,041
[YUKINE]
For you.

372
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,166
Wow, a picture book!

373
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,833
So did you make it?

374
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,750
Can I read it
to you?

375
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,416
Uh-huh.

376
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,958
[YUKINE clears throat]

377
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:25,750
[YUKINE]
Here we go.

378
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,500
This is the
story of Yato,

379
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,375
the tracksuit-wearing god
and his friend Hiyori.

380
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,625
[YUKINE]
Now let the tale begin!

381
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,916
[YATO]
Dammit, Yukine.

382
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,583
He's with Hiyori again.

383
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,083
[YUKINE] And on his
very first try,

384
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,041
the gifted Regalia
drew a Borderline.

385
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,166
[HIYROI]
That's so cool!

386
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,583
You really are
amazing, Yukine.

387
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:52,000
Even Yato was surprised
when I did it.

388
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:52,916
Really?

389
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,875
He was?

390
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,958
Uh, yeah.

391
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,625
Moving on.

392
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,916
[NORA]
Yato.

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,583
Do you recognize this?

394
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,791
[YUKINE] So the ablution
was a success.

395
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,875
All thanks to
Yato and Hiyori.

396
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,708
[YUKINE] If neither of you
had been there for me.

397
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:32,458
Then I might not have
been able to come back.

398
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:36,791
[YUKINE]
And that's how...

399
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:42,708
[YUKINE trembling]
That's how...

400
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,583
[YUKINE] And that's how
Hiyori, Yato, and I...

401
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,250
[YUKINE]
...all became best friends.

402
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:59,125
[HIYORI clapping]

403
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,041
[HIYORI] I'm sorry,
but I still don't have

404
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,458
any memories
of Mr. Yato.

405
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:08,875
Although, it does sound like
we really are good friends.

406
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,625
Yeah!

407
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,000
So, I was wondering.

408
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,041
If you don't mind and all,
could I have that book?

409
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:15,916
Huh?

410
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,916
Uh, y'see,
the thing--

411
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,125
I just kind of
feel like

412
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,791
if I keep looking
at it over and over,

413
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,708
it might help me remember
what I've forgotten.

414
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,375
[YUKINE]
If you think so.

415
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,791
[NORA] The lunar cycle
is waning.

416
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,375
[NORA]
Tell me, Yato.

417
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,125
[NORA] Where do you suppose the
waning part of the moon goes?

418
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,708
[YATO]
Where does it go?

419
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,375
[water dripping]

420
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,166
[YUKINE]
You okay?

421
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,125
Hiyori--

422
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,291
[HIYORI]
Um.

423
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,833
Is this yours?

424
00:19:51,916 --> 00:20:03,458
[train rattling]

425
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,875
[YUKINE panting]

426
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,416
[YATO groaning]
Yukine.

427
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,083
What the hell
have you done, Nora?

428
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,875
[NORA] Hiyori's memory
is waning bit by bit,

429
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,041
falling away
into total darkness.

430
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,916
If you don't come
see us, and soon,

431
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,666
[NORA] she'll end up as nothing
but an empty vessel.

432
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:32,958
[water rushing]

433
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,333
[YUKINE trembling]
Hiyori.

434
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,041
She's forgotten 
about me now.

435
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:41,666
[YUKINE sobbing]
She doesn't remember me!

436
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,166
[YATO]
Yukine.

437
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,708
We're going to get
her memory back.

438
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:48,833
It's just...

439
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,291
Going up against
them again

440
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,416
could very likely
destroy you.

441
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,250
Yato.

442
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,125
[YATO] Not only that,
but I might give them

443
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,291
exactly what 
they want.

444
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,833
[YUKINE] You have to
believe in yourself.

445
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,875
That is what you
told me, right?

446
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,625
[YUKINE sniffling]

447
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:13,208
[water flowing]

448
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,375
[pages flapping]

449
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:20,208
[HIYROI] Is that
supposed to be me?

450
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,708
Why do I have a tail?

451
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,833
[HIYORI'S MOM]
Hiyori!

452
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,541
[HIYORI'S MOM]
Time to go!

453
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:31,708
[rain falling]

454
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,208
[YUKINE]
Hiyori!

455
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,208
[HIYORI]
Uh, yeah?

456
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,666
[YUKINE]
I'm sorry.

457
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,458
I shouldn't have freaked out
on you like that earlier.

458
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,916
Really.

459
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,125
You're the one who's being
tormented through all this.

460
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,500
[YUKINE]
The thing is.

461
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,500
[YUKINE] We've dragged you into
something terrible.

462
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,041
[YUKINE]
Actually.

463
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,250
[YUKINE] It's Yato's crappy
history that's to blame here.

464
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,791
But, he is still my master,
and his problems are...

465
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,250
...well they're
 my problems, too.

466
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,208
Do I have to do
 all the talking?

467
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,500
[YATO] I promise that
we will get your memory back,

468
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,583
so you just
rest easy and wait.

469
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,250
Okay?

470
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,416
[YUKINE]
Hiyori?

471
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,166
[YUKINE]
What's wrong?

472
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,708
I'm actually
not sure.

473
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,958
I don't know why
I'm crying.

474
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:27,291
[YATO]
Enough of that.

475
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,208
Let's go. 

476
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,625
[HIYORI gasping]

477
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,291
[ringing]

478
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,875
[wet thudding]

479
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,625
[rain falling]

480
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,625
[YATO singing]
Dun-duh-dun!

481
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:22,708
[YATO] It's time for
your Regalia midterms!

482
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,166
[YATO] List ten good
things about me!

483
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,416
[YUKINE]
Ten?

484
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,333
[YATO] You're already
failing! Try for five.

485
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,750
[YUKINE]
Five?

486
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,000
[YATO] Next time on Noragami:
"A Scrap of a Memory."

487
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,583
Fine, just the best three!

488
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,041
[YUKINE] I'm sorry, but
I can't think of any.

489
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,541
[YATO] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Are you serious?
