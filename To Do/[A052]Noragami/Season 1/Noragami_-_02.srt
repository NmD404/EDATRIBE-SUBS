your soul and consume it,

and once you're possessed by
a Phantom you lose who you are.

will you get to my job?

180
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,333
Huh?

181
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,333
Soon enough.

182
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,583
I told you to
sit tight, didn't I?

183
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,500
You've been telling me
that since last week.

184
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,666
I'm sick of waiting!

185
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,666
Oh, last week, huh?

186
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,958
Well here's
a proposition, then.

187
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,125
Call me "Lord Yato."
It'll show some respect.

188
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,458
Do that for
an entire week

189
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,916
and I'll consider
starting your job.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,041
I mean, seriously,
who calls a god

191
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,541
by his first
name, anyway?

192
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,041
I could call you
something else.

193
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,000
Fine the truth is I'm
not at 100 % right now.

194
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't take on a big job.

195
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,833
Not until I find a Regalia.

196
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,000
[HIYORI] Okay, and what
exactly is a Regalia?

197
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,916
[YATO]
Regalias are tools.

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,041
They serve as
weapons for gods.

199
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:21,041
When I have a Regalia
I can cut down anything.

200

[YATO gasps]

201
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,958
Did you lose it?

202
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,916
Lose a Regalia?

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,083
No, she qui--

204
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,000
I fired her.

205
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,458
Regalias are people?

206
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,833
Well, they're spirits.

207
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,125
Oh.

208
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,166
Really?

209
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,625
Hello!

I'm fast and affordable!

212

Need help, you say?

213
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,041
I'll be right there!

214
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,083
Wait!

215
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:55,791
I do not like that guy.

216

I got everything I need.

217
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,583
Why should I bother
getting some dumb job?

218
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,500
I don't need work.

219
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,708
My parents support me.

[HIYORI'S MOM]
Do you see them, Hiyori?

221
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,916
Those are "lazy bums".

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,625
Scary, aren't they?

223
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,416
Working is for losers

who don't have
anything better to do.

225
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:13,708
I mean, it's not
like I can't get a job,

226
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,958
it's just that I don't want to.

227
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,250
Besides, by not working,
I'm leaving a job free

228
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:16,708
for somebody else out there
who needs it more.

229
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,541
That's it!

warning me about.

But what now?

Yep.

If you stick it on
the wall like this,

255
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,333
you can get all the mold off

256

without having
it drip everywhere.

a day before rinsing it off.

on how things first appear.

That's not cool!

360
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,583
That's your worry?

361
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,083
Listen, human!

362
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,041
You're out of your league
trying to fight that Phantom.

363
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,250
Don't do anything
like that again!

364
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,541
But you said
yourself that you can't do

365
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,416
anything without
a Regalia, right?

366
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,416
Back off!

367
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,333
I've been trying
to find one, okay?

368
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,041
I have to--

369
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,250
A young boy.

370
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:08,000
Not so young... looks to
be in his teens, I'd say.

371
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,000
A difficult enough
age for anybody.

372
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,291
Smells nice!

373
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,250
Uh, Yato.

374
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,541
I think he'll do.

375
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,541
Smells nice!

376
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,625
Spirit, you are lost and adrift.

377
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,208
You have nowhere to go
and nowhere to return to.

378
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,291
Thus, I grant you
a place to belong.

379
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,708
My name is Yato.

380
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,000
Bearing two names,
you shall remain here.

381
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,791
With these names,
I make thee my servant.

382
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,875
With these names I use my life
to make thee a Regalia,

383
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,791
fit to be wielded by a god.

384
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,083
Thou art Yuki!

385
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,291
As Regalia, Sekki!

386
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,916
Come Sekki!

387
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,291
A sword?

388
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,375
Yato!

389
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:57,166
No! Yato!

390
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,958
[YATO] This is the land
of the rising sun.

391
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,833
Your desecrations
shall not be allowed.

392
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:06,833
Hear me.

393
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,291
I am the god Yato.

394
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,250
I now lay thee
waste with the Sekki

395
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,625
and expel thy vast defilement!

396
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,000
I cleanse thee!

397
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,625
Rend!

398
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,208
That's so...

399
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,166
Wait, was he just crying?

400
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,750
[HIYORI] I found my body
and brought it back!

401
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,916
It's so cold!

402
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,041
What are you doing?

403
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,166
I have to cleanse
the blight from my hand.

404
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,541
So all it takes
is a little water?

405
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,083
This day wasn't
a total waste, after all.

406
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,708
It's a lucky thing we ran
into an uncorrupted spirit.

407
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,208
Really lucky.

408
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,541
The blade's
the perfect length.

409
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,375
Wow!

410
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,583
So that's a Regalia!

411
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,208
Cool!

412
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,625
It's looks sharp
and shiny.

413
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,000
Which I'm guessing is good.

414
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,541
Sure is. Name's Yuki.

415
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,458
Or, less formally, Yukine.

416
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,375
Whoa!

417
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,375
It became a boy!

418
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,041
Yukine.

419
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,375
I am Yato.

420
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,333
I'm your master now.

421
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:04,375
I summoned you here from
the Far Shore to be my Regalia.

422
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,291
You will remain by my side.

423
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,791
You need not return
from whence you came.

424
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,416
Take this.

425
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:12,916
Go on.

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,416
You've nothing to fear.

427
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,291
[YUKINE] I don't
want a stinky tracksuit.

428
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,250
Um, well, take this.

429
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,708
It's cold out here.

430
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,625
Can we get
inside, already?

431
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,291
Hey. You hear me?

432
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,958
[YATO]
Are you cold?

433
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,583
You can put on my
fluffy-fluff scarf.

434
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,083
[HIYORI] Thanks for
the offer, really.

435
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,000
But I think I'm okay.

436
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,958
Next time, on Noragami:
"Bidden Calamity."

437
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,625
Oh, go on, just
take the scarf.

438
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm gonna pass.
