1
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,541
I seriously gotta
wear this garbage?

2
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,208
[YATO] Quit yer complainin'.

3
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,583
Here! Check it out!
This one's kinda cool.

4
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,083
[YUKINE] That's so lame.

5
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,791
Fine, I'll wear it then!

6
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:47,166
I wonder why I still feel
all this physical stuff.

7
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:57,666
It doesn't make sense,

8
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,083
considering how long
I've been dead.

9
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:32,916
[YATO] This looks like
a good spot to eat.

10
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:36,916
[YATO] Eat up.

11
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:41,916
Is this a joke?

12
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,958
Ya said you were
hungry, now didn't ya?

13
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:46,958
So don't be a snob
and eat your lunch.

14
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:48,875
You call this lunch?

15
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:51,333
[YATO] Get this straight:
You're my Regalia.

16
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:53,750
I'm your master
and what I say goes!

17
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:57,250
[CAT screeching]

18
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,708
Your Regalia, huh?

19
01:02:58,791 --> 01:02:59,958
[YATO] Yup!

20
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:01,625
And I deserve nothin'
but respect from you!

21
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:03,000
Worship me!

22
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,291
[CAT meows angrily]

23
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:07,041
You loyally serve your
master's every demand!

24
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,083
[coughing]

25
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,791
You could at least
serve us some tea, y'know!

26
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:16,041
With what stove
and what tea, exactly?

27
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,291
This backtalk is not gonna fly!

28
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,083
I demand obedience!

29
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:22,208
[YATO yelling]

30
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,500
[YATO]
You're ripping out my hair!

31
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:25,208
Get off me,
you vicious little monster!

32
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:28,083
[YUKINE] I never would've
dreamed this is how a god lives,

33
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:30,833
drifting around town
like some kind of bum,

34
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:33,416
sleeping out on the stone
steps of some old shrine

35
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,000
just to avoid attention,

36
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,083
and digging through
garbage every day

37
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,875
just to find some food.

38
01:03:44,166 --> 01:03:45,541
That's your strategy?

39
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:47,875
Gotta advertise.

40
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,750
For jobs that never come?

41
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:54,208
[stomachs growling]

42
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:59,000
Are you positive
that you're a real god?

43
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:01,291
That's rude. You doubt me?

44
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:07,083
All right, then.

45
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:09,333
I'll show you what I can do.

46
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:11,333
[door chiming]

47
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,583
[WAITRESS 3A]
Welcome. Good afternoon!

48
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:18,833
Hiyori's offered
to buy us some grub

49
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:21,333
all because she
appreciates my services.

50
01:04:21,416 --> 01:04:23,000
[YUKINE]
This feels like extortion to me.

51
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,333
After you eat,

52
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:27,333
I expect you to finally
take my request seriously.

53
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:38,458
[WAITRESS 3A]
Hey! Good afternoon.

54
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,875
Can I get you anything to drink?

55
01:04:39,958 --> 01:04:42,250
[YATO] Yeah, how 'bout
two more glasses of water?

56
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,500
[WAITRESS 3A] Huh?

57
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:47,458
[WAITRESS 3A] Oh!
I'm so sorry, I didn't see you!

58
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,291
I thought you were
invisible to other people,

59
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:53,416
considering that you're
not human and all.

60
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,875
Not quite.

61
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,541
[YATO]
We're not actually invisible.

62
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:59,875
We're just hard for people to
notice, but they can see us.

63
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,291
[YATO] Let me ask you this.

64
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:05,708
How many waitresses
are working in here?

65
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,750
Huh?

66
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:09,583
[YATO]
Don't look, that's cheating.

67
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,333
Um, I guess...

68
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:12,666
Like, two?

69
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,375
Whoa, there's four of them?

70
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,916
And it's the same with us.

71
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,791
Yukine and I just kind of
blend in with the background,

72
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,166
just like those
other waitresses.

73
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,916
And if someone does notice us,

74
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,833
we look like normal,
boring people.

75
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:28,958
They quickly forget
they ever saw us.

76
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,750
[WAITRESS 3A]
I apologize again about that!

77
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:33,458
[YATO] Think about it like this.

78
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:34,875
You don't remember
every stranger

79
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,083
you've ever passed
on the street, right?

80
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,000
[YATO] Being from the Far Shore,

81
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:44,458
we're like the ultimate
stranger, so it's stronger.

82
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,125
[HIYORI]
Well it's pretty noticeable

83
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:57,250
how much food you eat.

84
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,458
Never let an
offering go to waste!

85
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,708
An important rule!

86
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,708
You're gonna make
yourself sick, you know.

87
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:07,166
[YATO] Oh, I'll be fine,
gods don't need to poop!

88
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,458
[WAITRESS 3A]
Thank you! Come again!

89
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:13,416
[HIYORI] Jeez!
He's really got some nerve!

90
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,708
So, uh, thanks
for the food and all.

91
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:25,958
No problem.

92
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:27,833
I'm Hiyori Iki, by the way.

93
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:29,916
You can just call me Hiyori.

94
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,750
[YUKINE] So how do
you know him, Hiyori?

95
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,958
[HIYORI] Um, well...

96
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:37,666
[HIYORI] I kind of
sometimes lose my body now,

97
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,083
so I'm hoping he can
help me fix that.

98
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,541
Sucks to be you, huh?

99
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:44,666
I guess so.

100
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,750
[laughs awkwardly]

101
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:49,791
[HIYORI] Um, so what about you?

102
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:53,125
How did you, um...

103
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:58,250
Y'know, what'd you do
before you were Yato's Regalia?

104
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:02,291
[YUKINE] Well...

105
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:04,083
...I dunno. I mean,

106
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:05,958
I do know that I died,

107
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:09,000
but I can only recall
suddenly being in his hand.

108
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:10,708
And that's all I can remember.

109
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:12,375
Nothing from when I was alive,

110
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,791
and I don't know what
to expect now, either.

111
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:20,625
[YUKINE] Hey, you're that
sardine thief from earlier.

112
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:23,500
[YUKINE] Good boy.

113
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:24,583
[HIYORI] He likes you.

114
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:26,000
Do you like cats?

115
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,708
[YUKINE] It seems like it.

116
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:30,416
Well cats are
really cute, huh?

117
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,125
I like them, too.

118
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:39,333
[YATO shouts]

119
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:42,208
[YATO] Yukine...

120
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,375
You just had a rather
filthy thought, didn't you?

121
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:47,416
[YATO] Listen up, kid,
just so you know,

122
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,250
gods and Regalias
share mind and body.

123
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,708
So as your master,
you subject me

124
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:54,875
to every one
of your pervy thoughts.

125
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:56,500
Keep our minds
out of the gutter!

126
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:57,750
[YUKINE] Huh?

127
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,333
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

128
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:02,083
[HIYORI] Wait, what do you
mean you share mind and body?

129
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:03,625
Man, you kids.

130
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:06,708
I know puberty's rough, but
try to have a little control.

131
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,125
Shut your mouth, you idiot!

132
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,583
[YATO] Hey, who do you think
you're callin' an idiot?

133
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:11,250
This is not exactly
how I pictured

134
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,291
a wish-granting god to act.

135
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:15,833
--[PHONE ringing]
--Not at all.

136
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:16,916
[YATO] Hello!

137
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,250
Thanks for calling
Delivery God Yato.

138
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:21,791
I'm fast, affordable,
and I get results!

139
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:24,125
Yukine!
We got a job! Let's go!

140
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,041
[YUKINE] Someone hired you?

141
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,416
Wait! What about my job?

142
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,125
[screaming in pain]

143
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:43,041
[breathing deeply]

144
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:45,416
Hey, what the hell,
who invited you along?

145
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,833
[HIYORI]
You wanna get rid of me?

146
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:48,708
Finish my job
like you said you would!

147
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,958
[YUKINE] A tail?

148
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,833
[YATO] Who are you?

149
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,708
[YATO] Did you call in
a fake job just to set me up?

150
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,750
[TENJIN]
"When the east wind blows,

151
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:19,416
spread your fragrance,
o plum blossoms."

152
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,208
Plum blossoms?

153
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:23,166
[TENJIN]
"Even without your master,

154
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,083
do not forget the spring."

155
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:28,250
Wait, that's a
Sugawara-no-Michizane poem.

156
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:30,208
Don't tell me that's...

157
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,500
...the god of learning!

158
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:32,958
Lord Tenjin!

159
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:34,041
Oh, my...

160
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,916
You've heard of me?

161
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,166
[YUKINE, HIYORI] Oh, god!

162
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,291
[YATO] Hey, cut it out!

163
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:42,833
I'm impressed you
recognized the poem,

164
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:43,791
little spirit.

165
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:45,416
It's a bit of a golden oldie.

166
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,916
It's in all the schoolbooks!

167
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,500
[TENJIN]
Well, that's distressing.

168
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,083
Don't you have copyright laws?

169
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:52,083
[HIYORI] They expire
50 years after death.

170
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:53,208
[TENJIN] Is that so?

171
01:09:53,291 --> 01:09:54,791
So you're a real god.

172
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,333
Such an impressive aura!

173
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:58,291
[TENJIN] Oh, you flatter me so.

174
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:00,333
He's the complete opposite.

175
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,500
[TENJIN]
Hmm? Tell me, Yato.

176
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:10,458
What's this little one called?

177
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:11,958
[YATO] He's called Yuki.

178
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:17,166
As a Regalia, Sekki,
and as a person, he's Yukine.

179
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,416
So, Yukine.

180
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,875
I take it you've only
just become a Regalia.

181
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:23,541
As such, you need not
prostrate yourself before me.

182
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:24,416
Huh?

183
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,458
[TENJIN] Tsuyu.

184
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:30,958
It's true.

185
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,708
To put it simply...

186
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:34,958
...you already serve
in the employ of one god.

187
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:36,875
And to bow before
another, like so,

188
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:39,375
is to disrespect
your master.

189
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:41,208
Please remember this rule.

190
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:42,625
Wow!

191
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:45,291
You've also got like an
entire swarm of shrine maidens!

192
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:46,291
I'm Ayu!

193
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,333
I'm Nayu!

194
01:10:47,416 --> 01:10:48,125
I'm Miyu!

195
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,750
I'm Moyu!

196
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,916
[MOYU] And together we are...

197
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,375
[MAIDENS]
...the maidens of Lord Tenjin!

198
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:56,541
To be precise,

199
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:59,291
each one of them
serves as a Regalia to me.

200
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:01,750
It can be a task
providing for all of them.

201
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:04,333
Real gods are on
a whole different level!

202
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,958
I'm a real god!

203
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,041
So what do you want?

204
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:13,083
[TENJIN] Oh, right,

205
01:11:13,166 --> 01:11:14,375
I have my hands
full with requests,

206
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:16,458
it being exam season and all.

207
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:20,000
So I was hoping you could
dispatch some Phantoms for me.

208
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:22,958
I mean, it's not
like you're busy.

209
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,291
[TENJIN]
And I am aware of the fact

210
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:27,625
that you sleep in my
shrines without permission.

211
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:29,125
I know you've
hit hard times,

212
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:31,958
so I'm more than happy to
let you join my Tenman Group.

213
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:34,291
I could even make you
a branch manager.

214
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:36,583
[TENJIN] But of course,

215
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:40,000
I assume you'd prefer
to have your own shrine.

216
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,708
I can respect that.

217
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:45,916
Oh, I'm sorry, I seem
to only have large bills.

218
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,875
Can you make some change?

219
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,208
Oh, how sad.

220
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:55,500
Running a little low
on funds, are we?

221
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,791
[HIYORI] There's even a
class division amongst gods?

222
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:00,458
[YUKINE] That's gotta be why
the world's so screwed up.

223
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:08,083
You had change
the whole time?

224
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:10,916
Now then, I'll provide
you with some guidance.

225
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,458
Makoto.

226
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:15,083
My Lord,

227
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:17,250
Mayu is still new
to these parts.

228
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,125
I would suggest another guide.

229
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:21,666
[TENJIN] You do have a point.

230
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:22,875
[YATO]
This better not be fake.

231
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:26,083
[TENJIN] But Mayu
happens to know Yato.

232
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,291
[YATO] Tomone?

233
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,708
I no longer go by Tomone.

234
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:38,833
It's Mayu now.

235
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:39,875
Tomone!

236
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,916
You--You joined this blowhard?

237
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,333
[MAYU] My name is Mayu.

238
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:45,708
[HIYORI] You know each other?

239
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:46,875
[MAYU] You could say that.

240
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:49,125
There was a time
when I was Yato's Regalia.

241
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:51,125
Oh, wow!
You were, really?

242
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:53,583
How was it? I mean,
working with him?

243
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:55,875
Did he actually follow
through on his jobs?

244
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:57,500
And what about
food and clothing?

245
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:01,125
Was he always a homeless,
jobless, bum in a tracksuit?

246
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:02,833
Well he would
never admit it,

247
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:05,916
but he's actually every last one
of those things you mentioned.

248
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:09,833
[YATO] Give your former master
some credit here, Tomone!

249
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:11,208
It's Mayu, dammit!

250
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:13,791
Quit calling me by that name.
It's disrespectful.

251
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:16,083
[YATO] You complained nonstop
about me putting my hands on you

252
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,708
and now you're some
geezer's smoking pipe?

253
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:20,208
Money sure does change things!

254
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:22,583
[MAYU] I would have gladly
teamed up with anyone but you!

255
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,500
Is she an ex-girlfriend?

256
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:25,916
No!

257
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,541
An ex-wife, then?
You're on pretty bad terms.

258
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:30,333
It's nothing like that!

259
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:32,291
[YUKINE] Well you sound
like a bitter divorced couple.

260
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:34,750
[YATO and MAYU arguing]

261
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:35,875
[HIYORI] Excuse me...

262
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,916
[YATO and MAYU arguing]

263
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,916
[HIYORI] This job
you need Yato for--

264
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,791
It's to kill Phantoms, right?

265
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:44,166
Are they really that bad?

266
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,458
I mean, do you have to
permanently get rid of them?

267
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:49,958
Isn't there some other way
you can deal with them?

268
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:54,125
"Disorder on Earth brings
disorder to the heavens."

269
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:59,000
[TENJIN] Hiyori, dear,
to be honest with you,

270
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:01,250
I can't say that I
approve of the existence

271
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:02,750
of one such as you.

272
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:05,583
You could too easily
complicate matters

273
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:07,250
without meaning to.

274
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,666
[MAYU] A few days back,

275
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:28,500
Lord Tenjin received an
unsettling wish plaque.

276
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:30,875
[MAYU]
I chose to investigate it,

277
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:34,291
and learned that two students
had taken their own lives.

278
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:36,666
Why would anybody do that?

279
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:39,041
This area is
plagued by Storms.

280
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:41,000
The Phantoms they bring
cling to people,

281
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:43,333
and then they take
control of them.

282
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:45,958
[MAYU] Overcome with
unbearable heartache,

283
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:49,333
Lord Michizane erected
a barrier here.

284
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:51,250
[MAYU]
Although, people can still carry

285
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:53,583
deeply-rooted
inner demons through it,

286
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:55,833
which hinders the
act of purification.

287
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:58,583
[train whistle]

288
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:07,416
[MAYU]
Such an unfortunate waste.

289
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,250
A waste of precious life.

290
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,166
[HIYORI]
So then all we have to do

291
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,291
is the defeat the Phantoms that
are possessing these people?

292
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:16,625
Yes!

293
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:17,791
[YATO] Hiyori?

294
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:19,875
People are dying
because of these Phantoms.

295
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:22,375
I can't just sit back
and let that happen.

296
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:24,833
If someone wants
to die, let 'em die.

297
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,000
Huh?

298
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:28,291
Spoken like the
true scumbag you are.

299
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,250
[HIYORI] Y'know,

300
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:35,208
that's a pretty
crappy attitude to take.

301
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:37,125
[YATO] If a soul's
willing to commit suicide,

302
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:39,083
that means it's been possessed.

303
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:40,833
It can't even become a Regalia.

304
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,958
[YATO] Dead or alive,
it still doesn't matter.

305
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:44,333
There's no saving it.

306
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,166
[HIYORI]
How can you even say that?

307
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,875
Isn't it your job
to save people's souls?

308
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:06,291
[YATO] Right. I'm out.

309
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:10,166
[MAYU] Not so fast!
You've been paid!

310
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:13,333
Should we stop her?
Or go after her, at least?

311
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:18,250
[YUKINE] Man, why's
he gotta be such a jerk?

[YATO] It's time
for your first job.

314
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:26,333
So what exactly
do I have to do?

315
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:28,500
[YATO] Come to me when
I call for the Regalia

316
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,458
and revert when
I call your name.

317
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:31,875
That's it for now.

01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:33,041
[HAND PHANTOM 3A] Don't worry,
come here and take it easy.

349
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:37,250
[HAND PHANTOM 3A]
Easy. Easy. Take it easy.

350
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:39,958
The answer is easy.

351
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:43,833
[YATO]
We're taking out that Phantom.

352
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:45,833
Don't wuss out now,
all right?

353
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:48,166
Yeah, no problem.

354
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:55,125
[HAND PHANTOM 3A] Easy. Easy.

355
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,291
Oh, no! We're too late!

356
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:57,416
Relax!

357
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:00,250
[HAND PHANTOM 3A] Easy.

358
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:09,083
This is the land
of the Rising Sun.

359
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:11,875
Your desecrations
shall not be allowed.

360
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,375
[YATO] Hear me.
I am the god Yato.

361
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:17,291
I now lay thee waste
with the Sekki

362
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:19,958
and expel
thy vast defilement!

363
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:22,041
I cleanse thee!

364
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:25,916
[YATO] Rend!

365
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,833
Yuki! Revert!

366
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:45,500
That's enough!
You cut too well!

367
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:15,166
[HIYORI] You said
that people who wanna die

368
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:17,291
should just go ahead and die.

369
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:19,541
But I guess you don't
feel that way after all.

370
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:21,541
[YATO] Hate to tell ya,
but you're wrong.

371
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:24,666
I just refuse to let anyone
die in front of these guys.

372
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:27,833
"These guys" who?

373
01:20:27,916 --> 01:20:30,000
[YATO] I know things
can get painful.

374
01:20:30,083 --> 01:20:31,416
But people should
still appreciate

375
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,500
what it means to be alive.

376
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,666
[YATO] If a soul's
willing to commit suicide,

377
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,333
that means it's been possessed.

378
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:43,833
It can't even become a Regalia.

379
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:45,541
[HIYORI] The Regalias.

380
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:47,791
They're all so
young and innocent.

381
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:54,875
[HIYORI] And if none of them
took their own lives,

382
01:20:58,416 --> 01:21:01,375
then every one of them
still wanted to keep on living.

383
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,958
[HIYORI] Yato couldn't stand

384
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:08,416
for the Regalias to see these
suicides waste their lives.

385
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,583
He wanted to
protect them from that.

386
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:17,291
Hiyori?

387
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:20,916
[sobbing]

388
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:24,333
[YATO yelling]

389
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:26,041
You little perv!

390
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:33,541
Okay, what'd you do to her?

391
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:34,458
Nothing!

392
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,166
[HIYORI] Hey! I'm okay!

393
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,583
I've just got some debris from
earlier in my eye, that's all!

394
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:41,208
[YUKINE] Huh?
That's not okay, it's dangerous!

395
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:42,375
[YATO] Huh?
No, don't rub them!

396
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:43,291
[YUKINE] Easy!

397
01:21:43,375 --> 01:21:44,250
[YATO]
Listen! Just stay calm!

398
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:45,750
Take deep breaths, okay?

399
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:46,625
[YATO breathing deeply]

400
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:48,583
[YUKINE] How's that gonna help?

401
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:08,833
[YATO] Use it.

402
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,791
[YATO] It'll help
warm ya up a little.

403
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:21,375
[YATO] For your first job,

404
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:24,625
I gotta say that ya actually did
pretty good out there today.

405
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:25,666
[YUKINE] Huh?

406
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:24,916
[YATO]
Yukine, what's the difference

407
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,333
between butter and margarine?

408
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:28,000
[YUKINE] Uh, their
ingredients, right?

409
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:30,166
[YATO] Wrong!
It's their names! Ha ha!

410
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,291
Are you too slow
to solve a simple riddle?

411
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:33,958
[HIYORI] Next time on Noragami:

412
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:35,333
"Where Happiness Lies."

413
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:36,416
[YUKINE] He is so obnoxious.

414
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,083
[HIYORI] Hang in there, Yukine.
