00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,166
[HIYORI]
Help us!

2
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,833
Please! Yato needs you!

00:01:59,166 --> 00:01:59,625

[DAIKOKU grunts]

00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,875

Border!

[HIYORI shrieks]

7
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,708
[YUKINE]
A Borderline?

8
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,208
[HIYORI groans]

9
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,500
Take it down!

10
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,750
Please let us in!

11
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,333
Daikoku!

12
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,000
Kofuku!

13
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,333
Don't just stand there!

14
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,083
Can't you see?

15
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,958
[HIYORI]
Yato's going to die!

16
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:27,625
[HIYORI sobbing]

17
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,416
[DAIKOKU] You're the only one
I'm letting inside.

18
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,083
[HIYORI gasps]

19
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,916
[DAIKOKU]
Kofuku.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,708
Can you purify Hiyori
and cleanse her blight?

21
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,958
[KOFUKU]
Right.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,750
[water spraying]

23
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,125
[KOFUKU]
This water's pure.

24
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,500
It's pumped in directly
from the spring in the garden.

25
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,375
Come over here
and wash your body.

26
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,958
[HIYORI] What
about Yato?

27
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,791
It's too late for Yatty's
blight to be cleansed now.

28
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,750
It can't be!

29
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,000
How?

30
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,708
Yuki...

31
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,000
He needs
to be punished.

32
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,666
[YATO moaning]

33
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:06,916
[DAIKOKU]
Kofuku.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,166
Take over
for a while.

35
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,958
I'm gonna visit
some nearby shrines.

36
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:11,750
[HIYORI]
What?

37
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,458
Why do you
need to do that?

38
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,583
What is Yukine's
punishment?

39
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,166
He needs ablution.

40
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,375
Huh?

41
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,166
An ablution's a ceremony
for expelling blight.

42
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,750
But it requires three
Regalias to pull it off.

43
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,541
So we'll need two
more besides me.

44
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,083
[KOFUKU]
Just to be clear here.

45
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,458
You know what'll happen
if the ablution fails.

46
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,750
You do, right?

47
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,458
[DAIKOKU]
Yeah.

48
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,916
Regardless...

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,375
We need the other
Regalias here right away.

50
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:41,333
[YATO whimpering]

51
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,750
[DAIKOKU] He doesn't
look like he'll even last

52
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,416
until the morning.

53
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,416
[DAIKOKU]
Yukine.

54
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,416
Take one step from where you're
standing and I will kill you.

55
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,166
[YUKINE]
Yeah, whatever.

56
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,708
[clothes rustling]

57
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,791

00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,166
[HIYORI]
That's cold!

60

[water spraying]

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,250
[HIYORI] Yato is
seriously on the verge of death.

62
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:22,291
But what exactly are they going
to do to punish Yukine?

63
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,166
[water spraying]

64
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,375
[HIYORI]
Please.

65
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,208
Please, please.

66
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,000
Just let them both be okay.

67
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,625
Actually...

68
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,666
[HIYORI] I never really
thought about it but,

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,333
Who does help gods and Regalias?

70
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,666
[TENJIN]
Yato's truly dying?

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,666
[DAIKOKU]
Yes.

72
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,208
[REGALIAS gasping]

73
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,916
[AYU]
An actual ablution?

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,291
[MOYU] If you don't
do it correctly,

75
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,916
you can get eaten
by a Phantom.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,583
[MIYU]
What?

77
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,166
Are you serious?

78
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,625
[NAYU] I had a friend
who took part in one.

79
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,166
It was a serious ablution
and she helped out.

80
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,666
[MIYU] What happened
to her?

81
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,791
Is she okay?

82
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,166
I don't know.

83
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,041
Nobody has seen her
since it took place.

84
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,500
[ALL gasp]

85
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,041
[MAYU] If you'll
permit it.

86
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,500
I can help.

87
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,291
[AYU]
Hey, hold on!

88
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,208
You aren't serious, are you?

89
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,083
[MAYU] Yato did grant me
the name Tomo at one time.

90
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,375
[DAIKOKU]
Thank you.

91
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,666
And who are...?

92
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,333
Mayu, now.

93
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,083
We only need
one more, then.

[ALL whimper]

95
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,416
I greatly appreciate
your assistance.

96
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,416
I ask no more.

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,458
You've been generous enough.

98
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,375
[DAIKOKU] Please try not
to fret over this.

99
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,291
Worrying would only affect Lord
Tenjin's health.

103
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,375
Yato's been corrupted.

104
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,875
How could that fool
allow this?

105
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,708
What is he doing?

106
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,916
[DAIKOKU]
Please hear me out.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,750
Would you kindly allow
me to borrow one Regalia?

108
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,458
I humbly beg of you.

109
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,791
Please!

110
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,000
[TENJIN] When corruption
has already set in.

111
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,958
There's no guarantee that using
Regalias can save a master.

112
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,375
What kind of Regalia

113
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,291
inflicts this much upon
its master in the first place?

114
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,916
[knuckles crack]

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,416
[TENJIN] You must
slay Yukine, Yato.

118
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,375
Yeah okay...
what?

119
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,875
[KOFUKU] You could
only find one Regalia?

120
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,041
What are we gonna
do, Daikoku?

121
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,125
[DAIKOKU]
Keep looking.

122
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,208
That's the only thing I can do.

123
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,708
[DAIKOKU]
Yeah. I-I know.

124
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,083
Mm, right.

125
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,458
I'll call you back later
with an update.

126
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,750
The only other gods
around here are...

[DAIKOKU gasps]

128
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,708
[KOFUKU whimpering]
We've gotta do something.

129
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,583
If we can't find someone else
to help us, Yatty's gonna die.

[wind rushing]

133
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,291
[HIYORI]
Just one more!

134
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,166
I need to find one more Regalia.

[water drips]

136
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,500
[HIYORI]
There's always Nora.

137
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,958
I'm certain she'd
come to Yato's aid.

138
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,791
[HIYORI grunts]
Except, what would be the cost?

139
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,208
[NORA]
You know I'm good.

140
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,375
I can kill anything in your
way with no trouble.

141
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,625
[HIYORI]
She just might kill Yukine.

142
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,291
In that case.

143
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,166
[HIYORI panting]

144
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,416
[KAZUMA]
You should be more careful.

145
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,166
If you cross paths
with Bishamon again,

146
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,125
keep your head down, or things
could go badly for you.

[HIYORI gulps]

149
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,291
[HIYORI]
This is no time to be afraid.

150
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,875
Come out, Kazuma!

151
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,125
I need your help!

152
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,791
Please, Kazuma!

153
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,041
[KAZUMA] Has there been
activity in the northeast?

154
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,375
[KINUHA] It's all
fairly quiet.

155
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,958
There are no signs of any
vent openings for now.

156
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,125
[KAZUMA] And in
the southeast?

157
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,875
[TSUGUHA] All clear--
Nothing to report.

158
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,208
I'll continue to remain
alert though.

159
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,416
[HINAHA] I'm really
sorry, Kazuma, but well...

160
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,458
[KAZUMA]
Hm?

161
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,916
A girl's been
calling for you

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,958
outside a shrine
for a while now.

163
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:21,666
[BISHAMON]
What is it?

164
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,541
Well?

165
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,583
[KAZUMA]
Sorry it's nothing.

166
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,208
This girl's too ill-mannered
to even offer a bow.

167
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,083
Ignore her.

168
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,833
[HINAHA]
Okay.

169
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:32,750
Now then.

170
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,208
Let's get back
to your reports.

171
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,125
[HIYORI]
Please, Kazuma!

172
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,750
You have to talk to me!

173
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,500
Please, I need your help!

174
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,083
We're talking life
and death here, Kazuma!

175
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,333
Plea--

176
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,083
[KOFUKU] You couldn't
find one more person!

177
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,750
You dummy, what's
wrong with you?

178
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,750
You didn't even try
looking, did you?

179
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,125
[DAIKOKU] Of course
I looked!

180
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,541
But no one is willing
to take the risk to help

181
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,250
the Regalia of a god
they've never even heard of.

182
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,666
[MAYU] Please try
to hang in there.

183
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,958
[MAYU] We're trying. 
[KOFUKU] What are we 

184
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,000
[MAYU] Please, Yato!
[KOFUKU] gonna do now?

185
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,958
[YUKINE walking]

186
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:03,875
[DAIKOKU] Hey!

187
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,375
Didn't I tell
you not to move?

188
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,333
[YUKINE]
Do I look like I care?

189
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,583
[YUKINE grunts]

190
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,625
[KAZUMA] And where
are you going?

191
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,291
[DAIKOKU]
Kazuma?

192
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,791
[MAYU]
Who is that?

193
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,791
[KAZUMA] How's
Yato holding up?

194
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,208
[DAIKOKU ] Hold on, isn't Yato
your master's sworn enemy?

195
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,500
He is.

196
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,125
But I personally
owe him a debt.

197
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,833
On top of that.

198
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,291
[KAZUMA] She came
to me for help.

199
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,541
[KOFUKU]
Yori?

200
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,250
I suggest you give
her a stern lecture.

201
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,875
I've warned her myself, yet she
came right to our front door.

202
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,583
[KAZUMA] Veena would've
killed her if she had known.

203
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,791
[DAIKOKU]
Well,

204
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't know what kind
of debt you owe him,

205
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,583
but we've got
our three Regalias now.

206
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,250
You do. But
the state he's in?

207
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,208
[ALL gasp]

208
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,958
This is not
going to be easy.

209
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,041
Yato.

210
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,375
Can you hear me?

211
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,541
You need
to banish Yukine.

212
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,750
You can't endure
this for much longer.

213
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,375
[YATO moaning]

214
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,125
Yato!

215
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,958
[MAYU] He just won't
listen to reason.

216
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,375
[DAIKOKU] That's why an ablution
is the only way we can save him.

217
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,833
[KAZUMA]
Yukine.

218
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,416
What'd you do?

219
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,250
I don't know.

220
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,916
Nothing.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
[KAZUMA]
If that's true,

222
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,708
then why were you
just trying to leave?

223
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,166
[YUKINE]
'Cuz I wanted to, okay?

224
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,083
Or maybe it's because you
can't handle the guilt you feel.

225
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,333
[YUKINE] Or it's because I'm
sick and tired of all of you!

226
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,958
I said I didn't do
anything, alright?

227
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,458
[DAIKOKU]
Is that so?

228
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,666
Then you wouldn't mind taking
off your shirt for a sec.

229
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,583
[YUKINE]
Uh, what?

230
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,000
Why should I?

231
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,583
Just shut up
and do what I say.

232
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:44,958
[clothes rustling]

233
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:45,625
[PHANTOMS shriek]

234
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,458

236
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,708
[ALL gasp]

237
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,083
[PHANTOMS shrieking]

238
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,541
[YUKINE]
What is that?

239
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,583
[DAIKOKU]
Damn it!

240
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,416
You stung your master that much?

241
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,541
[DAIKOKU] Are you ready to do
this? [YUKINE] Nasty!

242
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,250
[MAYU] Yes.
[YUKINE] It's talking now!

243
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,750
[YUKINE] Hurry and get it off
me!

244
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:08,416
Please, just get it off!

245
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,958
[DAIKOKU]
We now cleanse this spirit

246
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,583
belonging to the god Yato,

247
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,250
and we preserve the name
with which it was graced.

248
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,833
[YUKINE]
What is this?

249
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,791
[KAZUMA] With defilement
expelled and avarice removed.

250
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,125
We bring forth a sincere,
principled, and just soul.

251
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,083
[MAYU] With flesh pared
may he be cleansed.

252
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,333
[ALL grunt]

253
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,541
[HIYORI gasps]

254
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,041
[YUKINE screaming]

255
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:46,458
[YATO screaming]

256
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,125
[HIYORI]
What're they-?

257
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,708
[KOFUKU]
An ablution involves

258
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,541
purifying the flesh
through burning.

259
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,250
They're using
the Regalia borderlines

260
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,458
to hold him in place
and cleanse him.

261
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,291
They're doing...
what?

262
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,708
They all used
to be human.

263
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,583
Only Regalias may judge
the sins of other Regalias.

264
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,333
[YUKINE]
Stop it!

265
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,791
Let me out, damn it!

266
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,750
And once an ablution
has officially begun,

267
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,125
it's not safe to stop
until it's over.

268
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,500
[KOFUKU]
Not until the Regalia

269
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,958
has confessed and repented
all of their sins.

270
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,666
Every last one of them.

271
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,583
Yukine!

272
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,750
Confess your evils!

273
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,708
Do it now!

274
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,541
Shut up!

275
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,791
I'll kill you for this!

276

But if he refuses...

[KOFUKU]
Stop watching!

00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,166
[HIYORI]
This is cruel!

290
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,500
You have
to stop them!

291
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,833

293
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,875
I didn't do anything
to deserve this!

Why the hell are you
putting me through this?

295
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,291
I didn't do anything wrong!

298
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:15,000
[YUKINE] All of this just
'cuz of some loose change?

300
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,916
So I stole some stuff,
and I broke some stuff!

301
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,333
Who freaking cares?

302
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,750
I didn't hurt anyone!

303
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,666
Don't act like you don't
understand me!

304
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,333
It's because we're dead!

305
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,208
[YUKINE]
But they're not!

306
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,958
They have everything!

307
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,708
And they don't even
appreciate it!

308

pissing me off.

brother help me.

C'mon!

313
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:48,166
[YUKINE] A future, memories,
a family and friends...

314
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,541
They get to have everything.

315
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,500
Everything that's
been taken from me.

316
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,583
They've got it all
and I have nothing!

317
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,583
It's not fair.

318
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,083
I'm completely alone.

319
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,958
And I have nothing.

320
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:14,041
Nothing at all.

321
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,666
[NORA] You have such
pretty eyes for a boy.

322
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,250
They remind me of the fruit
on hawthorn plants.

323
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,375
You know.

324
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,833
Not even birds will eat
the hawthorn fruit.

[YUKINE gasps]

326
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,291
[NORA] Not because
of their taste.

327
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,333
They aren't poisonous
or anything.

328
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,250
They're just empty is all.

329
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,250
Useless, empty fruit.

330
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,958
They offer nothing.

331
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,166
And of course nobody
bothers to pick them.

332
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,500
So they're left on the plant
to wilt, wither, and die.

333
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:46,166
[echoing]
and die...

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,125
So what if I stole
a few things?

341
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,833
And why does it matter
if I smashed up some stuff?

342
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:12,458
Everyone should be like me.

343
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,916
