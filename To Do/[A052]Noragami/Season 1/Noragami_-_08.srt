00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,500
[DAIKOKU]
So Yato was right.

4
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,958
You did steal it.

5
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:39,083
[KAZUMA] Why is he even
using such a Regalia?

6
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,041
[YATO]

00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,666

Well, how 'bout
that? Hello, there!

17
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,333
Wait! I'm not spying
on you, I swear!

18
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,333
[HIYORI shrieking]
[YATO groaning]

19
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,333
[YUKINE]
Seriously.

20
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,583
He's telling
the truth.

21
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,250
[HIYORI yelling]

22
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,916
[HIYORI] Now, would you like
to explain why you're here?

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,041
[YATO]
It's for work.

24
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,500
I was trying
to tell you.

25
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,875
[YUKINE] By the way,
what part of the job includes

26
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,916
graffiti-ing the girls'
bathroom?

27

[YATO groans]

28
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,375
You see,
young one.

29
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,333
I long for the worship of all
people, regardless of age.

30
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,916
[YATO] Thus, I must
be prepared

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,208
to enter even a high
school bathroom

32
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,416
if that's where
the request leads.

33
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,916
[HIYORI] I'm
not buying it!

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,166
What kind of client would ask
you to come here, you perv?--

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,708
[YATO] Allow me
to introduce...

36
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,375
[YATO] ...our client!

00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:17,958
[MANABU]
Sorry.

41
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,333
Very sorry.

42
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,000
But I'm not being dirty
or anything, though, honest.

43
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,458
I just had to get away
from those jerks.

44
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,375
[HIYORI gasps]

45
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,541
[MANABU]
It's true.

46
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,125
My name's Manabu Ogiwara.

47
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,250
I'm in Class 2-A.

48
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,208
[MANABU] There are these
guys in my class.

49
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,416
They mess with me whenever
we have a break.

50
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,791
So I hid.

51
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,791
I figured this was one place
they'd never find me.

52
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry!

53
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,666
It was a stupid plan!

54
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,958
[HIYORI]
I had no idea.

55
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,125
Now I'm sorry.

56
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,458
I should've let you
explain all this, first.

57
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,916
[YATO] Yeah,
I had a feeling

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,125
it was gonna be
something like this.

59
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,458
[YATO]
That's usually the case

60
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,375
when I get called
out to a school.

61
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,375
[HIYORI] You've seen this sort
of thing before?

62
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,208
[YATO] Bullying
is real common.

63
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,250
And I happen to be just
the type of guy

64
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,666
victims call when
they want some help.

65
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,875
[HIYORI]
I can see why.

66
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,708
They're desperate enough
to clutch at straws.

67
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,166
[YATO]
Or at gods.

68
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,208
[MANABU sniffling]
What did I ever do to them?

69
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,208
[YUKINE growls]

70
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,250
I hate this stupid
school so much.

71
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:19,416
I wish I could go anywhere else!

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
[YATO] You're
getting angry

73
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,333
because you can see
yourself in him.

74
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,125
[YUKINE grunts]

75
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,166
I get it,
really.

76
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,625
It's not fair.

77
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,125
But being pissed at him
won't help anything.

78
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,208
[YUKINE] Don't
give me that!

79
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,041

do you know about me?

of tagging along

[MANABU whimpering]

89
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,875
[YATO] You could
learn from him.

90
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,791
In your case, it might
actually be helpful

91
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,541
to let it all
out like that.

92
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,625
Huh?

93
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,833

use this.

you gave him that!

kind of plan in mind!

fuel to the fire.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,583
[YATO] I want Manabu to try
defending himself for once.

103
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,125
How he chooses
to do that is up to him.

104
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,458
I guess so,

105
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,458
but couldn't you and
Yukine handle it somehow?

106
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,916
By severing his ties
to the bullies, maybe?

You know...

110

...you did just
give me a beating.

I think I'll...
go lie down.

Was this
a bad idea?

113
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,625
Being here could
push Yukine too far.

114
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,083
Maybe to his
breaking point.

"breaking point"?

118
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,250
[YUKINE] So he thinks
I'm like that other kid?

What a joke.

00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,416
[PHANTOM]
Cross over.

360
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,333
[MANABU] The line.

361
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,666
[PHANTOM A] Cross the line.

362
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,041
It will feel so good.

Wow.

That's some impressive

I like to be prepared.

I remembered what you said.

That's how I held back.

[MANABU] I couldn't use
that thing to hurt someone.

anywhere if I did that,

be human anymore.

go back to just ignoring me.

the most friends.

he'll be all right?

I mean, can you
be sure those jerks

395
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,958
won't try to get back at
him for today?

he finds a good friend,

over to that side.

This is your existence.

419

you used to anymore.
