1
00:00:01,673 --> 00:00:03,707
(running footsteps)

2
00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:07,540
[SHINICHI] You're dead!

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,140
(gasps)

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,507
What the...

5
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:12,107
Uh...

6
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:16,107
(ah!)

7
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:23,040
It's not the one
I'm looking for...

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,107
But this one IS
one of those parasites.

9
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:28,340
Ah! Hey, wait a second!

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,407
[SHINICHI] What's wrong? Migi?!
[GUY] (ah... ah...)

11
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:35,207
[MIGI] I've determined that
his human brain is still intact.

12
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:36,807
It is?!

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,740
[GUY] (nervous laugh)

14
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,407
[PARASYTE] Whoa! That is crazy!

15
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:44,873
Just the hand?
[SHINICHI] (urk!)

16
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:47,673
How does THAT guy
have a human brain?!

17
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:49,573
No, he's telling the truth!

18
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:50,940
I really do have a human bra‐

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,573
[PARASYTE]
It's totally for real!

20
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:55,473
Can you believe this crap?
(crazy laughter)

21
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:57,240
[GUY] (umphf)

22
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:02,040
[MIGI] Yes, Shinichi, the
brain is indeed still intact.

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,840
From the lower half of his face
to the base of his neck,

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,307
perhaps down to his chest,
is the parasite.

25
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:09,140
Yep, that's right.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,873
So, hey guys, that means
we're like practically the same!

27
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:51,740
[GUY] It was only a year
after we got married,

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,340
my wife ran off and left me.

29
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,073
She never really said anything
about what was wrong.

30
00:02:57,173 --> 00:03:00,773
But my guess was
she just got tired of me.

31
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:04,773
I've never been the most...
exciting guy.

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,107
In fact, I'm so pathetic...
(waahhh... sobs)

33
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:15,873
I didn't even have the guts to
go through with killing myself.

34
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,807
It's really beautiful...

35
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:34,907
(thump)

36
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:42,507
[GUY] (waaah!) What is that?!
Go away! Shoo! Shoo, shoo!

37
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:44,107
(huh)

38
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,840
(urk)

39
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:52,207
(WAAAAHHHH!!)

40
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,140
And then, after all that, I‐

41
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,507
Oh, my God, he tells
the worst stories!

42
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:04,840
Now, your right hand should be
able to remember some of
this stuff.

43
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,207
So, y'see, my very first
and only thought

44
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:09,340
was to take over the brain
of a host, right?

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,540
So I start zippin' straight
for this guy's noggin.

46
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,807
But something's wrong...

47
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:16,573
[PARASYTE] What's happening?

48
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,573
It's not breathing.

49
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:21,973
If that doesn't change,
the body will die.

50
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:24,340
There's no time
to take the brain.

51
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,840
Neither one of us will make it.

52
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,440
So since he was about to eat it,

53
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,340
I had to just go for it and get
to merging as fast as I could.

54
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,373
(deep breath)

55
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,440
[MIGI] I see, very interesting.

56
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,173
Ya see, that's how
we wound up like this.

57
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:51,040
[GUY] (mmm...) (deep breath)

58
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,340
So, the problem is,
whenever I hand over the
talky part to this guy,

59
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,007
he just blathers and yaps and
puts everybody to sleep!

60
00:04:58,107 --> 00:04:59,040
Quiet!

61
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,173
Anyway, I sure was
surprised to see you!

62
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:04,273
When this guy suddenly tells me
that one of my kind
is coming closer,

63
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:07,873
I was pretty nervous about
what sort of monster we
were gonna run into.

64
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,673
But when you showed up,
man, was I relieved.

65
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,507
I mean, wow! There are actually
other people out there

66
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,607
who're like me!

67
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:18,140
So, I am dying to know...
Tell me your story.

68
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,473
How'd you get like this?
[PARASYTE]
Yeah, yeah, totally! Tell us!

69
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,607
Sure, but before I do that,

70
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:27,073
do you think maybe we could go
somewhere else, please?
[PARASYTE] (hmm...)

71
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:31,873
My name's Shinichi Izumi.
And this is Migi.

72
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:34,940
The thing is, we need to stay
close to a certain place.

73
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:39,040
Ah, well, I'm Mamoru Uda.

74
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,873
And this guy, you can just
call him "Parasite."

75
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:45,007
That' s right, you can just
call me "Parasite".

76
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:49,540
Wait, where the heck did he go?

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,607
It's like he just disappeared.

78
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,973
[UDA] (sobbing)

79
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:58,007
That's awful!
It's just completely awful!

80
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,940
That's why you've stayed
so close to the hospital
this whole time?

81
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,607
It must be so hard.
I couldn't do it!

82
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:06,140
[SHINICHI] Yeah...

83
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,040
[PARASITE] I swear ta God, he
cries all the freakin' time.

84
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,807
I don't understand how
these humans operate at all.

85
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:14,673
[MIGI] I feel the
same way sometimes.

86
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:16,240
I can't help but notice.

87
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,073
Your Migi speaks quite well.

88
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:19,573
Huh? Oh, yeah...

89
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:22,973
Well, that's probably because
he reads whenever he
gets the chance.

90
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:25,773
Well, I learned how to talk
from watchin' a whole lotta TV.

91
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,840
I mean, all this guy does
is sit on the couch,

92
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,640
and watch old re‐runs and cry.

93
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,607
How about your host? Does he
spend all his time crying?

94
00:06:32,707 --> 00:06:35,240
Hey, look, that is
just about enough!

95
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:42,040
Okay, I work at the hotel that's
just in the next town over.

96
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,807
And once he tells me one of
those things is around,

97
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:47,340
I will let you know.
[SHINICHI] Uh...

98
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,473
Please let us help you out!

99
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,040
I mean...
(beginning to sob)

100
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,007
You're the first person
I've met like me and‐
(sobbing)

101
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:57,207
[SHINICHI]
This guy really is a crybaby.

102
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:59,373
But I'm glad I met him.

103
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:00,973
It feels good to know that

104
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:03,873
I'm not the only one
out there like this.

105
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,340
[MIGI] Shinichi...

106
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,940
Shinichi!

107
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,773
It's really late, Migi.
What... what do you want?

108
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:14,540
This is very important.

109
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,307
I wanted to talk to you
earlier today,

110
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:19,807
but in meeting Uda and his
parasite, I missed my chance.

111
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,307
Did you notice, Shinichi?

112
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,607
First, you ran at the speed
of a seasoned athlete,

113
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:28,273
and then you jumped more than
three meters high.

114
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:29,440
What about it?

115
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,273
That doesn't seem odd to you?

116
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,940
Then I'll have to elaborate.

117
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,640
But first, about my own body...

118
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,773
See? Doing this kind of thing
takes practice, you know.

119
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:42,940
If I divide into
two parts like this,

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,473
each of the halves is still
fully capable of thought
and speech.

121
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:47,940
Wow...

122
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
But if I start dividing into
parts that are too small,

123
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,307
our intelligence will diminish
to where we're incapable
of thought,

124
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,907
much less rejoining together,

125
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:58,573
and those parts would be
unable to survive.

126
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:00,773
[SHINICHI] Huh... okay...

127
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:02,873
That's why,
whenever I do divide,

128
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:05,207
a consensus is
reached beforehand.

129
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:07,440
And it acts as a mantra,

130
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,707
an instinct to come
back together as one.

131
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:11,973
Uh, all right then,
I think I get it.

132
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:15,640
Then again, there are places
where even my smallest
fragments‐

133
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,340
They are still able to survive.

134
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,240
For example, a place where
there is a constant flow
of fresh blood.

135
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,507
In other words, they can
survive inside your body.

136
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:27,673
In my body?

137
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,273
Are you serious?!

138
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:30,673
[MIGI] Yes, that's right.

139
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:33,073
In fact, the Migi that's
talking to you right now

140
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:37,673
is actually only about seventy
percent of the original.
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

141
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:39,573
[MIGI] When I closed
the wound in your heart,

142
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:43,940
I instructed all my parts
to return to your right arm
via your bloodstream.

143
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,807
However, once it was restored,

144
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,307
your heart was much stronger
than I had expected,

145
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:51,507
so quite a lot of me was
dispersed throughout your body.

146
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,940
(hyperventilating)

147
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,907
[MIGI] They've become so small

148
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,373
that I can no longer
communicate with them.

149
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,507
Unbelievable...

150
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:10,807
Just when I thought you couldn't
tell me anything else that
could surprise me.

151
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:12,973
[MIGI] If there had been no
physiological changes,

152
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,707
I was going to
keep quiet about it.

153
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,873
Migi...
[MIGI] What is it?

154
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:21,873
You said throughout my body...

155
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:24,040
Does that mean even in my brain?

156
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,373
[MIGI] I don't know. But it's
not like those tiny fragments

157
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:28,907
have any consciousness.

158
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:31,873
I seriously doubt they would try
to enter the capillaries.

159
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,007
Is something bothering you?

160
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,073
[SHINICHI]
No, I'm sure it's nothing.

161
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:40,273
I'm probably just
over‐thinking things.

162
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:45,573
Before, I felt like my heart
was going to explode from
everything I was feeling,

163
00:09:45,673 --> 00:09:47,807
but I still couldn't cry.

164
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:50,173
It was the
same thing today, too.

165
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,173
I mean, Uda started
bawling his eyes out

166
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:54,507
when he met someone like him
for the first time.

167
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:56,207
But not me...

168
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:57,473
How about your host?

169
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,907
Does he spend all
of his time crying?

170
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,140
A hole in my heart...

171
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:13,840
Hey, Maki...

172
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,273
Aww, how'd you know I was here?

173
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:18,773
Tell me somethin'.

174
00:10:18,873 --> 00:10:21,140
Do I seem like
a normal person to you?

175
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,273
Huh? Of course you do.

176
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,940
What do you mean?

177
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,373
(sighs)

178
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:29,340
Oh, come on, what's going on?

179
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,107
You gotta give me
something here!

180
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,873
You... You haven't really
said anything to me.

181
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:37,007
Huh?

182
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:39,207
Back on the boat,
and even now, too...

183
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:42,340
It's like you just sit there
with this terrible look
on your face!

184
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,807
It's like...

185
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:46,807
You're crying inside,
but you're holding it all in!

186
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,807
It... it makes me worry.
[SHINICHI] Sorry.

187
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:55,607
Just... just forget it, okay?

188
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,973
(phone buzzes)

189
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:02,873
Oh, it's Uda.

190
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:04,673
[UDA] It's here now!
A parasite!

191
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:08,040
And I'm pretty sure it's
the one you're looking for!
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

192
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:14,942
[SHINICHI]
So, is it headed this way?

193
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,042
[UDA] No, it seems to have
noticed me and is coming closer.

194
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:20,842
I'm gonna try to stall it
somehow until you can
get over here.

195
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:22,376
[SHINICHI] No! That's crazy!

196
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:24,976
If that thing realizes that you
still have a human brain,

197
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:27,842
it's gonna try to kill you!
[UDA] (ah!)

198
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:29,476
[PARASITE]
'Bout another 100 meters!

199
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:31,809
Get outta there!
You need to run away right now!

200
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:33,409
[UDA] Uh, o‐okay I got it!

201
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:37,609
I'll make my way around the cape
and be there as soon as I can!

202
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,376
(running)

203
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,542
(running)

204
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:54,442
[MIGI] Shinichi,
I'm detecting one parasite.

205
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:56,876
[SHINICHI] One? It must be Uda.

206
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:59,176
[UDA] (panting)

207
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:03,909
Come on, it's gonna catch up!

208
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,342
Look, this is the
best I can do, okay?!

209
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,909
Well, it looks like that one's
learned to hone its host

210
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,409
and maximize its
physical potential.

211
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:12,876
There's no way we can beat it.

212
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:14,276
We've gotta get outta here!

213
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:15,676
No, we can't!

214
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,876
Shinichi and Migi
will be here soon.

215
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:20,776
We have to work together
to have a chance!

216
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:22,809
Then you gotta go that way.

217
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,642
It's the only hope we have
of not getting destroyed.

218
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:29,276
[MIGI] Shinichi...
[SHINICHI] Migi, can you
sense the other one yet?

219
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:31,309
[MIGI] No, I'm tired.

220
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:33,342
Huh?! No, no, not now!

221
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,176
I need sleep...

222
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:39,309
[SHINICHI] Come on, Migi!
You can't just let Uda and
his parasite die!

223
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:42,509
[MIGI] Shinichi,
You have to listen to me.

224
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,076
Hey!

225
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:46,009
[MIGI]
If possible, you should run.

226
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:49,909
Choose your own surviv... al...

227
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,842
Everything will be fine.

228
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,109
I just need to find Uda
before it's too late.

229
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,842
(panting)

230
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:04,042
[UDA] Oh, crap!
(heavy breathing)

231
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:06,276
What do we do?
There's nowhere else to go!

232
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:08,042
This is really bad!

233
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:09,342
Even if we get cornered here,

234
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:11,909
you and Shinichi can
still combine attacks.

235
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:14,409
(bushes rustling)
[UDA] (gasps)

236
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,309
(aahhh...)

237
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:21,376
You are the second
like this I've met.

238
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:25,076
The second one whose human
brain has remained intact.

239
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:26,476
As far as I am concerned,

240
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:29,042
you are nothing more than
an unfortunate mistake.

241
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,942
And you must be removed.

242
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:37,342
(waahhh!)

243
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,309
Whoa! That's what we're
supposed to really look like?

244
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,242
That's freakin' awesome!

245
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,476
Where could they be? Where?

246
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,676
(loud swish)
[UDA] (waahh!)

247
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:51,276
[UDA] (screams)

248
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:56,409
(umphf)

249
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:58,809
(ungh)

250
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,209
[UDA] I'm gonna die!

251
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,909
(umph!)

252
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:07,242
(muffled whimpers)

253
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:09,209
[NOBUKO]
You are clearly outmatched.

254
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:12,109
I am completely fused
with my host.

255
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,342
Your base remains human
which causes you to be
much less responsive.

256
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:19,209
[PARASITE] She's right.
You are totally slowing me down.

257
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:21,909
I can feel the effects of
your crappy conditioning.

258
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:24,376
But y'know, her attacks
are kinda repeating.

259
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:27,742
It's just like she's targeting
the same spot over and over.

260
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:30,542
She may be strong,
but she's not very creative.

261
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:32,542
This battle is all but done.

262
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:34,809
It is time for you to die now.

263
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,942
(muffled whimpers)

264
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:40,442
(ungh!)

265
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:53,309
In cases when it's difficult
to determine where
the parasite ends,

266
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:59,776
destroying the heart is
the best approach to
eradicating one's opponent.

267
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:02,476
[PARASITE] Yes, of course...

268
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,242
the heart...

269
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,109
(gasps) Another one of us?

270
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:15,176
Strange...
The signal is much too weak.

271
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:19,376
It's as if...
the parasite is asleep.

272
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:23,042
You're alive. My attack
should have terminated you.

273
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:27,042
Could it be that
my targeting was off?

274
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,242
No, that's not possible.

275
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:33,309
You were punctured through the
heart, yet somehow did not die.

276
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:36,976
Obviously, I should have
cut off your head as well.

277
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:38,609
Dammit...

278
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,976
Even the voice
is still the same.

279
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,442
I am gonna kill you now,
and it's gonna be quick.

280
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:51,409
(grr...)

281
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:56,376
Yeah, that's it, come on!

282
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:58,342
Like the disgusting
monster that you are!

283
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:01,676
You are going to die, too.
Like your friend.

284
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:04,609
(gasps) "My friend"?

285
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,042
What have you done to Uda?!

286
00:16:06,142 --> 00:16:09,009
[NOBUKO] The signal from his
right hand is very weak.

287
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:11,609
It's almost as if
it's hibernating.

288
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:14,442
This human is all alone.

289
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:17,442
(swooshing)

290
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,009
What? Impossible!

291
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:22,342
How could normal human agility
be able to evade my attacks?

292
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:24,276
(swoosh!)

293
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:29,842
How is this happening?

294
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,876
[SHINICHI] I can see it...
I can see every move it makes!

295
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:36,142
It's completely different
from when I fought Mr. A!

296
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:37,342
There it is.

297
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:40,209
The tentacles move while
morphing at the same time!

298
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:44,209
[NOBUKO] Unbelievable.

299
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:48,776
(gasps) Uda!

300
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,176
(grr...)

301
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,676
He was the only one...
The one person in the world

302
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:55,042
who could understand what
I've gone through!

303
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:57,942
(gyah!)

304
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:04,209
[NOBUKO] I don't understand.

305
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:06,942
How is he able to
move like this?

306
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,242
The neck...

307
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:16,209
Aim for the neck up!

308
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,309
I cannot let it live.
(kyah!)

309
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:20,442
I will kill it!

310
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,976
I will kill this
goddamn monster!

311
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,742
(swoosh)

312
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:29,876
[NOBUKO] What is this?
He can't be human.

313
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,142
[SHINICHI] Don't worry, Mom...

314
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:41,476
I'm gonna hack that demon
right out of you!

315
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,876
(swoosh)
[SHINICHI] (ungh)

316
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:06,809
[NOBUKO] You fared
surprisingly well for a human,

317
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:09,109
but now it is time...

318
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,776
to die.

319
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:17,576
(gasps)

320
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,509
(splash)

321
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:24,476
(ungh)

322
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:27,176
Uda!

323
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:29,509
[UDA]
That... that thing wasn't...

324
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,709
really your mom, of course.

325
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:33,509
Even so...

326
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:37,076
I didn't feel like you should be
the one to have to do it.

327
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:42,009
[PARASYTE] But how?
How can you still be alive?

328
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:44,276
I could see right through
your attack pattern.

329
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:47,376
You aimed in the exact same
place, every single time.

330
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:51,242
So, I just moved the heart
and all the other vital stuff
out of the way,

331
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:54,242
and then let you think
you had taken me out.

332
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:56,442
(ungh...)

333
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:01,142
(waves crashing)

334
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:08,142
[SHINICHI] Mom...

335
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:12,542
It's over.

336
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:17,342
It's all over, Mom.

337
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:26,170
[SHINICHI] Thank you,
for everything. Take care.

338
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,604
[MAKIKO] Ah! I'll walk with you.

339
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:33,270
So, then...
you're all done here?

340
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,537
Uh... Yeah, I am.

341
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,270
Well, next time you come,
we should do some sightseeing.

342
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,404
No, I won't be
coming back here again.

343
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:48,804
You won't?!

344
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,204
Well, maybe someday...

345
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:53,804
Maybe someday you'll
change your mind.

346
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,270
[MAKIKO] Goodbye...

347
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:12,170
[DAD]
I wish I could say this better.

348
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,837
How can I put this?

349
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:18,804
I want you to understand this
one important thing, Son.

350
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:20,504
Right up until the very end...

351
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:24,237
No, even now, your mother
loves you very, very much.

352
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:27,537
And I love you and
your mom, too.

353
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:32,570
[SHINICHI] Dad...

354
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,204
I wanna ask you something
'bout what you saw.

355
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:39,437
Um...
The night everything happened...

356
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:42,470
did... did Mom...
Did... she...

357
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,404
Dad, did she suffer at all,
do you think?

358
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:47,470
No...

359
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,170
No, it all happened
way too fast.

360
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,770
Oh... okay.

361
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,470
(thump)

362
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,870
Shinichi?

363
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,637
(gasps)

364
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:15,304
It's him! He's here.

365
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,670
(gasps)

366
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:23,870
[SATOMI] Shinichi?

367
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,304
He's here! He's back!

368
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:29,837
Shinichi, hey!

369
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:34,137
Hey.

370
00:22:55,537 --> 00:22:58,737
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"Freezing Point"
