00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:03,525
[school bell chiming]

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,559
[YUKO] Hey, Shinichi.

3
00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:06,359
Huh?

4
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:07,825
Did you hear what happened?

5
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,192
You know, about the girl

6
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,992
who got killed in the next town
over? She, um...

7
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:13,259
Yeah, I heard about that!

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,492
There's like a ton of
rumors going around!

9
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:19,192
And I heard the body was found
by none other than you,
Shinichi!

10
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:27,959
Good grief, Akiho!
[STUDENTS] (surprised chatter)

11
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:29,392
[YUKO] (grr...)

12
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:47,325
(hmm?)

13
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:52,125
You okay?

14
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:53,892
Mm‐hm, what about you?

15
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:56,925
All right, I guess.

16
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,925
So, um...

17
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:04,192
[SATOMI] (hmm?)

18
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,692
The other day...

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,392
we were supposed to
go see a movie.

20
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:10,425
But uh...

21
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,992
Yeah, well everything happened.

22
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:16,759
It's just awful.

23
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,292
[SHINICHI] Yeah...

24
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:05,992
[HIROKAWA]
In spite of all the many
feeding locations we prepared,

25
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:09,259
he chose to feed
outside the
designated areas,

26
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,025
and was therefore
killed.

27
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,892
It's an unfortunate incident.

28
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,525
[KUSANO] Not only did he allow
himself to give in to the
immediacy of hunger,

29
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:20,025
he fought against his own kind,
which is very selfish.

30
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,292
He acted as though
he were an animal.

31
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:23,992
We're better off he's dead.

32
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:27,025
[GOTO]
If only it were that simple.

33
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,359
We have now provided the humans

34
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,625
with another sample for
them to examine.

35
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:33,892
And of course, the perpetrator
has yet to be revealed.

36
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:36,892
Do you think this could've been
done by a human?

37
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,359
Yes...

38
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,825
and we know exactly who it was.

39
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:45,759
[KUSANO] The boy who found
the dead human female.

40
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,292
[TAMURA] Shinichi Izumi.

41
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:51,225
He was probably enraged
when he saw that his friend
had been killed.

42
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:53,692
He was "enraged"?
His "friend"?

43
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:57,192
Are you saying that this boy's
brain is entirely human?

44
00:03:57,292 --> 00:04:00,092
Yes, his brain remains intact.

45
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:02,492
And he's coexisting
with his parasite.

46
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:05,192
He's quite a valuable specimen.

47
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:06,759
[KUSANO] "Valuable specimen"?

48
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:09,159
He could also be viewed
as a threat.

49
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:14,092
Right now, I am making an effort
to ensure a more secure future
for all of us.

50
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:18,125
I'd like you to consider my
research on him as part of that.

51
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:23,159
Very well, I'll leave the matter
of this boy in your hands
for now then.

52
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,992
Oh yes, and by the way...

53
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:26,492
How is your child, Tamura?

54
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:29,592
Just like a normal human child.
(baby crying)

55
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:32,625
[TAMURA] Though I am rearing it
with human assistance.

56
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,159
Oh, goodness.
(baby crying)

57
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,459
Oh, what's the matter?

58
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,525
What can I do for you?

59
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,092
I already changed your diaper.

60
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:44,092
Whatcha' need?
(door closing)

61
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:45,625
Mommy's home.

62
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:48,025
[KEIKO]
Well, hello, welcome back.

63
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,459
(baby crying)

64
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,259
Be quiet.
(baby stops crying)

65
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,425
(gasps)

66
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:59,792
[TAMURA] I've trained it well,
haven't I?

67
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:00,792
Huh?!

68
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:01,759
Thanks for your help.

69
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,959
Please do come back again
tomorrow.

70
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:07,825
O‐of course!
If you'll excuse me!

71
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,525
(terrified gasp)

72
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,492
(door opening &amp; closing)

73
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,825
<i>For me to conduct</i>
<i>the proper experiments,</i>

74
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:20,692
<i>it will need to grow a little</i>
<i>more first.</i>

75
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:22,625
(phone ringing)

76
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,392
[KURAMORI] I've followed
him around for a week,

77
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,625
but so far I've found nothing
much out of the ordinary.

78
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,759
It's intriguing that his
mother's gone missing,

79
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:32,692
and that he was also
recently a witness

80
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,892
in that high‐school girl's
mysterious grisly murder.

81
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:40,292
Otherwise, he seems like
a completely average
high‐school student.

82
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:42,859
Yes, yes, that's correct.

83
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,225
[TAMURA] I understand.

84
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,725
Please continue
your investigation.

85
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:50,525
An average high‐school student?

86
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:54,459
Human observational skills
are less than impressive.

87
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,359
However, there are some things
that only humans can do.

88
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,825
I couldn't test him using
Hideo Shimada, but...

89
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:06,425
Perhaps...
I can arrange something.

90
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:15,025
(uh?)

91
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,459
You're Shinichi Izumi, right?

92
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:22,192
[THUG] (low chuckle)

93
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:24,625
(sounds of fighting)

94
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:37,159
[SHINIICHI] All right,
who put you up to this?

95
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,259
Uh, it was...
it was a woman.

96
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,292
[SHINICHI]
A woman? What's her name?

97
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:46,325
[THUG] I don't know.
She just came up to us today.

98
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:48,459
I'd never seen her before.

99
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,792
[KAMIJO] Yo!

100
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:02,459
Kamijo...

101
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,692
Why're ya looking so miserable

102
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,525
first thing in the mornin',
little man?

103
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,825
C'mon, I don't look that bad,
do I?

104
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:11,392
Are things going good
with your girlfriend?

105
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:13,059
Y'mean good like how?

106
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,559
Don't play dumb with me.

107
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,092
Have ya done it yet or what?

108
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:19,392
[SHINICHI] What? No, cut it out.
It's nothing like that.

109
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:21,759
[KAMIJO] Aww, whatever...

110
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,092
Hey!

111
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,359
This is a tough subject for me
to bring up with you, but...

112
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,292
there are some rumors
about... Shinichi.
[SATOMI] Huh?

113
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:33,425
I've heard that HE found the
body in the latest murder,

114
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:36,392
and that the dead girl was
actually a friend of his.

115
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:38,959
Yes, I knew that.

116
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,392
So, what else about it?

117
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,859
Has your brother
found out anything?

118
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,525
No, nothing so far.

119
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,725
Don't you think it's weird,
after something like that
happened,

120
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:49,559
Shinichi is so calm?

121
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:52,025
He's kinda acting
a little too normal.

122
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:54,959
[GIRLS] (uh!)
[SHINICHI] Morning.

123
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,259
Uh, see you later, Murano.

124
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:59,325
So, what's with her?

125
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:01,392
Oh, it's nothing.

126
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:04,459
<i>Even back when...</i>
<i>when he saved my life,</i>

127
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,925
<i>he seemed so calm and strong.</i>

128
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:10,125
<i>It was almost like...</i>

129
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:11,925
<i>he was someone else.</i>

130
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,459
<i>But still...</i>

131
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:22,925
<i>was there really nothing</i>
<i>between him and Kana?</i>

132
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:25,092
<i>No, that's not the point.</i>

133
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,925
<i>Even if nothing WAS going on,</i>

134
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,525
<i>he's still kind of... cold.</i>

135
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:32,792
Are you‐

136
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,759
Oh, sorry! I have to...

137
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:37,925
to run some errands.
[SHINICHI] Oh... Huh? Uh...

138
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,325
[KURAMORI]
Okay, I might have something.

139
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:45,725
This kid has some
incredibly fast moves.

140
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,659
It's amazing.
I mean look at this!

141
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,759
Okay then, did you happen
to notice anything else
about him?

142
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,325
Huh, well, whaddya mean?

143
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:55,725
Well, like...
something unnatural...

144
00:08:55,825 --> 00:09:00,325
For example, did the movements
of his right hand seem
peculiar in any way?

145
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:02,692
Ah, well, I dunno.

146
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,359
I don't really remember
anything like that.

147
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:07,759
<i>If that's the case,</i>

148
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:11,825
<i>some unique variation</i>
<i>must have occurred.</i>

149
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:13,659
(dog barking)

150
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,225
[SHINICHI] I wonder
what's wrong with Murano?

151
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,659
Maybe...
maybe she's just worried,

152
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,425
because of everything
that happened to Kana.

153
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,859
(ah!)

154
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,592
Hang on... Of course!

155
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,492
She's supposed to be worried.

156
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:29,559
With all the stuff that's
been going on lately,

157
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:32,359
I'm the one being weird for
acting so calm about it.

158
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,159
That's exactly what's it is!

159
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:35,992
[MIGI]
What are you talking about?

160
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,925
You make an excellent
human being.

161
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:41,292
You can separate yourself
from needless emotions.

162
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,392
Migi, you're not helping.

163
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,859
You're making me lose
even more confidence.

164
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,059
[MIGI] In any case, you can
sometimes be overheard
when speaking to me.

165
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,159
Whenever you grow more agitated,
your voice becomes loud enough

166
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,559
for your father
to find it strange.

167
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,225
(knock at door)

168
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:01,392
[SHINICHI] Dad?
[DAD] Hm?

169
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:03,225
I'm going out for a bit.

170
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:05,225
All right,
don't stay out too late.

171
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:06,859
[SHINICHI] Right.

172
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,559
<i>[KURAMORI] A bit late</i>
<i>to be going out, kid.</i>

173
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,692
<i>This is the same town where</i>
<i>that girl was murdered.</i>

174
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,659

175
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,892
<i>and now you're going back to</i>
<i>the scene of the crime?</i>

176
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,292
<i>Something's going on.</i>

177
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:07,992
<i>The way he was moving earlier,</i>

178
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:09,859
<i>and now whatever this is...</i>

179
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,392
<i>What're you up to Shinichi?</i>
<i>What're you hiding?</i>

180
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:21,489
[MIGI] Shinichi...

181
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:23,722
What are we doing here?

182
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:25,622
I can't explain it, but...

183
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,556
The way I am now...

184
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:28,956
It's like, more and more,

185
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,856
I just forget about anything
that's painful or sad.

186
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,689
It simply disappears.

187
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:36,889
[MIGI] And is that wrong?

188
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,856
I was never like this before.

189
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:41,889
I used to obsess over the
smallest things.

190
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:43,922
I worried all the time.

191
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:47,656
[MIGI] That, of course,
is a waste of energy.

192
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:49,922
[SHINICHI] That's not the point!

193
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:51,922
<i>Who're you talking to?</i>

194
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:54,889
<i>Yourself?</i>

195
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:00,322
[SHINICHI] I think Kana
was out looking for ME

196
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:03,389
and ended up following
that monster instead.

197
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,156
And it got her killed.

198
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:07,889
It was because of me!

199
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:10,589
[MIGI] You really
shouldn't think like that.

200
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,122
No, for her,
I need to try to...

201
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:16,689
This might sound kinda strange,

202
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:19,489
but I want to be able
to mourn Kana's death.

203
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:25,189
I don't want to forget
what sadness feels like.

204
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:27,756
I'm a human being.

205
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,056
Uh‐huh...

206
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:39,556
[KURAMORI] (uh!)

207
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,189
(huh?!)

208
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:44,289
[MIGI] (baah!)
[KURAMORI] (waah!)

209
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,822
Ah, Jesus Christ!

210
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:48,556
(uhn) Migi,
what the hell're you doing?!

211
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,956
[MIGI] What do you think?
I'm going to kill him.
[KURAMORI] (waah!)

212
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,989
[SHINICHI] Wait! Stop it!

213
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,189
(waah!)

214
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:57,322
Run for it! Hurry!
[KURAMORI] (uhhh...)

215
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:58,556
Shinichi, don't interfere!

216
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,389
[SHINICHI]
What are you doing?! Run!

217
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,822
[KURAMORI] (waah!)

218
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:07,322
[KURAMORI] (ungh!)

219
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:09,089
[SHINICHI] (AHHH!)

220
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:15,456
[KURAMORI] (WAAH!) (ungh)

221
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,356
I don't have the body mass
to cut him in half.

222
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:23,456
[KURAMORI] (waah!)

223
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:26,289
Not good.

224
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,189
He's getting farther away.

225
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:31,256
[KURAMORI] Someone, help me!
[MIGI] Tch!

226
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,722
[SHINICHI] Migi...

227
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:34,822
Look, do you seriously
not understand

228
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:36,322
the position you're in now?!

229
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:39,389
We've just been seen up close
by some complete stranger!

230
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:40,989
And he had a camera!

231
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:43,156
Let's go!
Follow him...
[SHINICHI] (ahhh!)

232
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,556
and kill him!

233
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,889
No way! We can't kill him!
(ungh...)

234
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,956
Migi... stop it!

235
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,722
[MIGI]
Shinichi, I don't understand,

236
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:57,022
you've seen a great number
of humans die already.

237
00:13:57,122 --> 00:13:59,389
So, what's the difference
if one more dies right now?

238
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:02,889
Besides, it's for
our own protection!
[SHINICHI] (umphf!)

239
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:05,022
There's no reason to hesitate!

240
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:08,556
Just forget it! I won't!

241
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:10,489
That's going too far!

242
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,322
I'm tired...

243
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,189
[SHINICHI] Killing humans
is out of the question.

244
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:20,089
We can't do that.

245
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,456
I don't care
what the reason is.

246
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:24,822
[MIGI] He's gone.

247
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:33,756
It would be too late to
catch him now anyway.

248
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,889
[DAD] You sure took your time.

249
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:37,756
Did something happen to ya?

250
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:39,656
No, Dad.

251
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,689
Everything's okay.

252
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,289
Get some sleep.

253
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,322
(birds twittering)

254
00:14:57,622 --> 00:15:02,856
[MIGI] That male appears to have
been targeting you specifically
in his investigations.

255
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:05,656
Which means that, even though
he knows a lot about us,

256
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:08,122
we do not know
anything about him.

257
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:14,089
[MIGI] If that man turns out
to be a police officer or
someone in the media,

258
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:16,589
or a member of
some government agency,

259
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:18,289
then I'm afraid
we're already done for.

260
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,789
And if that's the case, we'll be
made into lab rats for sure.

261
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,089
[SHINICHI] <i>Lab rats...</i>

262
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:31,489
Shinichi?

263
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:35,822
Oh‐

264
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:39,289
(sighs)

265
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:44,956
You're a damn monster!

266
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:47,089
Have you really
been eating people?!

267
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:48,956
You... You stay away from me!
[STUDENTS] (angry muttering)

268
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:50,122
[YUKO] Leave me alone, Shinichi!
[GUY] Who do you think you are?!

269
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:51,922
[YUKO] I don't know you anymore!

270
00:15:52,022 --> 00:15:54,389
[GUY] Get out of here!
[STUDENTS] (angry muttering)

271
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:56,256
[TEACHER] Mr. Izumi?
[STUDENTS] (angry muttering)

272
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,856
[TEACHER] Mr. Izumi?!

273
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,689
[TEACHER] Hey!
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

274
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:01,322
Pull your head out and wake up.

275
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:03,289
It's your turn to read
the next section.

276
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:06,356
If you're not going to make an
effort, then just leave!

277
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:11,456
[TEACHER]
Uh... What are you doing?!

278
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:16,622
Holy crap, he totally just left.

279
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:18,222
Shinichi...

280
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,289
(door closing)

281
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:24,789
(clock ticking loudly)

282
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,556
<i>They'll come for us.</i>
<i>I know it.</i>

283
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:36,489
<i>They're going to come get me</i>
<i>and turn me into an experiment.</i>

284
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:37,956
But before that happens,

285
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:41,089
it's possible that one of
my kind could eliminate us.

286
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:43,989
Either way, there will
certainly be consequences.

287
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:45,589
You can count on that.

288
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:47,822
[SHINIHCI] <i>Whaddya I do?</i>

289
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:50,389
<i>What the hell should I do?!</i>

290
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:53,556
<i>Maybe I should just</i>
<i>cut my arm off right now.</i>

291
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:55,389
<i>While Migi's still asleep!</i>

292
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:59,422
<i>No, I can't.</i>

293
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,856
<i>Who was that guy?</i>

294
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,356
<i>Who's after me?</i>

295
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,456
<i>After us?</i>

296
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:11,956
<i>I bet... I bet he's still</i>
<i>watching, right this minute!</i>

00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:14,222

304
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,822
[SHINICHI] Hey! Don't go!
Listen to me!

305
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,489
Please just hear me out! Please!

306

Why is this...

308
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:49,289
Why is this happening to me?

<i>It's not fair...</i>

00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:57,389

00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,372
<i>it's time.</i>

317
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,705
What's up?
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

318
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,572
What did you want to
meet with me about?

319
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,938
[SHINICHI]
Uh, well... It's, uh...

320
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:33,638
I wanted to ask about Yuko.

321
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,705
[SATOMI] Huh?

322
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:36,205
[SHINICHI] I mean, um...

323
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,405
She's back to her regular,
cheerful self again.

324
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:41,272
She didn't even get
a scar or anything.

325
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:44,905
Did you seriously call me
out here just to tell me that?

326
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:48,838
Ah! No, uh... not really.

327
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:51,605
I just wanted...
to talk while we still could.

328
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:57,038
Come on!
That makes it sound like
you won't ever see me again.

329
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:59,538
[SHINICHI] Uh, that's not it.

330
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:04,238
Shinichi,
you seem kind of depressed.

331
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:08,972
The truth is,
I'm a little off myself.

332
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:11,605
Hey, is it okay if I go first?

333
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:14,405
Uh... Sure.

334
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,872
[SATOMI] I've been trying
not to let it get to me,

335
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:19,372
but I just can't help myself.

336
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:21,272
It's about... Kana.

337
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:23,872
You canceled our date that day

338
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:26,438
so you could meet up with her,
right?

339
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:29,572
It was for something important,
wasn't it?

340
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:31,205
At least,
something more important

341
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:33,605
than going to see
a movie with me?

342
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:37,405
I... I've wanted to tell you
about so many things!

343
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:39,905
[SATOMI] So tell me!
Just say something!

344
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:42,905
Shinichi,
you can tell me anything!

345
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:47,305
(sighs) You've been preoccupied
with something for a while now,
haven't you?

346
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:49,105
And not about what
happened to Kana.

347
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:50,738
What is it?
[SHINICHI] Nothing.

348
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:51,972
[SATOMI] You're lying!

349
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:53,605
You look miserable.

350
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:54,805
And whatever it is,

351
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:57,105
it's so big that
even someone dying

352
00:19:57,205 --> 00:20:00,005
isn't enough to really
shock you anymore!

353
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:03,672
Come on, Shinichi! What is it?!

354
00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:05,072
That's not...

355
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,105
That's not how it is, okay?

356
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:11,005
Shinichi, you're so strong.

357
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:12,872
I really think you are.

358
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:18,038
But even so, there are times
when I simply can't bear
to look at you.

359
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:22,005
I can see you trying so
desperately to hold
something back.

360
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:26,638
Please, what happened to you?

361
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:31,072
Don't do this by yourself;
talk to me.

362
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:35,172
I wish...

363
00:20:35,272 --> 00:20:36,572
(gasps)

364
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,872
No, no!
Nothing's going on, really.

365
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:43,172
(whimpers)

366
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:46,438
How can you possibly expect me
to believe nothing's wrong?!

367
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,605
Forget it!

368
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,938
I can't even talk
to you anymore!

369
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:52,572
<i>No, please don't say that.</i>

370
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:56,638
<i>I need you... I need you...</i>
<i>I need you more than anything!</i>

371
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:01,672
<i>I'll tell you!</i>
<i>Yeah! I'll tell you!</i>

372
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:04,838
<i>Murano,</i>
<i>something happened to me.</i>

373
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:07,305
<i>I have a... I have a...</i>

374
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,938
There's nothing going on.

375
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:19,272
(gasps) (whimpers)

376
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:22,172
[SATOMI]
It's like you don't trust me.

377
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:25,205
Look, if you won't believe me,
then what can I do?

378
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:28,672
Shinichi, your eyes...

379
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:31,538
your eyes have no... tears.

380
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:57,405
[SHINICHI]
Next time,
"The Selfish Gene"
