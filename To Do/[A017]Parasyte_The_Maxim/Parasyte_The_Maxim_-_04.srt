If you allow yourself to become

10

I will act as if I'm attacking,
but I will actually be
focused on defense...

21
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:35,406
That will allow me to protect
you from his assault.

defense, who will attack?

An analysis of Mr. A's

has led me to believe he
underestimates human ability.

27
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,006
He will naturally
be wary of me,

28
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:53,939
but he has given
no consideration whatsoever
as to your capabilities.

29
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,839
That is his weakness.

30
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,073
I will be on defense,
and you will be on offense.

Oh, Ryoko!
What on Earth's going on?

200
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:23,045
I got a phone call from
the school, so I rushed over
as soon as I could.

201

actually just about
to leave...

about this later, Mother?

It seems to be three
minutes is the limit,

the longest I can
be separated.

242
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:25,011
So, what, you went on
a little morning walk?

243
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:27,945
No, not a walk.
But a movement analysis.

244
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:29,411
Wait, movement...?

245
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,911
Hey! You're not testing
to see how to move up to
my head are ya?

246
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,845
I already told you,
that's not possible.

247
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:35,778
I matured without
eating a brain,

248
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:39,411
therefore I would not
know how to control
an entire body.

249
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:42,078
But still, perhaps
I should give it a try.

250
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:44,178
Ah! Quit screwin' around!

251
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:45,911
Hm? Wait a second...

252
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:48,811
So, then does that mean
the ones who've managed
to take over a brain

253
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,845
can move from
one head to another?

254
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:52,078
In theory, yes.

255
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,611
But there's always
the possibility
of rejection,

256
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,611
so swapping heads
would be quite
dangerous.

257
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,711
I really doubt anyone
would risk it.

258
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:01,045

finally take some time off.

an eye on the house.

is always working,

on a vacation in a long time.

264

You don't...
think it's risky?

265
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:19,478
You mean, because of
the Mincemeat Murders?

266
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:21,211
Looks like those have
finally stopped.

267

It's nothing to worry
about anymore.

268

But that doesn't mean the
killer's not out there!

to some strange place,
it's dangerous.

strongly about it,

<i>The only reason</i>

that he keeps a few secrets

I shouldn't be that worried?

352
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:37,178
It's true.
Simply consider
the probability.

353
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:40,845
My kind prefer urban areas
where food is plentiful.

354
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:44,345
Furthermore, their targets
are normally people who
are out by themselves.

355
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:48,611
If your parents travel out to
the countryside, they will be
safer than they are now.

356
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,111
Yeah, okay...

357
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:51,578
Guess I shouldn't
have been so against it

358
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:52,945
when they brought it up.

359
00:17:53,045 --> 00:17:53,678
Shinichi?

360
00:17:53,778 --> 00:17:55,745
Ah! Wh‐what now?!

361
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:58,278
Were you, uh, just talking
to somebody in here?

362
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,878
Nah, just to myself!
What do you want?!

363
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:04,078
Huh? Well... dinner's
going to be ready soon...

364
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:07,645
Oh, okay. I'll be down
in just a few minutes...

365
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:10,278
And, uh, Mom?
Huh?

366
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:11,678
The next time
you come up here,

367
00:18:11,778 --> 00:18:13,511
could you knock before you
just open up the door!

368
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:16,045
Can I have some privacy?!

369
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,145
Oh... Okay, son.

370
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:20,511
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:24,978
Ahh... I seriously thought
I was gonna have a heart attack!

372
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:28,645
If that were to happen, it would
be an inconvenience for me.

373
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:33,245
Your son was yelling
at me just now.

374
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,145
Well, he's probably up there
whacking off or something.

375
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,945
Oh!
[Dish breaking]

376
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:44,431
[Dog barking]

377
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:46,131
[SHINICHI]
Um, I know I said

378
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:47,998
I was against your
trip this morning,

379
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:49,431
but I take it back now.

380
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,164
Honestly, I think
it's a good idea

381
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,764
for you guys to get
away from everything

382
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:56,631
and go relax somewhere
with some nice fresh air.

383
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:58,698
Mmm...

384
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:00,531
So, when do you leave?

385
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:03,564
Uhh...
Hmm...

386
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:05,564
I don't get it.

387
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:06,598
Huh?
Huh?

388
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:10,864
I just...
don't understand you, Shinichi.

389
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,264
Ah...

390
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:14,331
[NOBUKO]
What on Earth is
going on with you?

391
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:17,464
You were so dead set
against it this morning...

392
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:19,331
I mean you were very adamant...

393
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:21,898
And now you're saying something
completely the opposite.

394
00:19:21,998 --> 00:19:25,664
So now you're not so worried
about your parents, is that it?

395
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,198
Oh, now I get a guilt trip?!

396
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:29,864
Maybe you're the one with
the problems here, Mom!

397
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:31,364
I don't get this...

398
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:33,564
In fact, I don't get
anything about you anymore!

399
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:36,564
Something is just...
Something is different.

400
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:40,198
And it's... like you're
not my son anymore.

401
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:41,631
Baby, please.

402
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:45,264
[Crying]
Please, why won't you tell me?!

403
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:47,531
What's happening to you?

404
00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:49,264
Uh...

405
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:51,531
[Crying]

406
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,198
Shinichi.

407
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,164
I didn't want
to be alone...

408
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:03,964
At least, I didn't
this morning.

409
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:05,264
Huh?
Huh?

410
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:07,098
But when I talked to
a friend about it,

411
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:08,131
he just laughed at me.

412
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:09,631
And I changed my mind.

413
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:11,831
So I think I'm feeling
better about it now...

414
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:15,198
If I do get lonely,
I can just invite
someone to come over.

415
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,364
That's really
all there is to it.

416
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:18,498
Mm‐hmm...

417
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:22,431
You guys understand, right?

418
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:26,798
[Crying]

419
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:31,664
Mm‐hmm...

420
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,398
[SHINICHI]
The taxi should be here
in a coupla minutes.

421
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:36,931
This'll probably
be the first time

422
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:38,231
we've been gone
this long...

423
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:39,731
It should be
really fun.

424
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,264
Y'know...

425
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:43,298
Back when we were living
in the old apartment,

426
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:45,398
we couldn't even
afford to take trips.

427
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:48,164
Right, we could barely
afford the apartment itself.

428
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:51,531
It was in that little
bitty kitchen, where
I wound up with this.

429
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:53,798
Oh! Hmm...

430
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:54,964
[Car pulling up]

431
00:20:55,064 --> 00:20:56,798
Oh? Hehe...

432
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:58,031
[Taxi honks]

433
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,031
Uh... Well, take care
of the place.

434
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:02,664
Uh... Mm‐hm!

435
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:05,898
And be sure to
turn off the stove
and lock the door.

436
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,164
I will.

437
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:09,764
And don't be worried
about us, okay buddy?

438
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,198
Okay.

439
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:14,398
We'll be back!

440
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,331
[RYOKO]
Huh...

441
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:30,731
It moved...

442
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:59,331
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"The Stranger"
