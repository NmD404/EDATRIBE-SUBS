<i>Again...</i>
<i>The same dream...</i>

8
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,813
We have seen
several types
at this point...

9
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,413
Ryoko Tamiya
the teacher was
certainly a surprise,

10
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:03,847
but now there's
a politician...

11
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:05,447
He won't be able
to get elected

12
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:07,913
without having a solid
grasp of human psychology.

13
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:10,013
There's no way he'll
ever get elected...

14
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,813
He's gonna have
to show his true
colors soon enough.

15
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:16,147
Although, given which
town this guy's in...

16
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:17,880
It's possible that
Ryoko Tamiya

17
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,280
is somehow involved in
all this. Possibly...

18
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,280
He seems to be very
interested in this.
Could Hideo Shimada have
had something to do with

19
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,747
So... I guess you think
he's after something.
That could mean‐

20
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,147
Yes. I do.

21
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:29,680
The first possibility is

22
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,613
that by assuming a human
identity and studying mankind,

23
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:35,547
he has developed a real
interest in politics.

24
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,680
In which case, he would actually
make an excellent mayor.

25
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,413
That's ridiculous.

26
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:42,313
But there is also
a second possibility.

27
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,413
He wants to secure safe haven
and a food source for others.

28
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:49,280
Good point, but even if
they hide the bodies
after feeding on them,

29
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,213
people are still gonna
turn up missing.

30
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,947
And let's say they
killed somebody who was
famous or something...

31
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:55,780
they'd get
exposed for sure.

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,213
Being in a position offering
both access and control

33
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:01,247
of such information while
securing food would be ideal.

34
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,980
So that's his
goal then?

Oh, y'know I just had this
feeling that you were there.

I thought I told you
to stay away,

even if that
happened again.

46
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:30,547
Yeah, but it was much
more than just you.

47
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:33,780
I could sense it in the crowd
that had gathered there...

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,780
I'd say, there were about
four or five of them.

<i>sense eight of them,</i>

51
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:48,913

about whatever I want.

for some reason.

that you not get involved
further in this situation.

we wouldn't win.

Oh look. It's not like
I came here to fight.

I can find out how many
of them are here.

63

kind of important

ask you about.

that feeling from anyone
other than me?

stay away from anyone

that "signal."

Tell me the truth,
was speaking to her

your actual objective in
going on today's outing?

112

my species has indeed
evolved over time...

115

developing true human emotions.

not to take any action

put me at risk...

too much to her, then I...

to shreds, would you?

00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:58,347
Kana... You've got
this all wrong.

176
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:00,313
Hm... You know what...

177
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:04,480
The thing that I feel is
different for you than it
is for the rest of them.

178
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,413
Huh? Really?

179
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:07,813
Uh‐huh...

180
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,913
There's a very distinct
difference between them...

181
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:13,513
I can tell if it's you
or if it's one of
those weird monsters.

182
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,113
You really can?

183
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:19,113
So I won't go near anyone with
a "signal" that's not yours...

184
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:20,813
That should solve it, right?

185
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:23,880
Uh... Hm...
I guess so.

186
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,913
Okay, now as far
as I can tell...

187
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,747
I'm the only one in the
world who can do this...

188
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:32,213
You must admit, that's pretty
amazing stuff isn't it?

189
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:35,280
Yeah, you've got
something special.

190
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,513
So. Since I've told you
about my secret...

191
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:41,380
You're gonna have to
show me your secret
someday, too.

192
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,313
What secret?

193
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:45,013
Um your right hand...

194
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:49,713
Otherwise, how can I ever really
be able to believe your story.

195
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:51,213
Fair enough.

196
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:52,513
It's a promise, then.

197
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:56,013
Yeah, I promise.

198
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,147
Mm...

199
00:09:58,247 --> 00:09:59,713
[SHINICHI]
Well. He won.

200
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:01,747
[MIGI]
That means the parasites
have now secured

201
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:04,880
a refuge as well as
a stable food supply.

202
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,413
<i>They're as intelligent</i>
<i>as humans...</i>

203
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:11,813
<i>and they'll do anything</i>
<i>to protect themselves.</i>

204
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:15,447
<i>She said she's able to</i>
<i>tell me apart from</i>
<i>the rest of them,</i>

205
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:18,513
<i>but I'm not sure</i>
<i>that adds up.</i>

206
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:27,398
Oh really?

207
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:28,898
Yeah.

208
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:31,431
It's supposed to be a
really great movie.

209
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,831
Oh...

210
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,231
Yuko and Akiho said they
cried their eyes out...

211
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:37,831
so I have to see it while
it's still in theaters...

212
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:41,131
Okay. So, tomorrow at
ten o'clock then?

213
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:42,464
Sure!

214
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:46,331
[KANA]
<i>Why don't you notice me?</i>

215
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:49,564
<i>We're joined... by fate.</i>

216
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:52,431
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who can sense you.</i>

217
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:56,931
<i>SHE doesn't feel you</i>
<i>like I do...</i>

218
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:59,964
<i>Look over here.</i>

219
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:02,364
<i>Feel me.</i>

220
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:05,331
<i>Please...</i>

221
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,798
[Exhales]

222
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:22,764
[Gasp]

223
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:24,331
Mitsuo!

224
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:26,264
Don't scare me like that.

225
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,098
What're you doing?

226
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:31,498
What's it
matter to you?

227
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:33,164
This isn't like you...

228
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:34,964
It's like you're a stalker.

229
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:37,264
The way you're sneaking
around and following me,

230
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,364
that would be you...
You're the stalker.

231
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:42,064
Can't you see he
already has a
girlfriend?

232
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:45,064
That guy's not right
for you, Kana...
You know that.

233
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,531
Oh, yeah? And you're
saying that you are?!

234
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:48,998
I have had enough of this!

235
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:51,598
Always following me around
like a little puppy dog...

236
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:54,398
Please, you need to
get out of my life!

237
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,864
Uhh... Mm...

238
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:02,031
I don't know
what to say...

239
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:05,298
I can't believe you
hate me that much...

240
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,231
Mitsuo...

241
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:08,864
I'm sorry...

242
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:11,498
But, I just can't do this!

243
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,131
You need to give me
some space.

244
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,564
[MIGI]
I've decided to
tell you something.

245
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,064
Huh?

246
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:25,031
It'd be foolish
for me to make an
enemy out of you...

247
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:27,098
But then again,
I certainly don't want you

248
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:29,364
doing something rash
while I'm asleep, either.

249
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:30,564
Huh...?

250
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:32,731
It's about that
female, Kana.

251
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,831
Her power has grown stronger,

252
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:37,364
and she has now begun
to emit her own signal.

253
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:38,564
Signal?

254
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:40,564
It's the signal
parasites send out

255
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,631
that allows us to
sense one another.

256
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,131
I became aware of hers

257
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,598
while we were on our way
home from school yesterday.

258
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:49,198
What? No way!

259
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:51,798
<i>If she sends out a signal...</i>

260
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:54,431
<i>then those things will</i>
<i>be able to find her...</i>

261
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:57,731
<i>She'll get herself killed!</i>

262
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:59,764
Most likely, she can
only send her signal

263
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,898
when she has
full concentration,

264
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,064
however, her transmission
range is quite limited.

265
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:06,931
Why didn't you tell
me this before?!

266
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:12,264
No... Thank you for
telling me now.

267
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:16,198
Migi...
The other day...

268
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:19,164
While you were asleep,
I told Kana everything I knew

269
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:22,231
about the parasites, and I
told her about you, too.

270
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:25,298
But don't worry she
didn't believe me.

271
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:26,698
I thought as much.

272
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:30,831
Look, I know she wouldn't
turn against you. And so...

273
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:32,998
I was hoping...

274
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:35,998
that maybe you would agree
to show yourself to her.

275
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,798
I mean, it'll be fine!

276
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:39,931
Besides, if she does
ever tell anyone else,

277
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,198
I can always bluff
my way out of it.

278
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:45,031
As long as you
kept on pretending
to be my right hand...

279
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:48,598
she'd just sound
like a crazy person
talking nonsense.

280
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:50,464
Well?

281
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,498
All right.

282
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:55,498
[Sigh]

283
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:57,498
Okay, I'll give
her a call then.

284
00:13:57,598 --> 00:13:59,231
We'll meet her tomorrow...

285
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:02,864
Ah! I have a date
with Murano.

286
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:05,198
Mm...

287
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:08,798

00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,064
Ah...

290
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:20,064
Mmm...

291
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,831
I guess we're a little early.

292
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:29,898
Hey. You remember, right?

293
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:32,031
What you promised
yesterday.

294
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:32,831
Yes.

295
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:34,098
But this is bad.

296
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:35,798
Two of my kind
are approaching.

297
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:36,864
Uhh...

298
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:39,298
[Phone ringing]

299
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:41,631
Hello?

300
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:42,798
I'm sorry...

301
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:44,264
I want to change
our meeting place...

302
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:46,698
For now, don't go
near the trains.

303
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,131
I'll call you later.
[Hangs up]

304
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:50,464
Huh?

305
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:55,298
[MIGI]
It's those two.

306
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:56,731
Let's go.

307
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:59,731
Wait. If we move, it'll
make them suspicious.

308
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:02,131
Pretend you're
making a call.

309
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:08,931
<i>This time...</i>

310
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:12,864

<i>my power can REALLY do.</i>

311
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:15,731
<i>I can sense you,</i>
<i>and you alone.</i>

312
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,331
<i>No one else,</i>

313
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:20,498
<i>not even that girl Murano,</i>
<i>has such feelings for you.</i>

314
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:22,231
[Door opens and closes]

315
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:23,831
I want you...

316
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:26,431
I want you to sense me, too.

317
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:46,531
They acted as though we were
nothing out of the ordinary.

318
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:50,031
[Phone ringing]

319
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:53,164
C'mon why won't
she pick up?

320
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:58,264
There he is!

321
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:04,831
It's no good.

322
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,431
With all these people around,

323
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,298
there's no way I can
pinpoint Kana's breathing.

324
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:12,331
Migi. Aren't you able to
receive that signal of hers?

325
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,564
Impossible. Her signal
is weak in comparison,

326
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:19,164
and she may not
even be sending it
out right now.

327
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:22,264
[KANA]
I'll see him.

328
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,331
I will!

329
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:26,264
I'll see him soon...

330
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:28,498
Shinichi...

331
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:29,731
[MIGI]
There!

332
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:32,098
Uh! What?
You found her?

333
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,298
I didn't.
It's one of mine kind.

334
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,498
I'm not worried
about that now...

335
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:37,898
No... Wait...

336
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,731
If Kana senses
that guy's signal...

337
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,831
She's likely
to approach it.

338
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,831
Which way?!

339
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:47,998
[KANA]
Shinichi! I told you!

340
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:50,731
I am able to sense you
and only you!

341
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:51,764
Shinichi!

342
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:54,131
[Eating sounds]
Haha!

343
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,231
Ah...

344
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,398
Huh! Ohh!

345
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,564
It's a human...?

346
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:09,131
The signal was rather weak...

347
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:10,598
but this is...

348
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,164
unexpected.

349
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,931
Ah! Ahh!

350
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,464
AH! Uuh...

351
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:18,864
[Gasp]

352
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:21,798
[Kana panicked breathing]

353
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:24,031
<i>I'll be okay...</i>

354
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:26,198
<i>He'll come to save me!</i>

355
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,864
Hah...

356
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:35,864
Shinichi!

357
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:37,998
[Thwump]

358
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:43,431
[Thud]

359
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,964
Migi.

360
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:56,198
Handle the defense.

361
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:57,531
Defense?

362
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:01,964
[Grunts]

363
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:04,131
AAHHHH!

364
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:05,264
AHH!

365
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,031
[Crash]

366
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:09,364
Incredible.

367
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,364
[Deep breathing]

368
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,498
[MIGI]
It's no good.
She's lost too much blood.

369
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,431
No, no...

370
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:27,331
Ahh...

371
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:28,298
Kana.

372
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,464
Uhh...Shini...

373
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:32,931
Shinichi... I...

374
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,964
I knew that you were
going to come for me...

375
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:38,331
I could sense you.

376
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:39,964
Just hold on!

377
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:41,964
Uhh...

378
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:45,898
I saw this before.

379
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:48,998
It was in a dream...

380
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:51,564
Please, please try
not to talk.

381
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,598
It was just so
embarrassing...

382
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:59,431
I could... never tell...

383
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:01,464
anyone...

384
00:19:02,764 --> 00:19:04,264
Ahh...

385
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,110
Kana...

386
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,710
[Sniffs]

387
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,143
Huh...

388
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:21,976
[Sobs softly]

389
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,143
[SANDA]
That's the boy who found her.

390
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,776
He seems pretty calm for
someone who just found
his friend murdered.

391
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,610
This is confidential
information,

392
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,576
but that kid's mother
was actually killed by
a parasite as well.

393
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,243
[SANDA]
Really?

394
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,176
Not too friendly, huh.

395
00:19:57,276 --> 00:20:00,476
I'm sure he's pretty tired
of all the questioning
he's been through.

396
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,076
The kid's had
a rough go of it.

397
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:05,710
And we also had him give us
one of his hairs, just in case.

398
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,910
Oh, I'm sure he was
a fan of that.

399
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,210
Well we can't be
too careful...

400
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,543
The victim was
murdered by a parasite...

401
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:16,110
But we... we don't know
who killed that parasite.

402
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,476
Something tore through its
rib cage, gouged out its heart,

403
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:22,876
then slammed it with
enough force to destroy
the wall itself.

404
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,510
No human could do that.

405
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,743
Which means, there was at least
one other parasite at the scene.

406
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:29,943
So, the parasites
had a falling out?

407
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:33,543
Yeah well...
we have to consider that
as a possibility.

408
00:20:33,643 --> 00:20:38,243
If I... had just gone to the
movies with Murano...

409
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:41,710
then none of this would ever
have happened to Kana.

410
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,876
[MIGI]
That's not true, Shinichi.

411
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,710
It was just a matter of time
for this to happen...

412
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,543
You don't need to
feel responsible.

413
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:51,176
How can you say that?

414
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:53,576
[MITSUO]
Stop right there.
Huh?

415
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,210
Kana...

416
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,476
Kana is dead!

417
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:01,876
AHH!

418
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:04,910
Why couldn't you
protect her,
you bastard?!

419
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,276
Ah!
Ugh!

420
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:14,110
How can you be
so freakin' calm
right now?!

421
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:14,843
[Punch]

422
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:16,343
Just one tear!

423
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,576
You can't shed just
one tear for her, huh?!

424
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:20,610
[MIGI]
Shinichi.

425
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,743
You aren't...

426
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:23,876
you aren't even human!

427
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:24,643
Ugh!

428
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,343
That's right!

429
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:33,710
Uuhh...

430
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,110
[Grunting in pain]

431
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,010
You don't know
who the hell I am!

432
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:42,043
Uh...

433
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:44,843
[Sobbing]

434
00:21:44,943 --> 00:21:46,810
<i>If we take this</i>
<i>any further...</i>

435
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
<i>I'm gonna rip</i>
<i>this guy to pieces.</i>

436
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:55,776
<i>"Not human"...?</i>

437
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:59,310
<i>He's right...</i>
<i>he's absolutely right.</i>

438
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:03,443
<i>And why am I</i>
<i>so calm right now?</i>

439
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:06,976
<i>Is it possible?</i>

440
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,743
<i>Have I just not</i>
<i>felt it happening?</i>

441
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:11,743
<i>Am I gradually being...</i>

442
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:14,976
<i>has my brain</i>
<i>been taken over?</i>

443
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:17,643
<i>I mean... Kana is dead...</i>

444
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:20,976
<i>but I...</i>
<i>but I can't cry.</i>

445
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:24,143
[Thud]

446
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,343
[Thud]

447
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:27,576
[MIGI]
Stop it, Shinichi.

448
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:29,176
Huh...

449
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:35,876
At least my
blood's still red.

450
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,510
For now anyway.

451
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:58,543
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"Hello Sadness"
