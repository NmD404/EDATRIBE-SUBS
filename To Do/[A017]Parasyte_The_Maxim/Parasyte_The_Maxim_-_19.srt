1
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:06,041
[SHINICHI]
<i>What the heck's with this guy?</i>

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,508
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

3
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:11,874
<i>he's a parasite!</i>

4
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:14,708
<i>No, he's definitely human.</i>

5
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:16,874
<i>I can tell that much, somehow.</i>

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,508
<i>C'mon, Migi!</i>

7
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,374
<i>Wake up!</i>

8
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:01,296
[KATSUMATA] What's with him?

9
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:02,796
He's changed.

10
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:05,496
He's different now.
Something's going on.

11
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:09,096
[HIRAMA]
This is who he really is.

12
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,930
[SHINICHI] <i>Wait...</i>

13
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,330
<i>Is he human? Is he really?!</i>

14
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:23,363
[URAGAMI] <i>It's not like I really</i>
<i>think that I'm all that</i>
<i>special or anything.</i>

15
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:29,330
<i>How am I able to tell humans</i>
<i>and monsters apart?</i>

16
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:33,263
<i>Huh, let's see...</i>

17
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:37,696
<i>Maybe because I've had my share</i>
<i>of "fun" with humans.</i>

18
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:39,063
(schnick!)

19
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:40,630
<i>Put simply...</i>

20
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,830
<i>I know more about the "quality"</i>
<i>of these beings</i>

21
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,196
<i>than anyone else does.</i>

22
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,196
<i>It's just a shame...</i>

23
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,596
<i>they break so easily.</i>

24
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,596
<i>Oh, yeah...</i>

25
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,763
<i>I've had my fun.</i>

26
00:02:56,863 --> 00:02:58,330
<i>(creepy laugh)</i>

27
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,596
<i>Still, most animals have the</i>
<i>same ability, don't they?</i>

28
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:07,930
<i>It's just an innate capacity</i>
<i>to tell your own kind apart</i>
<i>from others.</i>

29
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,463
<i>I was shocked the first time I</i>
<i>found one of them, of course.</i>

30
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,763
<i>I mean, it was a...</i>

31
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:20,496
<i>creature in humans' clothes,</i>
<i>walkin' around in the crowd.</i>

32
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:23,530
<i>If I watched everyone pass by,</i>

33
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,563
<i>there'd be one or two of them</i>
<i>every hour, if I was lucky.</i>

34
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:32,096
<i>It was kinda weird that no one</i>
<i>else seemed to notice them.</i>

35
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,130
<i>But as for</i>
<i>the creatures themselves,</i>

36
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,763
<i>they looked like they</i>
<i>really didn't care.</i>

37
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:40,296
<i>I pretty much kept my distance.</i>

38
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:43,063
<i>Honestly, I felt like</i>
<i>these guys were BAD news.</i>

39
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:48,130
<i>In fact, I guess you could</i>
<i>call that an "innate</i>
<i>animal instinct" as well.</i>

40
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,963
<i>(disturbing laughter)</i>

41
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,396
<i>Yet, part of me eagerly</i>
<i>looked forward</i>

42
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:59,196
<i>to seeing how some "mysterious"</i>
<i>monster would do things.</i>

43
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:02,230
<i>But it was really no big deal.</i>

44
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,530
<i>Honestly, it wasn't so</i>
<i>different from stuff</i>
<i>I had done.</i>

45
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,830
[URAGAMI]
Well now, you made quite a mess.

46
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,496
I mean, ya gotta clean up
after yourself when you're
done playing.

47
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:15,030
[POLICEMAN] Don't move!
[URAGAMI] (uh!)

48
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,296
[BOTH] (nervous sounds)

49
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:18,763
[URAGAMI]
Wait, no! I... I didn't do this!

50
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:20,330
I know it looks bad,

51
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,096
but it wasn't me!

52
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:29,996
[KATSUMATA]
He's taking his sweet time.

53
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:33,163
[MIYAKE] Mr. Hirama,
I'm afraid we can't wait.

54
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:39,730
Shinichi Izumi's expression
never changed once during
questioning,

55
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,396
but he certainly seems to be
afraid right now, doesn't he?

56
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,830
[HIRAMA] (on headset) Uragami?

57
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,363
It's a wash.

58
00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:51,063
[HIRAMA] (on headset) What?
What's that supposed to mean?

59
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:54,063
[URAGAMI] Well,
this guy might have potential...

60
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,396
but something else
has got my attention.

61
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,896
There's something different
about THIS guy.

62
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:04,863
Things got a little confusing
there at first.

63
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:07,363
[HIRAMA] (on headset)
"Confusing"? In what way?

64
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:11,430
[URAGAMI] I guess maybe I
could've imagined it but...

65
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,030
but just for a second,

66
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,896
I thought I saw something
inhuman deep in his eyes.

67
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:18,396
[HIRAMA] (on headset) WHAT?!
[URAGAMI] (urk!)

68
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:21,163
Jesus Christ, man, don't yell
in my ears, all right?

69
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:23,996
Anyway, I think it
must've been nothin'.

70
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:26,230
When I took another
good look at him,

71
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,263
I didn't see
whatever I saw before.

72
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:41,330
[HIRAMA] So, the two of you
will be staying at the hotel
for a few more days.

73
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,930
We'll have an officer escort you
if you need to visit your house,

74
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,230
so just be sure
to let us know in advance.

75
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,596
No thanks, that's not necessary.

76
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:52,130
Yeah, well, I insist.

77
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,030
[SHINICHI] Um, Mr. Hirama?
[HIRAMA] (hmm?)

78
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,263
I have a question
about the baby, sir.

79
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:08,296
I assume you're talking about
the one with Reiko Tamura.

80
00:06:08,396 --> 00:06:10,596
Well, we need to do more tests.

81
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:14,596
After all, the poor little thing
was being raised by a parasite.

82
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:18,563
[SHINICHI] So, what happens if
you confirm the baby's normal?

83
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:23,663
If that's the case, the child
will then be raised in an
appropriate facility.

84
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:24,830
So, um...

85
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,196
Why would you be
worried about that?

86
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:30,096
Uh, no... It's just I...

87
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:34,863
[HIRAMA] If you were to come
forward and say that you are
related to Reiko Tamura,

88
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:36,896
then I'd have YOU look after it.

89
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,030
[SHINICHI] Huh? What?!

90
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:45,730
[HIRAMA] I was just joking.

91
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,396
Oh... (weak chuckle)

92
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:52,130
<i>"Deep in his eyes," huh?</i>

93
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,363
<i>What the hell did he see?</i>

94
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:59,796
[DAD] Shinichi, need the bath?

95
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,730
Nah, you go ahead.

96
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,496
[DAD] Okay, will do.

97
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,563
(door opening &amp; closing)

98
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:12,096
<i>Ah man, who was that guy?</i>

99
00:07:12,196 --> 00:07:15,230
<i>Just thinking about him</i>
<i>gives me the chills.</i>

100
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,630
<i>I've seen all sorts of</i>
<i>man‐eating monsters,</i>

101
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,463
<i>but that guy...</i>

102
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:22,663
Shinichi, it would seem
that you're exhausted,

103
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:26,263
and not just physically,
but also mentally as well.

104
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,130
I met someone really messed up
while you were asleep earlier.

105
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,096
Human?

106
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:33,530
[SHINICHI] Yeah...

107
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,663
But this guy...

108
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:38,296
He must've been...

109
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,463
a killer.

110
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:43,330
[SHINICHI] I just...

111
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,663
I don't know what's
what anymore.

112
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:48,963
I mean, that guy was really off,

113
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:50,963
and just terrifying.

114
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:54,596
And yet, Reiko Tamura,
a parasite that ate people,

115
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,996
actually saved me...

116
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:59,296
And healed the hole in my heart.

117
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,430
[MIGI] I still find it
impossible to comprehend

118
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,330
Tamura's behavior.

119
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,896
We are two halves
of the same whole.

120
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:12,363
Parasites and humanity
are of one family.

121
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,496
[TAKIZAWA] Therefore,
in regards to the

122
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:23,063
"Legal Interpretation of
Emergency Measures and
Response to

123
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:26,363
Indiscriminate Killings
by Parasites"...

124
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:29,796
The government has indeed given
its approval for this operation.

125
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:34,230
But I'd like you to keep in mind
that there are still many,
many gray areas.

126
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,630
(uh‐hmm)
[YAMAGISHI] (chuckles)

127
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,763
[YAMAGISHI]
Well, yes there are.

128
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,730
Good to see you, Inspector.

129
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,663
Assistant Inspector.

130
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,496
Well, ASSISTANT Inspector,

131
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:48,896
there's talk you'll make
superintendent by the day
of this operation.

132
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,930
You're a really funny guy.

133
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,463
In fact, he'll be commanding
the front‐line forces

134
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:55,530
during the upcoming
tactical operation.

135
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,096
The name's Yamagishi.

136
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:59,296
[TAKIZAWA]
As you've already been informed,
[HIRAMA] (hmm?)

137
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:04,030
[TAKIZAWA] Mr. Hirama will be in
charge of overseeing the support
functions of this operation.

138
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,263
Meanwhile, Mr. Yamagishi,
has his own set of objectives.

139
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:09,930
Identifying and
eliminating the enemy.

140
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,196
Um, Director...

141
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:14,663
I feel that Uragami,
the man I mentioned to you,

142
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,430
could be a very powerful asset
if we use him correctly.

143
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,830
I think we need to reassess
our proposed operations

144
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,730
and incorporate him
into the core strategy.

145
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,563
[YAMAGISHI] Yeah, of course I
appreciate the input, but...

146
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:31,063
As for this "psychic power"
of his, I dunno.

147
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,863
I can't really trust
a convicted killer.

148
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:36,396
Using a rogue element
like that guy?

149
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:39,063
It could hamper how our
tactical forces operate,

150
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:41,063
especially when it matters most.

151
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,130
Now, he wouldn't be there
as an operative.

152
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,463
We'd only be using him
as an extra pair of eyes.

153
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,130
A "pair of eyes"?

154
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,063
But we already have
a detection system

155
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:51,930
that'll be set up
to handle that.

156
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,096
It's not like you're facing
some flock of sheep

157
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:56,896
that can just be
herded up by dogs.

158
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,030
You are clearly
attributing these creatures

159
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,796
with far too much humanity.

160
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:05,930
We're not out to
conduct a manhunt here,
Assistant Inspector.

161
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,396
This is pest extermination.

162
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:18,320
We haven't been able to
get in touch with
Reiko Tamura for days.

163
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,154
The same goes for Kusano,
Hikawa, and Maesawa.

164
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,954
Three dismembered corpses were
recently discovered in a
municipal construction site,

165
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:30,854
and the following day,
a female who was believed
to be a parasite

166
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:32,720
was shot dead in a park.

167
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,120
[HIROKAWA] However, all four
bodies were retrieved by
a special agency,

168
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,454
and none of their identities
have as yet been revealed.

169
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:45,187
We both know that Kusano never
cared for Reiko Tamura
or her methods.

170
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:48,854
I'd say he conspired to
kill her without our consent,

171
00:10:48,954 --> 00:10:51,620
but instead ended up
being the victim himself.

172
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,687
[HIROKAWA]
So you think the woman
who was shot dead in the park

173
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,420
was Tamura, yes?

174
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:58,520
Most likely.

175
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,287
Now that a special anti‐parasite
agency has been created,

176
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:05,754
I am no longer receiving
confidential information.

177
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:10,087
That means the government
is finally starting to
take this seriously.

178
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,454
That would seem to be the case.

179
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,087
[SATOMI] Shinichi!
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

180
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:19,687
[SHINICHI] Murano!

181
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,654
I sure have been good
at making you worry.

182
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:24,854
(mm‐mm)

183
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:26,954
Oh, here!

184
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,120
These are all the notes I took
while you were gone.

185
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:33,287
Oh, thank you.

186
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:34,654
I'll make some copies of them.

187
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:36,787
[YUKO] Hey, it's been a while!
[SATOMI] (giggles)

188
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:38,487
[YUKO] Hey, Murano! (giggles)

189
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:40,754
You done with your
little vacation?
[YUKO] (hmm?)

190
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:42,520
Uh... uh...

191
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,187
[PE TEACHER]
All right, listen up!

192
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,787
This will be your last timed
trial in high school!

193
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:51,754
Give it everything ya got, guys.
Don't leave anything out there!

194
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:55,554
Oh, eat it.
[FURUTANI] I don't think I like
the idea of Coach holding a gun.

195
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:58,387
'Kay, Izumi, I've always
wanted to say this,

196
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:00,454
you have never taken
any of this seriously.

197
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,720
So just ONCE, for me, you gotta
run like you gotta pair!

198
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,687
<i>Yeah, I couldn't really go</i>
<i>all out before, could I?</i>

199
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:09,687
<i>The last one, huh?</i>

200
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:11,620
[PE TEACHER] Get set!

201
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,054
(starting gun)

202
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:22,320
[SHINICHI] (breathing hard)
(stop watch clicks)

203
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,287
(wha...)

204
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:29,720
Jesus! Ten point five seconds?

205
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,487
No freakin' way.

206
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,487
<i>Whatever.</i>
<i>I could've done it in nine.</i>

207
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:43,420
[NAGAI] What's the matter?
You too embarrassed to
change with the rest of us?

208
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,354
Uh...
[FURUTANI] (juvenile chuckle)

209
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:48,820
We're all dudes here,
so don't go gettin' all shy!

210
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,987
[FURUTANI] (uh...)

211
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:54,887
Sorry, man.

212
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,954
(sighs)
Nah, don't worry about it.

213
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:58,554
It's nothing.

214
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,720
(urk) (huh?)

215
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,320
Dumb‐ass!

216
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,120
[SATOMI] Hy‐aa!

217
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:14,187
(huh?)

218
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:16,987
(soft chuckle)

219
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,487
[SATOMI] We'll be
graduating in three months.

220
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,087
[SHINICHI] Yeah...

221
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:26,787
[SATOMI] So much has happened.

222
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,554
It's kinda unreal.

223
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,254
Way too much, if you ask me.

224
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,254
Yeah, but there were
good things, too.

225
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:41,054
Guess now I've gotta
do some studying.

226
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,187
Huh?! You're taking
the entrance exams?

227
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:46,320
[SHINICHI] Yeah. of course!

228
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:50,354
Hey, ya know what?

229
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,020
When I get to college, I‐
(gasps)

230
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:00,687
Let's go.

231
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,454
We can do it, y'know?

232
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,287
[HIRAMA]
In fact, I am certain of it.

233
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:19,987
And yet, I can't help but
feel as though we're
missing something.

234
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,154
I don't know what it is,

235
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:24,987
but it's definitely something.

236
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:28,020
I'd very much like
to hear your thoughts.

237
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,554
[SATOMI] Why's it always...

238
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,220
have to be Shinichi?

239
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,087
It shouldn't be JUST him.

240
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,454
Everyone at this school...

241
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:43,454
We're all trying
our best to move on.

242
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,020
We all just want things
to be normal again...

243
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,320
go back to how they were.

244
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,987
Instead,
we have to live on edge,

245
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,720
afraid of what'll happen next!

246
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,187
[YAMAGISHI] He looks like
just a regular high school kid.

247
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:09,954
[HIRAMA]
He's the witness I mentioned.

248
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:12,820
Ah, so you're the guy?

249
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,554
I heard that you got the chance
to see Hirama and his men

250
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:17,620
put one of them down recently.

251
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,320
That's right.

252
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,954
I know that you're
a civilian and everything,

253
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,954
but do you have any ideas
about any type of weapons

254
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:27,287
that would be
effective against them?

255
00:15:28,654 --> 00:15:31,720
A flamethrower would be
an excellent choice.

256
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,454
But they can move so fast.

257
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:36,387
Of course,
fire alone will not be enough.

258
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,754
But I do think
it'll be effective.

259
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,187
To put it simply,
it will startle them.

260
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:45,354
At least the
surface part, anyway.
[SHINICHI] (ohh...)

261
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:48,120
Now,
we're as intelligent as humans,

262
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,887
and we parasites don't have
an irrational fear of fire.

263
00:15:51,987 --> 00:15:53,987
But...

264
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,220
if we did
encounter it suddenly,

265
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,920
we'd suffer an
internal disconnect.

266
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,420
In short, we would be startled.

267
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,720
Uh‐huh...

268
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,254
We know Goto's body contains
several parasitic sections,

269
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:10,787
but each of those beings are
controlled by a single
consciousness.

270
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,354
So if that consciousness
is startled,

271
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:15,654
it should effectively
unbalance him significantly.

272
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:18,220
Makes sense, I guess.

273
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,687
So we should use flamethrowers?
(snide chuckle)

274
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:23,720
Huh?

275
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,187
[YAMAGISHI] Ah, I'm sorry.

276
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:28,354
Okay,
I'm sure that'd probably work.

277
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,887
But still, no matter how many
parasites there are
in one body,

278
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:36,187
there's just one heart.
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

279
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:51,087
[SHINICHI] The day has come...

280
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,054
[WOMAN] What's going on?

281
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:05,954
[MAN] I have no idea.

282
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:08,287
It looks like the riot police.

283
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,187
But why?

284
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,487
<i>So, this is it.</i>

285
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:32,120
(keyboard clacking)
(high pitched equipment hum)

286
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,587
Sensors ready...

287
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:40,354
and standing by.

288
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,387
Let's do this.

289
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:47,720
[MIZUSHIMA] (on PA)
Attention! This is
an emergency announcement!

290
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,754
Everyone within the building,
please listen to the following
instructions very carefully.

291
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:55,520
I'm Detective Mizushima with
the Higashi‐Fukuyama
Police Department.

292
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,554
A male assailant armed with
a hunting rifle has entered
the building

293
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:01,854
and is now hiding
somewhere on the roof.
(continues in background)

294
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:05,320
[YAMAGISHI] (on radio)
Mutsuki and Kisaragi Squads will
rendezvous in the main hall.

295
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,387
Yayoi Squad will
cover the annex.

296
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,920
Uzuki Squad, take the second
floor and seal all exits.

297
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,154
Satsuki Squad,
protect the detection system.

298
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:15,720
Minazuki Squad,
neutralize the chameleons.

299
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,787
Let's move men; make it count.

300
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:21,054
[MIZUSHIMA] (on PA) ...please
proceed to the main hall on
the first floor at this time.

301
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,420
(bing!)

302
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,587
[HIROKAWA]
<i>They say they're police?</i>

303
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:39,387
<i>But I'm sure NONE of them</i>
<i>are peace officers.</i>

304
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,187
<i>You're really doing this,</i>
<i>you disgusting humans?</i>

305
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,820
This is where the fun begins.

306
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,987
We will strip these bastards
of their masks and lead
them to the slaughter.

307
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:56,654
The suspect is currently
on the north side of the roof!

308
00:18:56,754 --> 00:19:00,220
Now, we'll be able to evacuate
everyone so he can't see you,

309
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,220
but he may take notice if the
entire building leaves at once.

310
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,554
Therefore, we will be leaving
in groups of seven.

311
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:12,987
[URAGAMI]
I'm tellin' ya, I don't know.

312
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:15,287
I hafta see 'em in person.

313
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,154
A monitor's useless.

314
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:22,154
Still, this is
pretty impressive though!

315
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,220
It looks like some
kinda war zone.

316
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,187
I'm not so sure you even
really need me around.

317
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:30,087
(door opens)
[URAGAMI] (huh?)

318
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:32,287
[URAGAMI] Oh, it's you.
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

319
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,554
So bringing in the
armed forces wasn't enough.

320
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:37,754
You had to recruit a killer
and some damn teenager, too?

321
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:39,054
Man, you guys are up the creek.

322
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:40,687
[KATSUMATA] That's enough!
Shut the hell up!

323
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:42,120
(urk!)

324
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,520
[HIRAMA] You see any?

325
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,120
Well, do you?

326
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:53,920
I don't know, sir.

327
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,720
Most of all, we would like
to find the deviant with
the multiple parasites

328
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,254
that you were telling us
about earlier.

329
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,487
<i>The "deviant"?</i>

330
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:06,554
And then, of course,
there's the other one:

331
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:08,487
there is Mayor Hirokawa.

332
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:11,620
<i>That's right...</i>

333
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,554
<i>Hirokawa's the key!</i>

334
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:17,620
<i>But what... what was she</i>
<i>trying to say about him?</i>

335
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,687
They said we're supposed to
evacuate in groups of seven.

336
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,620
You should go first, Mr. Mayor.

337
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,054
No, I couldn't.

338
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:27,787
Please give the children
and elderly first priority.

339
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:29,287
And then the women.

340
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:31,154
Please ensure that
all city workers

341
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:33,387
are shifted toward
the end of the line.

342
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:34,620
(uh...)

343
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,087
[SOLDIER]
Here come the first seven.

344
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:43,854
[YAMAGISHI] HQ to all squads.
If shots are fired

345
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:47,087
and the chameleons make any
attempt to escape or retaliate,

346
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,487
initiate safeguards at once.

347
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,087
[RADIO] Roger.

348
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:55,720
[ODA] I will now remove all
matter from the sensor image

349
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,587
that does not
contain human DNA.

350
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:04,220
(sighs) Nothing in this group.

351
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,620
All right, let's send out
the next seven.

352
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,020
[ODA]
There's nothing here, either.

353
00:21:13,954 --> 00:21:17,554
[SHINICHI] (wishpering)
Migi, you have any idea how
many of them are in there?

354
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:20,887
[MIGI] We're pretty far away,
so I can't say for sure.

355
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:23,020
But there are several present.

356
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:27,020
[ODA] There!

357
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,654
It's that one!

358
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:33,487
So the first one is a woman.

359
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:58,554
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"Crime and Punishment"
