1
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:14,762
I don't think I've been
this far out before.

2
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:17,195
Oh, really?
You gotta be up early tomorrow?

3
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:18,829
No I don't.

4
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:20,962
[MAN] Good, then let's go
a little bit farther.

5
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,062
Th‐there's a spot up ahead
with a beautiful view.

6
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,062
I don't care for this thing.

7
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:29,129
Yeah well, y'know, you might
wanna go ahead and put it on,

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,962
just to be safe.

9
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:33,795
(chuckles)
Hey, what are you doing?

10
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:36,595
(gasps)
(tires screeching)

11
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:38,195
(loud crash)

12
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:46,229
(pained coughing)

13
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,995
The vital organs are ruined.

14
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:55,429
My host body will die soon.

15
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:57,862
I'll use the man.
[MAN] (groans)

16
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:02,029
[PARASYTE] I see.
The belt does serve a purpose.

17
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,495
[PARASYTE]
(groaning with effort)

18
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:10,895
My only choice is to relocate
to this man's body.

19
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:14,429
There should be no difference
in controlling a male host.

20
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:15,662
Sever the head...

21
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:18,195
fuse with the host...
and regenerate...

22
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:22,295
It must all be
done in an instant.
[MAN] (ah...)

23
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:23,762
[MAN] (huh?)

24
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:26,062
[MAN] (aahhh!)

25
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:33,529
[PARASYTE] It feels strange...

26
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,195
I need to move...

27
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:38,729
C'mon, move...

28
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,695
[SHINICHI] Ah! Oh, crap!
I'm gonna be late!

29
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,462
Why didn't you wake me up?!

30
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:20,762
[MIGI]
You slept as long as you did

31
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:22,395
because your body
needed the rest.

32
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:25,029
If I had woken you up,
I would deprive you of energy.

33
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,629
It's a good thing.
[SHINICHI] Yeah, yeah.

34
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,162
[MIGI]
And of course, your well‐being
is also my well‐being.

35
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:34,962
Interesting...

36
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:37,162
it would appear you two
are conjoined.

37
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:40,129
Ah man, what's that even
s'pos'ta mean?

38
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,262
[MIGI] I'm not certain,
but the reason could lie

39
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:44,662
in the network of your nerves
and bodily fluids

40
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:47,229
that are linking my body
to your brain.

41
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,095
Huh?!

42
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,495
It's possible your brain may be
undergoing some kind of change

43
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:53,795
as well as your body.

44
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:56,229
Ryoko Tamiya was probably
able to sense it,

45
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,029
and noticed something about you
that seemed inhuman.

46
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,762
She thinks I'm not a human?

47
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:03,129
The only thing not human
about me's you.

48
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,429
I'm not so sure.

49
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:06,862
It would not surprise me
if you had changed somehow,

50
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,329
particularly at the
psychological level.

51
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:10,829
(gasps)

52
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,795
Going to sleep now...

53
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,029
[SHINICHI] Hey, wait a second!

54
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,762
(grrr...)

55
00:04:16,862 --> 00:04:18,795
We're "conjoined"?

56
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:20,662
Ever so slightly.

57
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:23,829
I won't be killing you
after all.

58
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:27,095
No, there's nothing
wrong with me.

59
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:30,362
Something is just...
Something is different.

60
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:33,929
You know, Shinichi,
you've changed recently.

61
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:35,962
I'm not turning into
one of them!

62
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:38,429
I'm not gonna kill
and eat people.

63
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:48,395
Huh?

64
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:51,729
[MAN]
Hey! I thought I said stand up!
(punching sounds)

65
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:53,229
(ungh!)

66
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,895
[THUG]
You like that, bitch?! Get some!
[NAGAI] (ungh!)

67
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,129
(gasps) Nagai!
(continued punching sounds)

68
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:00,462
[SHINICHI] Stop it!
[THUGS] (huh?)

69
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:02,062
[THUG A] You got a problem?

70
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:05,229
[SHINICHI]
C'mon guys, you need to
leave him alone all right.

71
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:06,995
(uhhh...) Shinichi?

72
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:09,795
[GIRL] (giggles) And why's that?

73
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,095
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

74
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:20,162
but I thinks he's had enough.

75
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:22,095
(hmph) Heh...

76
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,695
(ungh!)

77
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,162
Got anything else you
wanna say, Four‐Eyes?

78
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:31,662
[THUGS] (laughing)

79
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:33,195
I'm thinkin' the little
shit wants another one.

80
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:35,362
[GIRL] Just forget it.
It's kinda pitiful.

81
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:40,062
[GUY] Look pal, we've got some
business with your boyfriend
here, so get lost.

82
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:45,029
One thing I don't understand
about the human psyche

83
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:47,629
is the notion of
"self‐sacrifice."

84
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,695
Doing something to
assist another being,

85
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:51,995
at a cost to oneself,
is unnatural.

86
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:55,429
I do no see the benefit
in this at all.

87
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,195
[SHINICHI] The human psyche...

88
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:58,729
[THUG] C'mon, get up, asshole.
[NAGAI] (groans)

89
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:00,195
[THUG]
We're just gettin' started.

90
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:01,695
[SHINICHI] That's it!
[THUG] Hope you got some time!

91
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,195
Human beings are different
from parasites!

92
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:06,829
Hey! I said to stop it!
(kicking &amp; punching)

93
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:08,095
[SHINICHI]
It's not much of a fight
[THUGS] (huh?)

94
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:10,562
when you have someone
outnumbered!

95
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,662
[GIRL] (huh?)

96
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:13,362
Yo, dude...

97
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,962
You sure you wanna do this? Hmm?

98
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:20,362
Yeah, I do.
[GUY] (heh)

99
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:24,029
[SHINICHI] Might've been a bad
idea... (ungh!)

100
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:27,095
(punching sounds)
[GUY]
This it? This what you wanted?

101
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:29,129
Don't you think you're
overdoing it a little?

102
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:31,362
[SHINICHI] (ungh)
[GUY] Not yet.

103
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:34,895
You heard the dumbass,
he was askin' for it right?

104
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,729
[GUY] (gahn)
[SHINICHI] (ungh)

105
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:41,295
Oh, no, Migi's not gonna know
what this is about!

106
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:43,229
All right that's enough!

107
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:48,695
It's kinda lame to pick on
someone so weak and sad.

108
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,995
[GUY] Must be your lucky day.

109
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:57,462
Mind your own business.
It's less painful. (gasps)

110
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,895
Ah!

111
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,629
(gasps)

112
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,229
Wha...

113
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:16,462
What... What are you?

114
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:21,229
[GUY]
Come on, let's get outta here.

115
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,129
Hey there, Nagai,
you doing okay?

116
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,262
Jesus Christ, man, you crazy?

117
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:39,362
Maybe... That was probably
pretty stupid, huh?

118
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:44,029
But hey, that's the kinda stuff
that separates us from the
animals, right?

119
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,662
Hmm?

120
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:47,729
(bell chiming)

121
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,795
[SATOMI] Oh, my God,
what happened to you?

122
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:53,095
Don't worry, it's nothing.
I'm okay.

123
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:54,629
[YUKO] I asked him that, too.

124
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,395
And he wouldn't tell me either.

125
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:58,462
D'you get in a fight, or, uh...

126
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,929
[KAMIJO] Hey, Shinichi.
[All] (huh?)

127
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,829
Nagai just got through
tellin' me.

128
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:04,129
He said you took on
Mitsuo's whole crew.

129
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,529
I wouldn't say I took them on.
They killed me. Look at my face.

130
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,695
Those guys have been doing
more and more crap
like that lately.

131
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:13,629
If they try anything else,
you let me know, okay?

132
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,462
Oh, sure.

133
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,762
Uh... It's you!

134
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:28,695
So I guess you have
a girlfriend?

135
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:31,562
[SHINICHI] What do you want?

136
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:33,495
Why didn't you
run away earlier?

137
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,262
[SHINICHI]
Huh? I just couldn't...

138
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:37,529
You barely even know that guy
and stood up for him,

139
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:39,629
and you got your ass kicked.

140
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,629
This guy's not quite
right is he?

141
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,762
Do what?
What's that supposed to mean?

142
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:46,362
[SHINICHI] Let's go.

143
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,595
I can see through you!

144
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:53,262
You can pretend to be
all self‐righteous,

145
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,929
but I know that
you're up to something!

146
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,795
[SATOMI] What's her deal?

147
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:00,395
[SHINICHI] I dunno.

148
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:05,029
Dammit, Kana...

149
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,595
(loud crash)

150
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:08,262
[SATOMI] (ah!) Stop it!
[SHINICHI] (ungh!)

151
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,495
[SATOMI] (screams)

152
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,129
(pained groans)

153
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:17,129
[SATOMI] (whimpers)
Shinichi, help!

154
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,629
Murano!

155
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,395
Shinichi!

156
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:29,695
There you are, you piece‐a‐shit.

157
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:32,429
[SHINICHI]
Just let her go! Come on!

158
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:34,795
[GUY] Nah, I don't think so.

159
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:38,029
Go on home;
we'll take care of her.
[SHINICHI] What?

160
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,362
[SATOMI]
(whimpers) Ow, that hurts!
[THUG] That's right!

161
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:42,129
(grrr...)

162
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:46,729
(ungh!) (argh)

163
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,162
Shinichi, no!

164
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:51,029
I said go!
[SATOMI] Please, stop it!

165
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:53,895
Y'ain't actin' like
a frickin' hero this time!

166
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:57,629
Face it, you can't do
a goddamn thing.

167
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,662
(panting)

168
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:01,695
[MIGI] Shinichi...

169
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:03,429
No not now, Migi.

170
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:04,729
You can go back to sleep.

171
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:05,929
[MIGI] Shinichi...

172
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:08,529
[SHINICHI]
I can take care of this.

173
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:09,995
[SHINICHI] (hyah)

174
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,462
(ungh)

175
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:14,995
[MIGI]
For your reference, I will rate
each of them by strength.

176
00:10:15,095 --> 00:10:17,529
If your rating is a ten,
then he's an 18.

177
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:22,029
The one to the right is a 13,
and the others are 14 and 12.

178
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:24,362
Migi, why are you
telling me all this?

179
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:26,762
[MIGI] Even dogs and cats
are able to evaluate

180
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:29,062
the strengths and weaknesses
of their opponents.

181
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,195
Animals instinctively avoid
fights they cannot win.

182
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:35,129
[SHINICHI]
Yeah, so what's your point?

183
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:38,295
[SHINICHI] (ungh!) (urggh)
[SATOMI] Leave him alone!

184
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:41,695
Well, sometimes a human
can't back down from a fight.

185
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:44,795
There's a difference between
humans and animals.

186
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:48,529
Migi, I don't have much
feeling in my hand!

187
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,262
Give me full control! (ungh!)

188
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:53,895
Sorry, you got something to say,
you'll have'ta speak up!

189
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:59,395
(coughing &amp; gasping)

190
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:04,095
Man, why doesn't he
just give up?

191
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:06,462
[SHINICHI]
You are gonna let her go!

192
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:08,662
Or else!

193
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:11,329
(gasps)
Wait! No, Migi, stay outta this!

194
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:12,762
(huh?)

195
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:22,129
[GUY] "Or else," what?

196
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:23,995
You'll run home and
tell your mommy?

197
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:26,829
[THUGS] (derisvie laughter)

198
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:29,295
I, uh, think that's enough,
Mitsuo.

199
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,429
[MITSUO] Kana...

200
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:36,929
[KAMIJO] Well, well,
look what we have here.
[ALL] (huh?)

201
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:40,762
[SHINICHI] Kamijo, Nagai!

202
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:48,962
[MIGI] Ah, yes, the majority
overpowering the minority.

203
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:52,462
These humans actually make
much more sense than you do,
Shinichi.

204
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:55,495
Looks like it's time for some
payback, you son of a bitch.

205
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:58,629
You think cause you brought some
friends you've got a chance?

206
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,329
You've made a big mistake.

207
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,795
SHUT UP!
(melee sounds)

208
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,362
(waves crashing)

209
00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:19,762
Hmm... The male genitalia
are actually quite different
from the female.

210
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:25,395
I can't seem to control them
very well. (grunt)

211
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,229
Something's wrong, I can't move.

212
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:30,429
Damn! It's rejecting me!

213
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,829
I can no longer merge with
a body of the opposite sex.

214
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,962
I must find a woman.

215
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:38,695
Leaving the urban area
was a mistake.

216
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:41,829
I must find a new host
and relocate.

217
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,195
[SHINICHI] Look, it's not like
I can't walk or anything.

218
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:47,429
I'm fine, really.

219
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:50,462
Uh, no, you're not.

220
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:55,395
[SATOMI] I'm really sorry.

221
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:58,429
There's nothing that
you need to apologize for.

222
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,762
Oww, ow!

223
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,729
Oh, huh? Your right hand
isn't even scratched.

224
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:06,929
Cause I mean, your left hand
sure got messed up pretty badly.
[SHINICHI] (ah... uh...)

225
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:09,829
Ah... How 'bout that?

226
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:19,462
Tell me...
Do you think that I'm weird?
[SATOMI] (huh?)

227
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:21,095
Do I seem normal to you?

228
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:24,595
Oh, no, you are not
normal at all.

229
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,095
I'm not?

230
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:30,195
Well, you're kinda cool
[SHINICHI] (huh!) (embarrassed)

231
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:33,762
You risked yourself
to help a friend.

232
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:36,895
Not many "normal" people
out there would do that.

233
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:39,462
Is that s'posta be a compliment?

234
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:44,362
[SATOMI] Of course.
[SHINICHI] (ah!)

235
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,929
I've never known anyone who
would try something like that,

236
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,429
knowing you couldn't win.

237
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,862
You did a really good thing.

238
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:55,295
[SHINICHI] Oh, okay.

239
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,529
My parents are out of town
right now...

240
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:03,429
Do you maybe wanna stay over?

241
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,362
Mmm... No, thanks...

242
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:06,662
I should go.

243
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,262
(small giggle)

244
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:13,362
[MIGI] Very disappointing.

245
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:16,162
I'd hoped I'd get the chance
to see humans mate.

246
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:17,329
Oh, go to sleep.

247
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:19,262
[KANA] Who are you talking to?

248
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,095
You followed me home?

249
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,495
[KANA] I just came to apologize.

250
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,095
Oh, uh...

251
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:27,862
Okay, then.

252
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:32,529
A truce?
[SHINICHI] (hmm?)

253
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:36,062
Well, at the very least,
WE don't have a problem, do we?

254
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:38,595
Um...

255
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,195
Yeah...

256
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,929
(gasps)

257
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:55,029
(uh!) S‐sorry,
I'm really... tired.

258
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,729
[MIGI] You should be careful
when it comes to that female.

259
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:05,329
It seems she is able to sense,
however slightly,

260
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:09,295
wavelengths that should only be
perceptible to parasites.

261
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,162
But she is human, right?

262
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:14,595
I've noticed Murano's also a
very perceptive person.

263
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:16,995
But THIS girl is on
a whole different level.

264
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:19,329
You should stay away from her.

265
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:22,062
[SHINICHI] Yeah...

266
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,762
(waves crashing)

267
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:38,229
[MOM] Wow, this is beautiful!

268
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:42,762
Yeah, kinda makes all that
rushin' around to get here
worthwhile doesn't it?

269
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:44,895
We should come back here.
(giggles)

270
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,762
And bring Shinichi with us!

271
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,762
(chuckles) He's never far
from your mind, is he?

272
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:53,562
(huh?!) Nobuko!
[MOM] (huh?)

273
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,429
(hissing) (thwack)

274
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:06,995
(sighs)

275
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,662
[MIGI] Your diet appears
to be unbalanced.

276
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:12,295
You don't even know what
this tastes like.

277
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:16,195
[MIGI] Your mother always
prepares nutritionally
appropriate meals.

278
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:20,095
Well, I can eat like that
again tomorrow.
(phone buzzes)

279
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:24,429
It's from a public phone.

280
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,729
[DAD] Shinichi?
[SHINICHI] Yeah, Dad?

281
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:31,195
[DAD] Y‐your mother...

282
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:33,662
Uh... what's wrong?

283
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:36,929
[DAD] Your... your mom...

284
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:39,362
I'm going to the police.

285
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:42,862
I'll get that damned monster
if it's the last thing I do!

286
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:45,562
(unnhhh...) (loud thump)

287
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:49,362
Wait, Dad?! A monster?!
(dead line)

288
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,462
[SHINICHI]
"A monster"? It can't be...

289
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:57,862
But... but Mom...

290
00:16:57,962 --> 00:17:00,295
[MIGI] Shinichi, what is it?

291
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,614
[SHINICHI] Dad! Mom!

292
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:13,714
What's going on?
What is this place?

293
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:16,047
[DAD] We're in no rush.

294
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:19,580
We'll just decide where to stop
as we go along.

295
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,880
[MOM] It'll be nice to just
relax and take it easy.

296
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,147
[SHINICHI] Dad, where's Mom?

297
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,714
[DAD] That goddamn monster!

298
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:35,447
[SHINICHI] She's not a monster,
she's... Mom! (echoing)

299
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:38,180
[MOM] Shinichi...

300
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,314
[SHINICHI] MOM! (echoing)

301
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,580
(gasps)

302
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:48,580
Come on, Dad,
you gotta call me back.

303
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,314
I gotta figure out
a way to find them!

304
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:56,780
Shinichi, you really need
to get some sleep.

305
00:17:57,847 --> 00:17:59,080
"A monster..."

306
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,980
That's exactly what
Dad said on the phone.

307
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,080
I know that can
only mean one thing.

308
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,547
Hmm... Hold on, Shinichi.
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

309
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:11,947
I'm detecting
one of my kind nearby.

310
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,414
And it's coming
directly toward us.

311
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:16,880
This is all your fault.

312
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,614
I was against them taking the
trip in the first place.

313
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:22,314
But you said they'd be safe;
you said it would be fine!

314
00:18:22,414 --> 00:18:24,247
I never said that
it would be "fine."

315
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:26,347
I merely pointed out that,
in terms of probability‐

316
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:29,214
Shut up! I should've told them
about what was really going on

317
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:30,780
when you showed up
in the first place!

318
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,447
I understand there's a lot
you'd like to discuss right now,

319
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,847
but I need you to focus on the
battle that's about to commence.

320
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:45,714
No, you won't need
a weapon this time.

321
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:48,014
I will eliminate it before
it's able to determine

322
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:50,214
whether or not
we are friend or foe.

323
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:52,214
I can't face this thing unarmed.

324
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:55,114
I'm so full of hate right now,
I'm going crazy.

325
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:56,347
Those damn monsters!

326
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,747
[MIGI] It stopped moving...

327
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,680
It's just outside.

328
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,114
(lock clicking)

329
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,280
How could it unlock the door?

330
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,680
(footsteps)

331
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,480
(ah!) It's you!

332
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,514
[SHINICHI] Mom?

333
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:39,514
So, then the male
has not yet returned.

334
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:41,347
What's that Mom?

335
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,914
That's not your mother.

336
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:44,114
You know that.

337
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:45,880
Uh, welcome back!

338
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,547
Mom, are you doing okay?...

339
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:49,480
What's the matter?

340
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,280
[MOM]
This is a unique situation.

341
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,747
A merge with the hand
is highly unusual.

342
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:57,547
One of my kind has taken over
your mother's head, Shinichi.

343
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,647
Huh? My hand?

344
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:01,280
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Mom.

345
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,880
I mean, I really wanted to tell
you about it earlier, but I...

346
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,914
I just couldn't. I, uh...

347
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:09,080
I mean, it's kinda crazy, right?

348
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,147
No, Shinichi, she's not‐
[SHINICHI] JUST SHUT UP!!

349
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:14,314
Am I to assume
the male is now dead?

350
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,680
I see.
Then I must go back and confirm

351
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,280
whether or not he's
actually been eliminated.

352
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,680
The knife, it's in my way.
Put it down.

353
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,780
So, yeah, I know, having a
talking right hand is
pretty weird.

354
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,314
I mean hard to believe right?

355
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:30,080
Just the hand? How unlucky.

356
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,080
Without taking the head,
you find yourself under
human control.

357
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,247
(grr...) Stop it, Mom!

358
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:38,980
I'll tell you everything
I've been hiding from you!

359
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,414
Just, please,
stop talking like that!

360
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:43,247
Shinichi, you have to see
what's happening.

361
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:44,614
Your mother is already‐

362
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:46,014
Shut up! JUST SHUT UP!

363
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:47,214
You don't know what
you're talking about!

364
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,580
If you keep talking,
[MIGI] Shinichi!

365
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,747
I swear I'll cut you off!
(breathing heavily)

366
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,580
Please, Mom!

367
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,580
It's okay...

368
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,947
You remember it right?

369
00:20:58,047 --> 00:20:59,980
The scar on your arm?

370
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,014
Every time I see it,
I feel guilty.

371
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:04,780
And, Mom, I...

372
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,547
I wanna apologize.

373
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:12,014
(gasps)

374
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:13,614
Shinichi!

375
00:21:17,814 --> 00:21:19,480
(unhhh...)

376
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:32,414
(unhhh...) (sobs)

377
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:33,647
Mom...

378
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,247
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"The Sun Also Rises"
