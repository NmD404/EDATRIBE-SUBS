00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:39,368
Huh?

[Gasp]

00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:53,068

00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,435
[MIGI]
One is dead.

8
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:15,868
Uh...

9
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,535

We got one!

10
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,235
[YAMAGISHI]
<i>One down.</i>

11
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,868
Retrieve the body...
Use a different route.

12
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:05,368
Yessir!

00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:08,035
[YAMAGISHI]
<i>Those things aren't</i>

14
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:11,268
<i>They're just machines</i>
<i>driven by demons...</i>

15
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:15,535
<i>And all it takes to</i>
<i>stop a machine is to</i>
<i>destroy the engine.</i>

16
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,368
<i>To destroy the heart,</i>

17
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:22,801
<i>destructive spread is</i>
<i>more important than</i>
<i>mere penetrating power.</i>

18
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,768
<i>What we need are</i>
<i>shotguns loaded with</i>

19

What was that?
Did you hear that?

21
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:35,868
[Man]
I heard gunshots.

22
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,235

Somebody's shooting.

23
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:38,701

Hey! You know what's goin' on?

24
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,701
Everyone, please
remain calm...

25
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:43,301
The gunman's firing
warning shots.

26
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:45,601
He's only trying
to prove a point!

27
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,635
So for now, we're going to wait
for a just few minutes.

28
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:50,135
Then resume evacuations.

Well now...
What is going on here?

32
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,868

Evacuations may now continue.

00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:12,135
[ODA]
Nope. All clear...

34
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:19,201
None here, either.

35
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:21,868
What's going on?

36
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:24,201
This can't be right...

37
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:26,935
Are they onto us?

38
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:27,768
[ITO]
Captain.

39
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,268
Hm?

40
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:35,168
The late investigator's
notes mentioned
something interesting...

41
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:37,468
although rather vaguely...

42
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:41,035
Telepathy...?

43
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:42,468
Yeah yeah, I read about that.

44
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:44,835
[HIRAMA]
We need to take
every precaution.

45
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:46,368
I'm about to
send Uragami in.

46
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:50,035
Please, don't
hesitate to use him.

47
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:52,768
I don't trust this guy...

48
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,701
Hm?

49
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,568
Hold on for just a second...

50
00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:58,035
Whatcha got?

51
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:00,368
I have an update
on Hirokawa.

52
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,835
So some people still
haven't made it down?

53
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:05,301
That's right.

54
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:07,035
It looks like a town
meeting was scheduled

55
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:09,035
in the second floor
conference room today.

56
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:10,535
And I doubt the people
who're up there

57
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:12,768
were able to hear
the announcement.

58
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:14,635
Don't worry we'll
take care of it.

59
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,501
We'll send some men
to check things out.

60
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,701
Yes, well I don't think
they're going to react well.

61
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:21,935
A group of men
coming in with guns...

62
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:24,668
It's likely to
cause more panic.

63
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:25,735
He's right.

64
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,101
We'll go up to
the second floor

65
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,101
and bring them
back down with us.

66
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:32,901
Looks like they're
making their move.

67
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,801
Don't let them leave...

68
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,235
Try and stall them.

69
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,501
Yessir!

70
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:40,268
Okay I'm back...

71
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:42,501
You can go ahead and
bring in your psycho killer

72
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:45,101

Ya gotta take
these cuffs off.

What'll I do if things
get ugly around here?

76
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:55,035
Look, I'm not gonna run.

00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:57,568
I couldn't go anywhere
if I wanted to,

78

there's cops everywhere.

But stay by me.

Hey Migi...

81
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,935
We should help out, too.

82
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,535
We can at least sense
who the enemy is.

That's a bad idea.

It was strictly to
eliminate the enemy.

their priority...

prevented a panic.

unfortunately sacrificed...
