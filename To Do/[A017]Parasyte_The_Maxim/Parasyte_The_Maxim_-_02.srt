00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,213
A‐ahh...

2
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:09,980
I... right hand... failure.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,480
It's because of the canine.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,846
Maturation and environment
were factors,

5
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:21,046
but it was lax with its studies.

6
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,513
[THUGS]
Hehe...

7
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:57,513
[THUG 3]
Hey little lady.

8
00:01:57,613 --> 00:01:58,546
You a college student?

00:01:58,646 --> 00:01:59,480
[GIRL]
Mm‐mm!

10
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,413
[THUG 1]
No? Really?

11
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:01,546
You work around here?

12
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:03,580
Ah, come on. It's okay.

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,346
We just wanna talk to ya.

14
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:07,013
[GIRL]
I'm sorry. Excuse me please.

15
00:02:07,113 --> 00:02:08,746
[THUG 2]
Aw, now what's the big hurry.

16
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,113
You're not leavin' yet are ya?

17
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,046
Yeah. Dontcha wanna

[GIRL] Ah!

18
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:14,346
Just relax‐

19
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:16,680
Urk! Ugh!
[Punching]

20
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,313
[THUG 2]
Hey what do you think you're‐

21
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:19,446
Gah!

22
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:21,046
Ugh!

23
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:25,780
I'll walk you.

24
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,646
Ahh...
Ugh...

25
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:37,046
[Grunt]

26
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:38,646
[GIRL]
AAAAHH!!

27
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:41,713
Think you can just
walk away fancy pants?!

28
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:45,613
Uhhh...

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,880
[THUGS]
Heh, heh, heh...

30
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,146
I don't think my stomach
can hold all four of you.

31
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:52,813
Your stomach?

32
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,580
[Swishing]

33
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:00,880
Seems two swings was
more force than necessary.

34
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,580
[GIRL]
Aaaahh!!
[Swish]

35
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,646
I should probably change
my appearance as well.

36
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:17,746
[HAND]
I take it you don't feel
the need to go to the
police anymore?

37
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:22,280
[SHINICHI]
Uh‐huh. I think I realized
that if I ran into another one
of you parasite things...

38
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,613
without you I'd be a
pretty easy target to kill.

39
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:28,013
A very wise decision.

40
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:31,846
[SHINICHI]
You know, I should probably
give you a name.

41
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:35,013
No thanks. I do not have
the needs of human beings.

42
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:35,946
Nor am I your pet.

43
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:38,380
Well I need to
call you something,

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,880
I can't just call you
"you" or "righty".

45
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,313
In that case...
you can call me Migi.

46
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:45,980
What? Migi?

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,846
Well sure. It means
the same thing,

48
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,980
but doesn't sound
nearly as silly.

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,046
Hmm... Well I'm not so sure
if I'd say that...

50
00:03:55,146 --> 00:03:57,313
[MIGI]
Well, you're the one
who wanted a name.

51
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:59,746
I see no need for them anyway.

52
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:09,646
[Ball bouncing]

53
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:11,646
[Grunt]

54
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,346
Nice shot!
Whoo!

55
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:15,546
He's got some
nice moves.

56
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:18,146
Huh? Well... I...

57
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:20,513
Shinichi!
Huh?

58
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:22,646
Murano here says that
she'll totally forgive you

59
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,546
if you manage to
make another shot!

60
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:26,180
What are you doing Yuko?

61
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,913
&lt;Yuko chuckles&gt;
Uhh...

62
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:29,213
Uhh...

63
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:31,246
Hm...

64
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:34,880
Ow, hey!

65
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,580
Hmph!

66
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,780

67

[Grunt]

68
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,413
Five seconds left!

69
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:50,046
<i>Welp! Here goes nothing!</i>

70
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,980
Aah!

71
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:55,980
Ha ha ha!

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,313
Uh... oh!

73
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,246
[Softly]
Thank you, Migi.

74
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:03,013
Pretty good, eh, Murano?

75
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:04,346
Uh‐huh...

76
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:07,580
Piece‐a‐shit, Shinichi...

77
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,313
Oh!

78
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,380
Oh, look at the time,
I gotta go!

79
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,246
Uh...
[SHINICHI] Um...

80
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:18,813
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:21,280
I really wasn't trying to
grab you like that yesterday.

82
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,746
It's just... My hand just
sorta went off on it's own...

83
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:27,780
and anyway...
I'm really sorry!

84
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,113
Well I'm glad you know
what you did was wrong.

85
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:31,480
Yes, yes it was!

86
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,146
It was so very wrong!

87
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,846
Well maybe I can find it in
my heart to forgive you

88
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:39,313
if you treat me to
pancakes next Sunday.

89
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:40,780
But hear this!

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,146
If you ever pull any crap
like that again you're dead!

91
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:44,580
No, no of course.

92
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,613
I won't, I promise.

93
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,146
Hehehe...

94
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:52,846
Okay then.
I'm holding you to it.

95
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:55,080

Everything's just fine,
don't worry!

It's all good.

Um... Shinichi?
Huh?

00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:13,446
You are... you ARE

104

Yeah of course I am!

[Chuckle]
See ya!

108
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:27,780
Are you crazy, what do you
think you're doing, man?!

109
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,913
I was just curious about your
human mating behavior.

110
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:34,280
I could sense you wanted to mate
with that female, correct?

111
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:35,780
Huh?!

112
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
No, no I did not want to
"mate" with her!

113
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,113
[NAGAI]
Shinichi!

114
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:40,213
Huh?

115
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:42,413
Come outside with me.

116
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:44,280
Now.

117
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:51,380
So why are you in there
talking to yourself,

118
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,980
ya practicing your
pickup lines? Huh?!

119
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:55,846
Uh, well...

120
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:58,280
I should probably
go get changed...

121
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,346
Hold it! I've had my
eye on Murano

122
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:02,280
since we were both
in middle school.

123
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,080
Oh yeah?
Is that so...?

124
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,780
You stay away from her.

125
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,646
Eh... Haha...

126
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:09,146

Come on, get up!

to fight back?

hold back you idiot!

An "idiot"?
That word is to be used

when addressing a being
of lower intelligence.

147

You didn't kill him,
did you?

I'm detecting urine in

dermatophytes will propagate,

for me to pee

170
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,546
next to a guy
talkin' to his pecker.

The "Mincemeat Murders"?

00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:49,146
Yeah. From what I've heard,

175
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:51,080
it seems that they've been
happening all over the world.

176
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,213
The victims are literally
torn to pieces.

177

The police have been
trying to keep it quiet,

178
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:58,613
but some really graphic videos
have been showing up online.

179
00:08:58,713 --> 00:09:00,246
What about the killer?

180
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:02,413
Still out there somewhere...

181
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:03,880
The thing is...

182
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,846
there's no way one person
could commit so many murders

183
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,813
all over the world at
the same time, right?

184
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,880
There has to be more people
involved in this,

185
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,013
like some kind of
crazy cult or something.

186
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:14,380
[SHINICHI]
Well, what does your
brother say about it?

187
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,513
He's a detective,
isn't he?

188
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:17,680
Yeah, well...

189
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,980
I asked him about it
the other day,

190
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,146
but he won't tell me
anything right now...

191
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:24,613
Which hopefully means that
the cops and the government
are already working on it

192
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:27,313
and trying to figure out
a way to solve this thing.

193
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:39,080
[SHINICHI]
So then, I guess this means
that more of your kind
are out there, huh?

194
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,613
[MIGI]
Most certainly.

195
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,046
When we ran into that canine
I learned something.

196
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:45,946
It would seem that those
inhabiting dogs only eat dogs.

197
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:49,680
While those who inhabit humans
will thus only eat humans.

198
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,280
Essentially, we are
cannibalistic.

199
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,146
What are you thinking,
Shinichi?

200
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,946
Should we really
stay quiet about this?

201
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,546
What exactly do you
mean by "stay quiet"?

202
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:04,446
We can't let them
run wild.

203
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:06,546
They're killing people
left and right.

204
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:08,313
What do you mean,
"run wild"?

205
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:09,613
Don't you get it?!

206
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,713
Only WE know what
they really are!

207
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:15,380
At this rate, there
will be more and more
victims every day.

208
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,780
Which is why...

209
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,180
"Which is why" what?

210
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,446
If I take you to 'em...

211
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:20,713
They can research you...

212
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,313
And learn what you are...

213
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,646
I don't understand.

214
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,913
Your logic's a bit difficult
for me to follow.

215
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:29,246
My kind are simply
feeding to stay alive
and nothing more.

216
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:32,246
It's natural for
life forms to feed
on other life forms.

217
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:36,013
You just find it unpleasant
that it's your own kind
that is being eaten.

218
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:37,613
Well yeah of course!

219
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:40,413
Human life is a
precious thing, isn't it?

220
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:41,713
I don't know.

221
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,180
I can tell you that
I value my own life.

222
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,813
Although I've never really
considered any other life form
to be all that valuable.

223
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:50,813
Yeah... bet you haven't.

224
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:54,013
'Cause you seem to be more like
an animal or an insect.

225
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:55,513
Shinichi...

226
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,613
is that an attempt
to be insulting?

227
00:10:57,713 --> 00:10:59,280
Understand this.

228
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,213
If you were to take action
in any way that would be
harmful to me,

229
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:05,613
I would have no choice
but to do everything in
my power to stop you.

230
00:11:05,713 --> 00:11:06,880
Uh‐huh...

231
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,180
Your survival depends on me.

232
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,613
You're just a parasite.

233
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,546
I WILL protect your life.

234
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:17,280
Although... you don't
necessarily need to
be able to speak.

235
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,446
Ah!

236
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,313
And then...
you don't really need

237
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,380
to be able to see
or hear either.

238
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,713
A‐ah...

239
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:27,213
Well... Looks like
someone's terrified.

240
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:30,646
Perhaps you should maybe
take a little rest.

241
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:41,916
[SHINICHI]
You're a demon...

242
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:46,583
[MIGI]
Shinichi, I have done some
research into the concept of
these "demons" you speak of.

243
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:50,816
And I would say that humans
are the life forms most
closely resembling them.

244
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,416
Humans tend to kill and
eat a multitude of
different life forms,

245
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:57,216
while my kind simply eats
only one or two.

246
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,083
We're quite frugal and
efficient in comparison.

247
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,550
Oh, whatever.
I'm not listening.

248
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,116
[SHINICHI]
People out there
are being killed.

249
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:13,016
And I'm the only one
who truly knows
what the killers are.

250
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,683
Mincemeat...

251
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:30,816
[B]
Hmm... Such a shallow breed.

252
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,783
They grind cows
and pigs into feed,

253
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:35,683
and then act so surprised
when it happens to them.

254
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,716
Hmm?

255
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:39,550
Well now...

256
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,150
Isn't this unusual.

257
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,983
It's one of my own.

258
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,450
[MIGI]
Shinichi.

259
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,050
One's coming this way.

260
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,983
Huh?

261
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,216
It's one of my kind.

262
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,950
It's somewhere over in
the crowd to our left.

263
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:02,283
There are too many people for
me to identify the individual,

264
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,316
but I'm certain that
one's there.

265
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,050
We need to fall back.

266
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,750
A single misstep now,
and it could mean another
fight to the death.

267
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,050
Walk faster.
It's getting closer.

268
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,216
Maybe it wants us to join
your little cannibal club.

269
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,816
[MIGI]
Shinichi! Where do you
think you're going?

270
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,316
It's forty meters away,
right behind you.

271
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,283
And it's gaining on us.

272
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:31,683
[SHINICHI]
I'm going to meet him.

273
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:34,016
I want to look this murderer
right in the eye.

274
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,916
[MIGI]
Don't be so foolish.
You'll get yourself killed.

275
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,216
[SHINICHI]
Then I guess you'll just
have to protect me.

276
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:40,450
[MIGI]
This is different.

277
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,916
We won't be up against
a dog this time.

278
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:50,183
No one will be able
to see us back here.

279
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,950
[MIGI]
I have much to learn
about the human mind.

280
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,650
You seem to be completely
numb to fear right now.

281
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,316
Tell me. Why is that?

282
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,216
A lot of people have
been killed since
these murders began.

283
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:03,950
<i>If I don't do something,</i>
<i>Murano could be one of them.</i>

284
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,483
I know you think
that I shouldn't do
anything about it.

285
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,716
That I should let these
things go on killing
people, but I can't!

286
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:13,116
I've got to fight!
Fight for humanity!

287
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:15,650
For humanity then...
I see.

288
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,450
And I'm going to need
your strength to do it.

289
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,183
I need your help.

290
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:22,516
Migi please...

291
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:24,550
Five meters.
Ah!

292
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:26,283
Uhh...

293
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:34,083
Now I see...

294
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:37,216
So this is the reason
you were running away.

295
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:38,850
[Nervous breathing]

296
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,183
Your host's brain is still
completely intact and
functional.

297
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:45,683
A rather dangerous situation
wouldn't you say?

298
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,250
Shut the hell up,
you monster!

299
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,050
Excuse me?

300
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:53,616
Stop right there!

301
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:54,950
If you attack this human,

302
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,283
I will be forced to
retaliate and destroy you.

303
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:58,716
Take it easy.

304
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,183
I understand.

305
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:02,416
I can appreciate where
you're coming from.

306
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:04,083
But you must realize...

307
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:07,183
you do have the option of
simply moving over to me.

308
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:08,583
A transfer?

309
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:11,183
I don't think relocation's
possible at this point.

310
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,516
What's that?

311
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:14,516
Looks like you still
have a lot to learn.

312
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:16,216
Relocating from
a mere appendage

313
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,150
to a more complex structure
would indeed be impossible.

314
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,583
That said... moving from
one arm to other is simple.

315
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:30,183
Huh!
Huh?

316
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,150
Well then?

317
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,450
I've created a location
for you to join me.

318
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,683
You should fit quite nicely.

319
00:15:41,883 --> 00:15:45,350
Well? What are you waiting for,
it's time to transfer.

320
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,616
Once we inhabit the same host,
we'll both become more powerful!

321
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,216
What's the matter?

322
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,850
It's simple:
Kill your human and
relocate over here.

323
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,216
I'm losing a lot of
valuable blood.

324
00:15:57,316 --> 00:15:59,850
If the two of us
manage this body
at the same time...

325
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,616
We could live upwards of
one hundred and forty years.

326
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:05,350
[Nervous breathing]

327
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,183
U‐uh... Migi...

328
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,816
You're wasting time.

329
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,616
But you will have
no choice in the matter

330
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:15,050
if your host no longer
has a head.

331
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:17,316
Uhhh!

332
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,983
Wh‐why would you do
such a thing?

333
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,016
What the...
what the hell is
wrong with you,

334
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:29,583
do you realize
what you've done?

335
00:16:29,683 --> 00:16:31,650
My body...
I need my body...

336
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,550
I need my body to survive...

337
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,116

Migi...

340
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:48,216
Migi did you just save my life?

341
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:51,683
[MIGI]
I was simply unsure
if such a relocation
was possible to achieve.

342
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:54,383
The only life I consider
important is my own,

343
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,616
so I chose the safest option.

344
00:16:56,716 --> 00:17:00,983
Very tired. I must sleep now.

350
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:17,416
<i>Maybe he was only concerned</i>
<i>with saving himself,</i>

351
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:19,216
<i>but still...</i>

352
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:23,316
[Whispering]
Migi... you awake?

353
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,683
Mmmm! So good!

354
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:34,850
Mmmm!
Hmm...

355
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,116
[SATOMI]
You know, if you're not enjoying
yourself you could say so.

356
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:40,983
Uh, no no it's really great!

357
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:44,416
Mmm‐mmm! Delicious!

358
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:47,750
Yeah, I am so not
buying that...

359
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,983
Hehehe...

360
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,283
Hahaha...

361
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:56,316
Hehehe...

362
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,216
[Both laughing]

363
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,616
[SATOMI]
My parents are pretty strict
about me leaving the house
nowadays.

364
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,216
[SHINICHI]
Huh? Why's that?

365
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:10,183
[SATOMI]
Well, because of everything
that's been going on.

366
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:12,050
You know, the Mincemeat Murders.

367
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,050
[SHINICHI] Oh, right...
[SATOMI] It's just awful.

368
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,116
I mean, they're getting
cut to pieces?
What's wrong with people?

369
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:18,416
[SHINICHI]
Yeah...

370
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,983
<i>Man, if she ever</i>
<i>found out about Migi,</i>

371
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,183
<i>she would completely</i>
<i>freak out for sure.</i>

372
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:27,683
Um, is something wrong?

373
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:28,983
Hey Murano...

374
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,250
you like animals,
don't you?

375
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,716
Mm‐hm! Yeah of course.

376
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,350
Except worms,
they're creepy.

377
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,850
Aah! Ugh!

378
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,683
Are you okay?

379
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:41,350
Uh‐huh...

380
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,950
[SATOMI]
Hey! Come over here!

381
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,050
Uh?

382
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:45,983
C'mon c'mon.

383
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,050
I wanna play in the sandbox!

384
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,116
Meow!

385
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:52,816
[Boys laughing]
[Boy 1] Aw crap...

386
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,550
[Boy 2]
Dude, you suck.
It's my turn.

387
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:57,850
[Grunt]

388
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,950
[Boy 1]
Air ball! Heh, heh!

389
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,050
That's horrible...

390
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,883
[Boy 2]
Whatever, man.
Got closer than you.

391
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:05,616
Let's go.
I cannot watch this...

392
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:07,950
Yeah, who could?
Huh?

393
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,216
Hehe... Huh?

394
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,416
[Boy 3]
Who's this clown?

395
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:15,516
Hey you guys.

396
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:17,216
You really need to cut it out.

397
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,016
Huh?!

398
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,250
Meow...

399
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,350
Oh, wow...

400
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,683
Meow!

401
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:26,916
Aw c'mon, we're just
playing around, man!

402
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:29,216
Yeah, try mindin'
your own business?

403
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,283
It is a living breathing thing.

404
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:33,683
Not a toy for you to play with.

405
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:35,416
It's alive just like you.

406
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:36,416
Tsk!

407
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:37,483
Loser!

408
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,083
Seriously dude?

409
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:40,950
[Guy 3]
What a tool.

410
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,216
Hm...

411
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,150
Hehe...

412
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,883
Hmph!

413
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:51,150
Look out!

414
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:53,850
Whoa!
Uhh!

415
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:01,850
I will eat you alive.

416
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:07,083
Aahh! Ooh!

417
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:10,883
Let's go.

418
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:13,083
Uh... O‐okay.

419
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:22,981
[SHINICHI]
<i>Maybe Migi was right about us.</i>

420
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:27,015
<i>Maybe human beings</i>
<i>aren't so sacred.</i>

421
00:20:27,115 --> 00:20:30,848
<i>Maybe... maybe we're</i>
<i>the demons after all.</i>

422
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:45,248
Uhh!

423
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:49,015
Huh...

424
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,248
Uh...

425
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:54,081
Hm...

426
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,081
Hehe...

427
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:57,181
Oh!

428
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:59,348
Hey, Shinichi?

429
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:00,615
Yeah?

430
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:03,948
You ARE...
Shinichi Izumi...

431
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:05,581
aren't you?

432
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,715
Yeah.
Of course I am.

433
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:58,015
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"Symposium"
