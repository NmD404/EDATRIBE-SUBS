182
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:24,031
It's already gone...
It's not a dog anymore...

183
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:26,098
It's just a hunk of
dog‐shaped meat.

184
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:28,198
Huh?! No!

185
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:29,464
What's wrong?

186
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:31,131

193
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:57,731
Just then... You heard...

194
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:00,031
I said something
strange to her...

195
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,798
What was it I did wrong?

196
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:04,731
I don't think you did
anything wrong at all...

197
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,198
From my perspective.

198
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,731
But you are very different now
from how you were before.

199
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:11,098
Huh?

200
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:12,464
The statement you just made

201
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:14,031
about the "dog‐shaped meat"...

202
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,131
Was the sort of thing that I
would be more likely to say.

203
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:18,631
Oh...

204
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:20,698
Hm...

205
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,931
I guess so...

206
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,031
Thank you, Migi.

It can't be Uda and his
Parasite, can it...?

224
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:30,029
So... does that mean
this one's here to kill me?

225
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,929
[MIGI]
I sense no murderous intent.

226
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:33,496
What do I do?

227
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:35,929
For now, I think we should
meet them in a public place.

What? Meet them?!

229
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:39,696
It's possible this
is not an enemy.

its rate of approach
is calm and measured.

233
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,262
I believe this may be
another one similar
to Ryoko Tamiya.

234
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:52,962
In other words, it's the
type that can possibly
be reasoned with.

supposed to mean?!

the better you become

to get rid of me?

here to kill you.

would give the idea
some consideration.

I do not wish for
conflict either...

enough for today...

Can I help you?

353
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:46,762
Oh. Wrong person.

354
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:50,029
I'm so sorry...
I thought you were Shinichi.

355
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:54,062
Really? What would make you
think that I was Shinichi?

356
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:55,129
Huh?

357
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:57,162
When someone mistakes
two people...

358
00:17:57,262 --> 00:18:00,796
it's normally because they look
similar in one way or another.

359
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:04,329
So... How do Shinichi and
I seem similar to you?

360
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,996
I told you I was sorry.

361
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,029
[KANA]
Hey! What are you doing?!

362
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:11,662
<i>I know that voice...</i>

363
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:12,962
Let me go!
I just want to
talk to you

364
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:14,996
Stop!
for a little bit.

365
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,329
Hey! What're you
doing to her?!

366
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,862
Ah! Let go!
Shinichi!

367
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,262
I only wanted to discuss
some things with her...

368
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:27,129
It would appear that
this particular female
is rather perceptive.

369
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:28,229
Listen...

370
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:31,029
If anything happens to
anyone close to me...

371
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:33,896
I will be coming after you.

372
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:38,029
I swear to God
I will take you out.

373
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:41,329
Hehe. Shinichi.

374
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:42,962
It's like I keep saying‐

375
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:44,929
I don't want to fight you.

376
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,196
What's with him...?

377
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:48,096
There's something cold
in his eyes...

378
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:50,929
[SHIMADA]
<i>Interesting,</i>
<i>his parasite's signal</i>

379
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,962
<i>seemed very weak</i>
<i>just then.</i>

380
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:55,162
Oh, wow!

381
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:57,029
You're pretty strong, huh?

382
00:18:57,129 --> 00:18:58,629
Uhh...

383
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:00,729
Uh...
[Loudly] Oh, Shinichi!

384
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:02,129
Walk me to the station!

385
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:04,529
I'm scared that creepy
guy might be there!

386
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,429
Yeah. No problem.

387
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:07,862
Ah!

388
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:11,729
Mm...

389
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:13,796
<i>Not again!</i>
<i>What the hell?!</i>

390
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:16,029
What's wrong?

391
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,435
[SHINICHI]
Telepathy?

392
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,935
[KANA]
Yeah. That's right.

393
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:25,101
I can tell whenever
you're anywhere nearby.

394
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:28,335
But for some reason, I managed
to get it wrong just then...

395
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,668
But you did
finally show up,

396
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,301
so it's not like
I was totally off.

397
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:33,768
[SHINICHI]
Yeah, but...

398
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:36,268
I'm not so sure that's
such a good thing.

399
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:37,801
Huh?

400
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:40,868
I mean... whatever it is you
think you're sensing...

401
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:43,768
it could be some kind of
"wavelengths" being broadcast

402
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:45,435
by dangerous jerks like him.

403
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,868
So does that mean you're
a dangerous jerk, too?

404
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:48,701
Uh?!

405
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,001
Uh, well yeah...
yeah I am...

406
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:55,935
So you should probably
just stay away from guys
like us, you got that?

407
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:57,201
Hmm...

408
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:07,001
[SHIMADA]
<i>Well, I think I'll use</i>
<i>this face as bait today.</i>

409
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,701
<i>Hmm... That sow has had</i>
<i>a healthy upbringing,</i>

410
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:15,401
<i>and its skin has a nice sheen.</i>

411
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:18,135
Hello there,
are you lost?
Oh!

412
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:19,901
Well, I was just...

413
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:24,068
I'd be more than happy
to show you around,
if you'd like me to.

414
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:26,801
[SHINICHI]
Dad.

415
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:29,901
Yeah, I know...

416
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:32,101
Bed time.

417
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:36,435
'Night.

418
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,568
Shinichi...

419
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:40,335
Tell me, Son...

420
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:43,101
When did you suddenly
get to be so strong?

421
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,601
Hm?

422
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:48,968
It's like you're made of steel.

423
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:52,735
Like a metal shell with
nothing left on the inside.

424
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,201
Uhh...

425
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:00,468
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,468
[Sigh]

427
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:08,835
[Drawing strokes]

428
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:13,835
There we go.

429
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:16,501
Came out even better
than I thought it would.

430
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:19,435
Heh... Hmm...

431
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:22,868
[Eating sounds]

432
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:58,701
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"Beyond Good and Evil"
