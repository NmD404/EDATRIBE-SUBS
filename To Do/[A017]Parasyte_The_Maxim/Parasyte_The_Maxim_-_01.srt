00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:07,986
[SHINICHI]
Not long ago, someone on Earth
had a passing thought...

2
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:15,219
(cracking)

3
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,953
(roar)
[WOMAN] (terrified whimpers)

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,053
(continued whimpers)

5
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:05,953
[MUFFLED VOICE] I have failed...

6
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:09,653
This is unfortunate.

7
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:12,553
What? What's unfortunate?

8
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:14,719
[MUFFLED VOICE] Be quiet.
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

9
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,286
What a dream....

10
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:28,886
That was the worst
night's sleep...

11
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:31,019
(sizzling)

12
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:38,386
Did you find that
"worm" of yours?

13
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:42,686
My hand feels kinda numb.

14
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:46,719
[MOM] Well, probably because you
wrapped your headphone cord
around it last night.

15
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:51,919
Can I...
Can I just have toast.

16
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,053
No, sir! You need to eat
a proper breakfast.

17
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:57,053
Come on, gimme a break.

18
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:58,819
I had a rough night.

19
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,453
That's because you
stayed up too late.

20
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:02,986
Hm?

21
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,119
(gasps) (pain)

22
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,586
[DAD]
Relax, it's just a spider.

23
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,086
[MOM] Seriously, Shinichi,

24
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:12,253
when are you gonna get over
this silly fear of bugs?

25
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,086
[NEWSCAST] At the latest
meeting of the OECD...

26
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:20,253
[MAN] At... the... latest...
meeting of the O‐E‐C‐D...

27
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:23,119
[LITTLE GIRL]
Daddy! Where's Mommy?

28
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,819
I need something to eat.

29
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,819
[MAN] (mimicking)
Daddy! Where's Mommy?

30
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,253
I need something to eat.

31
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:38,019
(slurping noise)

32
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,086
[SATOMI] (giggles)

33
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:55,386
Hi‐yaa!

34
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:01,053
(waah!) Murano?!

35
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,419
Ah, don't act surprised.

36
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,753
What do you mean?

37
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:09,119
Come on, you obviously knew
I was sneaking up behind you.

38
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,819
Ah, no, I didn't!

39
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,253
Huh?

40
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,419
Uh...

41
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,353
(WAAHHH!) Oh my God, oh crap!

42
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:23,719
I'm so sorry!
[SATOMI] (hmpf!)

43
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:24,819
I didn't mean to, I swear.

44
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,519
I mean I‐ (ungh!)

45
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:30,453
[SATOMI] Real nice, Shinichi.
Real nice!

46
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:32,853
[YUKO] What the heck
were you thinking?

47
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,286
[SHINICHI] Yuko...

48
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:37,353
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

49
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:41,419
Ah man, I am off today...

50
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,086
S'there a problem
with your hand?

51
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:46,086
[SHINICHI] Uh... no.

52
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,053
It's fine.

53
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:53,219
(sleepy breathing)

54
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:07,186
(snoring)

55
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,019

56
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:25,986
(waah!)

57
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,986
What the...?!

58

(tapping)
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

59
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:42,019
[SHINICHI] (ungh)

60
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,553
What the hell is going on?!

61
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,686
[SHINICHI] (nngh)

62
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:50,553
(knock on door)
[DAD] Shinichi!

63
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,219
Is everything alright?!

64
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,053
Help me!

65
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:57,119
What the hell is
going on in here?
[MOM] (gasps)

66
00:05:57,219 --> 00:05:58,419
[MOM]
What are you doing to your arm?

67
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,553
There's...
There's something in it!

68
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:01,853
A worm or something!

69
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,119
A what?!
[MOM] A worm?

70
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:08,219
(heavy sigh)
Ah, you've gotta be kidding me.

71
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,553
I'm telling you the truth!

72
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:11,986
It's like it burrowed a hole
right into my arm!

73
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:13,219
Uh‐huh...

74
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,153
Okay, son, let's have
a look at it then.

75
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:19,119
[SHINICHI]
Look! It's right... Huh?

76
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:22,353
Okay, son, please don't tell me
that you are on drugs.

77
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:24,319
[SHINICHI]
No, no, I'm not! I swear!

78
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,286
(giggles) Honestly, sweetie,
don't scare us like that.

79
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:30,586
That's weird...

80
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:32,519
Doesn't even hurt or anything.

81
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:37,019
[SHINICHI] It felt so real.

82
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,753
I couldn't have just imagined
the whole thing, right?

83
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:42,153
[YUKO] Shinichi!
[SHINICHI] Hm?

84
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,919
[TEACHER] Hmm...
[SHINICHI]Uh‐ ah‐

85
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,719
Hmm?
[SHINICHI] Huh?

86
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,053
My lecture not riveting
enough for ya?

87
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:50,086
I think you're aware that
the use of cell phones

88
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:52,386
is not permitted
during class hours.

89
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:54,853
[SHINICHI] I thought I
turned it off, and... and I...

90
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:57,186
Yes?
[SHINICHI] Sorry, sir.

91
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:59,019
[TEACHER] (hmpf)
[YUKO] (sighs)

92
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:05,053
[SHINICHI] Huh?

93
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:07,553
Uh, Murano,
about this morning...

94
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:11,553
[YUKO] Looks like she's
still pretty pissed off.

95
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:15,253
Okay, look, because you're
my friend and I'm such
a wonderful person,

96
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:17,286
I'll go and apologize for you.

97
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:18,619
[SHINICHI] Really? Thanks, Yuko.

98
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:21,219
But first you have to
tell me if you're okay.

99
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,186
Because well...
you don't look so good.

100
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,119
[SHINICHI] Yeah...

101
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:28,319
I don't really
feel so good either.

102
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:31,486
I think I'm gonna ask the
teacher if maybe I can go home.

103
00:07:38,486 --> 00:07:42,119
[SHINICHI]
There's no way my hand could
just move on its own could it?

104
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,553
I mean, after that
thing from last night,

105
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:45,653
I don't know what to think.

106
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,653
(car honking)
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

107
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:50,686

108
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,886
(car horn)

00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:54,319

110
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,786
(brakes screeching)

111
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:00,419
(broken car horn)

112
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:06,886
(gasps)

[MOM] (panicked gasp)

115
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:15,253
Oh, my God,
thank goodness you're okay!

116
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:20,286
(door opening)

117
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,053
(hmm?)

118
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:25,453
Is that Shinichi?

119
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:27,219
Well, he's home early.

120
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:29,019
(door slamming)

121
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:31,986
(heavy, panicked breathing)

122
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,619
I don't know how the hell
you got in there... (whimpers)

123
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,253
...but you're coming out!

124
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:54,453
(gasps)

125
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,086
(whimpering)

126
00:08:57,986 --> 00:09:01,286
How very unfortunate.

127
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:02,653
(waah!)

128
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:11,553
I... right hand... failure.

129
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,019
F‐failure?

130
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,086
What did you do to my hand?

131
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:19,986
I have... I have eaten it. Gone.

132
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:25,686
(nervous laughter)

133
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:30,219
[SHINICHI] (soft whimpers)

134
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:34,053
I am, uh...
new to talking your language.

135
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:37,586
You must teach me, Shinichi.

136
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:39,186
(gasps)

137
00:09:42,053 --> 00:09:43,886
Just what are you?

138
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:47,486
So tired. I sleep now.

139
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:48,553
Huh?! Wait a minute!

140
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:51,119
You've got to answer
some questions first!

141
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:52,719
Hey! Come on, wake up!

142
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:56,553
(knock on door)
[MOM] Shinichi?
Is everything all right?

143
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,319
Hello? Shinichi?

144
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:01,719
[SHINICHI] No! Don't come in!
[MOM] (gasps)

145
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:02,953
[SHINICHI] I'm fine...

146
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:05,119
Everything's fine!
[MOM] (uh...)

147
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,053
(grrr...)

148
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,519
Awww....

149
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:34,819
How can I even search
for something like this?

150
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,219
I mean who ever heard of
something like this

151
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:39,153
ever happening
to anyone before?

152
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:41,553
[MOM]
Shinichi! Dinner's ready!

153
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,653
[MOM] I got a call from
the school today.

154
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:48,019
They said you left early.

155
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,619
[DAD]
Oh yeah? Something happen?

156
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,786
Nothing much.

157
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,853
Just felt a little sick,
that's all.

158
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,186
[MOM] Anything serious?
[SHINHICHI] Nah.

159
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,986
Oh? You want seconds?

160
00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:01,086
You must feel better.

161
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:04,253
So you don't feel well, but you
still have an appetite, huh?

162
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:06,519
Well, I'm feeling better now.

163
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:08,286
What's the big deal?

164
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,586
I can't tell Mom and Dad
about this...

165
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:17,353
They'll think I'm crazy.

166
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:20,853
[DRUNK]
I love you, love yooou!

167
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,619
Ah, face.

168
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,819
Oh, God...

169
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,753
Ha! Too many drinky drinks!

170
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,186
Huh?

171
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:32,386
(screams)

172
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:43,453
[WOMAN] Nakamura! You left your
laundry outside in the rai...

173
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:46,053
(screams)

174
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:49,919
Actually...

175
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:52,086
I can't tell anyone about this.

176
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:54,453
If I went to the police,
they'd probably put me away

177
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:56,119
for the rest of my life.

178
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:57,319
And if I went to a doctor,

179
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:00,186
I'd just end up being
their freakshow.

180
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,653
Then everyone would know.

181
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:04,586
I don't know what to do.

182
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:06,719
Hey.

183
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,319
Wake up.

184
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,019
(birds tweeting)

185
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:15,719
(uhmm...)

186
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,253
Is it morning?

187
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,019
Yes, it is...

188
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:28,686
It's morning and I'm awake!
(big sigh)

189
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:32,419
I'm still having a nightmare.

190
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,286
What are you doing?

191
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,453
As you can see.

192
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:46,219
I'm studying.

193
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:49,453
I see you can
speak pretty well now.

194
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:51,953
So, what are you?

195
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:54,519
Are you an alien or something?

196
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:55,853
An alien?

197
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:58,019
What's an alien?

198
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:01,586
[SHINICHI]
Is that wormy thing what you're
really supposed to look like?

199
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,153
[HAND] I can't help but notice
that none of your biology texts

200
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:10,153
seem to have anything about me.

201
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:14,419
Did you come from outer space?
Some distant planet somewhere?

202
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,053
[HAND] I don't have any idea
where I came from.

203
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:19,353
My earliest memory is with you.

204
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:21,753
Feeling disappointed,
I was unable to...

205
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:23,553
occupy your brain.

206
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,553
My brain?! Are you kidding me?

207
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,486
Wait! You're not gonna go after
my brain next are you?

208
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:32,553
[HAND] If that were possible,
I would've done so already.
But sadly, it's not.

209
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:35,786
Since I've already matured
without eating your brain,
it's too late.

210
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:38,353
Most unfortunate.
[SHINICHI]
Well, what would have happened

211
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,553
if you had succeeded?
In eating my brain?

212
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,453
[HAND]
You'd probably still look pretty
much the same as you do now,

213
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:46,353
but your head would be able
to do things like this.

214
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:48,053
That's so gross!

215
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:50,486
So why, exactly,
is this happening to me?

216
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:51,553
[HAND] Pure chance.

217
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:54,453
You were not chosen
for this specifically.

218
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:58,119
(sighs) Guess I really should
go to a hospital.

219
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:00,053
Whether I'm a freakshow or not.

220
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,686
[HAND] A hospital? Why?

221
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:03,986
So they can cut you off,
of course.

222
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:05,419
That would be undesirable.

223
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,353
I rely on the nutrients
that are present

224
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:09,386
in your bloodstream
for survival.

225
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:13,153
If I were to be removed,
then I would most assuredly
shrivel up and die.

226
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,653
And on top of that, Shinichi,

227
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,053
you would end up losing your
right hand in the process.

228
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:20,253
Unfortunate for both of us.

229
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:22,886
Look! You're the one who just
took over my arm without asking.

230
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:25,419
So you don't really
have a say here.

231
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,319
Hmm...

232
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,386
How about this?

233
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:30,253
I can re‐connect the
circuitry in your arm

234
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,686
so that while I'm asleep you'll
be able to control your hand

235
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:35,453
just like before.
[SHINICHI] Huh?

236
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:36,886
That'll work, won't it?

237
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:40,519
The two of us are gonna have to
learn to cooperate and coexist.

238
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:42,386
It's really our only option.

239
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:43,719
Huh?

240
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,786
You don't get to decide
any of this!

241
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,553
[HAND] I'm tired. I sleep now.

242
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,286
Wait a minute!
Hey, you're just doing that

243
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:51,019
to get out of this discussion!

244
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,319
Use me with care...

245
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:56,153
(grrr...)

246
00:14:57,686 --> 00:15:00,319
(sigh)

247
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:03,619
So I guess I'm supposed
to clean up this mess.

248
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,919
[SHINICHI]
Don't I get any bacon and eggs?

249
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,853
You said you didn't
want any yesterday.

250
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,186
[SHINICHI] I thought you told me
that I needed to eat
a proper breakfast.

251
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:17,419
And I'd like more toast too,
please.

252
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,653
I sure do wish you'd
make up your mind.

253
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,919
[IZUMI] Look at that, there've
been even more of these attacks.

254
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,286
Another murder?

255
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:25,653
Uh‐huh.

256
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:28,619
A mother and her daughter
were killed just last night.

257
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,919
Their bodies were found
"savagely mutilated",

258
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,286
and now it looks like the father
has disappeared without a trace.
(sizzling)

259
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:36,319
Somebody else was decapitated,

260
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,286
and there was another hacked up
and hung out like the
laundry!

261
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:41,786
[MOM] Can we not talk
about that right now?

262
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:43,719
Oh... yeah.

263
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:47,319
(sighs) Huh? (chuckles)

264
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,986
[DAD]
Hey, Shinichi, check it out.

265
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,653
[MOM &amp; DAD] (hmm?)

266
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,319
(sliding door)

267
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:58,053
[MOM] You're okay with them now?

268
00:15:58,153 --> 00:15:59,853
Huh? What do you mean?

269
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:01,986
Well, that was a bug!

270
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,367
[HAND] Is this a different
route from yesterday?

271
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:22,800
[SHINICHI] Oh, so you're awake.

272
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,600
Where is it you're going?

273
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,267
I decided to go talk
to the police.
[HAND] Oh, don't do that.

274
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,867
You know they'll just take you
and turn you into their lab rat

275
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:33,034
and run all sorts of
experiments on you.

276
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:35,634
Your life will never
be the same again.

277
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:37,900
Okay, well then,
what do YOU suggest?

278
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,200
[HAND] I told you this morning.

279
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,967
Cooperation and mutual
coexistence is...

280
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:46,000
STOP!
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

281
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,000
Keep your voice down.

282
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,000
I sense one of my own.
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

283
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,600
[HAND] Yes, one of my species.
I feel him.

284
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,900
There's more of you?!

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,534
Wait, how do you
know it's there?

286
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:57,034
[HAND] I just feel it...

287
00:16:57,134 --> 00:16:58,767
Something like brainwaves.

288
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,067
It's my first time sensing it,
but I can tell:

289
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,000
it's definitely out there.

290
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,434
About 200 meters.

291
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:06,167
You mean to tell me,
someone else out there

292
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,500
has gone through
the same thing I have?

293
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,600
[HNAD] Right, go right!

294
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:19,600
[HAND] Shinichi...
[SHINICHI] Hmm? 'Kay.

295
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,967
[HAND] At the next
intersection, turn left.

296
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:29,967
It would seem that
they have sensed me, too.

297
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,834
(urk)

298
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,300
[HAND] What is it? Keep moving.

299
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,434
So, if it's one of
your species or whatever,

300
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:40,934
then could it be someone
whose brain was eaten?

301
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:42,167
[HAND] It's possible.

302
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:45,434
(uhh) Then no way!
That's too screwed up!

303
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:48,500
(waahhh!)

304
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:55,134
I would like to find out
exactly what sort of being
I actually am.

305
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:59,034
That sort of information
would be quite valuable
to you as well.

306
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,300
Uh... okay okay.

307
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:07,067
[HAND] Another twenty meters.
Around that corner.

308
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,600
It seems to be eating.
[SHINICHI] Huh?

309
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,534
(wet slurpling sounds)

310
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:22,467
[SHINICHI] (weakly) It's a dog,
and it's eating another dog?

311
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,934
(whimper of fear)

312
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,934
So I see... you failed too.

313
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,967
Please...
please don't talk, Mr. Doggy.

314
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,367
(uhhh...)

315
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,467
Your host is not... optimal.

316
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:47,934
I... also... am dissatisfied...
with... this host...

317
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:49,867
Run!
[SHINICHI] (ahh!)

318
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:52,200
[Hand] Run! Hurry!
[SHINICHI] (waahhh!)

319
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,267
[SHINICHI] Where are we going?!

320
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,834
You told me to take you there,
now you're telling me to run
away!

321
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:00,467
[HAND]
I sense its murderous intent.

322
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,534
You're still human;
it harbors suspicion of you.

323
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:12,134
(panting)

324
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,900
[HAND] It wants to fight.

325
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,034
We'll do it here.

326
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:18,134
What?!
You wanna fight that thing?!

327
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:22,800
[HAND] There's no choice.

328
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,334
If it kills you,
I will die as well.

329
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:26,567
We're in this together.

330
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,834
Here it comes.

331
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,734
What the hell?
You gotta be kidding me!

332
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,434
This cannot be happening!

333
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,367
(woorf)

334
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:47,634
(ngh!) Is that... its heart?

335
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,267
(heavy thump)

336
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,767
(low growls)

337
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,967
[HAND]
It will die without it. Look!

338
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,734
Just like me, it's dependent on
its body's digestive system

339
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,867
and other vital organs.

340
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,000
(low growls)

341
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:05,934
So I guess there really are
more of you out there.

342
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:08,334
Yes, but this one's core
was the head.

343
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:11,300
It controlled the host by
manipulating the nervous system,

344
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,500
but it made a crucial mistake
when it altered its body
to grow wings.

345
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,367
That caused its core to alter,
and its focus to disperse,

346
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,567
creating an opening.

347
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:22,100
But it... it was still
one of your own kind though.

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,967
[HAND]
It's because of the canine.

349
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:26,234
Maturation and environment
were factors,

350
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:28,067
but it was lax with its studies.

351
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,267
Research is the reason I won.

352
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:34,900
[SHINICHI] It's like I'm
talking to an insect.

353
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,167
Doesn't have
a shred of sympathy.

354
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,200
[HAND] Shinichi, that's cold.

355
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,934
[SHINICHI]
Not long ago, someone on Earth
had a passing thought...

356
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:58,000
"All life is sacred and must
therefore be protected."
[WOMAN] (whimpering)

357
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,567
(frightened breathing)

358
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,000
[MAN] (hyah!)

359
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,834
[MAN] (maniacal laughter)

360
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:58,034
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"The Devil in the Flesh"
