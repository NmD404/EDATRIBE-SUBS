Why are they making such an
effort to hide the truth...

291
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:35,517
They should just show everyone
out there Shimada's body.

Even if they discover a parasite
disguised as a human being,

310
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:15,450
it can simply assume
another identity.

311
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,517
Humans would be unable
to apprehend them.

312
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:21,084

So WE should hunt
them all down right?

It's time to involve the public.
[Gasps]

328

And how do you
intend to make such
an announcement?

329
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:12,817
Let me clarify,

330
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,650
I'm not saying that we should
reveal the parasites' existence.

331
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,984
I mean we could subtly make
known a method that could be

332
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,417
used to distinguish humans
from the parasites.

333
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,884
But how would we
make that "known"?

334
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:25,117
And we can't even tell
each other apart...

335
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:26,417
Who out there's infected?

336
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:28,084
To explain this
matter further,

337
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:30,817
I'd like to hand it
over to Dr. Yui.

338
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,150
Mm.

339
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,450
Now then, I'd like to
start by expounding upon

340
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,750
what we've learned so far
about the parasites'
unique physiology.

341
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:41,250
These parasitic life forms

342
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,717
have the ability to act
as the human brain,

343
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:45,550
not only commanding
the entire body,

344
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,517
but even driving functions
beyond their normal limits.

345
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:52,317
Their cellular makeup closely
resembles that of neurons.

346
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,184
To put things more simply...

347
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:56,217
you could call it
"sentient muscle."

348
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:59,617
Ah, "sentient muscle"?
Very interesting.

349
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:03,650
There's more.
They have the ability to morph
their tissues in an instant,

350
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,650
to stretch out like rubber
or become as hard as steel.

351
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,850
So you might wonder, how could
such foreign cells as these

352
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,650
bind themselves to
the human body?

353
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,550
The answer is, a
near‐instantaneous
cellular fusion.

354
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,684
It's most likely a
substance much like how

355
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,617
polyethylene glycol
affects the cell
membranes‐

356
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:22,484

can identify them.

357
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:23,917
Huh? Ahh...

358
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:25,417
Ahem.

359
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:27,084
Now then...

360
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:29,284
As they are sentient muscle,

361
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:31,284
when enough of their
cells are gathered,

362
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:33,984
their intelligence level
is actually on par with
that of humans.

363
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:36,584
On the other hand,
what do you suppose happens

364
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:39,417
if enough of their cells
are not gathered together?

365
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:40,217
Hmm...

366
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,050
If deprived of blood flow

367
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,550
they shrivel up and die,

368
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,584
so they work together to fuse
with others of their kind.

369
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:49,150
So if a small enough
fragment becomes separated,

370
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,650
it struggles to survive,

371
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,150
but its small mass means it
lacks the intelligence

372
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,617
to rejoin the source.

373
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,984
Now if you were to pull out
the hair of a human,

374
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:58,517
nothing at all would happen...

375
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:01,317
But if you pull out a "hair"
from a camouflaged parasite...

376
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:04,784
I believe it would violently
writhe in pain for a few seconds

377
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:07,117
before the cells would
ultimately die.

378
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:08,617
In other words...

379
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:11,284
Pulling out a strand of hair
is one way to identify

380
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,384
whether or not someone
has been infected.

381
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:16,284
[Men chatter]
[COUNCILMAN]
Well done, Professor!

382
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,384
Good Lord, they could
just wear a wig!

383
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:20,117
What do you suggest
we do then?

384
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:22,317
A hair sample from
any part of the body

385
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:24,050
will create the
same reaction.

386
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,884
The main point is to isolate
a small enough mass of cells

387
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:28,250
away from the main body.

388
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,450
Well maybe...
I guess that makes sense.

389
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,817
Now then, I'm very sorry
for the imposition,
gentlemen,

390
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,517
but we ask that as you
leave this room,

391
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:39,684
you consent to pulling out
a strand of your hair.

392
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:40,884
Uh‐umm...

393
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:42,617
While the likelihood is low,

394
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:46,717
we cannot say for sure that
we don't have one of them
here among us.

395
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,111

<i>It didn't take as long</i>
<i>as you'd expect...</i>

396
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:55,244
<i>for school to be reopened.</i>

397
00:19:57,844 --> 00:19:58,844
Uh...

398
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:01,177
Murano.

399
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:04,111
Uh... Shinichi.

400
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:07,911
Are you...
are you doing okay?

401
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:09,577
Mm...

402
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:13,411
Sorry...
Sorry I didn't
text you back.

403
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:15,244
That's fine.

404
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:19,444
Are ya ready?

405
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:20,877
Mm‐hm...

406
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:24,044
How's Yuko doin'?

407
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,377
Oh, she's much
better now.

408
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:28,711
She'll be at
school today.

409
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,111
That's good.

410
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:33,777
She really... she really
went through a lot y'know.

411
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:35,244
Yeah, she did...

412
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,844
But she's always been
a pretty strong person.

413
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:38,977
Mm.

414
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:40,377
I've been
thinking about

415
00:20:40,477 --> 00:20:42,744
how much I need
to thank you.

416
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,144
Oh?

417
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,944
Because well...

418
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,277
if you hadn't
been there...

419
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:50,511
Look that's all behind us...

420
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:53,211
Let's just try to think of
happier things now.

421
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:54,677
Shinichi...

422
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:57,277
You know, we jumped from
pretty high up there.

423
00:20:57,377 --> 00:20:59,577
And somehow you
didn't even get hurt.

424
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:03,344
Yeah right, I think I
must've been all pumped
full of adrenaline...

425
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:06,077
I mean, I was as
surprised as you were.

426
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:07,944
Yeah, uh‐huh...

427
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:10,011
Well I do really mean it...

428
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:12,344
Thanks, Shinichi.

429
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:14,244
Mm...

430
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:15,311
Huh?

431
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:16,777
Good morning!

432
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:17,844
Good morning!

433
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:18,677
Oh!

434
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,211
Ah... Hehehe...
