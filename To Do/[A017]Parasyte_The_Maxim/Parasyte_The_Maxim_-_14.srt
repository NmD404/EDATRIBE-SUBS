1
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:03,419
Shinichi, your eyes...

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:06,719
your eyes have no tears.

3
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:16,419
[SHINICHI]
<i>Goodbye... Murano...</i>

4
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:55,303
[MIGI]
Shinichi, I was
unsure earlier about
what would happen.

5
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:57,736
[SHINICHI]
This was for the best, right?

6
00:01:57,836 --> 00:01:59,803
I mean, if that guy had
been watching us again,

7
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:02,603
he'd probably start
going after Murano next.

8
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:03,770
[MIGI]
"That guy"?

9
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,803
Yeah...

10
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:06,336
Y'know the man from before...

11
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,703
He was watching me again
this afternoon, too.

12
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:10,736
Why didn't you
say so sooner?

13
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:12,970
'Cause you would've
tried to kill him.

14
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,736
[MIGI]
Well, I've changed my
thinking on that matter.

15
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,836
His investigation of
you would appear to
be ongoing, correct?

16
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:24,703
If the same person is
continuing to operate
despite us having
discovered him,

17
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:27,070
we could actually be
facing several enemies.

18
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,936
We may as well track down
everyone involved in this
investigation and then‐

19
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:33,170
Kill them all, right?

20
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,203
No...
In fact, I've noticed

21
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:37,370
just how adverse a
reaction you have

22
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,636
when it comes to the
idea of killing
other humans.

23
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:42,036
And that means,

24
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:44,136
we will have to
work together.

25
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:45,670
Oh's that so?

26
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,703
Therefore, we should
set aside the idea of
killing him for now.

27
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:51,503
Instead, we should
investigate him.

28
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:52,903
How exactly?

29
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:55,136
We will call in an ally
and ask for help.

30
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:56,736
An ally, huh...?

31
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:59,536
But where in the world
would we ever find one?

32
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,336
Oh!

33
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:04,970
[SHINICHI]
Sorry for making you
come here.

34
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,536
And getting you involved
in all this, of course.

35
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,003
What are you talking about?

36
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:10,336
You two can count on us.

37
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:12,603
You're the only ones
in the same boat we are!

38
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:14,536
We have to help
each other out y'know!

39
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,236
I know, but...

40
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:18,236
but you kinda already helped
me out enough already...

41
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:20,670
[PARASITE]
You got that right!
You totally owe us...!

42
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,303
This is a huge pain for us!

43
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:25,303
[UDA]
[Muffled struggling]
That was not me just now.

44
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,503
Right.

45
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,136
[PARASITE]
Seriously. I get it.

46
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:32,436
But wouldn't it be better
just to kill the guy?

47
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:35,370
[UDA]
No, we can't.
It's not that easy, all right?

48
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,736
Anyway, do you have any idea
who might be behind all this?

49
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,870
[SHINICHI]
Actually, I think we do.

50
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,603
[MIGI]
Assuming the enemy isn't
some organization...

51
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:46,403
we do have a guess.

52
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:49,136
Okay, let's say we're
gonna just try to catch him
instead of kill him.

53
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:50,736
You at least know what
he looks like, right?

54
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:53,170
[MIGI]
Yes, I remember him well.

55
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,270
Like this.

56
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,403
Okay... I got it.
[Muffled struggling]

57
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,836
[UDA]
For now, I think we're
going to stay

58
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:02,903
in the hotel over by
the train station.

59
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:04,570
[SHINICHI]
Right. Okay.

60
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,936
Oh, by the way.

61
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:07,870
About this guy's name...

62
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,936
we decided "Parasite"
was too confusing

63
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:12,070
because they use that
on TV and everywhere...

64
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,770
so I've decided to
call him "Joe".

65
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,136
[JOE]
He so desperately needs
a friend you guys.

66
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:17,370
Hehe.

67
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,903
Guh. I do not get it with
all the friggin' names.

68
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:24,303
[MIGI]
I agree.
Names are totally unimportant.

69
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:31,070
[Foot tapping]

70
00:04:33,203 --> 00:04:35,103
You look like
you're exhausted.

71
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:38,103
You should really
go see a doctor.

72
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,703
Hm. I did go see
a doctor... Look!

73
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:42,936
That's not what
I'm talking about.

74
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:44,970
Yeah, well, they wouldn't
believe me anyway.

75
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,503
Someone's hand
stretching out
and attacking me?

76
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:50,070
But it did happen,
and I did get hurt...

77
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,770
I mean this is real,
isn't it...?!

78
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,836
Isn't it?

79
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:55,170
Please calm yourself down.

80
00:04:56,336 --> 00:04:59,236
Eh... Sigh...

81
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:01,970
Believe it or not,
I've calmed down quite a bit...

82
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,736
And I've taken time to think
about what happened back there.

83
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:07,670
As in, what the hell
was that... thing?

84
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,403
I haven't come up
with anything.

85
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,170
Well nothing that makes
any sorta sense at least.

86
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,703
I'll pay you for all the work
you've done up until now...

87
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:17,336
But your job's over.

88
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:20,503
Over? But we've just barely
scratched the surface...?

89
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:24,603
I mean come on here...
How am I supposed to deal
with all this crazy stuff?

90
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:27,303
I... I at least have to
figure out what that thing was!

91
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:31,170
Asking me to believe
your story is far
more unreasonable.

92
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,870
I guess I...

93
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,870
Hold on!
Wait a second!

94
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,236
You mentioned something
to me about Shinichi Izumi's
hand before, didn't you.

95
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:40,203
Oh?

96
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:41,770
You did...!
You definitely did!

97
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,170
So then you...

98
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,536
You already knew about it!
You knew!

99
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,436
That's the whole reason you
asked me to investigate him
in the first place!

100
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:50,503
Do you know what that
monster actually is...?

101
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:52,903
Look, you gotta tell me
what's going on here lady!

102
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:55,770
Would you stop this
foolishness? We're done.

103
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,836
Hey! I can't just
walk away from this‐

104
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,703
[Falling on floor]
Ah... Ow...

105
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:02,903
Ugh... Aww..

106
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:05,370
Hmph.

107
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:13,003
<i>This would seem to be as far</i>
<i>as I can go using the humans.</i>

108
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:16,970
<i>Ultimately, very little</i>
<i>was accomplished.</i>

109
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,236
<i>Perhaps I should get rid</i>
<i>of that investigator.</i>

110
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:23,536
[Small chuckles]

111
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:24,970
Huh?

112
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:30,103
[Small chuckles]

113
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:31,703
[Door closing]

[Small chuckles]

115
00:06:35,336 --> 00:06:37,170
Hahaha...

116
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:41,070
<i>Was I really laughing</i>
<i>just now...?</i>

117
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,770
<i>That's the first time</i>
<i>I've ever laughed without</i>
<i>making myself do so.</i>

118
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,736
<i>But when I saw how panicked</i>
<i>that man looked...</i>

119
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,236
Heh!

120
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:54,503
<i>I completely forgot about</i>
<i>my facial expressions.</i>

121
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:56,470
Hehehe...

122
00:06:57,803 --> 00:07:01,703
Hahaha...

123
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:11,203
[Maniacal laughter]

124
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:16,870
[Baby crying]
[Maniacal laughter]

125
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,803
Sigh...

126
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:30,070
<i>Already asleep, huh?</i>

127
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:32,370

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,370
Ahh...

[Door opens]

130
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,236
Hm?
[YOKO]
Ahh! What a day.

131
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:40,670
Oh, well, well.
Enjoying yourself, I see.

132
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,603
Want some?

133
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:43,370
No, I'll pass.

134
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,403
Sigh...

135
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,870
Hm?

136
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,936
You've had it pretty rough
lately, haven't you?

137
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:58,436
What?
You've been having
bad dreams...

138
00:07:58,536 --> 00:07:59,903
You cry out
in your sleep.

139
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:01,903
And now you've
gotten yourself hurt.

140
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,770
Don't worry.
It's no big deal.

141
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,236
So... is this job that
you've been working on

142
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,503
really just a
background check?

143
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,603
Do what?
What're you talking about?

144
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:13,236
I'm just saying
that nothing good

145
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:15,336
is going to come from
getting involved in...

146
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:18,870
in things that you
don't belong, that's all.

147
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:22,803
So now you're thirsty
all of a sudden?

148
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,436
If this job gets
too dangerous...

149
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,570
well then, isn't that
what the cops are for.

150
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,936
I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

151
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:30,903
I don't want you getting
in over your head.

152
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:32,703
[Glass clink]
Okay?

153
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,336
What you don't think
I'm cut out for this, ugh...

154
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:37,170
No. Maybe not this one.

155
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,236
Jesus hon, thanks for
the vote of confidence.

<i>I gotta show the</i>

158
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:51,903
[SHINICHI]
<i>The parasites</i>
<i>transmit signals...</i>

159
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:53,803
<i>Those transmissions</i>
<i>allow them to sense</i>

<i>like they're on the phone</i>
<i>or anything,</i>

<i>but if they agree on a kind of</i>
<i>"call sign" beforehand,</i>

163
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,736

Shinichi.

165
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:09,470
They've found him.

166

[SHINICHI]
Got it.

167
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,636
[MIGI]
We'll meet him at
the next corner.

168
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:14,303
[SHINICHI]
Understood.

169
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,070
Huh?

170
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:24,770
Huh? Ah!

171
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,936
Glad you came...

172
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:27,636
I didn't think
you'd show up.

173
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:28,336
Gah!

174
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:29,370
[Muffled]

175
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,503
Please don't say anything.

176
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,470
Now get in.

177
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:39,170
Who's he? What're you guys
planning to do to me?

178
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,603
Look, we don't intend to
cause you any harm...

179
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:44,803
We're just going someplace
where we can talk in private.

180
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,503
[Nervous sounds]

181
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:50,470
[SHINICHI]
<i>He doesn't need to be</i>
<i>so afraid of us...</i>

182
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,003
[SHINICHI]
Honestly, there's so
much I want to ask you.

183
00:09:57,103 --> 00:10:00,670
But first... I'd like you to
hear about our side of things.

184
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,903
Fine. Sure I'll
hear you out, okay.

185
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,736
But you gotta tell me
what's up with this guy.

186
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:06,636
There is something
wrong with his face!

187
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:10,536
He changed it a bit
so you wouldn't know
what he looks like.

188
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:12,236
Uh, y‐yeah...

189
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:15,203
Right... Please listen closely
to what I have to say to you...

190
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:18,036
My own life is
at stake right now.

191
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:20,470
O‐kay...

192
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,136
[SHINICHI]
<i>And then...</i>
<i>I went through everything‐</i>

193
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,703
<i>all the way from when</i>
<i>Migi dug into my hand</i>

194
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:27,670
<i>right up to the present.</i>

195
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,270
<i>Naturally, he was pretty</i>
<i>shocked at first,</i>

196
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,636
<i>but the more he listened</i>
<i>to my story...</i>

197
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:35,436
<i>the calmer he seemed to become.</i>

198
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:39,903
<i>But, even though he had begun</i>
<i>to relax while I talked...</i>

199
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:43,136
<i>that skeptical look</i>
<i>never left his eyes.</i>

200
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:46,170
[KURAMORI]
All right.
I get the gist of things.

201
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,936
I'm sure you know how crazy
this whole thing sounds...

202
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:51,303
Normally there's no way
I'd believe it...

203
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:54,270
but seeing as how there's
a whatever right here
in front of me...

204
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,170
I have to unfortunately
believe at least some of it.

205
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,936
So? What do you
want me to do?

206
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:03,870
I'm asking you
to keep this quiet.

207
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:07,636
Can you do that for us?

208
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:10,070
I understand your point but
according to your own account,

209
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,870
there are more of
these things out there.

210
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,070
Can we really just
stand by and do nothing?

211
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,103
Uh?

212
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:17,336
If you really do
care about humanity...

213
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:18,670
Then you...

214
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,370
you have an obligation
to come forward on this.

215
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,670
Even if they turn you into
some kind of experiment...

216
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,470
Even if it means sacrificing
yourself, you have to
think of civilization!

217
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,103
You have to think
of all of us!

218
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:30,236
Isn't that what it
means to be human?

219
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:32,736
What'd I say?
We should totally
take this guy out!

220
00:11:32,836 --> 00:11:33,703
Agreed.

221
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:34,670
Uh! Ah!

222
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,670
Ahh!

223
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,970
Stop it!

224
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,203
[JOE]
Maybe you should
sacrifice yourself.

225
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:42,903
[MIGI]
I want you to listen
to me very closely.

226
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:46,103
If you have a right to live,
then we have that same right.

227
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:49,603
Granted, the concept of "rights"
may be uniquely human,

228
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:51,536
but in any case,
you need to understand

229
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:55,903
that we will do anything
to ensure our own survival.

230
00:11:56,003 --> 00:11:57,970
And I will not allow him
to come forward

231
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,270
and be turned into
some kind of specimen.

232
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,036
If you're saying that will
make you our enemy...

233
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:05,203
I could kill you at
a moment's notice.

234
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:06,136
Aah!

235
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:08,903
[MIGI]
Take a good look at him.

236
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:10,836
He's a teenager,
still in high school.

237
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:13,503
From your perspective,
he's still a child, correct?

238
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:16,470
His mother was killed...
He's endured a great deal.

239
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,203
He has been forced to
step over a pile of corpses,

240
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,503
yet continues to try his
best to solve things.

241
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:25,703
I believe this is when you
humans are supposed to
experience compassion.

242
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:28,103
Would you be able to
endure all this?

243
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:29,670
[Crying]

244
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,103
[SHINICHI]
<i>Migi doesn't really sound</i>
<i>like himself at all right now.</i>

245
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:37,703
<i>I'm sure he's just saying</i>
<i>that stuff to get a reaction</i>
<i>out of this guy, but still...</i>

246
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:39,136
Okay listen...

247
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,903
I honestly do not
plan to kill you.

248
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:44,036
Run for it! Hurry!

249
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,170
Yeah... I know.

250
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,236
[MIGI]
I have one more question.

251
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,270
I want to know‐ who asked you
to investigate Shinichi?

252
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,570
Yeah right...
You know I can't say that.

253
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,403
What...!
Are you serious?

254
00:12:57,503 --> 00:13:00,470
Are you really gonna
try and pull some self
righteous bullcrap now?

255
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,636
Well, we do already have a
pretty good idea who it is...

256
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:07,103
And to be perfectly blunt, your
client is actually a parasite.

257
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,436
Wait what?...!
That can't be right!

258
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:12,270
I believe he mentioned her
earlier, didn't he...?

259
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,836
She was the female teacher
who just disappeared from
his high school...

260
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,470
Ryoko Tamiya.

261
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,970
Who... Who's Tamiya?

262
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,003
She's already
changed her name,

263
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:23,936
but your client's name
could possibly sound similar.

264
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:29,270
Ryoko Tamiya...
Reiko Tamura... [Gasp]

265
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,270
Look I barely even
get the concept of
having stupid names,

266
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,236
but I coulda
figured that out.

267
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:36,370
If you decide to continue
digging deeper into this,

268
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,370
it will be your client
rather than us who kills you.

269
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,103
<i>Son of a bitch...</i>

270
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:49,470
[Phone buzzing]

271
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:52,303
[TAMURA]
Shinichi Izumi?

272
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:55,803
[SHINICHI]
Ah! It's you!

273
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,736
[MIGI]
To think, she got
in touch with you

274
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,670
right after we
suspected something...

275
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,603
[SHINICHI]
She wants to meet on the
roof of the university...

276
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:04,436
What do you think she's up to?

277
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:08,303
Right now, Ryoko Tamiya
is one hundred thirty
meters from us...

278
00:14:08,403 --> 00:14:10,970
Which means she must be
somewhere beyond that building.

279
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,270
She went from high‐school
teacher to college professor...

280
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,436
Very ambitious.

281
00:14:17,536 --> 00:14:21,970
[PROFESSOR]
Altruism is action undertaken
for the sole benefit of others.

282
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,703
It's the opposite of
self‐interest, and would seem
to have no benefit for oneself.

283
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:30,836
If anything, the action tends
help others while being
disadvantageous to the actor.

284
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:35,970
‐What a cutie.
‐Aw, so sweet!
While these actions may
not be surprising amongst

285
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,270
what can be interpreted
as altruistic behavior

286
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,803
has actually been reported
in several animal species.

287
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:44,370
Honeybees are an excellent
example of this,

288
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,103
they sacrifice themselves,
one after another,

289
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,736
to protect the hive if
a predator should appear.

290
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:51,870
While this could
just be instinct,

291
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,703
some actions would not seem
to preserve the species.

292
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:58,370
The prime illustration of
such a practice could
be identified...

293
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,736
as infanticide.

294
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:03,936
But why kill the offspring
of one's own species?

295
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,636
In recent years,
what's been discovered is...

296
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:08,970
something called the
"selfish gene" theory...

297
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,770
To put it in simple terms,
all animals are manipulated by
their own body's genetic code.

298
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,903
What's important is the self,

299
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,536
and the offspring
who inherit that DNA,

300
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,803
rather than the species
as a whole.

301
00:15:21,903 --> 00:15:23,370
That being said...

302
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,103
Let's expand a bit further...

303
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:28,136
We can now justify all
altruistic behavior,

304
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:30,470
such as caring for others
in one's "pack,"

305
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,703
familial love, marital love
and even maternal love.

306
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:38,470
This premise would suggest
that love and compassion
don't actually exist.

307
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,270
Therefore, all behavior
that appears to be love

308
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,936
is really just behavior to aid
in transmitting one's own DNA.

309
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,770
To be sure, this theory is
not without its problems.

310
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,436
There have been countless
examples of animals helping
others completely unrelated
to them.

311
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,803
This includes like creatures
from unrelated DNA strains,

312
00:15:56,903 --> 00:16:01,270
and even instances of
protecting those of a
different species altogether.

313
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,770
Which begs the question,

314
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,870
can a theory like this
fully encompass

315
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,770
the complexity or the depth
of the human consciousness?

316
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,770
For example, it's interesting
to consider whether human
efforts toward such issues

317
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:19,670
as environmental‐and‐natural
conservation are altruistic
or selfish at their core.

318

[TAMURA]
<i>It's almost time.</i>

319
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:25,036

320
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,170
Yeah...

321
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,570
[Door creaks open]

322
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:40,870
[TAMURA]
I'm glad you came.
You look well.

323
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,170
Why'd you want us
to meet here?

324
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,837
I chose this place
because others of my
kind rarely come here.

325
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:51,937
Also, there was a lecture
I wanted to attend.

326
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:53,237
So it's true.

327
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,470
You are quite different
from before.

328
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,870
How did the two
of you combine...?

329
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,437
What really happened...?

330
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:02,337
I find it difficult to believe
it occurred without reason.

331
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:03,670
Uh...?!

332
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,004
So is that really...
your baby?

333
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:08,904
Yes. It is mine...

334
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:12,370
I haven't had it long, so I
haven't began working on it yet.

335
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,237
Working on it?
How so?

336
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:17,304
Your right hand...
"Migi," wasn't it...?

337
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,937
Shall we exchange
information again...?
For both our sakes.

First, I'd like to confirm
it was you who hired the
private investigator.

339
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,737
Hm.

340
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,937
Didn't you think that doing so

341
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:30,004
might put you in
great danger as well?

342
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,970
I don't really
worry about it...

343
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,137
I know I can simply
assume another identity,
if it comes to that.

344
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:38,604
So what's the deal with
this Mayor Hirokawa?

345
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:41,304
Why would one of your kind
want to be mayor anyway?

346
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:43,537
I'm not entirely
sure myself...

347
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:46,204
And yet... I know that
we are still evolving.

348
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:49,537
We've learned that
recklessly slaughtering
human beings for food

349
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,670
is not a wise
option for us.

350
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,070
Going forward,
we're going to have
to think about...

351
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,837
how we can coexist
with humans.

352
00:17:57,937 --> 00:17:59,470
"Coexist"?

353
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,470
Hideo Shimada said the same
thing, you saw what he did.

354
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,237
Couldn't it be said that,
in a way, humans and
their livestock coexist?

355
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,570
Now, that's not to say
you're equals...

356
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,204
But still, judging from
a pig's point of view,

357
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:15,137
humans are merely predators
that feed upon them.

358
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,670
Humans are so fond of
grandiose ideals.

359
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,204
You grasp onto the
notion that all life
on Earth is sacred,

360
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:23,270
yet you don't behave
in such a way.

361
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,337
I'll admit, there may
be a little truth

362
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,770
to some of the things
that you're saying.

363
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,804
But that being said...

364
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:34,237
There are reasons why I will
never be able to forgive you!

365
00:18:35,137 --> 00:18:36,770
What happened to you?

366
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,737
You just don't really seem
to be like a normal human
being anymore...

367
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:42,337
I'm not sure how to put it...

368
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:44,637
[Grunt]

369
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:46,604
[Baby starts to cry]

370
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:48,237
Huh...

371
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:53,837
A mother and... child...

372
00:18:53,937 --> 00:18:56,504
[Grunting]

373
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:59,437
I heard that your mother
went missing.

374
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:00,837
Uh...

375
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:02,070
Was she killed?

376
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,537
Ah...
[Heart beating]

377
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:06,237
[Heart beating]

378
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:09,337
[Gasping in pain]

379
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:11,004
[MIGI]
Shinichi, calm down!

380
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,837
[Labored breathing]

381
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:17,404
[Baby whiney]

382
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:19,870
Hahaha... I see!

383
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,770
So, one of us ate her.

384
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,204
Huh...

385
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:25,304
Ohh... Impressive...

386
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:27,770
It's like the air is
trembling around us...

387
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,270
I'm gonna kill you!

388
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,604
[Baby crying]
I think I'd lose
if I fought you now...

389
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:35,637
So, I'll have to use the
child to shield myself.

390
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:37,204
Ah!

391
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:39,370
[Baby crying]

392
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,437
Omigod look?!

393
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:45,637
It's that lady from class.

394
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:49,737
[TAMURA]
<i>It seems human children are</i>
<i>more perceptive than adults.</i>

395
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:52,404
Be quiet.

396
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:55,837
[Panting]

397
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:57,804
[SHINICHI]
<i>That bitch...</i>

398
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:03,604
Move it! Get outta my way!

399
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,937
[SHINICHI]
<i>Goddamn humans...</i>

400
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:09,304
[MIGI]
What's wrong, Shinichi?
You must settle yourself.

401
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:12,604
[SHINICHI]
<i>She will pay...</i>
<i>Her day is gonna come!</i>

402
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:15,770
So, I'll have to use the
child to shield myself.

403
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,604
I haven't had it long, so I
haven't began working on it yet.

404
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:22,704
[Panting]

405
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:27,304
[Out of breath]

406
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:31,437
[Woman]
Hello, young man.

407
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:32,970
Yes, <i>you!</i>

408
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,837
Huh?

409
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:35,304
Yes... Come on...

410
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:38,137
Come here...
I do reading.

411
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,937
Yes that's it...

412
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:42,304
You seem to be
full of suffering...

413
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:44,770
Let me see your hand.

414
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,804
Let's go.

415
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:48,904
[FORTUNE TELLER]
<i>Left hand?</i>

416
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:50,304
Hmmm...

417
00:20:50,404 --> 00:20:53,737
I see you have a hole in
your heart now, don't you?

418
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,070
Huh?!
How did you...?

419
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,504
Oh, it's a very
large hole indeed.

420
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,104
So then how can I...

421
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:01,170
how can I close it?

422
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,337
See the person.
What?

423
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:07,337
You have to meet once again with
whomever created this hole...

424
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:09,837
You must meet with them
and have talk.

425
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,837
Then you have closure.

426
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:17,337
Yes... This individual is
the only one who can
heal your wounds.

427
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:19,637
There is no other way.

428
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:26,504
[Scary chuckle]

429
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,370
[Gasp]
Huh?

430
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:33,337
Too late for that,
I already killed her.

431
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:58,204
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"Something Wicked
This Way Comes"
