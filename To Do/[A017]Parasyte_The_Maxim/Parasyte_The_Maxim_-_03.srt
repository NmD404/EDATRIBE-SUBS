1
00:00:05,146 --> 00:00:09,146
[WOMAN]
You. You in the gray coat.

2
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:11,646
What do you think you're doing?

3
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:14,079
[PASSENGERS] (hmm?)

4
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:17,646
I think you need to keep
your hands to yourself.

5
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:18,979
That is disgusting.

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,012
Ew, that guy's a pervert!

7
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:24,346
N‐no, no! That's not true!

8
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:26,746
What the hell is your problem!
What're you trying to do?

9
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:29,046
I didn't touch anybody!
You're crazy!

10
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:31,346
Why would you say that?

11
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,546
[MAN] (gaahhh!)

12
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:39,879
(ungh...)

13
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:24,489
This year's Kayama Fantasy
Literature Award,
the winner is, uh...

14
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:27,689
It's Dai Yoshimi.
"Seventh Transformation," right?

15
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:28,856
Uh‐huh. You read it?

16
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:31,023
It's about a guy that
somehow gains the ability

17
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:33,123
to communicate with reptiles.

18
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:35,056
It's completely ridiculous.

19
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,356
Hmm... Huh?

20
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,789
Not this again...

21
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,723
That brings the total to 84.

22
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:44,489
More Mincemeat Murders?

23
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:47,923
I hate to say it, but it doesn't
even surprise me anymore.

24
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:49,856
Dinner was great. Thanks.

25
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:52,423
[MOM] But, honey,
you didn't even eat half of it!

26
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:54,589
[SHINICHI] Yeah, sorry.

27
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,789
I may be the only person
in the entire world

28
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:01,356
who actually knows the truth
behind all these horrible
killings.

29
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:03,289
I just don't know
what to do about it.

30
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:06,256
[SATOMI] Shinichi!
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

31
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:07,789
[SATOMI] Morning.

32
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,389
Morning.

33
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,256
You know, Shinichi,
you've changed recently.

34
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:15,089
Huh? I have?

35
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,223
Yeah.

36
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:18,323
Really?
What're you talking about?

37
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:19,623
[MIGI] (muffled) Shinichi...

38
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:22,456
Huh?
I swear I just heard a voice.

39
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:24,556
[MIGI] Look down here.

40
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:27,823
Migi? That feels
really weird, ya know.

41
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:29,323
What's wrong Shinichi?

42
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:31,456
Uh, nothing. I'm fine.

43
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:33,089
[MIGI] One of my kind is near.

44
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:34,856
Huh? Again?

45
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:38,623
[MIGI] It's approaching rapidly.

46
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:42,623
[SHINICHI] But there haven't
been any Mincemeat Murders
around here.

47
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,623
[MIGI] Perhaps the bodies
simply haven't been found yet.

48
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:48,889
It's currently about 70 meters
away from us.

49
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:51,923
Sixty meters...

50
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,989
(soft gasp) Not here...

51
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,923
[MIGI] It's inside the building.

52
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:03,923
Inside the school...

53
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:11,789
(general chatter)

54
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:15,556
[SHINICHI] Where is it?

55
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,056
WHO is it?

56
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,623
Is it a guy?

57
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,256
Or a girl?!

58
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:21,956
[MIGI] It's in here.

59
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:24,556
Approximately 30 meters away.

60
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,323
Thirty...?

61
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:31,723
[MIGI] Don't make eye contact.
It will find us.

62
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,756
It's looking for us as well,
but it seems unable to pinpoint

63
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:36,856
our location in the crowd.

64
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:40,023
Welcome, good morning, students.

65
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:44,256
I'd like to introduce our new
math teacher, substituting
for Mr. Matsuyama.

66
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:49,489
HE had to be hospitalized
after the unfortunate
traffic accident two days ago.

67
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,523
Now then, I present to you Ms.
Tamiya.

68
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:02,156
I'm Ryoko Tamiya.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

69
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:04,056
[MIGI] It's her.
[SHINICHI] What?!

70
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:08,456
And, as of today, Mr. Yamamoto
will be the new homeroom teacher
for Class 3‐3.

71
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:11,256
Oh, my God, Murano's class!

72
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:15,223
[PRINCIPAL]
Therefore, Ms. Tamiya will act
as assistant homeroom teacher.

73
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,389
[MIGI] No eye contact, Shinichi!

74
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,189
She just looked at me!
D'you see that?!

75
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:30,589
Just look at her...
the guys are gonna freak out.
[YUKO] Mm‐hm!

76
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:32,856
She found us...

77
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,356
[PE TEACHER]
All right, listen up!

78
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,423
Once you do your five laps
around the field,

79
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:39,756
be sure to stretch again
to loosen up.

80
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,823
Then split into two groups
and set up a match.

81
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:45,123
[MIGI] This surprises me.
[PE TEACHER]
You've read up on all the rules.

82
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:47,123
[MIGI]
After taking over the host,
[PE TEACHER] I don't wanna
see any crap out there.

83
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:51,589
she has managed to
successfully maintain
their position in society.

84
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:54,889
Plus, she functions as
a teacher of humans.

85
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,123
She appears to be quite gifted.

86
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,289
What are you praising her for?

87
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:01,023
We have to do something.

88
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:02,223
[MIGI] What do you mean?

89
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:03,389
Well, what if we don't?

90
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,989
She's gonna eat everybody!

91
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,223
[MIGI] No, I highly doubt that.

92
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:10,156
She wishes to blend in
with human society.

93
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:11,889
I do not believe that
she would use anyone

94
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:15,289
in her immediate social circle
as a food supply.

95
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:18,223
Therefore,
I believe they should be safe.

96
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:19,623
You don't know that.

97
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:22,289
[MIGI] We should just
observe her for now.

98
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:35,123
With everything that's
going on right now,

99
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,389
how can Migi go to sleep?

100
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:40,789
I mean, what if she
suddenly tries to...

101
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,756
[RYOKO] All right, class.
I want you to use this formula

102
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:46,656
to solve problems
six through twelve.

103
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:56,189
[RYOKO] Mr. Izumi...
[SHINICHI] Oh, my God!

104
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:58,156
Is there a problem?

105
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:00,223
You don't appear
to have made any progress.

106
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:03,123
Huh?! Uh... No, ma'am.

107
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,023
Sorry.
(students laughing)

108
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:09,023
(bell tolling)

109
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:13,423
Mr. Izumi, would you
please visit me in the
counselor's office later?

110
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,756
Thank you.

111
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:23,356
Whoa... what'd you do?
[SHINICHI] Uh...

112
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,156
Dude, how did you do that?

113
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:28,523
Jesus, what do I have to do to
get myself called to the
teacher's office?!

114
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:31,089
Hellooo? What's wrong with
what's sitting right here...

115
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:32,989
Shinichi knows!
[FURUTANI] Whatever.

116
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:36,923
You can't teach me all the
things sweet, mature hottie
Ms. Tamiya can.

117
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,289
But I don't understand it...

118
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,789
What's she wanna with
squirrely ass Shinichi?

119
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,123
Doesn't really make sense.

120
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:43,489
What's that sposta mean?!

121
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,289
Why you gotta be
such a jerk, huh?

122
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:55,556
Oh, whatever, Shinichi... You
don't know what you're missing.

123
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,356
[MIGI] Shinichi...

124
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:02,223
She's approximately ten meters
away right now.

125
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:04,356
[SHINICHI] Oh, so you're awake?

126
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,356
Excuse me.

127
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,456
Please, come on in.

128
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,223
Well then, Mr. Izumi...

129
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:20,856
You are aware of what I am, yes?
[SHINICHI] Yeah.

130
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:25,856
"Yeah"? That's no way to speak
to your teacher now, is it?

131
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,256
Oh, there's no need
for you to be so anxious.

132
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:32,323
You should know that I have
absolutely no intentions

133
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:33,689
of killing you right now.

134
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,723
Your right hand
should know that.

135
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,423
Besides, if we fought
in such close quarters,

136
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,889
we'd both end up
being mortally wounded.

137
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:43,856
I'd like the opportunity to
speak with you a bit more.

138
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:48,156
You think you have time to meet
with me after school today?

139
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:50,089
Okay.
[SHINICHI] Huh?!

140
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:52,323
But what if it's
some kind of trap?!

141
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:54,789
I am totally against this!

142
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:56,089
How predictable.

143
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:59,223
Why must humans always
be so irrational?

144
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:00,989
What's that?!

145
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:08,223
If I wanted to kill you,
I already would have.
[SHINICHI] (uhhh...)

146
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:10,956
I am... curious however.

147
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:14,323
Because I've never seen a case
anything like yours before.

148
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,256
I wish to collect more data.

149
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,723
I'd like to exchange
information with you...

150
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,823
and discuss our future.

151
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,223
"Future"?

152
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:26,423
[RYOKO]
Well, that's all for now.

153
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:30,589
(sliding door)

154
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:35,089
[SASAKI] Hey, Ms. Tamiya!
[RYOKO] Yes?

155
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:37,523
Uh... do you have
any plans this afternoon?

156
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:40,823
[RYOKO] I do. I have some
student counseling sessions.

157
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:42,089
Oh, okay.

158
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,989
[RYOKO] If you'll excuse me.

159
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,323
Hey I'm going to the bookstore,
do you wanna come with me?
[SATOMI] Uh‐huh.

160
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:55,523
Huh? Is that...

161
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,756
[MIGI] Shinichi, you should
roll up your sleeves.

162
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:19,389
Why should I do that? We're not
getting into a fight, are we?

163
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,056
[MIGI]
Perhaps, something's coming.
[SHINICHI] Huh?!

164
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,456
Actually,
two of my kind are coming.

165
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:26,789
(gasp) So it really was a trap?

166
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,523
[MIGI] There's no way to
know that for sure yet.

167
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,889
[MIGI] Shinichi, it would be
really helpful right now

168
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:37,123
if you could slow down
your heart rate a little bit.

169
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:39,156
It's making me feel anxious.

170
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:40,756
I can't do that!

171
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:46,889
[RYOKO] Sorry for the wait.

172
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,056
I'll keep this short...

173
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:50,989
Meet Mr. A.

174
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:52,256
Just "A"?

175
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:54,756
Yes, he has no name.

176
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:56,656
What is this creature?

177
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,556
Can we even call him
one of our kind?

178
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:04,056
That's enough. There's no
merit in killing one another

179
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:06,456
in a place as public as this.

180
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:15,661
Interesting... So at this point,

181
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:18,627
you've only encountered
those two types so far.

182
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:19,661
Yeah.

183
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:21,761
Now, I'd like to know...
In your opinion,

184
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:25,527
what exactly do you think
we are, Mr. Izumi?

185
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:27,527
Well from everything
I've seen...

186
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:30,461
You're monsters here to
feed on the human race.

187
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:33,061
But you see...

188
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:36,061
Mr. A and I have experimented,
and had sex with each other.

189
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,761
[SHINICHI] (gasps)
(breaking glass)

190
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:40,327
Oh, I'm so sorry!

191
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:43,161
Please excuse me.
(softly) Oh, my God...

192
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,727
And the result might
surprise you.

193
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:49,227
I am now pregnant Mr. Izumi.
[SHINICHI] (gulp)

194
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:51,394
So then, here's a question...

195
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:54,627
This "thing" that I currently
have growing inside my body...

196
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,327
What do you think it might be?

197
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,627
Oh... well, uh...

198
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:02,327
[MIGI] A human, a normal one.

199
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:04,061
Good answer. Yes...

200
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:09,227
The child I am carrying
is human, an ordinary
human baby.

201
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:12,327
In which case, what do you
think that makes us?

202
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:14,161
I've no idea.

203
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:16,227
Nor do I really want
to find out.

204
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:18,161
What I DO know is
that you eat humans

205
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:20,427
in order to keep
your human host alive.

206
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:22,294
And that's what we call
cannibalism.

207
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:24,194
Why would you do
something like that?

208
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:25,527
Have you ever...

209
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:27,694
tried asking your little friend
that question?

210
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:30,394
[MIGI]
I receive nutrients directly
through Shinichi's blood,

211
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:31,994
so I do not experience hunger.

212
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:35,227
Therefore, I am also at a loss
to understand our own kind's

213
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,294
alleged necessity for
cannibalism.

214
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:39,261
Our species cannot reproduce,

215
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:42,361
and we engage in a sort of
pseudo‐cannibalism.

216
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,494
I'm not really sure
what to call us.

217
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,161
[MIGI]
I've given it some thought,

218
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:48,727
and I consider it
strange as well.

219
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:51,827
[SHINICHI] Are you actually
even life forms? Or what?

220
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:55,127
Either way, I don't think
you're from this planet.

221
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,427
I am leaving now.

222
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,594
Whether or not I find out
exactly what I am,

223
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,927
isn't going to change
anything for me.

224
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:02,561
I eat when I feel hungry,

225
00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:05,061
and I get rid of
anyone in my way.

226
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,861
And that is it.

227
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:14,861
[A] That one is dangerous.
He must be eliminated.

228
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,661
We didn't merge with
our host the same way.

229
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,961
Now...

230
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:23,894
Humans do sometimes
act illogically,

231
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:25,894
so I will give you a warning.

232
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:27,827
If you think of me
as an enemy,

233
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:30,094
and decide to make some
kind of a scene,

234
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:32,261
the disadvantage is yours.

235
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,694
You can't change your face.

236
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:42,461
I've decided it's in my interest
to protect my current
human identity,

237
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:44,527
so I will not behave
irrationally.

238
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:51,661
But if I were provoked,
an entire classroom...

239
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:52,994
(aahhhh...)

240
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:55,394
Would all be dead
in mere seconds.

241
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:59,394
I believe you have friends
in that class, do you not?

242
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:02,661
(whimpers)

243
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:07,494
[MOM] Shinichi! Is that you?

244
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:16,861
She's something else.
She was capable

245
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:19,961
of making you suffer an
intense amount of fear.

246
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,594
Shinichi... That's cold.

247
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:34,294
Huh?

248
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:35,961
So, uh, yesterday...

249
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:37,727
you took the bus somewhere.

250
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:41,594
Where did you go?
Murano was worried about you.

251
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,127
Oh... Nowhere.

252
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,527
(snap)

253
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:46,861
[MIGI]
Shinichi, we are under attack.

254
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,994
I sense nothing but
pure killing intent.
[SHINICHI] Huh?

255
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:51,827
[AKIHO]
Ms. Tamiya? Are you okay?

256
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,461
Idiot.
[AKIHO] (gasps)

257
00:14:57,494 --> 00:15:01,961
[TEACHER]
(whimpering) Somebody help!

258
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,427
Oh, my goodness!
Are you all right?

259
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,427
(unh) There's an intruder.
He went that way.

260
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,094
Okay! Get a hold of the police!

261
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:11,561
And we must evacuate
the students at once!

262
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:17,027
Time for study hall, class.
(confused murmurs)

263
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:23,261
Who do you think would
try to attack us?

264
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,127
[MIGI]
Probably the one from yesterday.

265
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:27,927
[SASAKI]
Excuse me, sir. You are not
allowed to be on school property

266
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,227
without a badge from the office!
You need to come with me!

267
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,261
Sir, I... (ungh!)
[TEACHERS] (gasps)

268
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:40,427
[TEACHERS]
(whimpering) (ungh!)

269
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,527
[MIGI] He just neutralized
three obstacles.

270
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:44,461
Are you saying that he
killed some people?!

271
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:47,427
[MIGI] I'm not sure.
But he's very forceful.

272
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,561
Dear God! This is terrible!

273
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:53,661
We need to get the students as
far away from here as possible!

274
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:56,427
[PA]
Attention students and faculty!
This is an emergency!

275
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,827
There is currently
an intruder on campus!
[NAGAI] What?

276
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:01,027
What do you think they want?
[PA]
Students are to follow their
teachers' instructions

277
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,894
Was there supposed
to be a drill today?
[PA] and evacuate the school

278
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:07,061
[PA] in groups according to
class. I repeat: There is
an intruder on campus!

279
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,827
Damn! He's doing this
in broad daylight.
[PA] Follow your
teachers' instructions.

280
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,761
[MIGI] He has no concern for the
consequences of his actions.
[PA] Emergency protocols
are now in place.

281
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,461
He doesn't have the same
reasoning as Ryoko Tamiya.
[PA] Please remain calm and
be aware of your surroundings.

282
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:18,394
Guess not.
Where is she right now anyway?
[PA] There is a confirmed
intruder on school grounds.

283
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:21,294
She is approximately one‐hundred
fifty meters from here.
[PA] Everyone is ordered to
avoid Wing A completely.

284
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,527
It would seem that she intends
to observe our fight
[PA] Students are to follow
their teachers' instructions

285
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:25,261
from a safe distance.
[PA] and evacuate the school
in groups according to class.

286
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,594
That's better than fighting
both of them.

287
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:30,161
[PA] Make your way to
the stairs near Wing C.

288
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:33,327
Do not approach Wing A
under any circumstances.

289
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:36,327
Ms. Tamiya! She's gone?

290
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:39,494
Okay, come with me kids!
Don't push. Don't push!

291
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:41,794
I need everybody to stay in line
and keep moving.

292
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:43,294
Just follow me down
to the courtyard.

293
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:45,327
[MIGI] We will have to
fight him, Shinichi.

294
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,094
Fight him? But why?

295
00:16:47,194 --> 00:16:48,927
It's daytime
in a crowded school.

296
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:52,427
He walked in here with
absolutely no regard
for being seen.

297
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:54,794
If we run,
he's sure to follow us.

298
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:58,027
It's better to finish him
here and now.

299
00:16:58,127 --> 00:17:00,461
Plus, right now,
we have the advantage.

300
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,894
And we also have a plan.

301
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:04,527
Huh, a plan?

302
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:07,427
Hey, who the heck
have you been talking to?

303
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,961
Huh?! I'm just
thinking out loud.

304
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:14,294
Hey, isn't that him there?
That's gotta be him.

305
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:15,327
Huh? He's where?

306
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:17,361
Over there, that old guy.

307
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:20,427
[AKIHO] Oh, God!
What do you think he wants?

308
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:23,494
[SASAKI] Please, stay in line!
Keep moving!

309
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:25,294
[MIGI]
He's trying to pinpoint your...

310
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,961
No, he's trying to pinpoint
MY location.

311
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:31,594
However, the size of this crowd
is preventing him from
doing that.

312
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:34,127
[SHINICHI] And then what?
What's gonna happen?

313
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:35,527
What if he does find us?

314
00:17:35,627 --> 00:17:37,861
[MIGI] Without a doubt,
he's going to attack us.

315
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:42,394
He will come full force,
affecting all those
who are around us.

316
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,394
Fortunately, that will
give us an opportunity.

317
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:47,594
Opportunity?
[MIGI] Yes.

318
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,794
[MIGI] While he's busy attacking
all the people around you,

319
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:53,361
I will be able to move in
swiftly and surprise him.

320
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:57,061
It's simple, and it has
a high probability of success.

321
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,994
All those people?

322
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:00,061
That's your plan?

323
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:01,661
[MIGI] Yes, that's the plan.

324
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:05,227
Mr. A will be encumbered by a
rather inconvenient obstacle:

325
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:07,194
a crowd of confused students.

326
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,427
A wall of flesh will protect us.

327
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:11,494
A "wall of flesh"?

328
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:14,461
I almost forgot
what a sicko you are!

329
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:18,827
Murano!
[SATOMI] Shinichi?

330
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,061
Get outta here!

331
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:21,561
Did you forget something?
I'll come wi‐

332
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:24,561
I said to go!
Get away from me!

333
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:26,327
(gasps)

334
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:28,027
Uh, I'm really sorry!

335
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:30,394
Just hurry up and
get out of here!

336
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:37,627
[SHINICHI] (panting)

337
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:40,561
[MIGI] What's wrong, Shinichi?

338
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,127
Do you not like my strategy
to fight Mr. A?

339
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:44,327
Of course I don't...!

340
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,194
How many need to die to do it?!

341
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:47,461
[MIGI] Does it matter?

342
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,494
It's for the sake of
self preservation.

343
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:52,161
Sacrificing others in order
to protect oneself...

344
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:55,827
That's simply the way that
all life forms maintain
their existence.

345
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,961
You know, you learned how
to speak like us.

346
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:03,327
But you don't understand
who we are at all, do you?

347
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:04,894
I just remembered...

348
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:08,561
Humans are very unique animals
that sometimes commit suicide.

349
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:11,561
It's not like anyone
WANTS to die.

350
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:14,861
[MIGI] What is it you're doing?

351
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,794
I have a better option
than a "wall of flesh".

352
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:21,394
C'mon, Class 3‐2,
you need to stay in line!

353
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,094
[SHINICHI] Are you angry, Migi?

354
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:27,027
[MIGI] Angry?
No, of course I'm not.

355
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:29,394
I have no time
for such things.

356
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:35,261
Shinichi, how do you think
we are different from Mr. A?

357
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:37,127
[SHINICHI] "Different"?

358
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:39,061
Well, he's a murderer.

359
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:41,361
And I'm a decent human being.

360
00:19:42,227 --> 00:19:45,361
He can be someone else.
And I can't.

361
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:47,261
There's one of him.

362
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,627
And there's two of us.

363
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:50,827
[MIGI] Is that so?
[SHINICHI] (hmm?)

364
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:54,827
[MIGI] Do you think Mr. A sees
us as two separate entities?

365
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,761
I don't understand.

366
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:06,461
Here, this will be your weapon.
[SHINICHI] My weapon?

367
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:10,061
That's right. Mr. A and I are
equally matched in combat.

368
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:11,827
That leaves one obvious factor.

369
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:13,894
You are going to have to
join the fight.

370
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,727
If you allow yourself to become
flustered during the battle,

371
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:19,761
it will only hold me back,
and we will lose.

372
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:22,694
But if you are able to fight
effectively, we win.

373
00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:23,694
Got it?

374
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:26,661
Fight "effectively"?
What's that mean?

375
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:30,561
[MIGI] In other words Shinichi,
we delegate our roles.

376
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:41,327
[SHINICHI] Do you think that's
really going to work?

377
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:42,861
[MIGI] It's our best option.

378
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:46,394
All that's left for you to do
now is conceal your weapon.

379
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,561
[SHINICHI]
The truth of the matter is,

380
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:54,294
Migi is way more skilled
at combat than I am.

381
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:57,327
I mean, he's even killed
two of his own kind.

382
00:20:58,294 --> 00:21:00,561
I guess my only choice
is to trust him.

383
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:02,194
[MIGI] He's here, Shinichi.

384
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,594
Mr. A is within
three meters of us.

385
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:05,761
Three meters?!

386
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:08,494
Huh? But that's impossible!
He'd be right here!

387
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:10,561
[MIGI] Directly below us.

388
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,794
(gasps)

389
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,961
[A] Was that meant as
some sort of barricade?

390
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:28,627
The only thing you've
accomplished is to
block off your escape.

391
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:58,894
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"Tangled Hair"
