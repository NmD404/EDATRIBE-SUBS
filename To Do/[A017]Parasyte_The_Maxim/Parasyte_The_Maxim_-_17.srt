1
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:08,912
Good evening, Tamura.

2
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:10,446
We can try to hide them,

3
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:13,179
but they can't be suppressed,
can they?

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,212
The strongest signals
that we emit

5
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:17,946
are those which
harbor animosity.

6
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:20,212
I know of your intentions.

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,279
Get on with it.

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,646
Why did you not make
any attempt to escape?

9
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:27,946
Because I was intrigued.

10
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:30,612
I fell prey to my curiosity.

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,512
Though I must wonder,

12
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:36,079
are there any others who
support your actions?

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,279
No, it's only the three of us.

14
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:41,979
Hirokawa and Goto know nothing
about what we're planning.

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,546
[TAMURA] I see.

16
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:44,846
And your reason?

17
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,779
Call it an instinct.

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,412
I believe that, going forward,

19
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:52,179
you will prove to be an
extremely dangerous
liability for us.

20
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:53,379
Very well, then.

21
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,679
You remind me a lot of Mr. A.

22
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,112
Mr. A?

23
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:00,912
We parasites have a tendency
to think and operate

24
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:05,779
in a manner that is normally
quite logical and
uncomplicated.

25
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,012
I thought that temperament
would make it easy to create
a united organization,

26
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,512
but I was mistaken.

27
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:16,379
Still, for the parasites,
myself included,

28
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,012
to have such
individual differences ‐

29
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,746
or rather, such personalities ‐

30
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:24,812
makes me very pleased.

31
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:28,646
I'm actually moved by your
decision to eliminate me.

32
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:31,812
Well then,

33
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:33,779
shall we get started?

34
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,079
With only three of you,

35
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,479
I hope you have some sort
of plan in place.

36
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:38,712
(huh?)

37
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:49,479
Stop her! Kill her!

38
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,846
(sounds of parasites fighting)

39
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:38,479
(hmm?)

40
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,412
The muscle strength of my host
is superior to yours.

41
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:50,712
Therefore, even in single
combat, I would win.

42
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:52,846
You seem so certain.

43
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:00,779
Too slow...

44
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,212
Huh?

45
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,479
(ungh!)

46
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:12,279
You can keep that.
(maniacal laughter)

47
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,779
What is she thinking,
splitting in two?

48
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,546
I'll go after her.

49
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:18,779
(waah!)

50
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:27,679
Tamura entered his body.

51
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,379
Are... Are you okay?

52
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,046
Yeah.

53
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,946
(maniacal laughter)

54
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:35,079
[BOTH] (huh?)

55
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:38,246
(aahhh!)
[TAMURA] (maniacl laughter)

56
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,379
(dog howling &amp; barking)

57
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:55,346
[WOMAN] (nervous whimpering)

58
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:57,712
Right there, that's her!

59
00:04:57,812 --> 00:05:00,146
Uh, excuse me!

60
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,579
Huh?

61
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,812
[BOTH] (gasps)

62
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:09,312
(sighs of relief)

63
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,879
Why are you putting rocks
in your bag?

64
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,679
[TAMURA]
It's dangerous out here.

65
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,946
(nervous chuckle)

66
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:20,146
Did you just see...

67
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:22,179
We saw the weirdest thing
back there.

68
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,112
We saw a lady just now who
looked like she only had half
her head, and she was, uh...

69
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:28,412
she was running around laughing
and it was crazy.

70
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:33,046
Just half of her head?
Oh dear, how strange..

71
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:36,146
I still...
I still have my head,

72
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:38,279
but it's empty inside!
See?

73
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,712
[MAN &amp; WOMAN] (gibbering)

74
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,146
[TAMURA] (maniacal laughter)

75
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,646
<i>She's lost her purpose,</i>

76
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:50,312
<i>and can no longer</i>
<i>think rationally.</i>

77
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:55,512
<i>There's no way half a parasite</i>
<i>can maintain control of</i>
<i>the host body.</i>

78
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,246
<i>It's suicide.</i>

79
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:59,179
<i>Such a waste.</i>

80
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,212
<i>For one so famed</i>
<i>for her intellect,</i>

81
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:05,146
<i>how sad for her to</i>
<i>die this way.</i>

82
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:09,246
[MAESAWA] (ungh) (waah)

83
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:14,646
My legs...
I can't feel my legs!

84
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,179
[MAESAWA] (kyaa!)

85
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,846
[HIKAWA] (gasps)
[MAESAWA] (gibbering)

86
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,112
What is this?!

87
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:25,312
[MAESAWA] It's not me! Not ME!
(arrrggghhh)

88
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:30,646
[HIKAWA] (ungh!)

89
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:34,812
<i>One of us is dead.</i>

90
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,679
[TAMURA] (evil chuckle)

91
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,412
[HIKAWA] (gasping in pain)

92
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,546
[KUSANO] Ah, you can survive
by burrowing inside.

93
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:56,079
But now, can you really take
over completely when you're
split in two?

94
00:06:56,179 --> 00:07:00,812
Will you be able to defeat me
using a body that's so
badly damaged?

95
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:05,746
(urk) Stop it! This is MY body!

96
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:07,412
Stop it! NO!!

97
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:09,412
[KUSANO]
Who am I even talking to now?

98
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,212
Is it Hikawa?
Or is it Reiko Tamura?

99
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:15,146
[HIKAWA] Please stop!
I'm on your side! It's me!

100
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:17,579
Really, then why are you
moving toward me?

101
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:20,779
[HIKAWA] Dammit! I can't control
anything below my neck!

102
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,179
[KUSANO] Just give in.

103
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,112
And die along with that
fragment of Reiko Tamura!

104
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:28,046
But I am on your side!

105
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:32,112
(ungh!) (urk!) (aahhh!)

106
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:35,179
[HIKAWA] (dying)
What have you done?

107
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,779
[KUSANO]
Is this really your strategy?

108
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,279
The body you attempted to
take over now lies in shreds.

109
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,779
Just, come out!

110
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,679
How long do you plan to
keep hiding in there?

111
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:50,546
(huh?!)

112
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:58,246
(urk!) (gasping for breath)

113
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:00,679
The human part of our body
is our weakness.

114
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,946
You should make your strike
without all the grandstanding.

115
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:07,146
[KUSANO] (bleh! bleh!)

116
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:09,412
[TAMURA] (laughs)

117
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:11,779
[TAMURA] Even if the host body
is destroyed,

118
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,979
our parasite cells survive
for a short time on their own

119
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,579
and emit brainwaves.

120
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:22,546
You're obviously experiencing
this phenomenon right now.

121
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:25,312
The strongest wavelengths
we parasites emit

122
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:28,012
are animosity and
murderous intent,

123
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:29,512
as you're well aware.

124
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,946
The ability to detect these
is quite important.

125
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:35,846
It's how we determine whether
an individual who's outside
our range of vision

126
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:37,612
is friend or foe.

127
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:40,912
But you cut your own ally
into pieces,

128
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:44,179
thereby surrounding yourself
with fragments of her flesh,

129
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,479
all of which continue to
emanate her signal.

130
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,112
[KUSANOU] (nnggghh...)

131
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:51,446
[TAMURA] That's right.

132
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:54,012
All those fragments were
acting as camouflage,

133
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:57,579
masking my transmissions
as I approached you.

134
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,946
[KUSANO] (urrrggg...)
Goddamn you, that's impossible!

135
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:04,579
Do you know where you came from,
[KUSANO] (dying gurgles)

136
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,146
and where it is you're
ultimately headed?

137
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,312
Have you ever pondered
about such things,

138
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:11,579
as a human being might do?

139
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,812
(dying gurgles)

140
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,512
[TAMURA] Goodbye, Kusano.

141
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:26,779
[TAMURA] Hmm... cannibalism...

142
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,479
Hmm? It's unlocked.

143
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:46,312
You are more troublesome than
I thought, Mr. Detective.

144
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:51,479
(mouse clickling)

145
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:55,846
[SHINICHI] Huh? He left?

146
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:57,946
Well, when did he
leave the hotel?

147
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:01,146
(mouse clickling)

148
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,146
(phone ringing)

149
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:10,079
[SHINICHI] Dad,
what are you doing at home?!

150
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:12,412
[TAMURA]
I'm afraid he hasn't been here.

151
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,246
(huh?)

152
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,846
Why the hell are you there?!
[TAMURA] Good morning.

153
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:18,779
[SHINICHI] (on phone) I take it
you're there to kill him.

154
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,179
[TAMURA] (soft laugh)
As a matter of fact,
it's quite the contrary.

155
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,879
[TAMURA] (on phone) I was hoping
to contact YOU regarding
a personal matter.

156
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:31,146
You know where
Hikari Park Number One is?
(mouse clicking)

157
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:36,212
It's very important that you
meet me there this afternoon,
at 5:20 PM.

158
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:38,346
[SHINICHI] (on phone)
What are you talking about?

159
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:40,312
I need to give you something.

160
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:43,912
Seeing as how you're something
in‐between human and parasite,

161
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:45,679
it's perfect for you.

162
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:02,146
<i>A mother...</i>

163
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,846
It's not right!
Something's very wrong!

164
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:06,946
Who are you? Ryoko!

165
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:08,746
Where is my Ryoko?!

166
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,612
(doorbell chiming)

167
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,446
<i>No one's home today, either.</i>

168
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,646
<i>I wonder if</i>
<i>something's happened?</i>

169
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:36,579
(huh?) Uh, hey! Um, Ms. Izumi?

170
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,712
Where is...
Where is Shinichi?

171
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:43,479
Sorry, he isn't here.

172
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:45,412
I see...

173
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:48,679
So, are you, uh,
Shinichi's mother?

174
00:11:49,512 --> 00:11:50,312
I'm not.

175
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:52,612
Do I really look
that old to you?

176
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,612
Uh, no.

177
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,079
But please tell me.

178
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:59,979
Do you know what's going on?

179
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,279
Shinichi...

180
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,346
He's caught up in
something bad, isn't he?

181
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:06,079
What do you mean by bad?

182
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:07,479
Well, I, uh...

183
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:10,446
I can tell that something
is definitely messed up.

184
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:14,179
Shinichi would never say
anything about it, but still...

185
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,846
You're worried, aren't you?

186
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,612
Worried about him?

187
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:22,679
I'm quite jealous.

188
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,179
Huh?

189
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,846
Don't trouble yourself.

190
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:29,346
Shinichi's actually much
stronger than he looks.

191
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:33,312
And he'll be back home
very soon, perfectly fine.

192
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:36,479
But when is "soon"?

193
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,912
(uh!)
<i>Where have I seen her before?</i>

194
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,185
[YUKO] Seriously though,
where did Shinichi run off to?

195
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:01,818
It's just weird.

196
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:03,152
[AKIHO] I swear.

197
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:06,418
Doesn't he know how worried
we are about him?

198
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:09,718
<i>[SATOMI] He'll be back, soon.</i>

199
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:11,952
<i>It could even be today.</i>

200
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:14,685
You... you will...

201
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:16,552
come back, right?

202
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:24,485
[SATOMI] <i>He'll be back.</i>

203
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:28,052
Hey!

204
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,818
It's okay.
You don't have to worry, Murano.

205
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,585
<i>He will...</i>

206
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:35,685
<i>He has to!</i>

207
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:53,152
[SATOMI] (gasps)

208
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:54,418
What's wrong?
[AKIHO] Where you going?

209
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:56,685
[SATOMI] Sorry!
Go ahead without me!

210
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:02,985
<i>[SATOMI] I think this is...</i>

211
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:05,252
<i>this is where Kana lived.</i>

212
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:11,418
<i>I wonder if she knew...</i>

213
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,352
<i>the Shinichi that I don't.</i>

214
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:17,752
(gasps)

215
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,052
[SATOMI] No, please wait!

216
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:47,052
(panting)

217
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,385
What the...

218
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:50,785
How is that girl so damn fast?!

219
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:53,018
[MAN] Hey!
[SATOMI] (gasps!)

220
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:54,618
Goodness, young lady.

221
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:55,952
A nice, young girl like you

222
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,585
shouldn't resort to using
such foul language.

223
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:00,285
Uh...

224
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,952
[HIRAMA] Hmm?

225
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:06,552
[MITA] What's this?

226
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:10,185
(birds cawing)

227
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,585
[KURAMORI]
Ah, there, there, there.

228
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:13,918
Hey, little fella...

229
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:16,418
[TAMURA]
You're good with children.

230
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:20,385
Well, my wife was the only one
with a job there for
quite a while.

231
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:23,318
So I spent lots of time
with my little girl.
[BABY] (fussing)

232
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:25,818
Aw, you're okay, you're okay.

233
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:32,985
[SHINICHI] I guess I must've
gotten here too early.

234
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:34,952
[MIGI]
Then walk around a little bit.

235
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:37,752
I'd like to get a layout
of the terrain.

236
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:39,352
Sure.

237
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:56,185
[KURAMORI]
Even a cold‐blooded monster
still values her child.

238
00:15:56,285 --> 00:16:00,018
I've been doing some extensive
research on you humans.

239
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:03,085
And on some level,
I'm able to comprehend your

240
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:05,752
rather irrational behavior.

241
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:07,618
Really?

242
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,652
Well, I guess that's good.

243
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:14,518
But you know, you'll never fully
understand, right?

244
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:16,418
You don't know what
it means to be human.

245
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,785
How it really feels
to be a parent!

246
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:21,952
How could you possibly grasp
the depth of the sadness

247
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:23,552
that comes with
losing everything?

248
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:26,785
Everything that's ever mattered
to you in your entire life?!

249
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,552
You can't do it!

250
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:33,852
Because I could kill this
innocent child right
here and now,

251
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,052
and you wouldn't even so much
as bat an eye, would you?

252
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:39,585
You'd just move on
like nothing happened!

253
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:42,318
And you know it!

254
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,185
This baby can't really
be yours anyway.

255
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,218
This baby's human.

256
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:55,385
[MIGI] What is this?

257
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:59,052
I've never felt this sort of
signal from one of my kind.

258
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:02,185
It's Reiko Tamura's brainwave,
but...

259
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:04,818
What is this emotion?

260
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,452
[KURAMORI]
You could never love it.

261
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:11,285
You're completely
cold and dead inside.

262
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:13,518
If I could just make you feel
even one tiny shred

263
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:16,352
of the grief I've had to
suffer through, then...

264
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:23,152
(urk!)

265
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:29,752
(ungh...)

266
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:41,018
I... I wouldn't do it.

267
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:42,418
I would never...

268
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:45,585
No human could ever kill
a helpless child.

269
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:47,618
You... you don't...

270
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:52,085
I didn't think...

271
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,652
I didn't think
a monster like you...

272
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:57,118
(weak chuckle)

273
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:02,385
Th‐that was a sur‐surprise.
(ungh...)

274
00:18:04,485 --> 00:18:06,485
(wet splat)

275
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:12,152
Yes, I'm rather
surprised myself.

276
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:15,618
[MIGI] Reiko Tamura has
started moving.

277
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:18,552
She's headed for the corner
on the opposite side.

278
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:21,218
So, over this way?

279
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:34,218
What am I even doing here?

280
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:37,052
I can't believe
I came all this way.

281
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,385
(brakes squealing)

282
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:45,718
[WOMAN] (screams)
[HIRAMA] (huh?!)

283
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:47,318
[WOMAN] (sobbing hysterically)

284
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,152
There's a... There's a man!
He's over there!

285
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:52,218
(running footsteps)

286
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:55,618
[HIRAMA] Kuramori!

287
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:58,885
Are you okay?

288
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,785
Are you able to talk to me?!

289
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:02,285
(weak moans)

290
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:05,452
Ah, hey there, Detective...

291
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:06,318
Where are they?!

292
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:08,218
Are they up on the hill?!

293
00:19:08,318 --> 00:19:12,052
Just go! And if you spot one
of them, do not hesitate!

294
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,518
[DETECTIVES] Yes, sir!
(running footsteps)

295
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:16,052
Was it Reiko Tamura?!

296
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:17,218
Did she do this?

297
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:20,152
Does Hirokawa know
what she's up to?!

298
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,085
There's a... a woman...

299
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:25,118
She's dressed in white...
She's holding...

300
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:27,618
And she's holding a little baby.

301
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:30,085
And there's some blood...

302
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:32,485
My... my blood got
on the baby's clothes.

303
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:35,252
[HIRAMA] Right!
We won't let her get away!

304
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,385
There's one more thing
I need to know.

305
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:39,952
You mentioned you had
a "partner" in your report.

306
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:41,652
Is he a human?

307
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:42,952
What's his name?

308
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:44,785
Please, you gotta tell me!

309
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,552
[KURAMORI] He is... human...

310
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:55,385
Like me, he had a small family,
and it was taken from him.

311
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,418
He too...

312
00:19:56,518 --> 00:19:58,385
He also s‐suffers...
(ragged breath)

313
00:19:58,485 --> 00:20:01,985
Talk to me!
Tell me who he is!

314
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:06,185
(soft chuckle) Yoko... Yumi...

315
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,952
I'm coming home.

316
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,718
I'll see you soon....

317
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:11,818
[HIRAMA] Kuramori!

318
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:14,185
Stay with me, buddy! Come on!

319
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:16,585
I... I would never...

320
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,385
I wouldn't do it...

321
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,385
The baby...

322
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,103
No! Stay with me!

323
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:27,937
Kuramori, please!

324
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:34,637
<i>You were an honorable man...</i>

325
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:38,103
<i>one of the greatest of heroes.</i>

326
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:42,503
<i>And I swear you will NOT</i>
<i>have died in vain,</i>

327
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:44,303
<i>Detective!</i>

328
00:20:44,837 --> 00:20:45,837
I understand!

329
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:48,137
White clothes, holding a baby.

330
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:50,003
(screams)

331
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:52,237
Don't move!
What's your name?

332
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:53,937
Answer me, now!

333
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:56,137
[HIRAMA] <i>I just pray that</i>
<i>Hirokawa's group</i>

334
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:58,770
<i>hasn't found out about</i>
<i>what we're planning.</i>

335
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,237
<i>We cannot let</i>
<i>Reiko Tamura get away.</i>

336
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:04,137
<i>We have to finish her off.</i>

337
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:05,403
<i>Now!</i>

338
00:22:53,737 --> 00:22:57,303
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"More Than Human"
