1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,904
[YOUNG WOMAN] (ah!)
I think I drank too much!

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,471
Well, I should
probably get going.

3
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:11,271
[YOUNG WOMAN]
(uh...) Now, hold on!

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:13,804
What's the big rush, huh?
Sit down.

5
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:17,237
Hey, y'know, you're a lot
cuter than Shiro said.

6
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:19,204
[KATO] You're embarrassing me.
(chuckles)

7
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:21,704
[YOUNG WOMAN] Ha‐ha, I mean it,
seriously.

8
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:24,537
Have you heard about
that hair thingy?

9
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:26,037
Hold still...

10
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:30,571
(laughs) Sorry about that!
I pulled out three by acci‐
(huh?)

11
00:00:41,704 --> 00:00:43,237
No...

12
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:45,004
This is awkward.

13
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:46,604
(thwack!)

14
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:51,804
(bushes rustling)

15
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:01,037
It was the hair
that gave me away.

16
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:02,504
I could use some help.

17
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,171
I don't normally eat meat
containing alcohol.

18
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:09,904
(wet slurping)

19
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,324
(birds chirping)

20
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,624
(huh?) (gasps)

21
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:08,290
(breathy gurgles)
[KANA] (gasps)

22
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,024
(breathy gurgles)
[KANA] (whimpers)

23
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:16,157
(running)

24
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:22,424
(screams)

25
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:25,890
(whimpers)

26
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,390
(ah!)

27
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:34,457
(heroic music)

28
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:39,857
(horse whinnies)

29
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,390
(shwick!)

30
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,590
(huh?)

31
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:16,357
I owe you...
I owe you my life.

32
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:24,290
(birds chirping)

33
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,890
(sighs)

34
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:42,290
I can't believe he'd do
something like that.

35
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,190
How do Shinichi and I
seem similar to you?

36
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,457
I mean, whatever it is
you think you're sensing,

37
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:51,057
it could be some kind of
"wavelengths" being
broadcast

38
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,824
by dangerous jerks like him.

39
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:56,724
Don't tell me Shinichi...

40
00:04:57,757 --> 00:04:59,257
Huh?

41
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:05,257
(footsteps)

42
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,890
[KANA] (ah!)

43
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:11,857
Nobody likes
being snuck up on.

44
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:13,724
Oh, sorry!

45
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,124
(sighs)

46
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:17,624
Look, if you really
want one of my hairs,

47
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:19,224
you can help yourself.

48
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:22,290
Oh, uh...
Okay, thank you.

49
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,890
[SHINICHI] You happy now?
[KANA] (ah!)

50
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:29,457
Oh...

51
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:37,524
[KANA] Wait up!

52
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:43,324
Hey, I remember you warned me
before about hanging around
Shimada.

53
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:47,224
Does that mean you already knew
about what he was capable of
from the start?

54
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:48,957
No, I... I didn't.

55
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,690
(chuckles) I guess not.

56
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,124
I mean who would be friends
with a mass murderer, right?

57
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,224
[KANA]
What's with the serious look?

58
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,490
[SHINICHI]
She has a special gift.

59
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,357
Maybe I could go ahead
and tell her everything.

60
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,724
No, I shouldn't,

61
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,690
not while Migi's still awake.

62
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,657
[MIGI] Shinichi,
I know what you're thinking.

63
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:11,057
But don't do it.

64
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:13,457
That female is no ally of mine.

65
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:16,324
Nor is she an ally of yours.

66
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:18,057
Your name is Kana, isn't it?

67
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:21,690
Huh? Yeah, yeah that's right!

68
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,624
[SHINICHI] You said that you
have some strange telepathic
ability to sense my presence,

69
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:30,690
but even if you feel like
I'm close by,

70
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,257
you should not try
to approach me.
[KANA] Why not?

71
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:37,057
[SHINICHI] Because you might run
into something else instead.

72
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:40,324
[KANA] What? Like a monster?
[SHINICHI] Yeah.

73
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:41,857
Now why would you say that?

74
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:44,590
I mean, you're a normal human
being, aren't you, Shinichi?

75
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,790
Yeah, of course
I'm a normal human.

76
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,657
Hmm... Well, if my senses do
happen to point me in the
direction of someone,

77
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:52,557
I already know
what it is I need to do.

78
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:55,290
I'll pluck out a hair to see
if they're safe or not.

79
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,024
No, Kana! You cannot do that!
[KANA] (soft gasp)

80
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:00,524
You okay?

81
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:02,657
Ah, I'm sorry.

82
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,990
It's just really dangerous,
you know.

83
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,824
Does that mean
you're worried about me?

84
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:09,757
That makes me kinda happy.

85
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,590
[MIGI] Shinichi...

86
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,357
I need to talk to you.

87
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:18,190
Ah, I have to get going!
I'm really sorry.

88
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,890
See ya.
[KANA] Huh?

89
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:26,490
[KANA] Oh, hello there.

90
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,024
Um, hello.

91
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:31,824
[MIGI] Shinichi, I don't want
you to speak to that
person again.

92
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:33,290
[SHINICHI] I can't do that.

93
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,057
You know if I just
walk away from her,

94
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:37,024
then eventually she's
gonna get into trouble.

95
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,057
Perhaps, but I believe
the way you talk to her

96
00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:42,790
has revealed
more than enough already.

97
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,257
I'll be careful.

98
00:07:44,357 --> 00:07:46,457
[MIGI] I hope so.

99
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,424
I, um... I know it's strange

100
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:50,724
to ask you this out of
the blue, but...

101
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:51,957
[KANA] Ask me what?

102
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:54,057
Do you... think that Shinichi's

103
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:57,124
been acting a little
different lately?

104
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:59,624
I've actually only
met him a few times.

105
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:02,724
I'm not so sure if I would
really be a fair judge.

106
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:06,457
I mean when you first met him
versus right now.

107
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:10,157
Did you two have a fight?

108
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,157
You like him, right?
I can kinda tell.

109
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:15,690
Look, he's just different
somehow, okay?

110
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,957
Not so much when we're talking,
but when...

111
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:20,557
Mm‐hmm...

112
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,024
I... I mean,
he did save my life!

113
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:26,324
He saved your life?!

114
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,657
So you mean you have dreams
like that, too?

115
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:29,990
Huh? Dreams?

116
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,724
Ah! Uh...

117
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,824
I guess I just don't see it.

118
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:38,357
I get the feeling he's been
this way all along, you know?

119
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:42,190
He's got this kind of
intensity about him.

120
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,624
[KANA] Well, if you don't
stop acting so mopey,

121
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:50,824
then you're gonna
lose him for sure.

122
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:56,824
Looks like I might
still have a chance!

123
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:06,690
[MAN]
I'll be back in ten minutes.

124
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,157
Understood, but, uh...

125
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,590
Couldn't you have worn
something a bit more...

126
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,724
normal looking?

127
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,657
It'll just get dirty.

128
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,257
(exhales)

129
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,024
What do you want?

130
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:23,357
How many are inside?

131
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:25,924
Are you kidding me?
You some kinda moron?

132
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,490
Get outta here
before you get hurt.

133
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,824
Ah, of course, you yakuza
are quite aggressive.

134
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:32,590
(grr...)

135
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,357
Okay, Short Shorts,

136
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,890
all these new anti‐gang laws
are cute and all,

137
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,790
but it won't keep you from
getting your ASS BEAT, YOU
UNDERSTAND?! (umphf!)

138
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:49,924
[YAKUZA]
Hey! Who the hell are you?!
[BOTH] (huh?)

139
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:50,990
(thwack)
[YAKUZA] (screams)

140
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,890
We got company!
[ALL] (huh?)

141
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,557
[YAKUZA] (ah!) (nervous sounds)

142
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,590
(grr...)

143
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,690
(hyah!)

144
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:17,824
(ungh!)

145
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:19,157
(umpf!)

146
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:21,090
(aahhh...)

147
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,857
(nervous whimpers)

148
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,624
(urk!)

149
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:28,490
(kyah!) (ungh...)

150
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,490
(gaahhh!)

151
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:38,457
(nervous sounds)

152
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,024
What's wrong?
Let's go.

153
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:45,490
(grr...)

154
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,890
(kyah!)

155
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,790
(umphf)

156
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:53,824
(gasps) (ungh!)

157
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:55,957
[YAKUZA] (hungh!)

158
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:59,190
[MAN] That's one.
[YAKUZA]
Damn you! You're a dead man!

159
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,357
(snap!)
[YAKUZA] (gasps)

160
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:04,390
(aarrgh!)

161
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,790
(waahhh!)

162
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:11,390
Two...

163
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,790
(omphf!)

164
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,090
Heh, gotcha.
[YAKUZA] That's it asshole.

165
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,124
That makes three.

166
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:22,724
What?! This guy's not dead?!
[YAKUZA] Holy shit!

167
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,757
[MAN] They managed three hits.

168
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:26,857
I guess that's about right.

169
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:31,024
What the hell?!
(shwick!)

170
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,124
What's this all about, man?

171
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:34,624
It's an experiment.

172
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:37,657
We wanted to determine exactly
how successful we would be

173
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:39,624
against a group heavily armed
with weapons.

174
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:41,090
[YAKUZA] No, please!

175
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,324
[MAN] My god what the hell
happened over there?

176
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,890
That guy,
his head got bashed in!

177
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,124
I'm pretty sure
I heard some gunshots.

178
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:50,457
Yeah, me too!

179
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:51,290
[ALL] (gasps)

180
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,424
(nervous reactions)

181
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:58,690
Hey, he's getting away!

182
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:06,157
[MAN] Hey, get back here!

183
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,957
What the...

184
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:10,124
Where'd he go?
He was right in front of us.

185
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:11,624
Let's get outta here.

186
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:13,690
I don't want to get in the
middle of some damn gang war.

187
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,990
[MAN] Maybe you're right.
But don't you think we should

188
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,157
at least call the cops
or somethin'?

189
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:20,657
[MAN] Nah, I'm sure
somebody already did.

190
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,790
(gate squeaks)

191
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,557
What is it?

192
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,457
[DRIVER] Nothing. It's just,
you're quite different
from before.

193
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:46,024
[YUKO] Mass murder at
a gang headquarters...

194
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:48,190
It says 22 people
were massacred,

195
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,490
every single
yakuza member there.

196
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,857
That's crazy.

197
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:56,124
It's like it keeps getting worse
out there every single day.

198
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:57,257
Yeah...

199
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:58,857
[SHINICHI] Was that a parasite?

200
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:03,290
No, they wouldn't kill like
that unless they needed
to feed.

201
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,290
The Metropolitan Police
Department has just held an
emergency press conference.

202
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,457
They made the announcement that
they will soon be releasing

203
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:16,190
security camera footage
of a male suspect fleeing
the scene.

204
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:26,590
That may have been a bit much.

205
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,424
It was a very successful
exercise. Very.

206
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:39,394
[SATOMI] Shinichi, hey!

207
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:40,994
I'm glad you're here.
Thanks for coming.

208
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:45,427
Um‐hmm. Thank you for asking me
to come out today, kind sir.

209
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,261
(laughing)

210
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,827
What d'ya wanna do?

211
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:52,661
I dunno, wanna go watch
a movie or something?

212
00:13:52,761 --> 00:13:54,261
Sure!

213
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:06,894
[SATOMI] I don't know about you,

214
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:10,061
but I still have nightmares
about that day sometimes.

215
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:11,494
Even after I know I'm awake,

216
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:14,327
I just can't stop myself
from shaking.

217
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:16,894
Does that ever happen to you,
Shinichi?

218
00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:18,561
Yeah, sometimes.

219
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:22,194
But by the end of the morning,
I'm usually okay.

220
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,627
You're lucky.

221
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:27,494
Unfortunately, my dreams are
always so... disturbing

222
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:30,161
I can't get them out of my head.

223
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:34,794
Well, actually, a friend told
me something one time.

224
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:38,527
He said it helps to think of
people like cows and pigs.

225
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,361
When you look at it that way,
you can kinda see that people

226
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,794
are eating chopped‐up animals
all the time,

227
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:47,194
So it's natural. There's really
nothing for you to be afraid of.

228
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:50,361
That's kinda strange...

229
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:52,527
What kind of person
would say that?

230
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:54,427
Ah... Hmm...

231
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,427
No one like you've ever met.

232
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:59,194
Well, maybe it's
because of this friend...

233
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:00,727
that you've changed so much.

234
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:02,594
No, it's not that...

235
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,027
I don't think so.

236
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:07,227
Look, I'm sorry!
I don't mean anything bad,

237
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:09,661
it's just you're different,
that's all.

238
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:14,961
I never know which Shinichi's
gonna show up.

239
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:16,394
It was that trip.

240
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:19,461
Ever since he got back,
he hasn't been the same.

241
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,927
Um, Shinichi...

242
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:26,527
When your dad got hurt while on
vacation, and then, you went‐
(chair sliding on floor)

243
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,061
(gasps)

244
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,661
Let's get going.

245
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:34,694
I guess I shouldn't have
asked him about it.

246
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,661
(puppy barking)
[SAMOTI] (giggles)

247
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:45,461
[SATOMI] Oh, how cute!

248
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,527
Come here, little guy!
(puppy whining)

249
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,894
(dog panting)

250
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:50,927
(ah!)

251
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:53,961
(dog barking)
[SATMOI] Wha?!

252
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:54,827
(puppy whining)

253
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:56,461
Is that your mama?

254
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:57,594
Must be.

255
00:15:57,694 --> 00:15:59,994
[SATOMI] Maybe they're strays.
(puppy barking)

256
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:02,727
Oh, I guess not.
She has a collar.

257
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,561
[SATOMI] (huh?) Shinichi?

258
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,527
[SHINICHI] What a great day.

259
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:12,227
It's not even that
cold out here.

260
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,927
(ha!)
You sound just like an old man!

261
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:16,561
Old man? Aw, c'mon.

262
00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:19,661
[LITTLE BOY] Mommy! (crying)
[BOTH] (huh?)

263
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:22,294
Hey, Mommy, come back!

264
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:26,461
Wait for me, Mommy! (crying)
[MOM] Hey, come on. Let's go.

265
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:30,827
Come on.
[LITTLE BOY] (crying)

266
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:33,794
Mommy, you're stupid!

267
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,461
You're stupid!
[MOM] (uh!)

268
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,794
Hey, now...
[LITTLE BOY] (louder crying)

269
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:40,361
There's no need to get ugly.

270
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:41,927
[LITTLE BOY] I hate you!

271
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:43,161
I hate you! I hate you!

272
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:46,127
Excuse me?
How can you say that to me?

273
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:48,694
[LITTLE BOY] (continues sobbing)

274
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:50,727
I hope you die, Mommy!

275
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:52,894
(grrr!)

276
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:55,294
[SHINICHI] (gasps) (ungh...)

277
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,594
[LITTLE BOY] (quiet whimpers)

278
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:01,561
(sighs) Come on, let's go.

279
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:04,561
[SHINICHI] (gasping for breath)

280
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:06,161
What's wrong?!

281
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,394
[SHINICHI] A hole...
There's a hole!

282
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,561
A hole?

283
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:12,661
Uh, I, uh...

284
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:15,327
[SATOMI] What's going on?
Are you okay?

285
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:19,294
(deep breath) It was really
hard to breathe all of a sudden.

286
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:21,494
Maybe I am old.

287
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:24,927
Oh, cut it out! Now you're just
being pathetic, grandpa!

288
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,561
(laughs) Okay...

289
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:29,694
[SHINICHI] Sometimes...

290
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:33,061
it's like my body
is being torn apart.

291
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:36,227
But then,
the sensation just goes away.

292
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:41,661
That's when I feel like
a part of Migi really has
merged with me.

293
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:46,394
But... I really do like Murano.

294
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:48,894
I care about her
more than anything.

295
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,894
And there's one thing that
I'm absolutely sure of:

296
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:55,694
That feeling...

297
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:57,994
it comes from MY heart.

298
00:17:58,094 --> 00:17:59,127
When I'm with her,

299
00:17:59,227 --> 00:18:01,761
it makes me wish
Migi would just...

300
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:03,527
stay asleep.

301
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:07,327
Stay asleep... forever.

302
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:20,627
(soft gasp)

303
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:23,661
(sighs)

304
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:29,827
I'll see ya.

305
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:31,427
[SATOMI] (small chuckle)

306
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:37,561
(sighs)

307
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:42,227
[SATOMI] You... you really are
Shinichi Izumi, right?

308
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:51,827
[SATOMI] If only we had...

309
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:55,261
If only we had gotten closer
to each other sooner.

310
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:57,561
If that were the case...

311
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:01,761
I could truly believe
without any doubt in my heart...

312
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:04,794
that you really are Shinichi.

313
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,027
I'm such an idiot.

314
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:16,361
I should've known
from the beginning.

315
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:21,894
But!

316
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:26,694
(phone ringing)

317
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:32,761
[MIGI] Why are you making
the effort to see her?

318
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:35,294
[SHINICHI] She said it's the
last favor she'll ever ask.

319
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:36,994
So how could I ignore her?

320
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,427
[MIGI] I do not really
understand that.

321
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:47,694
[SHINICHI] Guess I got here
a bit too early.

322
00:19:47,794 --> 00:19:49,827
One of my kind is nearby.
[SHINICHI] (ah!)

323
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:53,627
Wait, not just one of them,
but three. No, five.

324
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,794
Well, are there three
or are there five?!

325
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,594
They're over there.

326
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:01,461
[PA]
We, each and every one of us,
must alter our way of thinking.

327
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:04,927
[MIGI] They've noticed us.
[PA] As it now stands,
the topic of global
environmental conservation

328
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:07,694
[MIGI] But they still
haven't made a move.
[PA] is merely viewed
as a fad or pure fashion.

329
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:08,961
Y'know something, Migi?

330
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:12,061
You and I may be the weirdest
crime‐fighting duo ever.

331
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:13,327
[MIGI] Shinichi...

332
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:15,794
They're currently about
sixty meters away.

333
00:20:15,894 --> 00:20:17,294
Eight of them in total.

334
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:18,927
Two are down low...

335
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:20,694
And six are elevated...

336
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:22,427
Still no aggression.

337
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:23,361
(gasps)

338
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:24,594
[PA]
Could you give up your vehicle

339
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:26,727
to prevent just
an ounce of pollution?

340
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:29,194
Completely reversing the course
of our daily lives

341
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,961
is next to impossible.

342
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,627
But if we choose to do nothing,

343
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:34,427
All six up there...
[PA] our entire planet
is in eminent danger.

344
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,694
They're all parasites?
[MIGI] And the two below.

345
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:40,227
[MIGI] At this distance it
would be difficult for them
to identify us,

346
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,227
but they might
if we make eye contact.

347
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,827
[PA] A popular approach is to
use scare tactics to try to
elicit results,

348
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,627
offering a terrifying glimpse
into of a dismal future,

349
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:50,161
threatening that
we're doomed to fail.

350
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:52,061
(gasps) Did he see us?

351
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:54,161
No, no way, not with this crowd.

352
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:55,861
[MIGI] He saw us.
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

353
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:57,427
Your eyes met.

354
00:20:57,527 --> 00:21:00,194
But they don't seem to be very
interested in us at this time.

355
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:02,061
Shinichi, now we've
seen what's going on,

356
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,727
I say we get out of here.
[SHINICHI] Yeah...

357
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:08,894
A parasite running for mayor?

358
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:10,194
What the hell are they up to?

359
00:21:10,294 --> 00:21:12,461
[KANA] Hey, Shinichi!
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

360
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:14,561
[SHINICHI]
What are you doing here?!

361
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:15,761
Uh, yeah, well...

362
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:18,294
I just so happen to live
in this neighborhood.

363
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:20,427
And ya know, I'm the one
who asked you here.

364
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:23,327
Oh, right, of course you did.

365
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:25,594
[PA] But it's right here,
in front of you!

366
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:28,594
It's at the local level and not
with the national bureaucrats

367
00:21:28,694 --> 00:21:30,461
that environmental issues can
start to be addressed...

368
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:32,261
[SHINICHI] This is bad...

369
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:58,661
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"Kokoro"
