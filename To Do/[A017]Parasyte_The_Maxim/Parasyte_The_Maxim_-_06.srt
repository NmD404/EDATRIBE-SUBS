1
00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:07,784
Uh? Ah...

2
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:15,051
Uh...

3
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:58,284
[NOBUKO]
I have punctured
the boy's heart...

4
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,384
Your human host
is now dead.

5
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:04,218
And you will follow
in a matter of minutes.

6
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:09,551
Now you must accept your fate
as one who was unsuccessful
in seizing the head.

7
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:16,018
[MIGI]
There's no time to waste.

8
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:20,318
A direct hit to the heart
is critical and cannot be
repaired very quickly.

9
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:24,984
At this rate, Shinichi's
brain will soon be
rendered inoperable...

10
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:30,918
My only available option
is to merge myself...

11
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,684
with his heart.

12
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:35,418
As I am sealing the wound,

13
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,884
I must initiate heart function

14
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:40,051
while also circulating
the blood within myself.

15
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:41,618
The parasite we just encountered

16
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:45,184
seems to have successfully
relocated to another
host's head,

17
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:47,818
but this is a far
riskier venture.

18
00:02:57,851 --> 00:03:01,751
[Heart beating]

19
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:03,784
Ah...

20
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,318
[Coughing]

21
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:09,418
[Labored breathing]

22
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:13,251
[MIGI]
Good. It seems this
might actually work.

23
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:16,084
But I can't expect an
instantaneous recovery.

24
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:20,784
I'll slowly gather cells from
throughout his body to aid
in the healing process.

25
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:25,218
In the meantime,
I will begin to gradually
return to his right hand

26
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:27,951
through his bloodstream...

27
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:30,184
[SATOMI]
Huh? Shinichi's absent
again today?

28
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:33,951
Yeah... I heard the
teacher tried calling
his house a few times,

29
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:35,918
but no one answered.

30
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:37,684
I'm really worried.

31
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,318
Wanna swing by
there later?
Yeah, sure.

32
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:42,251
Oh, but we don't know
where he lives...

33
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:46,184
I do...
I sorta went home with him
after school the other day.

34
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:47,184
Huh?!

35
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:48,518
[AKIHO]
Hey, Murano!

36
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:50,718
I didn't know you and
Shinichi were a thing.

37
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:51,784
Is it serious?

38
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:54,818
What?! No!
I mean we're not a thing.

39
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,018
Oh yeah, excuse me.

40
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:58,284
You just went home with him
"casually"... Hehe...

41
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:00,018
Akiho, this is none
of your business.

42
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,351
Quit being so nosey,
get your own life alright.

43
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,518
C'mon, I want all
the juicy details!

44
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:06,218
[AKIHO]
What'd you do at his house?
Did you see his bedroom?
So are Shinichi and Murano...

45
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,851
Was it clean or nasty?
really dating?

46
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:09,651
Did you make out or what?
I don't know.
Who cares!

47
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,351
[AKIHO]
C'mon, girl spill it!
Gimme some dirt!

48
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,718
[SATOMI] Could you just drop it!
[YUKO] Seriously.

49
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:26,751
Sugar.

50
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,884
[Faucet squeaks]
[Water running]

00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:09,484
Uhh...

57
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:12,518
Hmm...

58
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,651
Huh?!

59
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:22,018
Hm...

60
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:30,084
[Coughing, vomiting, sighing]

[SHINICHI]
<i>The wound... It's sealed...</i>

63
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:56,451
<i>But it looks like it's been</i>
<i>fused together or something.</i>

64
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,084
<i>Migi?</i>

65
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,718
<i>Did Migi heal me?</i>

[Whimper]

67
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:14,351
Ahh...

68
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:16,784
It wasn't...

69
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:21,551
It wasn't a dream?!

70
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:30,818
[Phone ringing]

71
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,118
Hello?

72
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:35,384
Ah, I'm glad we
finally got you!

73
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:37,584
I'm calling from
Sakurazaki Hospital.

74
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:41,084
Have I reached Mr. Kazuyuki
Izumi's residence?

75
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:42,084
Yes...

76
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:45,084
Ah! My Dad!
That's my Dad!

77
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:47,984
Oh, don't worry.
He's fine.

78
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:50,184
[Sirens outside]
He's getting some rest
at the moment,

79
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,751
but he's in stable condition,
and he's not in any danger.

80
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:55,584
I just wanted to suggest,
when you come to visit,

81
00:06:55,684 --> 00:06:57,318
if you could bring him
a change of clothes

82
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,451
and maybe some‐
[SHINICHI] I'll be right there!

83
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:02,384
Oh...!

84
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,851
Shinichi?

[Closes door and locks it]

86
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,851
Um... You haven't been
to school lately,

87
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,051
so I came to check on you.

88
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:21,018
You mentioned that your
parents were on vacation,

89
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:23,418
so I was worried that maybe
you had gotten sick,

90
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:27,084
and you were just laid up
here all by yourself...

91
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:28,618
Uh...

92
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:33,751
Found out my dad was
in an accident while
they were away.

93
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:34,984
Oh?!

94
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:41,851
Wow... your mom must really
be struggling right now.

95
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:42,984
Uhh...

96
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:44,684
Oh!

97
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:46,351
[Gasp]

98
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:50,818
Look... I won't be back
at school for a while.

99
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:54,284
Uh...

100
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,051

00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,984
You... you will...

103
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:09,951
come back, right?

106

<i>but not before Dad had</i>
<i>the chance to see</i>

107
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:37,351
<i>what that monster</i>
<i>really looks like...</i>

108
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:39,584
<i>in its true form.</i>

109
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:41,784
So then the male...

110
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:44,484
has not yet returned?

111
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:46,484
<i>But how did it</i>
<i>find our address?</i>

112
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:49,484
<i>From their luggage...</i>
<i>or at their hotel?</i>

113
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:51,118
<i>I'm sure it won't be long</i>

114
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:54,418

Are you doing okay?

119
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,284
You uh, you look like you're
kinda worried or something,

120
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:08,751
so I thought I'd see
if you're alright.

121
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:11,151
[SHINICHI]
Are you from Sakurazaki?

122
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,484
Yeah. I am.

123
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:15,384
So, do you know
Sakurazaki Hospital?

124
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:19,118
Oh! Yes.
I know where that is.

125
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:20,618
[DETECTIVE]
So, Mr. Izumi,

126
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:22,484
it was the night of
the 18th, correct?

127
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:25,351
That's when you say
your wife was killed.

128
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:27,084
Yes.

129
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:32,884
Has she...

130
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:35,851
Has my wife's body been
found yet, Detective?

131
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,318
Mr. Izumi...
Hmm?

132
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:40,084
I believe your wife
is very much alive.

133
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:41,384
Huh?

134
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:42,918
[DETECTIVE 2]
On the 18th...

135
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:45,084
that's the day on which you
reportedly struck your head

136
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,518
and fell into the ocean...

137
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:49,518
Your wife returned to the
hotel alone about 9:00 pm.

138
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:50,984
That's impossible!

139
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:52,518
We did confirm...

140
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:54,784
The staff at hotel's front desk
said they spoke with her.

141
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:57,584
[Confused groan]
She told them you had to
leave on urgent business,

142
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:00,151
but that she would stay on
for one more night.

143
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,784
She then checked out
the following morning.

144
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:07,684
No...
That can't be right!

145
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:10,251
It had to be somebody else!

146
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:12,584
Um sir, the hotel
staff confirmed

147
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:15,118
the burn mark located on
the woman's right forearm.

148
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:19,518
They've stated that they're
certain she was the same
person who arrived with you.

[Trembling]
Mr. Izumi...

150
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,518
In my opinion, I believe
that the terrible shock
you've suffered

151
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:28,584
is causing you to confuse
reality from before your
traumatic accident

152
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:31,551
with perhaps a nightmare
you had afterwards.

153
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:35,284
No way...
That was not a dream!

154
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,751
[Heart beat]

155
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:39,651

00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,118
Ugh... Uh...

It seems that something has
happened to your mother...

178
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:40,818
and well, we don't know
where she is.

179
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:42,118
Huh?

180
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:44,018
But, Dad...

181
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:46,318
You saw it!

182
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:47,251
Saw what?

183
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:48,918
What do you mean?

184
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:51,984
Well... The doctor says
that I'm confused...

185
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:55,351
Like, looks like I hit
my head pretty hard, Son.

186
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:59,684
<i>But Dad... No...</i>

187
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:02,884
I've asked the police to keep up
their search for her...

188
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:05,351
The doctor wants me to stay
here for a while longer,

189
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:07,618
but it's nothing serious.
So please don't worry.

190
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:09,618
[SHINICHI]
"Don't worry"?

191
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:11,751
How can you even say that?!

192
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:15,851
Shinichi, did something
happen back home?

193
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,351
What? Well of course
something happened!

194
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,918
Mom has been murdered
by some monster!

195
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:22,918
Dad, you know that!

196
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:29,718
Is that what I told you?

197
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:33,318
I told you all that nonsense...
on the phone?

198
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,151
Ugh... I'm sorry!

199
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:37,051
I'm so sorry! I was losing it!

200
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:40,918
<i>What? Does he really think</i>
<i>it's all in his head?</i>

201
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:44,984
Son, I'm going to recover
and be just fine.

202
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:47,918
I want you to try and
take it easy for a few days,

203
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,718
and go back home.

204
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:52,084
I know it's tough, but hang in
there just a little bit longer.

205
00:12:52,184 --> 00:12:55,451
If you have any problems,
then you can always go
to your uncle's house‐

206
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,951
Dad. I need to
tell you something.

207
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,018
Hmm?

208
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:00,451
It's about Mom
and the monster‐

209
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,118
Shinichi!
Uh...

210
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:06,351
Please. Not right now...

211
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,318
<i>Dad...</i>

212
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:10,384
<i>He's crying...</i>

213
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:12,451
<i>He knows, doesn't he?</i>

214
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,784
<i>He knows that Mom is dead.</i>

215
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:17,151
<i>I want to tell him the truth</i>

216
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:19,351
<i>about what that</i>
<i>monster really is...</i>

217
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:22,551
<i>About the creature</i>
<i>that killed her.</i>

218
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:25,851
<i>If only Migi...</i>

219
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:29,584
<i>If only Migi was actually</i>
<i>an ally of humanity.</i>

220
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,351
Here, I brought
you some clothes.

221
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:37,251
So where are you going
to stay, Shinichi?

222
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,818
Here with you.

223
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,784
C'mon you know you can't get
a good night's rest in here.

224
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:44,818
They told me about a hotel
that's right by the beach.

225
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:47,418
That's where you
should be staying.

226
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,384
<i>I'm at a hospital...</i>

227
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,284
<i>and Migi's asleep...</i>

228
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:58,484
<i>This could be my chance</i>
<i>to get him looked at!</i>

229
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:00,918
<i>No, now's not the time.</i>

230
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:03,784
<i>I need his abilities to find</i>
<i>the enemy.</i>

231
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,551
<i>And fight them.</i>

232
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:07,084
<i>I hate to admit it, but...</i>

233
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:10,984
<i>I have no choice but to</i>
<i>trust Migi and rely on him.</i>

234
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,951
Huh?!
The Sakurazaki Hotel,

235
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:16,384
is that far away
from here?

236
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:18,251
Um, no, not far at all.

237
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:21,718
In fact, it's just a few
blocks away from here.

238
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:24,784
<i>A few blocks...</i>

239
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:28,218
<i>That's at the edge of Migi's</i>
<i>ability to detect our enemies.</i>

240
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:30,318
<i>If that thing shows up</i>
<i>at the hospital,</i>

241
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:33,318
<i>we might not be able</i>
<i>to make it in time.</i>

242
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:41,584
<i>This is perfect.</i>

243
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:44,784
<i>Right behind the hospital.</i>

244
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,184
Hello, excuse me.

245
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:47,318
[Footsteps]

246
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:48,551
Uh...

247
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:51,318
I guess, you'll be
needing a room?

248
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,284
[SHINICHI]
It's you!

249
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:54,484
Hehe...

250
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:57,751
Hey, Mom! We have a
guest checking in!

251
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:03,918
<i>Dad must've seen it...</i>

252
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:07,018
<i>He saw Mom get killed.</i>

253
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:09,651
At some point,

254
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:13,051
I'm going to have to tell him
everything I know.

255
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,651
But for now...

256
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:17,618
I just have to keep him alive...

257
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:20,851
<i>and avenge Mom's death.</i>

258
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:26,351
[Footsteps]

259
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:30,351
Excuse me... your dinner's
ready for you downstairs.

260
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:31,518
Get it while it's hot!

261
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:32,851
[SHINICHI]
Thanks.

262
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:34,384
Hm‐hm.

263
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:38,851
<i>I could totally tell</i>
<i>that she was coming.</i>

264
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,484
<i>Are the walls that thin,</i>

265
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:43,684
<i>or has my hearing</i>
<i>somehow improved?</i>

266
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:48,851
[MIGI]
Shinichi.

267
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,384
I thought I might
keep this to myself,

268
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,218
but I've decided to tell you.

269
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,684
It's very important.

270
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:59,051
The feelings you have
for your family are
incredibly strong...

271
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:03,618
However, your feelings
for me are practically
nonexistent...

272
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:08,018
Actually, I know you
think of me as more of
a hinderance at best.

273
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:09,818
And while we do act as allies,

274
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:12,284
one could say that
we are really enemies

275
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:14,451
forced into a
difficult situation.

276
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:16,284
Yeah, so what's
your point?

277
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:20,451
You see, during the time
that I was repairing
your damaged body,

278
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:23,251
it would seem that my body
underwent a change as well.

279
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:24,984
A change?

280
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,451
That's correct.

281
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:32,118
I have now developed a weakness
that others of my kind have
never experienced.

282
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:34,784
Every day now,
for about four hours,

283
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:37,618
I fall completely and
totally asleep.

284
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:41,018
That's it? But you've
always gone to sleep.

285
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:42,284
Not like this...

286
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:44,384
Previously, even the
slightest disturbance

287
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:45,818
would awaken me immediately.

288
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:47,718
For instance,
if you were surprised,

289
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:49,784
or if your breathing was uneven.

290
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:50,984
Or if...

291
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:54,384
one of my associates
approached within 300 meters.

292
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:56,084
"Associates"?

293
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,284
Correct...

294
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:58,984
But since this change
has occurred,

295
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,818
it appears that while asleep,
I am able to detect nothing.

296
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:05,784
So, if an enemy were
to appear during that
four‐hour sleep cycle...

297
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:07,218
it would mean...

298
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,184
the end for both of us.

299
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:10,884
Oh...

300
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,318
Repairing your heart

301
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:14,484
meant that I had to spend
an extended period of time

302
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,451
detached from your arm.

303
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:20,751
And as a result, my physiology
has been slightly altered.

304
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:24,184
Why would you wait so long
to tell me about this?!

305
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,351
Well, ever since one
of my fellow parasites

306
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:27,918
killed your mother,

307
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:31,751
you have been harboring a great
deal of hostility toward me.

308
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,918
You must realize that revealing
one's weakness to an enemy

309
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:36,351
is extremely dangerous,

310
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:38,684
so that's why I said
nothing until now.

311
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:42,751
However, I determined that
if you weren't made aware
of this problem...

312
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:46,318
the situation would become even
more dangerous for us both...

313
00:17:46,418 --> 00:17:48,618
Do you understand?

314
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:56,418
Yes, I do...
But I don't really
think of you

315
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:59,018
as an enemy
anymore, Migi.

316
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:02,351
You did save
my life, you know.

317
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:05,684
That's not entirely
accurate, of course...

318
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:09,351
Since there was my life
to consider as well.

319
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:13,684
[MAKIKO]
Morning!

320
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:17,084
Oh... good morning.

321
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:20,884
Oh, hey... There's more
color in your cheeks...

322
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:24,351
Yesterday you were looking
kinda ragged, ya' know.

323
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:25,818
Hmm...

324
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:27,884
So I guess you
slept well, then.

325
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:29,518
Hehe...
Hehe...

326
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,784
[IZUMI]
Oh, thanks.

327
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,418
It's been a while since you were
able to read the paper, huh?

328
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,918
It has. When I fell
into the water...

329
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:44,684
my tablet and my cell phone
were both completely destroyed.

330
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:47,551
Then we'll have to get
you new ones when
you get home.

331
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:50,751
Uh‐huh...
When're you uh...?

332
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:53,918
I'm gonna stay a bit longer
and see how things go, okay?

333
00:18:58,184 --> 00:19:00,584
<i>Whenever Migi is</i>
<i>in a deep sleep...</i>

334
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:03,284
<i>I'll have to use my</i>

335
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:06,918
<i>I'll try to have Migi</i>
<i>sleep during the day</i>

00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:38,118
Have you been sitting
out here all this time?

349
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,318
I guess you must be really
worried about your father, huh?

350
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:42,918
Um... Well, yeah...

351
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:45,651
And I don't really
have much else to do.

352
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,718
Ah...

353
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:49,951
Um, do you have
a girlfriend?

354
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,084
Huh?

355
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:53,751
[MIGI]
Shinichi. I sense one.

356
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:54,718
Huh...

357
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,618
It's just about
300 meters away,

358
00:19:56,718 --> 00:19:58,351
in the direction
of the beach.

359
00:19:58,451 --> 00:19:59,784
<i>It's here!</i>

360
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:02,584
Hey Maki, which way is it
to get to the beach?

361
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:03,618
Huh?

362
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:05,118
If you head straight
down the road

363
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:06,851
back to my place and‐

364
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:08,184
Huh...

365
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:09,551
Wait, hold on!

366
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:11,751
If you just go straight,
you'll hit the seawall!

367
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:12,984
Stop!

368
00:20:14,318 --> 00:20:15,851
Hold on!

369
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,684
[Panting]

370
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,918
[Panting]
Hey!

371
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,584
He's so fast!

372
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:28,218
[MIGHI]
Shinichi.
I need to confirm.

373
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:29,318
[SHINICHI]
Yeah, what?!

374
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:31,584
Is it all right
to kill her?

375
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,918
[Heavy breathing]

376
00:20:37,884 --> 00:20:43,051
Yes! Something like that
cannot be allowed to
roam free in this world...

377
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,451
I cannot allow it!

378
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:49,118
[Makiko panting]

379
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:50,418
Ahh...

380
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,418
You just took off
before I got the chance

381
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,851
to finish telling you
exactly how to get there.

382
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:56,318
To get down to the beach,

383
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,551
you're gonna have to circle
around the west side‐

384
00:20:58,651 --> 00:20:59,651
Huh?

385
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:03,218
Whoa!

386
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:04,618
<i>Huh? I just saw it</i>

387
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:06,951
<i>down at the far end</i>
<i>of the bridge.</i>

388
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:09,818
<i>This is it!</i>

389
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:14,618
Shinichi, I have
something else
I need to tell you.

390
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,984
And it's something
about you.

391
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:19,184
It has finally become clear
to me that you have‐

392
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:21,384
Just save it!

393
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:22,718
<i>You're not getting away!</i>

394
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:23,684
<i>You will pay...</i>

395
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,951
<i>for what you did to my mother!</i>

396
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,384
[Grunt]

397
00:21:30,218 --> 00:21:32,418
You're dead!

398
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:57,818
[SHINICHI]
