1
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:10,686
(gasps)

2
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:21,186
(gasps)

3
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,153
Mitsuo?

4
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:25,120
[MITSUO] What's his problem?

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,720
Ah...

6
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:29,420
(grr...)

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,186
Hey, don't!
[MITSUO] Shut up!

8
00:00:31,286 --> 00:00:34,953
If I wanna fight this jackass,
it's none of your damn business.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,020
Shimada?

10
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:51,686
Huh? (ack!)

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,453
[SHIMADA] I went easy on you
this time because I'd prefer
to avoid trouble.

12
00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:02,620
However, if you decide to
show up again and pick a fight
with me for no reason...

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,086
I'll end you.

14
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:16,453
(gasps)

15
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:21,886
(huh?)

16
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,053
(gasps) Yes!

17
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,320
[SATOMI] Shinichi?
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

18
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:14,886
You... are Shinichi Izumi,
aren't you?

19
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,486
[SHINICHI] Huh?

20
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:18,720
I, uh...

21
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,253
Oh, sorry!
My mistake, I'm sorry.

22
00:03:21,353 --> 00:03:24,120
Uh! What?! Yeah, that's me!

23
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,286
Who... who're you?

24
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:28,986
I'm Satomi? Satomi Murano?

25
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:32,253
We both took our entrance exams
in the same room.

26
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,753
Oh, sorry, that's right!

27
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:37,953
I was so nervous that day
I didn't notice anything else.

28
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,420
Well, I'll see you
in April then.

29
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,686
Maybe we'll be in
the same class!

30
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:47,886
Yeah, maybe so.

31
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:53,886
(footsteps)

32
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,653
(huh?)

33
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,720
[SHIMADA] His parasite's
"signal" is weak again.

34
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,120
I wonder why?
Is it sleeping?

35
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,653
Perhaps if I emit
a signal of my own,

36
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,453
it should respond reflexively.

37
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:19,320
Especially, to murderous intent!

38
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,920
(sudden flight of birds)

39
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:31,120
Interesting...

40
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,753
[AKIHO] Mm, mm, mm, that Hide.
He's kinduv a hottie, huh?
[YUKO] (huh?)

41
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:36,586
[YUKO]
Oh! I, uh, don't really, um‐

42
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,553
Oh, c'mon,
don't even try to hide it.

43
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,520
I know you drew his face
in your sketchbook, Yuko.
[YUKO] (ah!)

44
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,153
Akiho, that is mine!
[AKIHO] (ah!)

45
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:46,320
I mean,
he's super cool, isn't he?

46
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,553
I think we have a new
hottest guy in school.

47
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,253
I bet he's a model.
Do you think he's a model?

48
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:53,153
S'like he's not real.
Like he's fake or something.
[YUKO] (huh)

49
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:54,653
Oh, Yuko, do me a favor.

50
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,853
Draw a picture of him
for me, too.

51
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:59,720
Ha! Thanks! (giggles)

52
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,453
[YUKO] "Fake"?

53
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:10,520
Why? What do you mean
I can't tell anyone?

54
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,620
In this situation, our greatest
fear is that we would cause
wide‐spread panic

55
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,520
due to a lack of
credible information.

56
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,420
When people stop
trusting one another,

57
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,153
it inevitably leads to
discrimination and fear.

58
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:25,920
And soon after that...
misinformation and
mass hysteria will follow.

59
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,253
That's my son, Shinichi.

60
00:05:30,353 --> 00:05:33,086
Uh, hello there. How are you?

61
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:42,086
[GOV MAN]
In any case, we still have no
way to distinguish them from us.

62
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:47,420
And given that, there's simply
nothing to be gained by going
public at this time.

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,020
We are truly sorry about
the loss of your wife.

64
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,686
Nevertheless, to be blunt
about the current state
of things,

65
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,886
this is a problematic situation
of having a few thousand

66
00:05:56,986 --> 00:06:01,353
violently dangerous killers
roaming around the country.

67
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,553
[AIDE] Please, take a look.

68
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,753
Yes... That's exactly what
the thing looked like.

69
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:22,686
So, it's able to morph into
just about anything it wants.

70
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,086
[TAMURA] It seems the rumors
have become widespread.

71
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:30,653
[HIROKAWA] It appears so.

72
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:33,220
[TAMURA] That outcome could have
easily been foreseen.

73
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,153
But if we continue this practice
of preying on them like
mindless insects,

74
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:42,786
we will all eventually be hunted
down and completely wiped out.

75
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:47,420
Our species is truly weak...
Our imperfections are troubling.

76
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,320
[HIROKAWA] It's hardly
surprising that you would have

77
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,453
pondered over and
worried about such things.

78
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:55,286
[TAMURA]
I only have one question.

79
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:57,553
I want to find out
the real reason.

80
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:00,986
Why is it we parasites
even exist?

81
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,986
[HIROKAWA] The answer to
that is quite simple.

82
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:06,686
The human race has now become
toxic to the planet Earth,

83
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:10,720
which has created
a need for balance.

84
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,853
So what you're saying is
this thing I'm currently
nurturing within me

85
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:17,653
is a poison?

86
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,786
(door opening)

87
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:23,720
So I guess they left, huh, Dad?

88
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:28,020
"Mass hysteria..."
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

89
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:32,886
[IZUMI]
I need to tell you... the truth.

90
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,486
It's about...

91
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:39,753
It's about your mother, Son.

92
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,453
[SHINICHI] I sat there quietly
and listened.

93
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,153
I nodded as my father spoke.

94
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:50,653
And told him nothing
about what I knew.

95
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:53,920
Then, finally...

96
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,420
Dad told me outright
for the very first time.

97
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,386
That Mom...

98
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,420
was dead.

99
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,853
We've asked Professor Bigg
Mouth for his opinion on
when to brush your teeth.

100
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:09,453
Morning or at night!
(audience laughter)

101
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:11,853
Professor Bigg Mouth,
please stop that!
(beep)

102
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:16,786
Aww, he's asleep again!

103
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,386
Hmm?

104
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,786
What is this?
That's just nasty.

105
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,486
(huh?) Ah! Gimme that!

106
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,020
It's part of an investigation.

107
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,720
Oh, is that what your suspect
looks like this time?

108
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,620
[HARUKI] How could THIS possibly
be a suspect? It's a monster!

109
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,986
Anyway, what's going on, Yuko?
Do you need something?

110
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:39,920
Yeah...

111
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,853
Could you take a look at
something for me?

112
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:48,253
This your friend?
That's pretty nice work.

113
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:50,486
You're getting better
and better at this.

114
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:53,886
[YUKO]
So, do you sense anything?
[HARUKI] (hmm...)

115
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:57,120
Like, his personality or
like his attitude?

116
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,653
Since you draw faces
for a living,

117
00:08:58,753 --> 00:09:01,186
I just thought maybe you
could tell me about him.

118
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:02,820
Come on, Yuko.

119
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,186
It doesn't really
work like that, y'know.

120
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:07,786
Oh, 'kay.

121
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,320
(baseball game sounds)

122
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:19,653
(gasps)

123
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:26,053
He's alone again today.
Is he waiting for someone?

124
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:28,253
Or maybe he's
watching someone...

125
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,953
(bat hitting ball)
[PLAYER] Hey! Look out!

126
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,653
(gasps)

127
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:39,886
[PLAYER] Hey, buddy!

128
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,686
Dude, are you all right?

129
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:45,553
Yes.

130
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:52,220
(whimpers)

131
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,653
I... I don't believe what I...
what I just saw.

132
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:04,204
Man, I really have to patch
things up with Murano today.

133
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:16,704
Murano!

134
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:19,404
[SHINICHI]
About the other day,

135
00:10:19,504 --> 00:10:22,337
that was...
that was nothing serious.

136
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,737
That girl was just...

137
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:27,404
she was... making fun of me.

138
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,504
So, I mean... (huh?)
[MIGI] Shinichi...

139
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:33,104
[SHINICHI] Jesus, Migi.
Now's not the time!
[SATOMI] Uh...

140
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:38,937
[MIGI] I sense Hideo Shimada
projecting murderous intent.

141
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:43,404
I believe I made myself clear,
but if you insist.

142
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:46,037
I'm sure that you'll agree,

143
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:48,870
we should find somewhere away
from prying eyes.

144
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,304
[MIGI]
He has four to six targets.

145
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:53,004
Most likely all human.

146
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:57,104
The probability that this
will turn into a massacre
is quite high.

147
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:58,937
Shinichi?

148
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:02,304
[MIGI] If you wish to intervene,
I can give you their location.

149
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:03,704
What would you like to do?

150
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:06,270
[SHINICHI]
What choice do I have?
[SATOMI] (gasps)

151
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:09,004
Shinichi?!

152
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:18,404
[THUG] Man, I don't think
I've ever met a guy so eager
to get pounded.

153
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:22,337
Hmpf! Maybe he doesn't really
understand how much trouble
he's actually in here.

154
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:25,037
Listen up, nobody touches him.
I'M takin' him down.

155
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:28,270
It's okay.
You can all attack together.

156
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,870
[ALL] (huh?)

157
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:35,637
[SHIMADA] I'm afraid a
distraction is on his way here.

158
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,170
If you want to do this,
do it now.
(running footsteps)

159
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,804
They're right over there.

160
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,604
(umphf)
[BOTH] (huh?)

161
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:49,937
This guy again?!

162
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:51,904
[SHIMADA]
He just jumped three meters.

163
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:55,204
Is his parasite empowering him?
That doesn't make sense.

164
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:59,737
So, Shimada! It looks like
you've finally shown
what you really are!

165
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:01,070
Let me guess...

166
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,804
This means that you
want to fight me then.

167
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:07,737
Look, I didn't ask to be
involved with any of this.

168
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:10,470
Turns out, I'm the victim here.

169
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,137
Aren't I?

170
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:15,737
[SHINICHI] You should go.

171
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:18,670
I'll take care of things
around here.

172
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,837
[SHIMADA] Oh? Well,
I'll leave it to you then.

173
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:26,370
(urk)

174
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,970
[THUGS] (huh?)

175
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,237
[MITSUO] You frickin' serious?

176
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:32,637
You're just gonna run away?

177
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:35,370
(hmph) Well now,
aren't you the big hero?

178
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,304
Pretty nice of you to get your
ass kicked for you buddy!

179
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,937
My "buddy"?

180
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:45,670
You idiots have no idea
what you're getting into.

181
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,870
So, why don't you just go home?

182
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,737
And don't ever
go after that guy again.

183
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,737
I'm talkin' to you.

184
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:59,104
[SHINICHI] You are the leader of
all these guys, aren't you?

185
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:01,070
[THUGS] (huh?)

186
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,104
[MITSUO] What the...
How did he know that?

187
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:06,970
There's no way he's
ever met Yano before.

188
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:20,237
Heh, what'cha looking at,
pretty boy? (hyah!)

189
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:24,570
(huh?! aahh...)

190
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,304
[SHINICHI]
Morons without a clue shouldn't
be mouthing off like that.

191
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:32,637
If they won't listen to reason,
then I'll have to try
something else.

192
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,437
(ungh...)

193
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:37,337
[YANO] Let's go!

194
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:40,770
Uh, Yano?
Hey, dude, where ya going?

195
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,637
He'd kill me.
If we fought, he'd kill me.

196
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:48,904
(grr...)

197
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,170
(footsteps)

198
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,104
Murano...

199
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:03,837
[SATOMI] Here.

200
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:07,604
Thank you.

201
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,104
(waahhh!)

202
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:13,704
What is it?

203
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:17,337
I was curious about what
happened to those males.

204
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:19,737
That doesn't concern
you anymore.

205
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:21,704
Did you use your new friend?

206
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:24,670
I imagine you beat them all
senseless, didn't you?

207
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,937
(soft gasp)

208
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:27,970
[SHINICHI] I did no such thing!

209
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,704
Look! Just go!

210
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,870
(grr...)

211
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:40,237
[SATOMI] Ow!

212
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,137
[SHINICHI] Oh! Sorry!

213
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:46,637
[SATOMI] Um, did something
happen between you and Shimada?

214
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:48,704
Can't stand that smug bastard!

215
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,570
He tries to act like
he's all harmless,

216
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,370
but he is full of shit!

217
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,304
[SATOMI] Shinichi...

218
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:57,237
You're acting different again.

219
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:00,870
And you've never been the type
of person to talk like that.

220
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:03,770
It's just not right.

221
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,370
"Not right"? What d'you mean?

222
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,837
[SATOMI] Well, it's like...

223
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:12,870
The Shinichi I know just isn't
this kind of person.

224
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,170
When you act like this,
it feels like you're forcing it.

225
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,470
Yeah, well, I'm not, okay?

226
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,937
Either way, you're a completely
different person than
the one I knew.

227
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:28,870
You have changed.

228
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,270
I guess that maybe I have.

229
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,870
But still, I'm not forcing it.

230
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,770
So who is it
you're trying to be?

231
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,937
You just snap your fingers
and change who you are?!

232
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:43,204
Are you...

233
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:44,637
Are you still...

234
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,670
Shinichi?

235
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,637
SHUT UP! (echoes)

236
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:55,270
Fine then...
I liked you better before.

237
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,804
(running water)

238
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:09,304
It's because of the hole
in my chest, isn't it?

239
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:12,304
[MIGI] Or the hole in your back,
depending on your perspective.

240
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,537
In my opinion, however,
you've actually grown
stronger as a life form,

241
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:18,970
if not so as a person.

242
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,070
You're able to maintain
your composure.

243
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,937
You recover quickly
from sways in mood,

244
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:25,104
and your thoughts
are quite logical.

245
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:29,037
When viewed by others, it's no
wonder they would perceive
that you've changed.

246
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,637
Migi, you don't even know
what you're talking about.

247
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:36,904
[MIGI] In any case, this mental
resilience is a definite
plus for you.

248
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:39,770
Is this supposed to be
your attempt at trying
to cheer me up?

249
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,970
[MIGI] Perhaps.
But if need be,

250
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,104
I will consider alternative
ways to improve your psyche.

251
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,870
[SHINICHI]
Well, how very nice of you.

252
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:53,137
I know what I saw...

253
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,370
It was real.

254
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,704
(gasps) He changed clothes.

255
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:16,170
Where's he going?

256
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,704
(whimpers)

257
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:46,604
Oh, my God, his face...

258
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,170
[YUKO] How can he do that?

259
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,604
He can turn into someone else?

260
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:59,337
That's impossible!

261
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:00,937
That's like...

262
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,304
(gasps)

263
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:05,604
No... It can't be!

264
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:09,104
(audience laughter)
(door opening)

265
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,770
[YUKO] I'm home.

266
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,437
Oh, hey there, Yuko.

267
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:14,637
Are you still in
your school clothes?

268
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,904
I need to ask you something.

269
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:24,670
[HARUKI] The truth is,
we don't have a clue what
these things really are.

270
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,370
Some of the theories are that
they could be aliens,

271
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,304
or mutants, or even bio‐weapons.

272
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:32,337
But there's one thing you do
know for sure, right?

273
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:34,637
That they can
change their faces.

274
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:37,137
[HARUKI] Yeah, that's what
the witnesses all say.

275
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:39,037
Also, these things can
speak our language,

276
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:42,437
and they kill people for food.
[YUKO] (gasps)

277
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:46,170
Do me a favor, be extra
careful if you're out
walking at night.

278
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,037
Now granted, their numbers are
relatively low compared to
the whole human race,

279
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:52,937
so it's pretty doubtful
you'll even run into one,
but, y'know.

280
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:57,437
Yeah, I guess so.
(nervous chuckle)

281
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:02,170
[HARUKI] (sighs)
If only we could just catch
one of these things alive.

282
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,204
[YUKO] Killing people for food?

283
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:07,337
Is that what Shimada's doing?

284
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,904
I should tell my brother.

285
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:13,604
But what if it turns out
I'm wrong about him?

286
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,504
Okay...

287
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:20,004
I'll just have to ask you
myself, Shimada.

288
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:40,437
Hmm...

289
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:43,270
These aren't gonna work.
(sighs)

290
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:48,037
Perfect!

291
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:02,193
[SHIMADA] So, what did you
want to talk to me about?

292
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:04,559
[YUKO] I'm not sure
if you know who I am,

293
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:08,693
but I've kinda had my eye on you
since you got here.

294
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:10,493
I watch you all the time.

295
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:13,593
And that's how, well...

296
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:15,759
I saw you.

297
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:21,559
[YUKO] Now I don't wanna believe
you're from another world
or anything,

298
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:24,793
but there are some
crazy rumors out there.

299
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:27,226
If you really, do, um...

300
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,926
kill people... and...
and eat them...

301
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:32,659
Yuko...

302
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,159
[YUKO] If... If you do...

303
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,493
then I'm asking you to go away.

304
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:38,826
And don't ever...

305
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:40,626
come back here again.

306
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:43,459
I... I mean it!

307
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,659
I don't want anyone else
to get hurt!

308
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,826
Have you told anyone else
about this?

309
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:52,459
Tell me!

310
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,159
Do you really do all those
horrible things to people,
Shimada?

311
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:03,559
[TEACHER] So you see, modern
and classical Japanese are
actually quite different.

312
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:07,126
You have to learn the rhythm
of the verbs in order to...
[MIGI] Shinichi...

313
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:10,526
Not good...

314
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:13,326
Not at all.

315
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,993
(gasps)

316
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:16,426
No...

317
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,326
Shimada!

318
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:19,726
No...

319
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:25,859
(terrifed whimpering)

320
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,359
[SHINICHI] THAT SON OF A BITCH!

321
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:58,459
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"What Mad Universe"
