00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,978
[SHINICHI] <i>That look on</i>
<i>her face...</i>

2
00:00:09,578 --> 00:00:11,111
<i>I hate her.</i>

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,578
<i>I hate everything about her!</i>

4
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:15,745
<i>She doesn't deserve to...</i>

5
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:17,478
[MIGI]
Shinichi, calm down.

6
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:18,778
We'd be in trouble
if we had to fight

7
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:20,611
while your breathing
was this irregular.

8
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:22,311
I know.

9
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:24,778
[TAMURA]
There's so much I'd hoped to
discuss with the two of you,

10
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:27,378
but I can feel a strong
sense of imminent threat...

11
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:30,878
so I'll have to make this a
bit shorter than I'd planned.

12
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:33,578
I've killed at least
38 people so far.

13
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:34,745
Uh...

14
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:36,645
Most of which
were for food...

15
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:41,745
But to tell you the truth,
I'd say that figure is
quite low among my kind.

16
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:47,045
I was able to sustain
myself with the same food
humans normally eat.

17
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:51,078
What I've found is that
consuming humans is
completely unnecessary

18
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:53,478
in order for my kind
to survive.

19
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:57,278
I've done a fair amount
of study on your species...

20
00:00:57,378 --> 00:01:01,078
Searching to find exactly what
we parasites are to you...

21
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,945
and, in turn, what you
are you to us.

22
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:07,711
The conclusion I reached is
that we are two halves...

23
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:09,978
of the same whole...

24
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:13,645
Parasites and humanity
are of one family...

25
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:16,511
We are the
children of mankind.

26
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:17,945
Huh? What was that?!

27
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,778
What kind of bullshit
are you talking about?

28
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:23,911
Of course, given your
human emotions,

29
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:26,445
I'm sure this is hard
to grasp...

30
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,711
But...

31
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,845
We are actually quite frail.

32
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:34,645
We're nothing more than
a life form that isn't
able to survive on its own.

33
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:38,378
So, please...
Don't be too hard on us.

34
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,411
You've got to be
kidding me.
Go to Hell.

35
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,378
[MIGI]
Hmm...
Hm?

36
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,745
Interesting...

37
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:47,645
[TAMURA]
You two are extremely
rare beings...

38
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:49,845
and that's exactly why
I wanted the chance

39
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:51,478
to share my thoughts
with you...

40
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,745
And also to give you an
important word of advice.

41
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:56,578
It's in regards to Goto,

42
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:58,711
the man who's been
pursuing you as of late.

43
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:01,078
You should avoid doing
battle with him.

44
00:02:01,178 --> 00:02:05,845
If you had started facing
off against Goto first
rather than Miki,

45
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:08,778
I'm quite certain
you'd be dead already.

46
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,878
[MIGI]
Probably so.
Huh?

47
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:13,245
[TAMURA]
He is one of the most
"frail" among us ‐

48
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:16,811
a being I created through
experimentation...

49
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:18,411
But he's invincible.

50
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:21,578
You do know you
just contradicted
yourself, right?

51
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:22,778
Hehe...

52
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,878
Hahaha...

53
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:29,178
<i>She's laughing.</i>

54
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:31,711
[Footsteps]

55
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:35,178
And then there's
the Mayor, Hirokawa...

[HIRAMA]
<i>Shinichi Izumi?</i>

57
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:42,311
[SHINICHI]
<i>I'm pretty sure that's</i>
<i>Detective Hirama...</i>

58
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:45,445
<i>That means, all these guys...</i>
<i>must be cops.</i>

59
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:50,711
[HIRAMA]
<i>At first glance it all</i>
<i>looks so normal ‐</i>

60
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:52,645
<i>a mother holding a baby...</i>

61
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:55,945
<i>and a young high school</i>
<i>kid in the park.</i>

62
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,145
<i>But one is a known parasite.</i>

63
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,911
<i>And the other found the</i>
<i>body of his own friend</i>

64
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,978
<i>murdered by a parasite.</i>

65
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:05,111
<i>And here they are, together.</i>

66
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:07,345
<i>Right after another murder.</i>

67
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:09,978
<i>What is this?</i>

68
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:12,711
<i>What in the hell</i>
<i>are you two up to?</i>

69
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:14,778
<i>Shinichi Izumi...</i>

70
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,311
<i>There's a lot more to you</i>
<i>than you're letting on.</i>

71
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:58,728
[KURAMORI]
<i>And there's some blood...</i>

72
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:02,128
<i>my blood got on</i>
<i>the baby's clothes.</i>

73
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:10,395
Stay back! Hold on.
Hold your position!

74
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:12,895
Now then.

75
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:15,628
You're Reiko Tamura?
Correct?

76
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:16,728
Excuse me?

77
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:18,628
And you just killed a man.

78
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:20,228
His name was Kuramori!

79
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:22,295
Oh! Uh...

80
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:23,928
What is this?

81
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:27,328
Then I'll have to ask
the other one.

82
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,295
Ikeda!

83
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,495
Hm?

84
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,528
What the hell are
you doing here?

85
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:33,395
You and I have met before.

86
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:35,728
You do remember me,
don't you?

87
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:38,595
So if you're the same
person that I met,

88
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,662
then you should be able
to say my name.

89
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:42,628
So tell me, who am I, Ikeda?

90
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:48,495
Well I uh...
It sounds like you forgot
my name, Mr. Hirama.

91
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:49,695
Hehe...

92
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:53,228
Okay that one would
seem to be human.

93
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:57,862
Well. You appear to
be quite calm and
collected, Ms. Tamura.

94
00:05:57,962 --> 00:06:01,495
I do believe you've mistaken
me for someone else.

95
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,528
From this short of a distance...

96
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:07,062
I feel quite confident
that I would not miss.

97
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:12,862
[Tamura acting scared]
Is this some sort
of sick joke?!

98
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,562
You people are crazy!
Leave me alone!

99
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:17,828
I'd be deeply sorry
if I were wrong...

100
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:20,095
but I'm afraid I'm
out of options now...

101
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:23,362
and I can't risk
getting any closer.

102
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:24,762
Now you listen to me!

103
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:28,162
I am accountable for
whatever happens here...

104
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,162
It's on me!

105
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,495
Don't do this!

106
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:31,795
I don't know what
your talking about!

107
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:33,528

She must have something
up her sleeve.

Something's wrong here.

151
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:00,362
I've been thinking...

152
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:02,362
for a long time...

153
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:03,862
About why...

154
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:09,028
Why was I even brought to
this world in the first place?

155
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:11,628
As soon as I would
resolve one question...

156
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:14,862
another one would
inevitably take its place.

157
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:17,228
I've sought the beginning...

158
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:19,795
And I've sought the end.

159
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:22,595
I've walked alone for so long...

160
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,962
always thinking...

161
00:09:25,495 --> 00:09:26,828
wondering...

162
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:30,495
Perhaps nothing will change
no matter how far I go.

163
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:32,562
So even if I stop,

164
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:35,062
it will still
remain the same.

165
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:38,162
And if someone were to
tell me it was all over,

166
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:39,595
I wouldn't be fazed.

167
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:41,528
But today...

168
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:44,195
today I finally
found the answer...

169
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:46,428
to one of my questions.

170
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,228
Shinichi...

171
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:50,762
In the end...

172
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:54,495
I never did anything
to harm this child.

173
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:58,262
This perfectly normal,
beautiful child.

174
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:01,528
Please make sure it's
raised in a normal way...

175
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,962
by human hands.

176
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:09,495

to laugh like a human
in front of a mirror.

How's Shinichi?

He's fine, and it looks like

00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:19,862
he'll be coming back to
school pretty soon.

So, like what happened?

244
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,262
He just left all of a sudden,

where he was going!

True, he does seem to be

there with an easy temperament.

There is only a minimal
response to my telepathy.

He's keeping his thoughts
very tightly guarded...

for me to determine if he
has the same ability I do.

mention this up front...

actually had such powers ‐

finely honed abilities ‐

who has the best chance.

You know what bein' in
prison's like, right?

354
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,862
If you put a hottie like this
in front of me, then...

355
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:24,895
Mmph!

356
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:25,795
Huh?

357
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:26,995
Ooohh...

358
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:29,529
[Uragami groaning]
Is he... godammit!
Arhh...

359
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,729
So‐uh shouldn't we maybe
stop him, Inspector..?

360
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:34,195
This is probably affecting
his concentration.

361
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:35,795
Hehehaha...
[SATO] Oh dear God!

362
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:39,629
Ah! He's one! He's one of
the parasites for sure!

363
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,495
Eww... Disgusting...
Where ya goin?

364
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:44,495
Aw don't leave,
I'm not done yet! Baby?

365
00:19:44,595 --> 00:19:46,795
Well this has been
a waste of time.

366
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,962
Hmmm.

367
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,458
[MIYAKE]
Mr. Izumi, sorry for the wait.

368
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:55,491
You may go in now.

369
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,658
Right.

370
00:19:57,758 --> 00:19:59,391
You aren't able to
hear each other,

371
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,791
so there's no need
to hold back, okay?

372
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:04,658
[HIRAMA]
Now tell me, what do you
think of this man?

373
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:07,491
Well, I... I don't know.

374
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:12,024
[HIRAMA]
For some reason, you tend to
encounter parasites quite often.

375
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:16,391
Most recently, you were
approached by the parasite
known as Reiko Tamura.

376
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:19,491
Maybe there's something about
you that attracts them...

377
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:21,124
Or perhaps...

378
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:23,891
You somehow have a way
of telling them apart
from the rest us.

379
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,558
[SHINICHI]
<i>Stay calm.</i>

380
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,924
<i>If I can just be calm,</i>
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

381
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:30,891
No, sir.

382
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:32,758
[HIRAMA]
<i>I can't help but think...</i>

383
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:36,624
<i>this is the partner Kuramori</i>
<i>was trying to tell me about...</i>

384
00:20:36,724 --> 00:20:39,491
<i>just before his death...</i>

385
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:41,258
<i>But mentioning his name...</i>

386
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,924
<i>seems to have no effect on him.</i>

387
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:45,924
<i>But it's hard to believe</i>
<i>a kid could bluff</i>

388
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:48,058
<i>his way through this</i>
<i>without ever cracking.</i>

389
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:50,558
I think that piece
a shit is asleep!

390
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:51,858
What the hell?!

391
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,324
[HIRAMA]
Dammit, Uragami!
Wake your ass up!

392
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:56,724
Uh... Hehe...

393
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:58,958
That chick really
wore me out...

394
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,424
Heh, heh. Huh?

395
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:02,324
We're still doing this?

396
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:04,591
You got a cute face there, boy.

397
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:06,591
I bet if you put on
a skirt or somethin'

398
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:08,358
I could rub out another one.

399
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,224
Hehehe...

400
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:15,658
Hm...

401
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:19,258
[URAGAMI]
Well, well, well,
Mr. Detective.

402
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:20,324
Huh?

403
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:21,858
I need you to tell this guy

404
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,058
to look me straight in the eye.

405
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,124
[HIRAMA]
Shinichi.

406
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:27,624
Yes?

407
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:30,124
Uh!

408
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:58,924
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"In Cold Blood"
