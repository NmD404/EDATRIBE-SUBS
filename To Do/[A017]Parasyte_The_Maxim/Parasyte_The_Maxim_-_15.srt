1
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:13,374
[ABE] They're splitting up.

2
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:15,140
Which one should I follow?

3
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,574
Yes... Understood.

4
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:19,340
I'll let you know what I find.

5
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:32,174
(huh?)

6
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:36,140
Pickin' up chicks?

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,140
(huh?)

8
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:18,307
(waah!)

9
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,274
Well that's not good.
[ABE] (choking)

10
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:28,707
I didn't even really notice
that you came up behind me.

11
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:31,307
[ABE] (struggling &amp; choking)

12
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:22,807
Ahem... I want you to
help me with something.

13
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,874
[KURAMORI] The last I heard,
he was headed for this
building's basement.

14
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:34,174
But I'm not crazy enough to
go in there by myself,

15
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:35,407
so I was kinda hoping
you guys would‐

16
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,774
[MIGI] What did we say?

17
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:39,774
We explicitly told you
not to go after this one.

18
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:42,807
[SHINICHI] Well?

19
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:44,240
Do you sense anything?

20
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,140
[MIGI] No, none of my kind
are currently in the area.

21
00:03:58,174 --> 00:03:59,940
I don't get it.
Where is he?

22
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,174
Something smells
really bad in here.

23
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,774
Huh?

24
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,007
[SHINICHI] (gasps)
Oh, my God... Not again!

25
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:13,007
Shinichi, one of them is coming.
[KURAMORI] (gasps)

26
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:14,507
Two hundred meters...

27
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,074
One hundred eighty meters...

28
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,540
Very fast.
It's probably in a car.

29
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,574
If we leave now, we'll likely
run into it near the entrance.

30
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:24,074
God, this is bad!
C'mon, we gotta hide!

31
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:27,040
It has another human.
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

32
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:32,874
[WOMAN] Eew, gross.
What is this place?

33
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:34,407
[KAWADA] Oh, never mind that.

34
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,774
Please just stand right over
there, if you don't mind.

35
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,040
[WOMAN] Oh, like this?

36
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,107
[KAWADA] Yes, that's fine.

37
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:46,107
What's this about?
You're so weird.

38
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,407
[MIGI]
Don't make a move, Shinichi.

39
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,340
[KAWADA] <i>Why are you hiding?</i>

40
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:57,474
<i>Well, whatever.</i>

41
00:04:57,574 --> 00:04:59,507
Now then...

42
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:02,307
Let me get a look at you.

43
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:05,207
[KURAMORI] <i>This is it.</i>
<i>This is how they eat people.</i>

44
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,740
Stop right there!
[KUROMORI] (gasps)

45
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,874
[WOMAN] (gasps) Who is that?!

46
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,507
Who are you?

47
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,507
I can tell you're not one of us.

48
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,707
Careful, lady!

49
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,107
That guy's not really a human!

50
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:21,274
Get away from him!
[WOMAN] Huh?

51
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,440
[SHINICHI] Hurry! He brought
you here to kill you!

52
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,540
(screams)

53
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,774
You son of a bitch!

54
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,440
You're a filthy human.

55
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,774
Listen to me, Shinichi.

56
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:42,040
You have to forget
that I'm even here.

57
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,007
[MIGI]
He'll defeat us before we can

58
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:46,340
finish discussing how
to coordinate.

59
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:52,640
[MIGI] You can see his
blades' movements, right?

60
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,240
[SHINICHI] Yeah!

61
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:58,807
[KURAMORI] I don't...

62
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:00,940
Everything's moving so fast!

63
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:04,074
[MIGI]
Just keep dodging his strikes.

64
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,540
And don't even think
of trying to attack this one

65
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,074
like you did last time.

66
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:10,407
Can we really
beat him like this?!

67
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,707
Well done,
your moves are quite good.

68
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:20,074
I'll win this by having
the better steed.

69
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:22,240
Did you just call me a steed?!

70
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,374
(aahhh...)

71
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:30,807
(ungh)

72
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:33,407
(gurgle)

73
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,807
(gapsing for breath)

74
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,574
(panting)

75
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,340
(aahhh...)

76
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,007
(urk!)

77
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:06,174
(heavy breathing)

78
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:08,307
(ugghhh...)

79
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:11,474
[MIGI] Our weakness is below
the neck; the human portion.

80
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,507
If we can protect that,
we will ultimately win.

81
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,174
[SHINICHI] I couldn't save her.

82
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:28,940
And it's too late now.

83
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,007
I knew what was going on.

84
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,874
But instead I...

85
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:36,974
I spent... I spent too much
time doing nothing!

86
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,407
[MIGI] In any case,
this whole thing is bad news.

87
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:44,007
Judging from the man's actions,

88
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:49,640
this structure must be one of
the communal dining areas
established by Hirokawa.

89
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,840
And if that's true,

90
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,340
it could mean that
we've just committed

91
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,340
a clear act of aggression
against the mayor's faction.

92
00:07:57,907 --> 00:07:59,974
Are you listening, Shinichi?

93
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:02,940
[KURAMORI] (vomiting)

94
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:12,440
[SHINICHI] I was wrong.
[MIGI] Hmm?

95
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,107
I was so wrong.

96
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:18,074
[MIGI]
Shinichi, we need to leave this
place as soon as possible.

97
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:26,974
So, what now?

98
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:30,207
I mean, you're not going
to stop looking, are you?

99
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:33,774
(huh?)

100
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:36,507
There's a detective
I met a while back,

101
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,440
I believe his name was Hirama.

102
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,974
I'm sure he'll listen to
whatever you have to say.

103
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:43,274
Because, not long ago,

104
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:46,040
he suspected me
of being one of them.

105
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,274
Hey now, don't give him
any strange ideas.

106
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:50,640
What's strange about it?

107
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,474
We're trying to go up
against Hirokawa.

108
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,774
What're you saying?

109
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:56,240
Have you not realized
that we could be

110
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,907
in an extremely precarious
situation right now?

111
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,540
[SHINICHI]
We can use the video he recorded

112
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,374
to get the police to search
the building from top to bottom.

113
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:06,674
Don't be foolish.

114
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:08,674
We are in that video footage,
too, you know.

115
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:11,140
Look, I don't even care
about that anymore!

116
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,240
Do you want your father
to be murdered as well?

117
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,840
[SHINICHI] (gasps)
What's that s'posta mean?!

118
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,607
Why would you say that?!

119
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:20,874
[KURAMORI]
You don't have to worry.

120
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:22,040
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

121
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,940
[KURAMORI] I was wrong, okay?

122
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,774
I'm in way over my head here,
just like my wife told me.

123
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:32,007
A small‐timer like me shouldn't
have gotten involved with this
to begin with.

124
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,940
(crack!)

125
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,240
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

126
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,807
I' m gonna get rid of
every bit of evidence

127
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:40,174
I've managed to find so far.

128
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:41,474
How could you?

129
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:42,940
You saw what happened!

130
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,974
Are you trying to say none of it
means anything to you?

131
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:46,374
Of course, it does!

132
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,940
Dammit, yes! Look at me,
I'm still shaking here!

133
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,840
But anybody who saw that
and honestly thinks he
could fight it

134
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,440
is out of his freaking mind!

135
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,674
Maybe you don't get it.

136
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:57,007
You're not a normal
human being anymore!

137
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:02,407
Look the fight that I just
witnessed back there,

138
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:06,474
that was two monsters
trying to kill each other.

139
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:08,407
I'm only a simple,
normal person.

140
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,674
I'm not that brave, and I don't
have any special power crap
to protect myself.

141
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:14,440
I can't do all that, okay?

142
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,340
As of today, I'm gonna forget
about the monsters and
Reiko Tamura...

143
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,940
and you too.

144
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,340
(sighs)

145
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:25,840
C'mon, don't look at me
like that.

146
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,540
I have a wife and kid to
think about, all right?

147
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:31,140
I know I got a little
high and mighty,

148
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,840
talking about the good of
humanity and stuff, but this...

149
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,374
this is too much.

150
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:41,040
Well, I guess that's true
human nature for you.

151
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,807
Shut the hell up.

152
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:50,240
(dog barking)

153
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,707
[KURAMORI]
Maybe you don't get it!

154
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:54,874
You're not a normal
human being anymore!

155
00:10:57,174 --> 00:10:58,907
[SHINICHI]
<i>He's absolutely right.</i>

156
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,907
<i>I'm NOT normal anymore.</i>

157
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:04,007
<i>The things I can sense...</i>

158
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,474
<i>The things I can do...</i>

159
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,007
Shinichi...

160
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:10,674
I've said this many times now,

161
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:13,474
but we should avoid
futile resistance.

162
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,574
Futile?

163
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,774
Yeah, maybe.

164
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:19,240
But well, we did win today,
right?

165
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:25,040
We can beat them one‐on‐one!
That is the answer!

166
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,540
If I were to choose to
cooperate with you, that is.

167
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,407
(huh?)

168
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,507
(piano playing softly)

169
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:35,907
[SHINICHI] <i>I can do it...</i>

170
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:37,940
<i>I can do it!</i>

171
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,540
<i>If I put my mind to it,</i>
<i>I can do anything!</i>

172
00:11:41,774 --> 00:11:43,974
(piano continues playing)

173
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,207
<i>One at a time...</i>

174
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,607
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>I can get them one at a time!</i>

175
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:54,374
<i>I'll beat them alone</i>
<i>if I have to.</i>

176
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:57,307
<i>I don't need to ask</i>
<i>any more humans for help.</i>

177
00:11:57,407 --> 00:12:00,240
<i>That way,</i>
<i>I'm sure Migi would help me.</i>

178
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,407
<i>No...</i>
<i>I will make him help me!</i>

179
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:08,007
(piano continues playing)

180
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:14,107
<i>Call it my human ego</i>
<i>or whatever,</i>

181
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,340
<i>but I wanna save</i>
<i>as many people as I can!</i>

182
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:22,307
<i>And it'll make things safer</i>
<i>for Murano, too.</i>

183
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,574
(piano continues playing)

184
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:25,940
[YUKO] Did you and Shinichi
have a fight or something?

185
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,540
I haven't seen you together
lately.

186
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,340
[SATOMI]
Not so much a fight as...

187
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,374
Well, I don't know.

188
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:36,374
It's like we just can't really
trust each other or something.

189
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:37,974
(huh?)

190
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,040
I don't know,
it looks like HE trusts YOU.

191
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:47,040
(piano continues playing)

192
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:51,207
(self‐conscious chuckle)

193
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:54,907
(ah!)

194
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,674
[SATOMI] I... I gotta go!

195
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:58,274
[YUKO] Murano, wait!

196
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,874
Seriously?

197
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:02,507
[YUKO] Shut up, Akiho.

198
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,874
<i>I will protect</i>
<i>every person I can!</i>

199
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:09,207
(piano continues playing)

200
00:13:09,307 --> 00:13:10,507
Our enemy is strong.

201
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,274
We cannot allow him
to roam free.

202
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,640
[TAMURA]
Killing him would be a waste.

203
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,574
Though I care nothing
for the detective.

204
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:18,874
Unwise...

205
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:21,540
He is, without a doubt
very dangerous to us.

206
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,574
Why would you defend him?

207
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,440
We are not human beings, are we?

208
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,374
Why would our opinions be in
such opposition to one another?

209
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:30,907
Now then...

210
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,174
I understand you're currently
raising a human child.

211
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:37,040
Could that be affecting
your judgment?

212
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,907
Why not simply dispose of it?

213
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:42,207
I can't do that just yet.

214
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:44,507
At any rate,

215
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:48,540
Shinichi Izumi killed one of
our members in a dining area.

216
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,974
We can't just let this go,
obviously.

217
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:53,407
We will need to eliminate him.

218
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:55,740
Very well, then.

219
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,607
But I would like to make sure
that his body

220
00:13:57,707 --> 00:13:59,774
is returned to me fully intact.

221
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:01,407
[HIROKAWA] For what purpose?

222
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,407
[TAMURA] I want to dissect him.

223
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:22,207
(lone person clapping)

224
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:28,507
[HIROKAWA]
Very impressive, Mr. Goto.

225
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,407
Was it Mozart?

226
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,840
[GOTO] No, Chopin.

227
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,074
Our target is purported
to be formidable.

228
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:40,074
Granted, I think it should be
you who takes care of him.

229
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,874
If you're implying Miki
wants to do it,

230
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:46,007
I will allow him to try.

231
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:50,207
He could use some more study.

232
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,107
[SHINICHI] (echoing)
<i>What is this?</i>

233
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:00,907
<i>Who are you?</i>

234
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,107
[MONSTER MIGI] Things are rough
for me, too, you know?

235
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,707
[SHINICHI] (echoing)
<i>You... You're a monster!</i>

236
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,840
(bones clicking)

237
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:13,674
Hmm?

238
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:17,040
Ah,
so I look like a monster to you?

239
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,207
But you're in
no position to talk.

240
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:23,207
[MIGI] Just take a look at this,
Shinichi.

241
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:29,640
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

242
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,407
(screams)

243
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:36,074
What... What the hell was that?
[clock ticking loudly]

244
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:42,940
<i>I need to kill off the</i>
<i>parasites by attacking</i>
<i>them one at a time.</i>

245
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,374
<i>But how am I ever going</i>
<i>to get Migi to agree to it?</i>

246
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:50,940
<i>Maybe the best way would be</i>
<i>to make it so that we have</i>
<i>no choice...</i>

247
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,140
<i>that we have to fight.</i>

248
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:57,440
(school bell chiming)

249
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,474
What're you doing?

250
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:03,407
I'm gonna be late for class.

251
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:04,607
[MIGI] You don't have time.

252
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:05,874
I sense my kind.

253
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:07,940
What? Again?!

254
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:09,907
<i>Here's my chance!</i>

255
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,640
Okay, let's fight.

256
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,374
Where is it right now?

257
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,140
[MIGI] Don't be so eager.

258
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,207
WE are being targeted this time.

259
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:20,640
The signal's headed straight
for us right now with
intent to kill.

260
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,674
I sense three.

261
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:23,440
There's three of 'em.
O'kay.

262
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,507
Do we fight, or do we run?

263
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:28,007
You seem more than ready
for a fight, at the moment.

264
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:31,507
If so, this is
the ideal location.

265
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,274
[SHINICHI] Don't be ridiculous!

266
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,807
I will NOT do this at school!

267
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:41,807
Shinichi!

268
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:48,540
It's okay.
You don't have to worry, Murano.

269
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,474
Huh?

270
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:51,707
It'sokay!

271
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:55,374
Look, you don't have to worry.

272
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,307
(gasps) Don't tell me...

273
00:16:58,307 --> 00:16:59,974
[SHINICHI] (ungh!)

274
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:03,440
Shinichi?

275
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,874
(running footsteps)

276
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:06,674
[MIGI] Stop; I've lost them.

277
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,707
They're more than
300 meters away now,

278
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,840
and they seem to be on foot.

279
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,274
So there's three coming
for us at once?

280
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:17,407
[MIGI] In this case,

281
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,607
we should consider taking
them out one‐by‐one,

282
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:22,174
rather than opposing
all of them together.

283
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,307
Take them out one by one...

284
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:30,040
Okay, I'm ready to go!

285
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,840
[MIGI] No, never mind.
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

286
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,774
Forget about that strategy.

287
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:35,407
Migi, why?!

288
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:36,674
[MIGI] I'm tired.

289
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:37,974
It's time for me to sleep.

290
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:40,807
(huh?!)
You've got to be shitting me?!

291
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:42,174
It can't be helped.

292
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:44,940
It's a case of
simple physiology.

293
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,607
In any case,
you have to keep moving,

294
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:50,907
as straightforward as possible.

295
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:53,340
That's all we can do for now.

296
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,774
So then, I'm on my own
for four hours?

297
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:07,807
(train horn)

298
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:18,601
(sighs) Well, I guess I can
relax a bit for now.

299
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:19,835
Two more hours, huh?

300
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:22,035
I should be able
to shake them off.

301
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,535
A taxi? Seriously?

302
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:28,235
You can keep the change.

303
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:29,835
Thanks a lot.

304
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:35,168
<i>Only one, huh?</i>

305
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:36,801
<i>So, it's not him.</i>

306
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,001
[MIKI] Well, hello there!

307
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:40,968
Nice place, huh?

308
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:43,768
No one around,
and it's so quiet.

309
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:45,068
<i>He's smiling.</i>

310
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:48,201
<i>There's no way this</i>
<i>guy's a parasite.</i>

311
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,668
I'm kinda surprised.

312
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:52,901
You took off in quite a panic
back there, didn't you?

313
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:56,801
And I had heard
you were so tough.
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

314
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:59,101
So what's goin' on? Huh?

315
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:02,868
You know, your hand's signal
seems awfully weak at the‐
(huh?)

316
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:06,835
[MIKI] Hey! Wait up!
(chuckles)

317
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:10,068
<i>I've never seen a parasite as</i>
<i>expressive as that before!</i>

318
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:16,768
<i>But he is pretty slow.</i>

319
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:18,301
<i>Parasites should be able</i>
<i>to get more</i>

320
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,801
<i>from their host‐body potential.</i>

321
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:23,635
<i>Still, the other two</i>
<i>could be close by.</i>

322
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:25,835
<i>I can't let my guard down!</i>

323
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,668
(panting)

324
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:38,401
Where ya headed to, young fella?

325
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,268
Would you like a lift somewhere?

326
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,968
Yeah, thank you so much.

327
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:50,268
<i>Is he... is this guy...</i>

328
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:51,735
<i>or his dog...</i>

329
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:53,835
<i>are they parasites?!</i>

330
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:58,301
<i>No, it's too small.</i>

331
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:00,835
[OLD GUY] Are you sure
you wanna get out here?

332
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:03,701
Yeah, I can't thank you enough,
sir.

333
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:08,535
<i>Thank God!</i>

334
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:10,468
<i>I guess he was okay.</i>

335
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:12,368
<i>It's been almost</i>
<i>four hours now.</i>

336
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:15,235
<i>It looks like they've given up.</i>

337
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,301
(vehicle approaching)

338
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,301
(ah!)

339
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:31,335
Please, Migi, wake up.

340
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:33,135
[MIKI] (ungh!)
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

341
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:37,168
Whoa, whoa, whoa! (umphf)

342
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,935
(laughs)

343
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,368
[SHINICHI] Migi? Migi!

344
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:49,735
WAKE UP!

345
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:51,768
(sleepily) (unh?) Ah, Shinichi,

346
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:54,368
I'm so glad to see
you're all right.

347
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:55,668
Huh?

348
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,035
They're here!

349
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:58,035
That's right.

350
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,435
But I still haven't
been able to find

351
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,668
where the other two
are hiding yet.

352
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:03,201
[MIGI]
I don't think you understand.

353
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:05,968
All three of them
are in that one body.

354
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,068
Huh?!

355
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:09,535
Did you seriously name
your parasite "Migi"?

356
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,568
What a coincidence!

357
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:12,968
Well... (chuckles)

358
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:16,735
You are simply NOT
gonna believe this.

359
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:20,335
Ya'see, I'm called "Miki."
With a 'K'.

360
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:22,335
(ungh!)

361
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,701
Well, this is interesting.

362
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:29,001
(chuckling)

363
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:32,735
Ya'can't beat me.
(chuckles)

364
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:58,268

Next time:
"Happy Family"
