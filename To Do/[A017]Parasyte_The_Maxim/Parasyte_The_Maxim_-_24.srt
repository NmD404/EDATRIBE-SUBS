00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,071
[SHINICHI]
In the end...
what were they really?

2
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:10,671
They're still being
talked about online...

3
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:14,804
but no public agency has
issued any formal statement.

4
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:16,937
After the bloody battle
at City Hall,

5
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,937
there haven't been
any parasite‐like
activities around town...

6
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:23,171
or anywhere else in the world,
for that matter.

7
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:25,204
Nothing at all.

8
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:29,204
Why did they suddenly go quiet?

9
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:34,104
One theory, of course,
was that losing that fight
taught them all a lesson.

10
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:37,204
Another suggestion however...

11
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:42,904
is that they've just become
much better at blending in
with human society.

12
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:46,237
Like Reiko Tamura, they've
learned to alter their diets,

13
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,204
gradually eating less
and less human flesh and,

14
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:53,237
in turn, becoming more
human themselves.

15
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:55,371
And then...

16
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,304
there's Migi.

17
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:01,671
[Sleeping]

18
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:06,771
[MIGI]
<i>Shinichi.</i>

19
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:09,537
[Shinichi voiceover]
Migi, you never change, do you?

20
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:12,037
Nothing seems to faze you.

21
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:19,971
But ya know, I'm really glad
you're still alive, Migi.

22
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:29,139
[MIGI]
How do I look to you
now, Shinichi?

23
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,772
[SHINICHI]
I don't know. A little
different again I guess.

24
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:35,539
But kinda the same.
Maybe...

25
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:36,606
I don't know...

26
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:38,206
Don't trouble yourself.

27
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,872
I actually came today
to tell you goodbye.

28
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:42,672
Huh?
What do you mean?

29
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:45,006
I think I'm going
to go to sleep.

30
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:48,939
Go to sleep?
But you always sleep, right?

31
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,072
This is different.

32
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,472
It will be a bit
longer this time.

33
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,306
Possibly forever.

34
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,539
Put simply,

35
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:59,372
just think of this as you
regaining your right hand.

36
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:03,272
Huh? Why would you do this?
I don't understand!

37
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,539
My internal structure
has changed once again.

38
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:12,472
In particular, my time
spent inside Goto's body,
dreaming and yet awake...

39
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,839
being alone and
yet not alone...

40
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,839
that experience has been
a major factor for me.

41
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,472
But, Migi...

42
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:23,506
Not only did I suddenly
receive a wealth of information,

43
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:27,406
I became able to pursue multiple
lines of thought at once.

44
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:30,172
I'd like to shut out all
other information

45
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,272
and just work with what
I have for a while.

46
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:36,139
I've decided to cease
all outward activities.

47
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,906
But Migi.
You can't be serious!

48
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,006
You've always been
so curious...

49
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:42,539
What happened to that?

50
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,839
There's still a lot out
there you don't know.

51
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,606
That's very true...

52
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,372
So I guess I'll
put it like this.

53
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,606
I'm going to head in
another direction...

54
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:55,139
One slightly different from the
waking world which you occupy.

55
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,172
I don't understand!
Migi, please...

56
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:02,539
Shinichi...
I want you to think of me as
nothing more than a dream.

57
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,472
It's the reason why,
in the end, I'm choosing to
say goodbye to you in one.

58
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:09,072
What are you
talking about?!

59
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:11,972
The time we've spent together,
everything we've done...

60
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,439
That wasn't a dream!
It was real!

61
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:15,739
Indeed...

62
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:18,239
The terrible things
that happened to you...

63
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:22,139
all those deaths...
those things were real, too.

64
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:24,639
Ah!

65
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,306
Mom!

66
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,806
Why is my mom here?!

67
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:32,139
This is an image you
manifest when you
think about people dying.

68
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,906
Ohh...

69
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,072
So this is the form your mother
takes inside your mind...

70
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:40,806
Uh, what?
What do you mean?

71
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:47,172
Migi...
What is all this?

72
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:51,806
It's all so different from how
I saw them in my mind's eye.

73
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:53,839
Show me myself.

74
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:57,706
Really...?

75
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,472
What do you mean, "Really"?

76
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,739
Well, it is what it is.

77
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:07,872
Ultimately, we can only
understand each other
on certain points.

78
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:10,306
You humans share the same
physical makeup,

79
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:13,872
yet if you were able to exchange
consciousness with one another,

80
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:15,939
you'd be able to
see entire worlds,

81
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:19,406
and hear things beyond
your imagination.

82
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:33,772
Well, it's time to go.

83
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,739
I'll be moving on now.

84
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,972
Wait!

85
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:38,872
What if more
parasites show up?

86
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:41,739
How can I fight them
all alone?!

87
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,406
I'm sure you'll be fine.

88
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:47,072
Just be careful on the road,
okay, Shinichi?

89
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,272
Wait!

90
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,706
So, I won't ever be able
to talk to you again?

91
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:53,372
Not ever?!

92
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:55,172
I don't know.

93
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:58,472
Neither of us should be
dying anytime soon.

94
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:02,672
Besides, a human who
talks to his own hand
is just peculiar...

95
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:05,672
Fundamentally speaking.

96
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,839
How can you do this to me?

97
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,939
Without any warning?

98
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:11,406
Once you wake up,

99
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:14,506
I'm sure you'll have forgotten
all about this dream...

100
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,406
like always.

101
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,472
And...
When that happens,

102
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:23,106
I'd also like you to
forget about me as well...

103
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:26,806
You can do it...
I'm certain you can.

104
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:29,906
And just think...

105
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,739
When morning comes...

106
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,406
you'll have an
ordinary right hand...

107
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:36,806
Just like you did before.

108
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:39,139
Migi...

109
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:43,806
Thank you for
everything, Shinichi...

110
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:46,306
[Birds chirping]

111
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,872
Mm‐hmm...

112
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:12,039
[Deep breath]

113
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:19,039
How in the hell could I ever
forget you, you idiot?!

114
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:24,939
Migi...

115
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:37,006
Ugh...
Nagai's been like
a total pain lately,

116
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,039
he won't
leave me alone.

117
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,906
[YUKO]
Akiho, I swear...

118
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:42,906
[AKIHO]
Ah! Look who's here...

119
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:45,506
Hey, Shinichi!
It's been a long time.

120
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,439
I'm late...
sorry about that.

121
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,739
Mm‐mm... Yuko and Akiho
happened to be passing by.

122
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,372
Mm‐hm.
Yeah, the two of us are going
out to see an art exhibit.

123
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:57,806
And I could not care less,
art is so stupid.
Hehe...

124
00:06:57,906 --> 00:07:01,639
We'll see you two
love birds later!
Be good now, bye!

125
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:04,206
Yeah! See ya!
Bye! Woo!

126
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:06,272
Oh my God, you are
so embarrassing.
They seem to be doing well.

127
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:08,739
Mm‐hm...
I guess those two
are really enjoying

128
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,372
the whole
college‐life thing.

129
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,772
Sigh... I've totally been
left behind haven't I...

130
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:16,372
Uh...

131
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:18,806
Then you'll have to hurry
and catch up!

132
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,606
We're waiting for you.

133
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,006
Hehe...

134
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:26,672
[SHINICHI]
After everything
that's happened,

135
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:30,039
having to wait to take
the entrance exam again
is like torture.

136
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,672
A wonderful summer of
basking‐in‐the‐sun torture.

137
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,039
[Kids laughing]

138
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,206
Nothing at all has been
happening recently...

139
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:41,406
And there hasn't been a
single sign of parasites
around anywhere.

140
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:45,239
In fact, one time,
I even called Uda...

141
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,806
and we talked about what we
thought might have happened...

142
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,972
and how we got to where we are.

143
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:53,439
I decided not to
tell him about Migi.

144
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,506
His "disappearance" is unique,
even among his kind.

145
00:07:57,906 --> 00:07:59,172
Migi...

146
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,206
I could never
understand you ‐

147
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:04,072
and it looks like maybe
I'm not the only one.

148
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:07,039
But that fits. In fact,
I'm sure right now,

149
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,039
you're walking some
path all your own.

150
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:13,339
The battles we
fought together...

151
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,006
They weren't really for
the sake of the Earth...

152
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:18,306
They were for humanity...

153
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:20,039
Or, to be honest...

154
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,406
sometimes just for me.

155
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:27,806
I could never see things from
the parasites' point of view...

156
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:30,206
let alone Migi's.

157
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:31,839
Of course not...

158
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:34,306
That was impossible
right from the start.

159
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:37,806
We're two different species.

160
00:08:37,906 --> 00:08:39,672
Sometimes we'd use each other,

161
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:41,339
and sometimes we'd
kill each other...

162
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:45,339
But we may never truly
comprehend each other.

163
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,806
Because, you can never
possibly understand someone

164
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:50,239
when you've judged them
by your own standards.

165
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,272
I believe it's arrogance that
makes humans think

166
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:55,939
we can sympathize how
other life forms feel.

167
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,172
It's obvious that among all
the creatures out there,

168
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:03,106
mankind doesn't really
have many friends.

169
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,439
But, even if we can't
relate to them,

170
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:10,239
they're still our "neighbors,"
and they deserve our respect.

171
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,506
We humans protect other species
because we feel alone.

172
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:20,172
We protect the
environment because we
don't want to go extinct.

173
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:24,972
Look inside the human heart,
and all you'll find is
self‐preservation...

174
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:27,372
I think that's all
there is to it.

175
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:29,806
We don't know anything else.

176
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,939
And I doubt it'll ever end.

177
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,406
I mean it seems to have
worked so far. Right?

178
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:38,872
Well that's what I think..
And so...

179
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:43,739
In the end,
it's a contradiction
for us to love the Earth
without loving ourselves.

180
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,706
Mm?
Are you okay?

181
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:47,539
Uh...
Oh, no I'm fine...

182
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,206
I'm actually trying to say
it's more peaceful lately.

183
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:54,572
Yeah? But I'm pretty sure
I heard that crime has
been on the rise.

184
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:58,039
Wait... that's it!
Huh?

185
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,239
[SHINICHI]
That's why they're
not standing out.

186
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:04,406
Or maybe...
they never stood out that
much in the first place...

187
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:09,639
Even murder can sometimes amount
to nothing more than a wild
animal feeding itself.

188
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:13,372
In a narrow sense,
they're our enemies...

189
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:17,506
but in a broader sense...
they're just like us.

190
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:21,106
I mean, we were all born
on this planet, weren't we?

191
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:24,239
And all of us...

192
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,439
all of us survive
off each other.

193
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,439
Uh? Hehe...

194
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,539
Hmm...

195
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:44,988
[SHINICHI]
Time has really flown by...

196
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:47,422
Can you believe how long
we've been going out?

197
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,955
Wait, have we been
dating all this time?

198
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:50,955
Huh?

199
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:52,622
Hehe...
I'm kidding.

200
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:54,588
Ah... hehe...

201
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,655
Y'know what...

202
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:57,822
Hm?

203
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:59,555
U‐uh...

204
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,922
You are so mean
to me sometimes.

205
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:04,588
Hehe...
What?

206
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:06,755
Oh...

207
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:10,322
What's the matter now?

208
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:12,588
<i>I must be</i>
<i>imagining things.</i>

209
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:16,322
<i>He looked like that guy.</i>

210
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:20,288
I just thought I saw
someone I knew.

211
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:26,855
So you wanna get
something to eat?

212
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:28,655
Oh! Uh!

213
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:33,255
<i>No! It is him!</i>

214
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:34,422
What is it?

215
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:36,522
Hold this...
Wait for me here okay.

216
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:39,322
Huh?
I'll be right back!

217
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:43,655
<i>He went through here.</i>

218
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:48,922
What are you doing Shinichi?

219
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:50,855
[URAGAMI]
Looking for me.

220
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:54,788
[SATOMI]
Uh... Aahh!
Uh!

221
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:55,655
Ah!

222
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:56,988
Huh?

223
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:00,455
[URAGAMI]
Yoo‐hoo...

224
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:02,088
[Satomi whimpering]

225
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,722
Murano!

226
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:07,222
Hey! You let her go!

227
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,088
Er.. Argh!

228
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,355
<i>This cannot be happening!</i>

229
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:13,988
<i>I should've just acted</i>
<i>like I didn't see him!</i>

230
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:15,688
[Door opens]

231
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:16,788
Ah!
Huh?

232
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:18,055
[Whimpering]

233
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,155
Let's get outta here.

234
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,588
Yeah.

235
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:24,055
[Whimpering]

236
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:25,855
Uh... Hmm?

237
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:29,655
Uh! Hey!
Hey, what do you think‐

238
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,455
[Gasping]

239
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:32,722
Huh?

240
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:35,122
AAAAHH!

241
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,955
Someone, help!

242
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:38,155
Ah!

243
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:39,522
Ugh!

244
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:41,722
[Stabbing]
Uh...

245
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:50,588
I'll get to you a little later.

246
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,922
I gotta talk to your
boyfriend first.

247
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,922
[Whimpering]

248
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:56,822
[Panting]

249
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:58,988
Murano!

250
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:03,688
Excuse me...

251
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:05,888
Gah!

252
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,488
[URAGAMI]
You got up here pretty fast.

253
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:13,522
Murano!

254
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:16,255
Shini‐chi...

255
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,755
Aw, isn't that just
the cutest thing ever..?

256
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:21,122
She's so scared,
she can barely even talk.

257
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:23,588
Stop it!
What'd you do to her?!

258
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:24,722
Nothing yet...

259
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:27,022
This blood's from
that minx over there.

260
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:28,555
Huh?

261
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:30,855
Hey. Come on now...

262
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:34,022
Settle down and just let
her go, so we can talk.

263
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:37,022
Huh?! You can't be serious!

264
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:39,522
What is it you want?

265
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:41,755
I'll do anything. Look just...

266
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,955
please don't hurt her.

267
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:45,555
Uh‐huh...

268
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:48,988
Is there something
that you want?

269
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:50,488
If there is,
just tell me.

270
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:53,788
Hmm...
Something I want?

271
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:56,788
The cops aren't
completely stupid.

272
00:13:56,888 --> 00:14:00,755
I know it's only a matter
of time before they
catch up to me again.

273
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:04,188
So I'm glad I got to run
into you two kids first...

274
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,255
I would like to
get an answer

275
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,788
that I can't get
from any human being.

276
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:09,488
Gasp...

277
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:10,655
Huh?

278
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:12,555
[URAGAMI]
When those monsters
kill humans,

279
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,488
it makes total sense, right?

280
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:16,222
They're just feeding...

281
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,555
But what do you think I am?

282
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:22,722
Now, I'm sure you already
know the answer to that...

283
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,722
I am true human nature.

284
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:30,855
I do wonder how all
the people out there
are able to be so patient.

285
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:35,355
I mean, humans have
always naturally had the
itch to kill one another.

286
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,355
Yet they make
such a fuss over it,

287
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:40,555
when we're all
thirsty for blood.

288
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:44,288
And these people who don't
even know what they are,

289
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:46,022
try to demonize me?

290
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:50,355
I can tell the monsters from the
humans just by looking at 'em...

291
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:54,455
I know how unnatural
the world has become.

292
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:58,422
So there is no need for
any of these monsters!

293
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,055
We're already here.
Humans will naturally
feed on one another!

294
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:04,255
It's been that way
for thousands of years!

295
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,722
It's only because we tried
to stop all of a sudden

296
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,055
that there are now seven
or eight billions of us!

297
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:13,188
We can't even sustain
ourselves anymore!

298
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,588
They lie to themselves.

299
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,288
But not us.
We're different.

300
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:19,155
So you can be honest with me.

301
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:21,588
I don't follow you.
What do you mean?

302
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,488
Don't you play dumb with me...

303
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,222
You're a mix aren't you..?

304
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:26,688
You're part monster.

305
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:27,722
What?!

306
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:29,022
[Frightened]

307
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:31,455
I knew it the first time
that I saw you.

308
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,288
It's not in your
head, though.

309
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:34,988
It's somewhere else
in your body.

310
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:36,388
No...

311
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:38,188
Don't be ridiculous!

312
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:40,188
You're his girly‐friend, right?

313
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:42,255
You've seen him up
close and personal.

314
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,788
Tell me. Does he have some
kind of scar somewhere?

315
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:49,188
A hole where a little friend
might've dug inside him?

316
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:50,788
[whimper]

317
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:56,255
I'm begging you...
Please, just let her go.

318
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,588
Now, answer me!

319
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:59,722
I'M the normal human
here, aren't I?

320
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:02,555
I'm just doing my thing,
following my natural instincts!

321
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:04,922
I'm the one being
true to my nature,

322
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:08,955
while the rest of this
herd desperately keeps
looking the other way.

323
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,855
I'm asking you for a favor,

324
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:15,555
seeing as how you're
halfway between the humans
and the parasites.

325
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:21,355
[SATOMI]
<i>Shinichi...</i>

326
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:26,788
Halfway between
the humans and
the parasites, huh?

327
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:32,755
Someone said something
to me very similar
to that once before.

328
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:36,622
You know, you're not
really anything close
to the likes of Goto...

329
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:40,855
but then again,
I'm not very strong
anymore either.

330
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:43,588
So if words can settle this,
I'll say what you want...

331
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:47,388
Just please...
please let the girl go.

332
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:50,055
Hmm...?

333
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:52,088
Er! Okay, you're right!

334
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:53,722
It's like you said.
I'm a‐!

335
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:54,788
[SATOMI]
Shinichi!

336
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,922
Just go.
Call the police.

337
00:16:58,022 --> 00:16:59,088
Huh?

338
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:01,022
Don't waste your time
with this guy.

339
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:04,422
How can you call yourself
a normal human being?!

340
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:07,622
You're even worse than
those damn monsters!

341
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,022
Oh, my...

342
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:12,222
For someone who was trembling
and couldn't even speak earlier,

343
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,588
you sure got spunky.

344
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:15,855
You can go to Hell,
I'm not scared of you!

345
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:19,988
I've seen things disgusting
garbage like you can't
possibly imagine!

346
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,755
Please... Murano...

347
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:25,055
Shinichi, you and
I both went through it.

348
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,322
That's right.

349
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:29,455
Shinichi,
you were incredible.

350
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:31,822
You carried me and protected me.

351
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:34,055
You did everything for me.

352
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:36,722
Sure, you might be
a bit different,

353
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,622
but you ARE a human!

354
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:42,188
Because real humans believe
that all life is precious!

355
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:44,088
You! YOU'RE the monster!

356
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,555
Enough, okay?

357
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:48,755
Shinichi, don't worry
about me, just go!

358
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:50,355
[URAGAMI]
Hahaha...

359
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:51,788
Yeah, yeah, go call 'em..

360
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:54,455
The two of us will just
hang here and wait.

361
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:57,322
I think we'll be able to keep
ourselves entertained...

362
00:17:57,422 --> 00:18:01,088
I'll take my time slicing off
every tasty little morsel.

363
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:04,955
I mean, it'll probably be
the last fun I ever get
to have, right?

364
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:09,622
Breaking down the spunky ones
is always so satisfying.

365
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,288
Shi‐Shinichi!

366
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:13,755
Uh...

367
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:18,488
I was... I was always
trying to catch up to you.

368
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:20,788
But you were moving
so fast, and then...

369
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:24,322
you went to a place
I didn't understand.

370
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:27,122
I ended up being
left behind.

371
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,522
Ah...

372
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:32,788
And now, I've finally
caught up with you...

373
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:34,555
But I...

374
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,722
I may've gone a bit too far.

375
00:18:37,822 --> 00:18:39,488
NO! DON'T!

376
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:43,155
<i>I'll save her!</i>
<i>I can do it!</i>

377
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,488
<i>That's right, I'm fast!</i>

378
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,455
<i>I'm not your</i>
<i>normal human being!</i>

379
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:49,488
<i>I see him. He looks like</i>
<i>he's frozen in time!</i>

380
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:53,255
<i>Stop the knife with</i>
<i>my left arm...</i>

381
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:54,822
<i>and then go for the jaw!</i>

382
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:55,755
Auughh!

383
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:56,488
Unngh!

384
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:58,222
<i>Now, with my right...!</i>

385
00:18:58,322 --> 00:18:59,755
<i>Uhh...</i>

386
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:04,422
[URAGAMI]
<i>Such a shame...</i>
<i>to break so easily...</i>

387
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:10,022
[SHINICHI]
AAUUUHH!

388
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,688
Uh...

389
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,422
No... Murano...

390
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:25,622
God not you too...
Not again... no...

391
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:30,855
[SHINICHI]
I met an organism.

392
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,755
I got to know it...

393
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:35,355
And it suddenly dies.

394
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:37,322
And then, I get sad...

395
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:38,922
Why does that happen?

396
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:41,455
[MIGI]
Perhaps, that just
shows you,

397
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,955
humans have too much
time on their hands...

398
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:48,922
But still...
having those feelings is
also their greatest merit.

399
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,955
To live with such room
in their hearts...

400
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:53,888
It is indeed
a wonderful gift.

401
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:58,422
But anyway...
That's quite enough of
all this moping around.

402
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:01,488
I'm tired, you can do
the holding now.

403
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,155
Uhh...

404
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,855
Gasp!

405
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,555
Ah... Murano!

406
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,388
Uh...

407
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,922
<i>I made it in time...!</i>

408
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:12,555
<i>Migi!</i>

409
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:15,822
[Exertion]

410
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:17,722
Uh!

411
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:22,322
[Catches his breath]

412
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,388
Are you okay?

413
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:26,422
Sigh...

414
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,688
<i>Thank you, Migi...</i>

415
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:31,288
<i>I'm so glad</i>
<i>you're still here!</i>

416
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:34,888
<i>Could Murano have seen Migi?</i>

417
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:38,222
<i>Oh, well... If it's her...</i>

418
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,488
<i>I guess I don't mind.</i>

419
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:44,622
<i>What a beautiful sky.</i>

420
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:49,222
Hey, um... Do you remember
the little puppy that
died awhile back?

421
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:51,822
And I threw it in
the trash can.

422
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:54,655
I keep forgetting
to tell you this but...

423
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,388
but I thought about it
for a long time...

424
00:20:57,488 --> 00:21:00,655
and I buried it
underneath a tree.

425
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,022
I know...

426
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:03,222
Huh?

427
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:06,588
I know. You did the right thing.

428
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:11,288
Because you're Shinichi Izumi.

429
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,188
Hm...

430
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,655
[Woman screams]

431
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:19,222
Oh my God!
Look! There's three more
bodies over there!

432
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:21,055
Did he say three bodies?

433
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,422
He's including us.

434
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:25,688
Hehe...
Hm.

435
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:31,788
[SHINICHI]
All of us are born
here together...

436
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:35,288
And we live our lives trying
to understand each other,

437
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:39,588
using little bits of reason
we accumulate along the way.

438
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:43,122
Striving to find
someone to relate to...

439
00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:45,788
and when we finally do...

440
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,788
it's already over.
