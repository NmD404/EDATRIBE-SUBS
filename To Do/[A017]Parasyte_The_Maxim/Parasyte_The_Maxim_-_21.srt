1
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:09,186
Ah, hello.

2
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,686
[RADIO] Yayoi Squad
has engaged Hirokawa.

3
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:19,086
Do not let him get away.

4
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,053
Make sure he's taken out.

5
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:00,092
Welcome, gentlemen,
so nice of you to come.

6
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:05,426
It is certainly an honor
to have you all here.

7
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,192
When it comes to
the art of death,

8
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:12,559
every species on Earth pales
in comparison to that of
the human race.

9
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,859
Yet, as I look at the
fine instruments you hold,

10
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,226
I feel they could be put to
a FAR greater purpose.

11
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:22,392
Such implements of force can be
used NOT for simple eradication,

12
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:26,959
but rather the protection of the
balance of our very existence.

13
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:32,459
That's right: to purge those
who offer NOTHING to
our community.

14
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:36,626
Because when put to task,
all of us must admit
an obvious truth:

15
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:40,992
that not everyone in our vast
population deserves to be
part of our family.

16
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:45,092
Instead, they attack our values.
They attack our ecosystem,

17
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:50,459
in a crime of arrogant apathy
far greater than that
of crude genocide.

18
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,892
Yet, hope is here.

19
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:53,592
It's staring you in the face.

20
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:55,692
It may be different
and seem frightening,

21
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,926
but you will come to cherish it.

22
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:01,359
The time has come that we must
hold our own predators
in high regard,

23
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,126
and in fact protect them.
And the most fascinating thing,

24
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:10,292
is that these predators will
ultimately allow us to grow
stronger and more powerful.

25
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:13,192
They are our saviors,
our masters.

26
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:16,692
(on speaker)
And they will restore the
balance that we could not.

27
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,559
<i>Hirokawa...</i>

28
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,792
Not long ago, someone on Earth
had a passing thought:

29
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:29,026
"All life is sacred and must
therefore be protected."

30
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,959
[SOLDIER] Who do you think
you are, you monster?!

31
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:35,859
[HIROKAWA] (hmph) This is why
I cannot abide my own kind.

32
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,226
If defiance is truly
your intention,

33
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,359
do not pretend
and act otherwise.

34
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,659
Even environmental conservation
is skewed in favor of
our own hubris,

35
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,926
a viewpoint most
refuse to acknowledge!

36
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:50,059
We MUST consider
all life on Earth,

37
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,759
not just the prosperity
of a single species!

38
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,659
THAT presumes your own
rule over creation!

39
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,359
Humans repeatedly claim
they're on the side of justice,

40
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,992
and what greater justice is
there than natural selection?!

41
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:04,292
The human race has
been inhabited,

42
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:05,792
and relinquished of the
sacred duty

43
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,892
by preserving the balance
of life on Earth!

44
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:13,159
Thus, exposing YOU as nothing
but parasites infesting
this planet!

45
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:17,059
It's you...

46
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,026
You are the infection!

47
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:26,692
We're the... infection?

48
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:28,259
[RADIO] Fire!
(multiple gunshots)

49
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,026
(urk!)

50
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:34,826
(ungh...)

51
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,959
(thump!)

52
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:45,659
(running steps)
(nervous breaths)

53
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,526
[SOLDIER 2] What's wrong?

54
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:05,826
[SOLDIER] The mayor was a human.
[SOLDIER 2] He what?!

55
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:07,992
(loud crash)
[BOTH] (huh?!)

56
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:25,726
Hirokawa, huh?

57
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,192
Right up to the end, I never did
quite understand him.

58
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:33,759
Reiko Tamura was
especially intrigued by him,

59
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:36,692
and had several
initiatives underway.

60
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:40,226
But that's all over now.

61
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:45,292
(chuckles)
This must be rather upsetting...

62
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,692
a human like this among you.

63
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:52,759
[KATSUMATA] (waaahhh!)

64
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,526
No... no... I don't...

65
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:58,326
Wh‐what the hell is this?
What happened here?!

66
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:01,692
[URAGAMI] I'm tellin' ya,
this was that guy from before.

67
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,226
He's more powerful
than the others are.

68
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:07,926
I mean you can't even shoot him.

69
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:13,926
Report.

70
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:16,092
[RADIO] Hirokawa has been
neutralized, but...

71
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:18,426
Well, another parasite
has arrived.
(gunfire)

72
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:19,826
[YAMAGISHI] (huh?!)

73
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,326
We'll meet Minazuki Squad
and head over there.

74
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:23,559
We're on our way now.

75
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,592
(single gun shot)

76
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:29,359
(uhhh...) U‐Uragami...

77
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,359
You bastard!

78
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,592
Oh man, my hand's all numb.

79
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:36,359
Guess that's why knives've
always been my thing.

80
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,359
Say "cheese."
(gun shot)

81
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,659
(ungh...)

82
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,192
Holy shit!

83
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:46,426
It blew his whole hand off!

84
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,492
You had to know this would
happen, Detective.

85
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:51,092
I mean, I was already
on death row.

86
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:54,059
I've got nothing to lose.

87
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,826
(loud clatter)

88
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,326
<i>Now to get outta here.</i>

89
00:06:58,426 --> 00:07:02,726
<i>That big guy is so powerful</i>
<i>he'll break through eventually,</i>

90
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:07,126
<i>and that's MY chance.</i>

91
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:11,159
[GOTO] Reiko Tamura would often
question our purpose here,

92
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,692
and wonder why we were born.

93
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,026
I guess...
none of that matters anymore.

94
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,659
The reason for my existence
is to fight.

95
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:33,292
[MIGI] Shinichi, let's go home.
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

96
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:38,792
There's no point in us
staying any longer.

97
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,226
After all, our work here
is finished now.

98
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,959
(whispering) How can you be
so sure about that?

99
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:48,359
And besides, we really have
to see if that Goto guy
can be taken down.

100
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,759
[MIGI] It doesn't matter.

101
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,626
The humans have already won.

102
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:56,259
If they really wanted to,
they could use cannons or
missiles or even bombs.

103
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,192
They can do whatever they want.

104
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:03,459
At this stage, we, as
individuals, no longer have
any say in what happens.

105
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:06,826
(huh?)
You're acting strange, Migi.

106
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:17,126
(naked footsteps approaching)

107
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,592
[SOLDIER] Fire!
(multiple gun shots)

108
00:08:35,492 --> 00:08:37,159
(smashes door)

109
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:41,226
[YAMAGISHI]
How can he move like that?

110
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,092
(ahhh!)

111
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:52,126
[GOTO]
You can do better than that.

112
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:56,392
Humans are supposed to be the
most intelligent life forms
on the planet.

113
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:59,026
Isn't that right?
(gun shots)

114
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:03,092
[SOLDIER] He can dodge gunfire?!
(urk!) (ungh!)

115
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:07,159
I can do more than that.
[SOLDIERS] (groaning)

116
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,292
I'm improving all the time.

117
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:14,992
Please, please don't shoot me!

118
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:16,026
Open fire.

119
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:17,526
They're beyond our help.

120
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:20,992
[SOLDIER] No, don't!
(multiple gun shots)

121
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:29,892
<i>If this monster is</i>
<i>able to move like this,</i>

122
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:33,292
<i>then that drastically limits</i>
<i>our firing options indoors.</i>

123
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:36,359
<i>We're at too great a risk</i>
<i>of shooting our own men.</i>

124
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,892
<i>We need a more open area.</i>

125
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:40,659
Let's fall back!

126
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,926
To the roof.
Let's go, now!

127
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,692
(grrr...)

128
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,392
(large explosion)

129
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,559
One more round.

130
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,559
(large explosion)

131
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,892
[SOLDIER] But shouldn't
that have finished him?

132
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:58,492
Stay vigilant.
We need to be twice as cautious,

133
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:00,792
and engage him on our terms.

134
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:06,759
<i>[YAMAGISHI] This guy's</i>
<i>comfortable using the</i>
<i>walls, floor, and ceiling.</i>

135
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:10,259
<i>Standard indoor combat tactics</i>
<i>are useless here.</i>

136
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,092
<i>This place is his lair,</i>

137
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,859
<i>and we're inside it!</i>

138
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,359
<i>It's sad to think we humans</i>
<i>lost our advantage</i>

139
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:20,692
<i>in a structure we created.</i>

140
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,892
(boom!)

141
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,759
[YAMAGISHI] All right,
split up left and right!

142
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:28,126
We'll take him out here!
(gasps)

143
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:34,859
[GOTO] What talk is this?
(door squeaking)

144
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,359
Son of a bitch...

145
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,026
You're all alone, Captain.

146
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:43,192
You don't have any more men
left to help you out.

147
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,692
Although, I should say...

148
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,126
They wouldn't've helped anyway.

149
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:55,726
(wind blowing)

150
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:59,292
That body of yours seems
to be rather special.

151
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,059
It's like it's armored!

152
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,292
That's correct.

153
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:06,059
But it doesn't protect
my entire body, unfortunately.

154
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,992
There are gaps.

155
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:13,026
Through sheer firepower,
you actually got the better
of me to some extent.

156
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,392
(grrr...)

157
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:20,159
(gun shots)

158
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,792
Even if I harden my cells,

159
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:25,626
deflecting gunshots head‐on
is still a risky proposition,

160
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,192
which is why I deflect
them at an angle.

161
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:31,059
Godammit!
Don't toy with me!

162
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,826
(large explosion)

163
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,759
(smug chuckle) (gasps)

164
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:37,892
Although I am able
to dodge gunfire,

165
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:40,526
it's not that I actually
move faster than a bullet.

166
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:46,126
I just predict its trajectory
based on my opponents' eye
and hand movements.

167
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:48,892
[YAMAGISHI] (oofff!)

168
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:55,526
[POLICE] Did you hear that?

169
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,859
[POLICE 2]
I think it came from the roof.

170
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,992
(gurgling cough)

171
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,392
[YAMAGISHI]
What the hell are you, anyway?

172
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:14,626
As you can clearly see, I am
simply a pure, feral life form.

173
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:17,859
[YAMAGISHI]
You're... an abomination.

174
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:21,959
And what are humans exactly?

175
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:24,759
Go to Hell.

176
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,492
(weak chuckle)
Oh a flamethrower, huh?

177
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,992
That might've been a good idea,
kid.

178
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,492
[SHINICHI] (ahhh...)

179
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:35,659
(loud clang) (bushes rustling)

180
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,692
See that?
Something fell from up there.

181
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:43,992
[POLICE] (WAAAHHH!)

182
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:50,626
(ugh!) Hey, what was that for?

183
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,426
[MIGI]
I told you we should leave.

184
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:56,592
[GOTO] Well, well, it's you.
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

185
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,259
(waaah...) Ah, Goto!

186
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,559
[GOTO] I see...

187
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,159
So you were involved
with this attack, too.

188
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:05,959
And it was a rather
intense battle at that.

189
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,659
In fact, it seems that
all others of my kind
were destroyed.

190
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,892
And if you were a part
of this operation,

191
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,126
there's still some
unfinished business here.

192
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:19,859
I'm sure killing you
will be most satisfying.

193
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,092
And besides,
I believe I need to kill you.

194
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:26,826
And when it's done,
I will move forward.

195
00:13:26,926 --> 00:13:29,826
"Move forward"?
(rapid gun shots)

196
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,926
Your aim was actually
quite accurate,

197
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:36,859
if you intended to
target the heart.

198
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,192
What in the hell?

199
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:41,526
But this fight must wait.

200
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:43,359
There are too many others,

201
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:46,592
and I'm feeling a
bit tired today anyway.

202
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,526
[HIRAMA] He... he just flew!

203
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:56,492
Shinichi Izumi,
what have you done?

204
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:59,492
Huh?! I didn't do anything!

205
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:01,326
I didn't! I swear!

206
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:02,926
[HIRAMA] Wait right there!

207
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,359
A lot of men died,
well trained men...

208
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,426
men under Yamagishi's command.

209
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:12,192
You saw it.
All it took was one monster,

210
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,726
and it was able to overtake us.

211
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:17,759
You expect me to believe
you knew nothing?

212
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,359
You're doing it again.

213
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,659
You're hiding something, dammit!

214
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:25,159
No, I'm not!
I honestly had no idea

215
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,959
that just one of these things
could do something like this!

216
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:29,259
[POLICE] A head!

217
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,892
Someone's head
fell off the roof!

218
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:40,059
Hey, Shinichi.
[SHINICHI] (waaah!)

219
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,659
(panicked breathing)

220
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:48,926
[MIGI] Shinichi,
that was a terrible dream.

221
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,692
(deep breath)

222
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:54,092
Migi, how do you know
what I dreamed about?

223
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,026
I just do somehow.

224
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,026
Will Goto be coming after us?

225
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:01,859
He most definitely will,
and it'll be soon.

226
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,959
I could sense how strong
his resolve was.

227
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:08,859
[SHINICHI]
So... We're going to die.

228
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,526
[MIGI] No, we can't
give up that easily.

229
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:14,592
We should try to
go get some help.

230
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:16,559
Like Uda, for example.

231
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:17,959
[SHINICHI] Forget it.

232
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,026
We can't drag
those two into this.

233
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,426
Well, we can get
the humans to help.

234
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:25,126
They can deploy the military
against him again.

235
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:26,626
How can we do that?!

236
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,926
And even if we did,
countless more people will die!

237
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:32,659
And we'd be responsible
for their deaths!

238
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,726
Why should I care?

239
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:40,192
(chuckles)

240
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,626
Migi...

241
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,892
You never really do change,
do you?

242
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,959
[SHINICHI] <i>Dad...</i>

243
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:52,692
<i>I'm afraid I might be</i>
<i>saying goodbye soon.</i>

244
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:54,992
<i>And Mom...</i>

245
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:58,292
<i>I might be</i>
<i>seeing you again soon.</i>

246
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,659
[SHINICHI] I got it.

247
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,559
Why don't we just
run somewhere far away?

248
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,626
I mean he's not...
He can't be so obsessed

249
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:09,626
he'd track us across
the country right?

250
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:12,726
Hey, Migi, are you asleep?

251
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:20,226
Ah! I forgot to go
to school today.

252
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:25,059
(laughs) ...school!

253
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:28,092
(huh?)

254
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:29,492
<i>Are you asleep?!</i>

255
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:30,959
<i>Migi!</i>

256
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,926
(gasps)

257
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:38,159
(waaah!)

258
00:16:39,226 --> 00:16:40,292
(huh?)

259
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:42,059
(panicked running)

260
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:54,059
[SHINICHI] If he shows up now...

261
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,759
(whimpering)

262
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:02,259
If he... if he shows up now...

263
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,026
(ugh)

264
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,292
Hey!

265
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,559
You gonna apologize, asshole.

266
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:13,059
I... I'm sorry.

267
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,559
He's totally scared, dude!

268
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,692
Get down on your knees.

269
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:22,526
Please forgive me.
I am so sorry.

270
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,559
[PUNK] That's a good boy.

271
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,026
(WAAAHHH!)

272
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:27,226
(ungh!)

273
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,292
[PUNK 2] No, no! (ugh!)

274
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:30,892
I apologized, didn't I?!

275
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,626
You got what you wanted, huh?!

276
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,526
I said it! I said it!

277
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,659
Are you happy now?!

278
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,226
(gasps)

279
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:51,992
[SATOMI] Shinichi?

280
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:53,759
Um, hey there.

281
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:55,526
(uh...)

282
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:02,792
Ah, so did you really
skip school again today?

283
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:04,026
Uh‐huh.

284
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,626
I sure did.

285
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:10,259
Just the kind of guy I am,
ya know?

286
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:13,392
I'm a scumbag.

287
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,726
Uh, what was that?

288
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:17,692
You're acting weird.

289
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:24,559
(soft chuckle)

290
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,892
(half‐sobs)

291
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:28,059
Wha...

292
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,159
[SHINICHI] (whimpering)

293
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,892
Stop that! It hurts!

294
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:35,326
Please, let go.

295
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,292
Stop it!

296
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:39,592
[BOTH] (heavy breathing)

297
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,092
(grrr...)

298
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:45,859
[SATOMI] (ah!) Shinichi?!

299
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:55,137
(dog barking)

300
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,303
[MIGI] Your idea to run far away
may not be a bad one, Shinichi.

301
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,803
Oh, hey.
Guess you were awake then, huh?

302
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:12,637
Just run away... Yeah...

303
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:16,370
And right when I'm finally
so close to graduating.

304
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,770
(chuckle)

305
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,370
[MIGI] Shinichi...

306
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,003
Your senses seem to be
a little dull at the moment.

307
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:25,437
(huh?!)

308
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:28,437
Well, hello there.

309
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:31,103
[SHINICHI] How did you know
you could find me here?

310
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,270
(sighs)

311
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,203
[SATOMI] You really like
this park, don't you?

312
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:40,037
I kinda like it, too.

313
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,270
[SHINICHI]
I'm sorry about before.

314
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,437
I didn't mean
to scare you like that.

315
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:51,503
You're a pretty mysterious guy,
y'know, Shinichi?

316
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:54,337
Sometimes, I just don't
get you at all.

317
00:19:59,037 --> 00:20:01,170
It's cold out here.

318
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,303
You wanna come over to my place?

319
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:05,503
So we can talk?

320
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:08,637
There's nobody else home now.

321
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:14,103
[SHINICHI]
<i>Your true nature shows</i>
<i>when your life is on the line.</i>

322
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:18,303
<i>And it turns out,</i>
<i>I'm just pathetic.</i>

323
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:22,337
<i>All I can think of is that</i>
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

324
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,337
<i>I want to live!</i>

325
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:29,637
<i>And I wanna keep living.</i>

326
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:40,337
<i>I've often told Migi he's</i>
<i>cold‐blooded, but...</i>

327
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:42,637
<i>but I don't have</i>
<i>any right to say that.</i>

328
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:45,270
<i>When all's said and done,</i>

329
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:50,137
<i>I've only made it this far</i>
<i>by stepping on those around me.</i>

330
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:54,270
[SATOMI] Shinichi...

331
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,370
You're actually a
pretty good guy, aren't you?

332
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:04,003
The two of us have gone through
a lot together, haven't we?

333
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:07,403
So even if something
bad happens, we'll be okay.

334
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:10,370
We can make it.

335
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,003
Murano...

336
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:14,770
I think that I might...

337
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:16,737
love you.

338
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,337
[SATOMI] (giggles)

339
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:24,570
Shinichi, that's a heavy thing
to just drop on a girl.

340
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:32,270
[SHINICHI] <i>I will live!</i>

341
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,737
<i>I'll do whatever it takes!</i>

342
00:22:56,303 --> 00:23:00,070
[SHINICHI]
Next time:
"Repose and Awakening"
