1
00:00:06,952 --> 00:00:09,141
[MIGI]
I'm sorry but I have some
bad news for you, Shinichi.

2
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:11,408
What is it Migi?
What's going on!

3
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:13,374
You need to hurry up,
right now.

4
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:15,574
[SHINICHI]
Are you sure it's him?

5
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:18,608
[MIGI]
These signals are very
intense and focused.

6
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:22,174
And given the speed of approach,
he must be in a car.

7
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:24,508
Here. Take a right
at the corner.

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,008
[SHINICHI]
Great!
Now I'm a thief.

9
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:29,141
[MIGI]
Such matters are
trivial at this point.

10
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:30,741
So, uh, Migi...

11
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,308
I have to ask,
when did you learn
to drive a car?

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,308
I did master human language
in a single day, if you recall.

13
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:41,141
Okay, I need a
favor from you.

14
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,574
Please take us
out to somewhere
less populated.

15
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:47,408
If we try to fight him
in the city, a lot of
people could die.

16
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,074
Very well.

17
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:54,608
Also, I have an idea
that's definitely
worth a shot.

18
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:06,274
Hm?

19
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:52,141
[SHINICHI]
Well?

20
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:55,541
[MIGI]
It didn't work.
He's still alive.

21
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,241
He's extremely resilient.

22
00:02:58,341 --> 00:02:59,674
Let's get out of here.

23
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:01,208
Where can we go?

24
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:03,241
Just run.

25
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:15,341
[MIGI]
Okay. Stop here.

26
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,074
[Catching his breath]

27
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:19,608
Why are we stopping now?

28
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,108
I thought we
couldn't afford to
waste time, right?!

29
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,474
Take a breath.

30
00:03:23,574 --> 00:03:25,808
Until he catches up,
we really should strategize.

31
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:27,341
"Strategize" now?!

32
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,974
We are about to be
chopped into
little pieces!

33
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:32,374
Shinichi, I know
what you're feeling.

34
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,474
Anyone would fear
being killed.

35
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:36,208
I'm afraid, too.

36
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:38,808
But this...
this is our
moment of truth.

37
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:40,608
Ah...

38
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,508
Now remember, you have
a strength that other
humans don't possess.

39
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:48,208
And you can be calm,
no matter what the
circumstances are.

40
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,708
Now, put your hand
on your chest

41
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:53,408
and breathe deeply,
like always.

42
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:59,008
[Deep breaths]

43
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,708
Good.
Well done.

44
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:06,441
[MIGI]
Listen.

45
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,674
Yes, Goto's abilities outclass
ours in every possible way.

46
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:14,108
Simple logic says
we have almost
no chance of winning...

47
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,774
In which case,
I say we shift
our line of thought.

48
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:22,108
If it's not possible
for us to win even if
we work together...

49
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,341
then maybe we ought
to give working
separately a try.

50
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:26,374
Do what?

51
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,741
Sometimes sheer strength
can be beaten...

52
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,941
by pure chance.

53
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,141
"Chance," huh?

54
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,974
I took a lighter
from that car,

55
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:35,474
and I put it inside
your left pocket.

56
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,574
Well now...

57
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:49,841
They've used the branches
to spread out in all
four directions.

58
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,574
How uninspired.

59
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:54,674
[Migi voiceover]
This will be a race
against time.

60
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:59,608
The human body is our
lifeline, but it's also
our greatest weakness.

61
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,008
The cells within you
that were once part of me

62
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:03,274
have since been altered..

63
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:05,641
and are now
completely integrated.

64
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,974
Therefore, Goto won't
be able to detect you.

65
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:13,808
He'll come straight toward me
without ever noticing
you at all.

66
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:17,641
If this fight goes on too long,
I'll shrivel up and die.

67
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:19,308
It's indeed a reckless plan...

68
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:23,708
But that's exactly why Goto
is not likely to see it coming.

69
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:45,441
[GOTO]
What's this?
No counterattack at all?

70
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:50,141
<i>Where is the human boy?</i>

71
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:55,108
<i>Once I've found and destroyed</i>
<i>the host, it's finished.</i>

72
00:05:55,208 --> 00:06:00,208
[Migi voiceover]
His body is protected by
an armor of semi‐hardened
parasitic cells...

73
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:03,974
but I doubt very much that
they cover the entire surface.

74
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:07,641
That said, there's no time
to search for the gaps
in his armor.

75
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:10,508
But I believe the area
least likely to be protected,

76
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:13,108
and therefore the most
optimal target...

77
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,074
would be... his head.

78
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:21,174
Controlling the multiple
parasites throughout
his torso and limbs

79
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:24,074
must require a tremendous
amount of energy.

80
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:27,141
So it must be very difficult
for the head already.

81
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:30,241
That means, if we can
remove the head,

82
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:31,974
he should lose control,

83
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:35,774
disabling enough protection
for us to be able to
destroy the body.

84
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,708
[SHINICHI]
<i>Come on, Migi...</i>

85
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:40,574
<i>If we don't hurry up, then</i>
<i>you're not gonna make it...</i>

86
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,574
[Migi voiceover]
We'll have just one chance.

87
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:45,208
Goto's speed and power
are far greater than mine,

88
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:47,308
so decapitating him
won't be easy.

89
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:52,741
[MIGI]
<i>Uh oh. My consciousness is</i>
<i>already starting to fade.</i>

90
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:54,141
<i>I'll have to hurry.</i>

91
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:56,641
<i>But I still don't</i>
<i>have a good angle.</i>

92
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:58,708
Come out! You cowards!

93
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,574
Am I really that terrible?!

94
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:04,641
Spreading out in all directions
is nothing but temporary
camouflage at best!

95
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:08,241
You should be using your brains
to fight, not run and hide!

96
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:09,741
[Migi imitating Shinichi]
Go now! Do it!

97
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:11,108
[SHINICHI]
<i>Was that my voice?</i>

98
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,341

100
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,541
[Stab]
Huh?

101
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:20,508
[Migi voiceover]
When exposed directly to fire,

102
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:24,174
Goto's surface cells will
reflexively break away
from his control...

103
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:26,308
And when that happens...

104
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:30,074
U‐ugh...

105
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:32,441

00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:42,374
We have failed.

have to die!

Hmph... People out there
can do some awful things
to each other.

175
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,222
Uh... Oh...

176
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:40,322
[SHINICHI]
<i>I never expected such</i>
<i>kindness from a stranger.</i>

177
00:11:40,422 --> 00:11:43,022
Thank you so much
for everything.

178
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:45,789
You should probably
stay here for the night.

179
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:49,089
Huh?
No, I couldn't possibly.

180
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:51,756
Where else are you plannin'
to go at this hour?

181
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:54,722
There aren't any
hotels around here.

182
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:56,156
Uh, Ma'am,

183
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:58,189
do you live out here in the
country all by yourself?

184
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,889
Nah, I don't have any
more family left.

185
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,889
Oh... I...
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

186
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,622
Oh, it's okay, son.

187
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:08,056
You call me, Mitsuyo.

188
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:10,089
It's nice to meet you...

189
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,456
My name is...
my name's Shinichi Izumi.

190
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:15,456
Shinichi?

191
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:18,922
It's nice to meet you, too.

192
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,522
[MITSUYO]
Thanks for this,

193
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:22,789
I'm sorry to have you
help with the shopping.

194
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,889
[SHINICHI]
Oh no, it's no problem.

195
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,189
It's the least I can do.

196
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,489
[MITSUYO]
We should probably tell
everybody that you're my nephew.

197
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:33,022
[SHINICHI]
Nephew?

198
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:35,256
A lot of strange things
have been going on lately.

199
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:37,956
People really don't like
outsiders around.

200
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:41,322
[SHINICHI]
"Strange things"?

201
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:44,089
[MITSUYO]
This is what I was
talking about.

202
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,756
Some company keeps
coming out here

203
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:49,822
and dumping these huge
truckloads of garbage...

204
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:51,889
One time,
it actually caught fire

205
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:54,389
and nearly burned up
the whole mountain.

206
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:59,456
The big cities are having
trouble finding room
for all their crap,

207
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,122
but this is ridiculous.

208
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:02,856
[SHINICHI]
Yeah...

209
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,356
Everybody around here's
been trying to keep watch,

210
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:09,322
but they still manage to
slip in here and dump more.

211
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,889
I don't know how
those assholes do it.

212
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:17,222
[SHINICHI]
<i>Mitsuyo may be</i>
<i>a little nuts, but</i>
<i>she's got a kind heart.</i>

213
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:20,922
<i>Still, every time I try to</i>
<i>thank her and leave...</i>

214
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:24,789
<i>she stops me with another</i>
<i>barrage of conversation.</i>

215
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,389
<i>With Migi gone, I honestly</i>
<i>have no idea what to do next...</i>

216
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:33,989
<i>so a few hours have turned</i>
<i>into several days.</i>

217
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:38,389
<i>But I can't keep</i>
<i>imposing on her forever...</i>

218
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:42,456
<i>I really must go home and</i>
<i>tell Dad what's going on.</i>

219
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,489
<i>About how I lost my arm...</i>

220
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,556
<i>And how I had a friend...</i>

221
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:49,356
<i>named Migi...</i>

222
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,022
<i>About the day that Migi</i>
<i>first showed up...</i>

223
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,489
<i>and all the things</i>
<i>we did together...</i>

224
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:56,156
<i>And about...</i>

225
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:59,156
<i>about how great Migi was.</i>

226
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,789
<i>He fought for me.</i>

227
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,022
<i>Saved me...</i>

228
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:05,956
<i>He was intelligent,</i>
<i>courageous...</i>

229
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:08,356
<i>And better than</i>
<i>I could ever be.</i>

230
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:11,322
<i>Because Migi...</i>

231
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:13,956
<i>is a true hero!</i>

232
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,689
[SHINICHI]
<i>Where am I?</i>

233
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:23,256
<i>I feel like I've</i>
<i>been here before...</i>

234
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:24,389
<i>What is that?</i>

235
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,722
Uh, who are you?

236
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:28,556
[MIGI]
What's wrong?
Did you lose something?

237
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:29,956
Have I lost...

238
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:32,256
Oh, that's right.
I'm looking for a friend.

239
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:35,889
Looking for your friend?
What do they look like?

240
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:37,756
Look like?

241
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:39,356
I can't really
remember that.

242
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:41,522
I'm afraid you're
on your own then.

243
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:42,989
Hey, wait!

244
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,589
I think he
looked like you.

245
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:47,489
That's right!
I remember now...

246
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,322
But... He...

247
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,556
He died.

248
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,656
What?
Your friend's dead?

249
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:53,822
Yeah.

250
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:55,722
No. No he's not.

251
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:57,422
He's still alive.

252
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,456
What?!

253
00:14:58,556 --> 00:14:59,622
I can tell.

254
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:02,722
Actually, I know
his name, too.

255
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:04,222
His name...

256
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:06,089
His name...?

257
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,522
Migi!

258
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:11,556
[Panting]

259
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:14,989
[Gasp]

260
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:17,289
Ah... Migi!

261
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:21,556
<i>Some of his cells</i>
<i>are still inside me!</i>

262
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:22,989
Hey, there..!
It's me!

263
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,689
Don't you remember?!

264
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:27,122
[MITSUYO]
Keep it down a little bit...

265
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:30,422
You're talking in your sleep.

266
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:33,589
Oh!

267
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:36,056
<i>It's no good.</i>

268
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:37,956
<i>There's still some</i>
<i>of him in there,</i>

269
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:40,856
<i>but not enough</i>
<i>to do anything.</i>

270
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,156
<i>Migi...</i>

271
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,956
<i>Migi!</i>

272
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:51,456
[Terrified screams]

273
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:55,589
[Frantic running and screams]

274
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:02,556
[MITSUYO]
I see. Well, I guess
it is what it is.

275
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:06,222
And I suppose I just can't
keep you here forever.

276
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:09,389
I don't know how I'll ever
be able to repay you
for your kindness.

277
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:10,789
Hm...

278
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:13,289
[Knocking on door]
Hm?
Hm?

279
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,056
What's your problem?

280
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:17,489
Don't you know
how early it is?

281
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:18,922
Okay boy, now talk to us!

282
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:21,056
You really expect us to
believe you're her nephew?

283
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:23,556
Hm?
Oh what the hell
difference does it make?

284
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:26,522
Besides, the kid was just
about to head out anyway.

285
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:27,989
Oh, I don't think so!

286
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,622
There's been way too much
going on around here lately.

287
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:32,256
All that illegal trash dumping

288
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,822
and then that crash between
two cars without any drivers...

289
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:36,156
Uh...

290
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:37,922
And now, we have a
murder on our hands.

291
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:39,589
Uh...
Haah?!

292
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:43,389
Nakano, you said the killer
was some outsider, right?

293
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:45,489
Well take a look at 'im.

294
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,856
I'm tellin' ya, that
thing I saw wasn't
just some "outsider"...

295
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:53,122
This kid has been with
me the whole time‐

296
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,489
It wasn't no human,
ya understand?!

297
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:57,422
I wasn't just
seein' things!

298
00:16:57,522 --> 00:16:59,056
It was three meters tall!

299
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:02,922
A‐and... that thing it had
like four front legs!

300
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,122
And a whole bunch of eyes
all over the place!

301
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:08,989
I'm serious!
I'm not making this up!
<i>That's Goto. It's gotta be.</i>

302
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:12,022
Look, you guys can call me
crazy all you want...

303
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:15,789
But this blood, that's all
over my coat is from Kitayama!

304
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:18,922
And some horrible monster
killed and ate him,

305
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:20,589
he lives right down the road!

306
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,889
You gotta believe me!

307
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:27,456
[DETECTIVE]
So it was around
here somewhere?

308
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:31,322
[NAKANO]
Yessir...
that's right.

309
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:35,222
Oh! Uhh...

310
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,356
Ah, that is
just horrible.

311
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,522
Wait a second, this is just
like those stories that
were in the news.

312
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:43,322
Uhh...
The Mincemeat Murders...

313
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:48,438
Right.

314
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,538
Understood.

315
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,338
A bunch of local hunters are
getting together tomorrow,

316
00:17:56,438 --> 00:18:01,605
and they ought to be able
to take this "monster"
of yours down for good.

317
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,938
Hunting rifles...
will not destroy him.

318
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:08,105
Huh...?
"Destroy him"?

319
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:11,572
You mean, you know about
this monster thing?

320
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:13,472
Yes, I do...

321
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:15,505
That's how I wound up here...

322
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:16,638
He's after me.

323
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:19,138
Huh?! Oh, quit talking
such nonsense.

324
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,238
So this whole thing
is my fault!

325
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:22,638
He followed me here...

326
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:24,938
And now more people
have been killed!

327
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,772
I'm gonna have to keep moving
or others will die too.

328
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,972
Come on, son.

329
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:33,372
All I wanted was to live...

330
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:35,338
No matter what it took...

331
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:38,605
Even though some
of my friends have
already died for me.

332
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:40,372
But I can't...

333
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:44,105
I can't keep running away
from this forever can I?!

334
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:46,472
Why can't you?

335
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:53,605
If it saves you then why not?
Just keep on running...

336
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:56,938
If it can save your life,
then you have to do it.

337
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,572
There's no shame
in that, son.

338
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,505
Mitsuyo, I can't.

339
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:05,505
There are things I've
avoided that now I must do!

340
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:08,738
I must sacrifice myself
and face that monster...

341
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:11,138
before any more people
out there get slaughtered!

342
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:13,205
Oh, shut up and
cut the crap!

343
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:14,538
Don't be a jackass!

344
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:17,305
What is this
"sacrifice myself" trash?

345
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:18,705
How can you talk
such bullshit?!

346
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:21,205
Who the hell do you
think you are anyway?!

347
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,772
Sacrifice yourself?
What a freakin joke!

348
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:27,838
What could a snot‐nosed brat
like you do about it anyway?!

349
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,638
Sigh...

350
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,372
Look, I might not know
your whole story...

351
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,305
but I think you need
to sit back

352
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:40,938
and just let the grownups
handle this situation.

353

[MITSUYO]
So, you're determined are ya?

354
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:54,205
Don't you have someone
special out there...

355
00:19:54,305 --> 00:19:55,838
someone you care about?

356
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:58,838
Someone you know.
Someone you wish you knew.

357
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:02,172
Just someone out there
you can't leave behind...

358
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:03,272
You know...

359
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:05,905
S‐someone that
makes you...

360
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,505
human...

361
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:11,738
Look, I don't know what
your plan is or anything...

362
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:16,705
but you at least owe it
to yourself to give
some thought...

363
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:20,105
to something else...
anything else.

364
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:24,472
Because, son, once you've
thrown it all away,
then that's it.

365
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:27,538
I'm just sayin' don't
give up, no matter what,

366
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:31,638
and remember that
there's always an option.

367
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,805
Hold on...

368
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,738
Is there anything I can
give you that you can use?

369
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:46,005
A weapon or whatever?

370
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:48,172
Uh...

371
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:50,538
Ah...
I'll take this.

372
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:53,772
Really, you seriously
want that old thing?

373
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:56,672
Well I guess it's
better than nothing.

374
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:58,272
Hm.

<i>Please dear...</i>

376
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,338

<i>If Goto has changed</i>

378
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:26,872
<i>then there'll be no way</i>
<i>to recognize him...</i>

379
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:28,138
<i>But I guess...</i>

380
00:21:28,238 --> 00:21:30,405
<i>I'll just have to</i>
<i>deal with it...</i>

381
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:33,938
<i>whenever that time comes...</i>
