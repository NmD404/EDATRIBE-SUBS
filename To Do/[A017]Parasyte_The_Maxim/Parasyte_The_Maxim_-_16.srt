00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:13,379
[KUSANO]
Okay... as for the
detective himself...

2
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:15,312
[HIKAWA]
I'll deal with him...

3
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:17,712
What about the human
with the parasite arm?

4
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:21,345
Of course... Miki is
heading that way tomorrow.

00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:24,145
[Firetruck sirens]

6
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,912
Hm?

7
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:33,945
Ah! Yoko! Yumi!

8
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:35,712
Oh!

9
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:39,945
[Shocked]

10
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,679
[Crying]

11
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:19,845
[MIKI]
Given your
situation...

12
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:23,579
I would imagine that
your combat style must
be truly unique.

13
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:27,212
Must be how you've dealt with
my kind so easily up until now.

14
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:31,645
But what I can't understand
is how having a human brain
still intact

15
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,545
could actually make
you stronger.

16
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:36,779
Judging by the condition
of the body left in
our dining area,

17
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,779
it would seem to indicate
your victory did not
happen instantly.

18
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,179
Hahaha...

19
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:49,145
What's wrong? Was that not an
appropriate moment to laugh?

20
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:51,445
So, how do you manage to do it?

21
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:55,212
I'd love to get a
demonstration of your
special fighting techniques.

22
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:56,879
Man... What's with this guy?

23
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:59,445
He's creepy as hell
and won't shut up.

24
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:00,912
[MIGI]
Stay alert...

25
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:03,079
He's only attempting to
figure us out right now.

26
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,712
And no matter how expressive
he may seem to you,

27
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,145
never forget that it's something
completely different

28
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:10,179
from actual human emotions.

29
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:15,345
Ohh... So you talk to each other
while you're fighting.

30
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,112
And that's an effective system?

31
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:18,412
Ah...

32
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:23,045
You certainly have impressive
speed and motion detection...

33
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:25,479
which means that bringing
you back in one piece

34
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,812
could prove to be
a rather difficult task.

35
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:30,112
[Shinichi grunting]
[MIGI]
There are too many blades!

36
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:31,679
So? Make more!

37
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,679
I'm afraid it doesn't
work that way.

38
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:36,912
There's a certain minimum
size requirement.

39
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,712
Ugh!

40
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:47,112
Hehehe...

41

[Panting]

42
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:52,645
That guy sure is pretty slow.

43
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,979
[MIGI]
True, you are faster
than he is...

44
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,579
but it's not as if you have
all that much stamina.

45
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:01,112
[Panting]
Yeah. I've been
running all day!

46
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:03,045
I'm really tired!

47
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,845
I agree. I am, too.

48
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,412
That fight was short
but very intense.

49
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:11,012
I guess we're pretty
pathetic aren't we?

50
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:13,812
[Labored breathing]

51
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:17,245
Okay, I think we've put
some distance between us.

52
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:19,612
[MIGI]
He's a new type of enemy.

53
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:21,412
Three‐in‐one this time.

54
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,045
So what about his legs?
His legs?

55
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:26,812
Well it's like you
told me in our
last fight...

56
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:28,812
that the human part
is the weakness.

57
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:32,445
If we can attack
his legs somehow...

58
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:33,712
Aah...

59
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:36,379
What's wrong?
We can't do it?

60
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,045
I'm worried...

61
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,145
I can't seem to get
a feel for how his
parasites are distributed.

62
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,879
But you said there
are three of them,
didn't you?

63
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,579
So they have
to be the head
and arms, right?

64
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,245
Logically, yes,
but something is wrong...

65
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:50,979
[Truck approching[

66
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,279
Uh...

67
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,845
[MIGI]
He's here. He caught up to us.

68
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:57,712
Ah!

69
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:02,445
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh!

70
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:04,245
[SHINICHI]
Here we go again.

71
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,245
[MIGI]
"Again"?

72
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:06,379
[MIKI]
Ugh!

73
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,345
I swear.
You sure do like to run.

74
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:11,079
And it's getting kind of old.

75
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,812
I guess I'll have to forget
about leaving your body intact.

76
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,612
Okay, it's time to gamble...

77
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:20,345
Let's aim for the legs,
just like you said.
Hm.

78
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,412
[MIGI]
I'll block the next
attacks that come
toward your right side.

79
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:27,312
You'll need to hold your
ground while dodging
attacks on the left side.

80
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:29,779
And how am I
supposed to do that?

81
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:40,012
[MIKI]
Huh?

82
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,312
[MIGI]
Peculiar.

83
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:44,079
Haha... Shall we finish?!

84
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,412
Ah!

85
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:52,545
What the‐?

86
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:53,712
[SHINICHI]
What was that?!

87
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,379
That was a
mid‐air collision,

88
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,712
and between his own
tentacles, no less.

89
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:58,745
Huh?!

90
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:01,012
I see his true nature
clearer now.

91
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,612
"True nature"?

92
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:05,645
Indeed... Seeing this new type
was quite a shock at first,

93
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:07,912
but he might turn out
to be mostly show.

94
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:09,212
I sure hope so.

95
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:10,879
As for the three parasites...

96
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,245
they're distributed through
more than his head and arms.

97
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:17,112
For instance, that leg
I was able to cut
earlier wasn't human.

98
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:18,445
It wasn't?!

99
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,179
Either way, I'm certain
that the head is,

100
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,779
in fact, the control center.

101
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,012
And I don't sense independent
thought in his arms' movements.

102
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:27,212
Look out.

103
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:29,545
I'll run as many
times as it takes!

104
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:32,979
I've found a good location.

105
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,079
Go into the woods right here.

106
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,979
[MIGI]
His control center
isn't that competent.

107
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,479
There's no cohesion to
his bodily movements,

108
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:44,945
which is why he falls down
and runs into himself.

109
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:47,512
Most importantly, his head
should be parasitic,

110
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:50,179
so why doesn't it morph
and join in the attack?

111
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,545
Good question!

112
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,545
I think the head has
a hard enough time

113
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,212
just governing the arms
and other parasite areas.

114
00:06:56,312 --> 00:07:00,012
Meaning, the head has to
stay intact or the entire
system falls apart.

115
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:02,612
So, it's actually not
at all that difficult.

116
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:04,612
In the end,
he's just a single enemy.

117
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:06,379
Right... We'll fight here...

118
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,912
Stop running.

119
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,612
Rather than the legs or torso,
let's aim for the neck...

120
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:14,212
Severing the head is the
surest way to victory.

121
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:15,912
Y'think we can get to it?

122
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:18,345
We can! Whenever I give
you the signal,

123
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:20,412
I want you to run
directly toward him...

124
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:21,912
And at full speed.

125
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:23,012
What?!

126
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:24,845
You'll just have to trust me.

127
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:29,445
[MIKI]
Sigh! I'm really
getting tired of this.

128
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:31,079
Now don't you move!

129
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:34,345
[MIGI]
Use the trees as a shield
and maintain your distance.

130
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:36,912
Dodge his attacks by
moving in all directions.

131
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:39,745
If you avoid him by just
using a linear pattern,

132
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:43,012
he'll be able to learn our
movements and predict
our next move...

133
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:45,079
Until suddenly...

134
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,512
Now!

135
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,112
[MIKI]
Huh?

136
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:50,379
[MIGI]
From his perspective,

137
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,612
a prey that has done
nothing but run away

138
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,279
now is suddenly
coming at him.

139
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,879
Parallel becomes perpendicular,
horizontal becomes vertical...

140
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:59,745
For someone struggling just
to control his tentacles,

141
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:02,112
he won't be able to
track our trajectory.

142
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:04,945
Haa!

143
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,512
Yeah!

144
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:17,479
[MIGI]
Gasp!

145
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,712
What's wrong?

146
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:21,712
I didn't know...
that was possible!

147
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,145
[GOTO]
Now it's my turn.

148
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,612
Uh...

149
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:33,512
Get over here, Miki.

150
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:37,479
[MIKI]
Yeah, sorry 'bout that.

151
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:42,512
[GOTO]
Irrelevant. As I suspected,
you're better suited to
remain a subordinate.

152
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:44,745
[MIGI]
So there weren't really
three of them.

153
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:45,812
What?!

154
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:48,179
Look. He is now
completely one being.

155
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,412
In an instant, he took control
of the entire body and
became a single life form.

156
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:56,779
But just before that happened,
his consciousness split into
five separate pieces.

157
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,812
In other words, there are a
total of five parasites
in that one body!

158
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:02,245
Ah‐no way!

159
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:03,979
When the first one was
acting as the head,

160
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,379
I felt that there were three
because he wasn't capable

161
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,879
of unifying all of them
at the same time.

162
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:10,412
Yes, that's correct.

163
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:13,312
Only Miki and I can act
as the controller.

164
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:16,879
And only I am able to unify
all of us together.

165
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:19,645
Wow...
[MIGI]
Yes.

166
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:22,812
But now is not the
time to be impressed.

167
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:27,979
It seems we must've come
quite some distance
while I was asleep.

168
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:31,112
We've met before.... Yes?

169
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,079
It's that guy!

170
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,545
He moves different
from before!

171
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:43,412
Gah! Ah!

172
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,745
[MIGI]
Not even apes can
move like that!

173
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:56,979
Being in the woods is now
a disadvantage for us!

[MIGI]
Very impressive.

I understand your pain
all too well. But, sir‐

209

Is there a detective
here named Hirama?

Yes, Chief?

come to know...

218
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:45,412

some new clothes.

you get that?

From that truck

Before you say it,
I am not human,

about your human

You're my hand, y'know?

234
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:25,079

and I are completely

we have developed
an alliance...

one another.

With that in mind,

239
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:37,379
what do you think is the
common purpose that unites us?

240
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,679
To survive.

and daughter,

saying that a bladed weapon
was used in the attack.

246
00:13:56,968 --> 00:14:00,235
Furthermore, Kuramori's office,
which handled private
investigations,

247
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:04,201
burned to the ground the same
night in what is believed to
have been an act of arson.

248
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,401
Police have said that they plan
to question Kuramori

249
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,601
about any possible connection
between the two incidents.

250
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,468
[MIGI]
They must have decided he's
too dangerous to be kept alive.

251

His family was probably
just collateral damage.

252

Most likely their primary
target, the detective, escaped.

the rules and anything?

And y'know, ever since
Mom's been gone I've tried
really hard to help out,

270

you can trust...

that you're safe.

My sincere condolences

Currently, they're still
being examined for

287
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,568
but what I've already seen
has confirmed my beliefs.

Right now, I'd like
to hear what your
thoughts are.

289

00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:00,935
That's right.

00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,101
Since I was a boy...

00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,935
I've always admired
the great detectives...

Heh... You know, like...
like Sherlock Holmes...

298
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,035
but things don't always
go as planned,

299
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,735
I managed to become
a PI at least...

[Crazy giggles]

301
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:23,301

302
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:27,068
You could be...
a great detective.

303
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,135
Can we...
can we avenge their deaths?

304
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:33,635
Of course we can!

305
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:36,935
I... I have some
information.

Mm‐hm.

307
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:41,701
But I'm afraid
I'm a little
messed up right now.

308
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,401
Can I have something
to write with...

309
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:46,468
and go somewhere
I can calm down first.

310
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:48,501
Absolutely.

311
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,368
[MIGI]
No, this isn't telepathy.

312
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:54,968
[SHINICHI]
How many times
is this now?

313
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:57,835
It's our sixteenth time
to meet in your dreams...

314
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,235
Though I'm sure you'll
just forget again.

315
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,335
Yeah but, you don't
look anything at all

316
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,468
like the Migi I know
in the real world.

317
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:07,968
You say the same thing
every time we do this.

318
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,135
But then, you don't
look like the Shinichi

319
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:12,601
that I know
in reality, either.

320
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,368
What, you're
already going?

321
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,768
I've now determined that
there's simply no way

322
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:21,435
for me to communicate with
the thirty percent of my cells

323
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:24,168
that still remain scattered
throughout your body.

324
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:27,335
So there's no point
in meeting in your
dreams anymore..

325
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:30,268
More importantly, our current
situation in the real world

326
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:33,935
is such that there's
no time to lose on
such trivial matters.

327
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:35,335
I should go.

328
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:36,368
Is that so...?

329
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:38,535
You'll remember
when you wake up.

330
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:40,335
Migi!

331
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:42,035
Huh?

332
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:43,701
What was I...?

333
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,568
It's cold...

334
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:54,968
You mean both of them were
failures? Unbelievable.

335
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:56,468
The real failure was on my part

336
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:59,568
in allowing the two of you
to deal with the investigator.

337
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:02,201
Killing the family without
getting rid of him first

338
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:05,335
shows your complete ignorance
regarding human nature.

339
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,535
The room was dark
when we got there...

340
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:11,701
At any rate, it will
be simple enough just
to kill him next, correct?

341
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:17,701
[TAMURA]
You underestimate the
humans a little too much.

342
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:21,901
True, individually,
they seem like
incapable creatures...

343
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,735
But that is not the case.

344
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:27,635
You need to recognize
something that's
very important...

345
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:31,235
The human race
is actually a
single life form

346
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:34,435
comprised of billions
of separate parts.

347
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:36,968
In addition to their
individual brains,

348
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:40,001
they possess a single,
collective "consciousness."

349
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,668
And when we oppose that...

350
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:44,601
we are truly defeated.

351
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,668
[KUSANO]
<i>"Defeated"?</i>

352
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:48,935
<i>Is she truly one of us?</i>

353
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,068
<i>Something's different...</i>

354
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:54,701
<i>Something's not right.</i>

355
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,668
[SATOMI]
<i>Shinichi wasn't at</i>
<i>school again today...</i>

356
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:01,701
<i>And yesterday, he was</i>
<i>acting like something</i>
<i>was going on again...</i>

357
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:02,668
[YUKO]
Murano.

358
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:03,801
Huh?

359
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,168
[YUKO]
Got something for ya...

360
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,468
Here... Shinichi forgot it
and left it behind.

361
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:09,668
You should totally go
take it back to him.

362
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:11,201
Wha...? But I...

363
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:14,201
It'll be a chance for you
two to patch things up.

364
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:17,635
If you won't take it
back to him, then I will!

365
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,368
Mm!

366
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,839
[Knocking on door]

367
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:31,139
[MITA]
Mr. Kuramori?

368
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:32,454
He duped us.

369
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:33,987
It's not like
he's a suspect,

370
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:36,187
so why do you think
he'd run off?

371
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:37,621
Huh?

372
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,387
A list of partners...

373
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:48,254
Reiko Tamura!

374
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,154
[KURAMORI]
<i>Yoko, Yumi...</i>

375
00:19:51,254 --> 00:19:54,554
<i>I will avenge you</i>
<i>with my own hands!</i>

376
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:57,354
<i>Reiko Tamura, you're dead.</i>

377
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:00,721
[KUSANO]
<i>Reiko Tamura...</i>

378
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:03,621
<i>No. She is not one of us.</i>

379
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:05,421
<i>She's dangerous...</i>

380
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,487
<i>She's a threat...</i>

381
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:09,821
<i>a threat to our kind.</i>

382
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:15,387
[TAMURA]
<i>You are such a mystery...</i>

383
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:20,121
<i>In a world of</i>
<i>so much confusion.</i>

384
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:22,121
<i>Why was I...</i>

385
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,354
<i>No. Why were we born?</i>

386
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:28,121
[Doorbell]

387
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:31,321
[Doorbell]

388
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:33,387
[SATOMI]
<i>I didn't think so...</i>

389
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:35,887
<i>Where are you...?</i>

390
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:39,354
<i>And are you safe, Shinichi?</i>

391
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:46,854
[KURAMORI]
<i>It was you.</i>

392
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:51,254
<i>YOU are the one who</i>
<i>dragged me into this hell!</i>

393
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,787
[TAMURA]
<i>Three of them.</i>

394
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,887
<i>And their intent seems</i>
<i>less than peaceful.</i>

395
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:03,554
[KURAMORI]
<i>Where's she going?</i>

396
00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:06,121
<i>All right...</i>

397
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,887
<i>While I still</i>
<i>have the chance...</i>

398
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:21,854
Good evening, Tamura.

399
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:23,554
We can try to hide them,

400
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:25,554
but they can't be
suppressed, can they?

401
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:27,887
The strongest signals
that we emit

402
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,587
are those which
harbor animosity...

403
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:33,087
I know of your intentions.

404
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:34,687
Get on with it.

405
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:58,954
