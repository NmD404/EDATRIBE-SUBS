(owl hooting softly)

00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:06,845
[SHINICHI]
<i>Out here in the trees,</i>

3
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:10,312
<i>I don't think I can pinpoint</i>
<i>Goto by the sound of</i>
<i>his breath.</i>

4
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,545
<i>I have no chance</i>
<i>of defeating him,</i>

5
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:15,778
<i>but I feel no fear.</i>

6
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:17,712
I'm numb to it all. (gasps)
(owl screeches)

7
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:21,078
<i>The will to live,</i>
<i>anger, grief...</i>

8
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:24,145
<i>I don't feel any of those</i>
<i>emotions right now.</i>

9
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:26,978
And yet,
(owl hooting)

10
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:29,145
<i>it's like I'm being driven.</i>

11
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:31,678
<i>I'm being pulled</i>
<i>straight to him.</i>

12
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:33,878
<i>It isn't...</i>
<i>it isn't courage,</i>

13
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:39,612
<i>and it's not some sense of</i>
<i>duty to fight as a 'hero'</i>
<i>of the human race.</i>

14
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,745
<i>It's just that,</i>
<i>if I do nothing,</i>

15
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,578
<i>then I will be forced to</i>
<i>witness more deaths</i>

16
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:46,478
<i>at the hands of the monster</i>
<i>that followed me here.</i>

17
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:49,645
<i>If anything, it's a miracle</i>

18
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:52,045
<i>I've survived this long</i>
<i>as it is.</i>

19
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:55,312
<i>It's up to me to finish this.</i>

20
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:57,978
<i>Death could very well be</i>
<i>waiting at the end,</i>

21
00:00:58,078 --> 00:00:59,812
<i>but I don't care.</i>

22
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:01,745
<i>I'm just...</i>

23
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:03,812
<i>so tired of it.</i>

24
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:07,278
<i>It's like it's</i>
<i>not even real anymore.</i>

25
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,178
<i>But for some reason, I feel...</i>

26
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:12,645
<i>positive.</i>

27
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:14,345
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

28
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:18,178
<i>I feel like this thing</i>
<i>might work out somehow</i>
<i>if I just go.</i>

29
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,545
<i>Even though,</i>
<i>I know what my chances are.</i>

30
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:23,345
<i>And they're not good.</i>

31
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:25,978
<i>It's strange...</i>

32
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:29,145
<i>My senses are honed and sharp.</i>

33
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:32,978
<i>Like they're heightened</i>
<i>or something.</i>

34
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:36,545
<i>And then...</i>

35
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:38,178
<i>I found him.</i>

36
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:13,878
(wind blowing)

37
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:20,922
[SHINICHI] <i>He's sleeping.</i>

38
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:23,789
<i>I guess even they have to rest.</i>

39
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:27,189
<i>Migi slept a lot, too.</i>

40
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,589
<i>I guess I...</i>

41
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:38,022
<i>should've gone after him</i>
<i>when he was asleep.</i>

42
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:40,622
<i>It's only because</i>
<i>I'm not a parasite,</i>

43
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,622
<i>and that I'm no longer</i>
<i>joined with Migi,</i>

44
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,155
<i>that I'm able to get</i>
<i>this close to him.</i>

45
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:49,289
<i>Maybe this is why I've been</i>
<i>feeling like things are going</i>
<i>to work out somehow.</i>

46
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:53,855
<i>Well,</i>
<i>maybe there's another reason.</i>

47
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,989
<i>Migi...</i>

48
00:03:57,089 --> 00:04:01,555
<i>Could you still be alive</i>
<i>somewhere in his body?</i>

49
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,655
<i>If I called out</i>
<i>to you right now,</i>

50
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:05,655
<i>would you answer me?</i>

51
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,489
<i>Migi!</i>

52
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,122
(gasps)

53
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:12,022
<i>I should've known it</i>
<i>wouldn't be that easy.</i>

54
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:24,155
[SHINICHI] (ah!) (kyah!)
(thwack!)

55
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:26,355
(uh!) (ah!)

56
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:27,489
Dammit!

[GOTO] Some lowly little human

<i>That's right...</i>

<i>I know I can't win,</i>

<i>I will make you suffer!</i>

<i>You have more speed and power,</i>

<i>As long as I have a plan,</i>
<i>I can fight you!</i>

72
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,255
<i>But what should I do?</i>

73
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:08,522
<i>How can I possibly find a way</i>

75
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:13,889
<i>Migi,</i>
<i>please tell me what to do!</i>

76
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:17,255
You at least owe it to yourself
to give some thought

77
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:19,855
to something else,
anything else.

78
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:22,755
I'm just sayin',
don't give up no matter what,

79
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,555

83
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:34,422
<i>The back of his neck... Yes!</i>

84
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:36,255
<i>When he's controlling</i>
<i>the entire body,</i>

85
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:37,989
<i>THAT should be his weak spot.</i>

86
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,689
<i>Even if I can't win,</i>
<i>I can hurt him.</i>

87
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,122
<i>I must cut as deep as possible.</i>

88
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:44,722
(uh!)

89
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:52,822

<i>strike from the side,</i>

93
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:10,722

Silly boy, the last time we met,

105
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:42,822
you skittered away
like a little cockroach.
[SHINICHI] (grrr...)

106
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,822
[GOTO] It was a wise choice.

107
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,855
Why would you ever come back?

108
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:50,589
What can a helpless little
creature like you hope to do?

109
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,255
I see you took off
your disguise.

110
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:54,689
Now I can at least see you
for the disgusting monster

111
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,889
that you really are!

112
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:57,622
[GOTO]
It's not necessary for me

113
00:06:57,722 --> 00:07:00,422
to pretend to be
human right now.

114
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:02,755
The air is clean,
and refreshing.

115
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,722
It seemed the perfect
place to revive,

116
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:07,889
but you have ruined the mood.

117
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:10,522
Now, of course,
I always welcome a battle,

118
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:13,989
even if there's to be
only one opponent.

119
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,189

Hey! Migi!
Are you in there?!

[GOTO] Are you talking
to your little friend?

Unfortunately for you,

(ungh...)

126
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,022

I mean, take this little
trinket, for instance.
(thwack)

128
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:47,089
Humans fight each other
using a variety of tactics.

But something like this
against me is...

130
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:51,322
ridiculous.

<i>With the garbage?</i>

143
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,089
I wouldn't even
call this a fight.

A battle with my creator
Reiko Tamura would have been
interesting,

but it's too late for that now,
isn't it?

146
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:47,322
Would you know
anything about that?

[SHINICHI] <i>Reiko Tamura?</i>

148
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:52,189
[TAMURA] He's one of
the most "frail" among us,

through experimentation.

150
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:57,655
But he's invincible.

[SHINICHI] <i>"Frail"?</i>

152
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,755
<i>How can he be "frail"</i>
<i>if he's "invincible"?</i>

153
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:03,422
[GOTO] Well, no matter.

154
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:05,355
It's time for you to become one

155
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:08,255
with the refuse that
surrounds you.

156
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:14,122
[MITSUYO]
...give some thought to
something else, anything else.

157
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:16,122
[SHINICHI]
<i>There's no more time to think!</i>

158
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,055
[MITSUYO] I'm just sayin',
don't give up no matter what,

159
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:21,755
and remember that there's
always an option.

160
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:24,489
[SHINICHI] <i>I'm going to die.</i>

161
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,355
<i>Then again,</i>

162
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,322
<i>I should be dead already.</i>

163
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:31,589
<i>He let me go.</i>

164
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:35,422
[GOTO] But this fight must wait.

165
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:36,889
There are too many others,

166
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:40,122
and I'm feeling
a bit tired today anyway.

167
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:42,889
We can make it.

168
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:45,022

00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:53,689
<i>Could that have been</i>
<i>the gap in his armor?</i>

172
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:55,755
(huh?)

173
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,455
(ah!)

174
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,622
<i>Can I get through it with this?</i>

175
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:06,155
<i>Well, I guess it's all I got.</i>

176
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:09,955
<i>Can I even be fast enough?</i>

177
00:10:10,055 --> 00:10:11,489
<i>As soon as I try to get up,</i>

178
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:13,889
<i>he'll just attack and</i>
<i>rip me to shreds.</i>

179
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:16,922
<i>I'm not sure I have a chance.</i>

180
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:19,655
(gasps)

181
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:21,889
<i>But if I don't try something,</i>

182
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,122
<i>I KNOW how this'll end.</i>

183
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:28,022
(aaahhh!)

184
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:31,589
[GOTO] (growls)
[SHINICHI] (kyah!)

185
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:33,455
[SHINICHI] <i>It went in!</i>

186
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,022
[GOTO] (roars)

187
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:36,722
(ungh!) (kyah!)

188
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:39,989
[GOTO] (roars)
[SHINICHI] (ungh!)

189
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:46,222
[GOTO] (growls) Goddamn human!

190
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:52,122
(ungh!) You are going
to shriek in agony!

191
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,531
(gasping for breath)

192
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:01,631
(bushes rustling)
[SHINICHI] (gasps)

193
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,031
<i>He's here!</i>

194
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,131
<i>But this is all I got.</i>

195
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,431
<i>I can't run anymore.</i>

196
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:10,031
<i>I did some good though, right?</i>

197
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:11,965
<i>I may not have caused a whole</i>
<i>lot of damage in the end,</i>

198
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:15,465
<i>but at least I was able</i>
<i>to hurt him, slow him down.</i>

199
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:17,431
(gasps)

200
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:19,565
(waaahhh!)

201
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:23,031
(ungh...)

202
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,631
(growls)

203
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:29,665
(huh?!)

204
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:34,031
[GOTO] How did you know where to
find the gap in my defenses?

205
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:37,298
I saw you get shot there before.

206
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:38,431
I saw you bleed!

207
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,765
[GOTO] (hmph!) Are you serious?

208
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:44,531
Do you mean to tell me you
risked everything on that?

209
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:46,531
Very well then, not bad.

210
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:53,031
But I cannot abide being injured
by a lowly, scrounging,
unworthy species.

211
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:54,998
IT'S OVER!

212
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:56,198
[SHINICHI] <i>This is it.</i>

213
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,698
<i>This time it really is the end.</i>

214
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:02,431
(huh?)

215
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,198
[GOTO] Who is that?

216
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:07,198
Miki? Stop resisting me!

217
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:10,165
Stay out of my way!

218
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,498
(ah!)

219
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:15,265
<i>What are you doing?</i>

220
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,931
If you're gonna kill me,
then hurry up and do it already.

221
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:20,465
<i>Just finish me and</i>
<i>be done with it.</i>

222
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:27,131
<i>[SHINICHI] The strike will</i>
<i>enter my right shoulder</i>

223
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:28,765
<i>and exit my left side.</i>

224
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,931
<i>I should die instantly.</i>

225
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:32,831
[MIGI] (mmph!)

226
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:35,365
(clang!) (explosion)

227
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:36,965
[GOTO] (hmm?)

228
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:39,731
[SHINICHI] Migi!

229
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:45,665
(waaahhh!) (ungh!)

230
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,765
[SHINICHI] (AAHHH!)

231
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:51,998
Hey!

232
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:54,231
(ah!) Migi!

233
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:56,998
(growls)

234
00:12:57,098 --> 00:12:58,231
[GOTO] What's happening!

235
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:59,798
Why do you defy me?

236
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:02,698
What are you doing you cowards?!

237
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:04,498
Shinichi...

238
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:07,465
Migi! (sobs)

239
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:10,298
That's quite a
powerful struggle.
[SHINICHI] (huh?)

240
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,465
[GOTO] (pained growls)

241
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,131
I'll kill you.

242
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:17,365
I'll kill both of you,
right now!

243
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:18,898
No, you won't.

244
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,665
As it happens, I shredded
several of your vital organs

245
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:23,965
when I was making
my way back out.

246
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:27,331
You'll have to repair them
before you can fight again.

247
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,098
(arrrggghhh...)

248
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:33,231
So what do you think's
happening to him?

249
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:34,631
It's a revolt.

250
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,831
The parasitic cells that
don't belong to the leader

251
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:40,431
have instinctively sensed danger
and are trying to escape.

252
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:42,898
He's now in the middle of
a tremendous upheaval

253
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:45,431
between the "head" and
all the other parasites.

254
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:47,998
But why? Why'd it start now?

255
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:49,798
[MIGI] (hmm?) It was you.

256
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:53,765
You were able to inject poisons
deep into Goto's body.

257
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:54,965
Poison?

258
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:58,198
[GOTO] (arrggghhh!)
[PARASYTES] (voices clamoring)

259
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:00,131
[GOTO] Silence!

260
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:01,931
You will pay for this.

261
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:03,465
I promise you that!

262
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,465
I'll tear you both apart!

263
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:07,531
He is quite full of rage now.

264
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:09,865
(arrggghhh!)

265
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,065
[SHINICHI] (ah!)

266
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,498
[MIGI] Anger is an emotion
I have not experienced,

267
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:16,231
because I never took
control of a brain.

268
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:17,765
But the source of his anger

269
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:21,131
stems from his desire to
devour the human species.

270
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:23,565
[GOTO] (roars)

271
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,365
[SHINICHI] (ah!)

272
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,565
[MIGI] Those feelings grew
and accumulated,

273
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:31,765
resulting in an insatiable
appetite for war and bloodshed.

274
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:35,065
But his time has now come.

275
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:43,531
[large explosion]

276
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:50,298
[MIGI] A single cut to the rope
that was already pulled taught

277
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:53,831
was enough to make
his entire body explode.

278
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,598
Up until the point the poisons
were driven into his body,

279
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,765
he was still
one complete organism.

280
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,665
The head held absolute control,

281
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,531
allowing him to put the other
parasites to sleep at any moment

282
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:06,665
and take full command of them.

283
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:09,765
So were you one of his slaves,
too, Migi?

284
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,931
[MIGI] To be honest,
it actually felt quite nice.

285
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,931
It was as if, though asleep,

286
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:20,098
there was a constant flow
of information streaming
through my mind.

287
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,565
It felt rather wonderful.

288
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:24,231
I got the feeling
I wouldn't mind

289
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:28,198
remaining a part of this
invincible "Goto" life‐form
forever.

290
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:30,231
Well, I'm glad you're back.

291
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:31,698
You have no idea how sad I was

292
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,431
when I thought you were dead.

293
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:35,231
[MIGI] Interesting.

294
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:43,565
[MIGI] This is where you
found the implement you
used against Goto, correct?

295
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:46,298
[SHINICHI] Yeah, but what's
this "poison" you mentioned?

296
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:48,598
[MIGI] Hmm? Burnt waste...

297
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,331
I can't actually say for sure,

298
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:53,565
but it might've contained
hydrogen cyanide

299
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:56,498
from the combustion of
acrylic compounds.

300
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:58,198
I take it that's poisonous?

301
00:15:58,298 --> 00:15:59,931
[MIGI] Lethally so.
[SHINICHI] (ah!)

302
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:01,765
And it's from
some shady company.

303
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:03,998
They just dumped it all here!

304
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:06,265
[MIGI] Well,
it did help you out, right?

305
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,265
[SHINICHI] (uh!)

306
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:11,931
[MIGI] It just goes to show you,
humans are very unpredictable.

307
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:13,931
(sighs)

308
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,865
[MIGI] Shinichi, we must go
back to our previous location.
[SHINICHI] (huh?!)

309
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:23,531
[MIGI] This is surprising,
but Goto is trying to
revive himself.

310
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:25,498
He's doing what?!

311
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:32,265
[MIGI] Look! Being blown apart
earlier has expelled the
toxins from his body.

312
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:35,998
The head is trying desperately
to reunite with the other
elements.
(slithering sounds)

313
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:39,798
But since they were scattered
in such small fragments,
reaction time is slow.

314
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,465
Possibility of regeneration
is around 50 percent.

315
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,098
And if he does somehow
manage to pull it off?

316
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:47,565
[MIGI] It won't change anything.

317
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:49,198
He could be slightly
less powerful,

318
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:52,531
but as long as he's alive, he
will still have the same desire.

319
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:54,065
He'll come after us.

320
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:55,598
Then, we have to kill him.

321
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,565
[MIGI] That's correct.

322
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:04,631
Migi?

323
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:08,931
[MIGI] Never mind.
[SHINICHI] (huh?!)

324
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:11,865
[MIGI] From my perspective,
he's one of my own.

325
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:15,398
In fact, one with whom I've
even shared the same host.

326
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:16,865
And if I were to kill him,
(slithering sounds)

327
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:19,965
it would amount to what
you refer to as "murder."

328
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,765
So, I'll let you handle it.

329
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,498
If you use that cleaver to
destroy his exposed organs,

330
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:27,265
he won't survive.

331
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:30,198
So, then you mean
you want me to do it?

332
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:31,665
[MIGI] Do as you like.

333
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:34,498
If you don't want to do it,
you could always run away.

334
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:35,931
[SHINICHI]
But more people would die.

335
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:37,965
And he'd just find
me again anyway.

336
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,131
[MIGI] That's right.
(slithering sounds)

337
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:43,065
[SHINICHI] In that case, there's
nothing for me to think about.

338
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:45,698
(piano playing softly)

339
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,965
Honestly,
it's kind of pitiful, huh?

340
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:52,131
[TAMURA]
We're actually quite frail.

341
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:57,131
We're nothing more than a
life‐form that isn't able
to survive on its own.

342
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,965
So, please...

343
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,898
Don't be too hard on us.

344
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,365
<i>Yeah, well, that may be true.</i>

345
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:06,565
<i>But still...</i>

346
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,831
<i>Why were they really born?</i>

347
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:13,098
<i>To kill humans, because there</i>
<i>are now too many of us?</i>

348
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:16,231
<i>To decrease our numbers because</i>
<i>we've polluted the Earth?</i>

349
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:18,431
<i>It's true...</i>

350
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,765
<i>The toxins we're producing</i>

351
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,565
<i>are driving other species</i>
<i>to extinction.</i>

352
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:22,631
(piano continues playing)

353
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,665
<i>And this is evidence of that.</i>

354
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:26,865
<i>Goto was so immensely powerful,</i>

355
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,831
<i>but not against what</i>
<i>humanity's left behind.</i>

356
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:33,365
[TAMURA] We are two halves
of the same whole.

357
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:36,131
Parasites and humanity
are of one family.

358
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:39,165
[SHINICHI] <i>So when it comes</i>
<i>to the life of Earth,</i>

359
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:40,765
<i>are humans the poison</i>

360
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:42,931
<i>and the parasites the cure?</i>

361
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,698
<i>Who decides that?</i>

362
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,065
<i>Who decides the value</i>
<i>of life on Earth?</i>

363
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:50,598
<i>What deserves to live?</i>

364
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:51,731
(piano continues playing)

365
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,698
[MIGI]
You must make your decision.

366
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,865
There's no time for delay.

367
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:57,831
[SHINICHI]
<i>I don't wanna kill him;</i>

368
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:01,398
<i>to end a life that's so</i>
<i>desperate to survive.</i>

369
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:03,431
<i>I mean, that's it, right?</i>

370
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:05,498
<i>I don't want to kill.</i>

371
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:10,865
<i>And that sentiment to treasure</i>
<i>life is a lasting trait</i>
<i>of humanity.</i>

372
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,031
[MIGI] What is it?

373
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:14,131
(piano continues playing)

374
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:17,498
I can't do it.

375
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:20,131
You might find it strange
given all we've gone through
to fight him,

376
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:23,631
but if his chances of
survival are fifty‐fifty...

377
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,931
I'd rather let fate
decide than me.

378
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:31,431
He's not a human being;
he's different.

379
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:34,131
So imposing my will
on him is wrong.

380
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:36,965
[MIGI] I see.

381
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:40,398
If that's your decision,
then it's fine by me.

382
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:41,765
Well, let's go.

383
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:43,465
(piano continues playing)

384
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,198
<i>[SHINICHI] It's entirely</i>
<i>possible that I could be</i>

385
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:48,731
<i>committing a grave mistake here</i>
<i>as a human being,</i>

386
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:51,531
<i>but I'm not sure</i>
<i>it's my place to decide</i>

387
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:54,098
<i>that an organism has</i>
<i>no right to live,</i>

388
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:56,398
<i>even if it's harmful.</i>

389
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:59,898
<i>Or even if it just</i>
<i>doesn't benefit humanity.</i>

390
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,465
<i>It's not...</i>

391
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:04,198
<i>it's not my decision to make.</i>

392
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:05,931
[MIGI] Shinichi?

393
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:10,098
Do you believe the Earth
to be beautiful?

394
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:11,665
[SHINICHI] I don't know.

395
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:14,365
[MIGI] I cannot understand those
humans who proudly proclaim

396
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:17,198
that they're doing something
"for the Earth."

397
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:22,231
After all, the Earth can
neither appreciate nor
even accept such an action.

398
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:23,731
It feels nothing.

399
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,465
And the life it spawned was born

400
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:28,131
into a boiling pool
of hydrogen sulfide.

401
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:30,398
(piano concludes)

402
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:33,698
[SHINICHI]
<i>Okay, so I'll leave it to fate.</i>

403
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:36,698
<i>Right?</i>

404
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,565
(slithering noises)

405
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:45,365
[SHINICHI] <i>I'm nothing more</i>
<i>than a lowly human being.</i>

406
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:47,398
<i>And all I can really do</i>

407
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,731
<i>is protect those close to me.</i>

408
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:52,198
(groans)

409
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:53,798
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:56,498
This is not your fault.

411
00:20:57,198 --> 00:20:58,698
But still...

412
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:00,998
It's your fate.

413
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,998
(thwack!)

414
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:10,631
What's wrong?
What's goin' on?!

415
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:13,565
[NAITO] The monster!
They found the monster's corpse!

416
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:16,131
They found what? Its corpse?!

417
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:23,198
<i>Did you really do it, Shinichi?</i>

418
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:31,065
[SHINICHI] Let's go home.

419
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:58,465
[SHINICHI] Next time:
"Parasitic Beasts"
