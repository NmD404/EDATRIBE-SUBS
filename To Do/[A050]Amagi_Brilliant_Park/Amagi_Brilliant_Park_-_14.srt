00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:11,055
[ISUZU]
(sigh)

2
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:14,755
[ISUZU]
(relax)

3
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:16,988
(notice)

4
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:24,421
[ISUZU]
What is it?

5
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:25,655
[MACARON]
Isuzu‐ron?

6
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:27,188
Is the plan still on
for tonight?

7
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,188
[ISUZU]
Yes, go ahead and
proceed, please.

8
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:31,855
[MACARON]
Gotcha! See ya later.

9
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:36,621
[ISUZU]
(unsure)

10
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,476
[ISUZU]
(focused exhale)

11
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:24,648
[ISUZU] Good morning. hm?
[SEIYA] Perfect as usual.

12
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:26,914
[ISUZU]
Don't you get tired of
doing that every day?

13
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,648
[SEIYA]
Nope. not in the slightest!

14
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,614
[ISUZU]
Oh.

15
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:30,748
[SEIYA]
By the way...

16
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:32,148
When is the AC gonna be fixed?

17
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:34,081
[ISUZU]
Tomorrow at the earliest.

18
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,114
[SEIYA]
Ugh...

19
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:39,881
[ISUZU]
B‐by the way Kanie,
I wanted to give you a‐

20
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:40,914
(phone rings)

21
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:42,414
[SEIYA]
Hold that thought.

22
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:44,381
[SEIYA]
It's Kanie.

23
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,448
Oh, good morning.

24
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:50,481
Right now? Oh no,
it's not a problem.

25
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:51,848
I'll be right over.

26
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:54,981
Latifah says she needs
to talk to me.

27
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:55,914
[ISUZU]
Um, Kanie?

28
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:58,114
[SEIYA]
What is it?

29
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,248
[ISUZU]
I um... no, nevermind.

30
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:03,214
[SEIYA]
Okay. see ya.

31
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,481
[ISUZU]
(sigh)

32
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:09,614
(phone buzzes)

33
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:14,114
[TIRAMY]
I can't wait to see his face!

34
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:15,881
[MACARON]
It's gonna be so awesome!

35
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:16,948
[MOFFLE]
Morning‐moff.

36
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:17,914
[TIRAMY]
Morning‐mii.

37
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:19,214
[MACARON]
Morning‐ron.

38
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:20,948
[MACARON]
What's with the tuxedo?

39
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:23,381
[MOFFLE]
PR work at Wakuwaku Preschool.

40
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:25,214
[TIRAMY]
Wakuwaku Preschool‐mii?!

41
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:28,081
[MACARON]
That's right, I forgot!
Today's the yearly visit!

42
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,614
[MOFFLE]
Moff... I was thinking

43
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:32,114
I'd take those three new girls
as part of their training.

44
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:33,614
[MACARON]
Hope they make it.

45
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,114
[TIRAMY]
If they survive,
they're ready for anything.

46
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,148
[MOFFLE]
Take care of everything
while I'm gone.

47
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:39,248
[MACARON/TIRAMY]
No problem!

48
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:41,148
[MOFFLE]
What about tonight?

49
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:44,681
[MACARON]
Under control.
I got catering from
a really good Italian place.

50
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:48,748
[MOFFLE]
Good!
Thanks for taking care of it.

51
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:51,181
[MUSE]
I'm sorry I made you come
all the way here, Miss Isuzu.

52
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,748
[ISUZU]
It's fine...
So what was the problem?

53
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:56,248
[MUSE]
Well, I slept funny...

54
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:57,814
And now my neck's twisted!

55
00:03:57,914 --> 00:04:00,614
[ISUZU]
Okay... that's not good...

56
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,814
[OKURO]
Listen. Do you really
think I have

57
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:05,348
what it takes to do
Mr. Moffle's job?

58
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:07,681
[TIRAMY]
All you have to do is wave‐mii!

59
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,381
[OKURO]
Right.

60
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:15,314
[OKURO]
Um, I think my legs are showing.

61
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:18,881
[TIRAMY]
Hmm... Eh, it's fine.

62
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:20,581
[MOFFLE] Eiko Adachi!
[EIKO] Present!

63
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,214
[MOFFLE] Biino Bando!
[BIINO] Present!

64
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:24,148
[MOFFLE] Shiina Chujo!
[SHIINA] D'I'm here!

65
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,714
[MOFFLE]
Moff... I'm glad
all three of you showed up.

66
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:30,714
[EIKO]
Excuse me, Mr. Moffle...
What exactly are we doing today?

67
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:34,148
[MOFFLE]
We're doing some off‐grounds PR
work as part of your training.

68
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:36,381
[BIINO]
PR work... off‐grounds?

69
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:39,281
[MOFFLE]
Moff. We're visiting Wakuwaku
Preschool in Amagi City.

70
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:43,881
The goal is to make a good
impression so they'll decide to
come for their fall field trip.

71
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:45,081
[SHIINA]
S‐sounds good.

72
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:46,881
[MOFFLE]
That's what I like to hear.

73
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:47,881
Get ready to‐aaaghh!

74
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,148
[EIKO/BIINO/SHIINA]
Hmm?

75
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,681
[MOFFLE]
Moff it all! I forgot something!

76
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:52,914
[SHIINA]
What was it?

77
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:54,781
They're expecting us
to bring a prize.

78
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:58,414
Bando... I think it's in the
admin room, could you grab it?

79
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,248
[BIINO]
Just leave it to me sir!

80
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:01,448
(dash)

81
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,514
[LATIFAH]
Here's the information

82
00:05:03,614 --> 00:05:06,214
on the Maple Land Senate
Budgetary Committee.

83
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:07,814
[SEIYA]
Oh thanks...

84
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:09,814
I was pretty sure I told Ashe
to handle this for me though.

85
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:12,814
[LATIFAH]
Well, I know my way around
these kinds of files anyway,

86
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,348
so I went ahead and located it.

87
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,914
I wanted to be
of use to you somehow.

88
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:18,748
[SEIYA]
Hmm?

89
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:21,681
[SEIYA]
It's from Sento.

90
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:22,648
[LATIFAH]
Go on.

91
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:24,048
[SEIYA]
Sorry.

92
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:26,414
[SEIYA]
Ah jeez.

93
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:28,148
[LATIFAH]
Did something happen?

94
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:30,281
[SEIYA]
Muse twisted her neck
pretty bad last night...

95
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:32,548
So she's not gonna
be able to perform.

96
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:33,548
[LATIFAH]
Oh...

97
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:37,781
[BIINO]
(panting) Please excuse me!

98
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:40,281
Huh? Nobody's in here...

99
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,814
I wonder where it could be...

100
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,414
Oh, right there!

101
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:46,048
Gotcha!

102
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:56,014
[OKURO]
(panting) So hot...

103
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:58,881
[CHIBA]
Look mommy, I can see the man
inside the Moffle suit!

104
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:02,181
[CHIBA'S MOM]
Shush! Just pretend
you don't notice it!

105
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:03,281
[BIINO]
Sorry for the wait!

106
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,548
[MOFFLE]
Oh is that the prize?

107
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:05,448
[BIINO]
Yep!

108
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:07,814
Moff... smaller than I thought.

109
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,348
[SEIYA]
Okay, got it.

110
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:19,748
We just need someone
to replace Muse, right?

111
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,781
[ISUZU]
That's basically it, yes.

112
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,381
[SEIYA]
Here's what we'll do.

113
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:30,114
[SEIYA]
Sento's got
fairly good reflexes,

114
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:32,481
and Latifah can handle
the paperwork for a while.

115
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:35,114
[SEIYA]
Muse, you go rest up
in the garden.

116
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:36,948
[ISUZU]
Can I really pull this off?

117
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,314
[LATIFAH]
I‐I'll do what I can!

118
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:39,748
[MUSE]
Are you sure it's okay

119
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,081
for me to be
wearing this dress?

120
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,648
[SALAMA]
I get that we need somebody

121
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:44,581
to fill in for Muse and
Miss Isuzu but...

122
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:46,881
...doesn't the princess
just kinda sit there?

123
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:47,948
[LATIFAH]
(shock)

124
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:49,281
[MUSE]
Salama, that was rude!

125
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:50,148
[SALAMA]
(surprised)

126
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:51,548
S‐sorry princess!

127
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:54,214
[LATIFAH]
Oh no...
that's correct, actually.

128
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,548
I will need you to make
the croquettes though.

129
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:59,081
[LATIFAH]
Sir Nick can explain
the details.

130
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,348
[MUSE]
Um... okay!

131
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:03,348
[SEIYA]
That should settle it then.

132
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:05,948
[PA VOICE]
This concludes the first
performance of the day.

133
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:08,814
[PA VOICE]
We hope you enjoyed the show.

134
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:10,514
[MACARON/METAL GUYS]
(exhausted)

135
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:13,114
[MACARON]
What's up?

136
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:14,481
The catering place‐ron?

137
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,781
Yeah we're still planning
to do it this evening.

138
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:19,948
[MACARON]
Huh?! What do you mean
you're gonna have to cancel?!

139
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:24,014
Mass food poisoning?!
Are you kidding me‐ron?!

140
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:26,181
[MAN A]
Why's he wobbling?

141
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:28,414
[OKURO]
(heavy panting)

142
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,214
(collapse)

143
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:33,414
[TIRAMY]
Whoa! Did you pee‐mii?!

144
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:35,681
[OKURO]
No it's sweat, actually...

145
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,614
Now... let's all
welcome our guests

146
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:46,114
from Amagi Brilliant Park.

147
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:48,614
[EIKO] Hello there everybody!
[BIINO] Hey there everybody!
[SHIINA] H‐hey there everybody!
[MOFFLE] Moff!

148
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:51,781
[PRINCIPAL]
Ah, Mr. Moffle?

149
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,414
Those girls don't look like
they're tough enough for this.

150
00:07:54,514 --> 00:07:57,248
[MOFFLE]
It'll be a good
learning experience.

151
00:07:57,348 --> 00:07:59,048
[PRINCIPAL]
Alright...

152
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:00,948
[KING CRIMSON]
Hey AmaBri!

153
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,481
You losers better step off!

154
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:04,548
[GRAND BLUE]
Yeah, the fall field trip
is ours!

155
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:07,348
[STAY GOLD]
These kids are comin'
to Tama Kartland!

156
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:10,181
[MOFFLE]
Hmph... Stupid marsupials.

157
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,981
[SHIINA]
Wh‐who are those guys?

158
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:13,614
[MOFFLE]
Oh, that's the enemy team.

159
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:15,014
[EIKO/BIINO/SHIINA]
Huh?

160
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:18,248
It's time to head on over
to Wakuwaku Coliseum.

161
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:19,514
YAY!

162
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:23,181
[SEIYA]
(exert)

163
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:24,748
I need you to sort
these files.

164
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,881
Put everything that has to do
with Animus in its own pile.

165
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:29,981
[LATIFAH]
I think I can manage that.

166
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:33,914
[SEIYA]
Ugh. it's like an oven in here!
I hope you'll be okay.

167
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,781
[LATIFAH]
Oh yes... I brought a Nix
Wind Chime with me,

168
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,614
so I'm almost chilly.

169
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:39,614
[SEIYA] Really?

170
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:41,048
I don't feel any different.

171
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:42,748
[LATIFAH]
Oh, it isn't working?

172
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:44,781
Perhaps it doesn't affect

173
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,481
inhabitants of
the natural world.

174
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:48,014
[SEIYA]
Hmmm...

175
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:49,581
[LATIFAH]
Anyway, I'll watch over
the office,

176
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:52,014
so please do whatever
you need to do today.

177
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,514
[SEIYA]
Okay...

178
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:56,014
If you're sure, I guess I'll go.

179
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:58,414
[LATIFAH]
Of course! Take care then!

[MUSE]
(happy sigh)

187
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:24,214
I could get used to this...

188
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,481
[NICK]
Hey, there you are.

189
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:29,414
I'm supposed to teach you
how to make croquettes.

190
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:37,381
[Kids]
Kick their butts! Kick their
butts! Kick their butts!

191
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:39,214
[PRINCIPAL]
Here at Wakuwaku Preschool

192
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:41,281
our policy is
"fight for what you want

193
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,314
and beat up anyone
who gets in your way"

194
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:46,714
so if you want that field trip,
better fight like you mean it!

195
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:47,914
[MOFFLE]
She's not kidding.

196
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:49,048

Yep, this is what PR work

I won't let you down!

Huh?!

201
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:56,481
[MOFFLE]
You're first, Eiko!

202
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:58,848

[MACARON]
Yes, tonight...

217
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:42,113
I've been turned down
by 4 places now.

218
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:44,746
No wait a sec!
Can't we make a deal?

219
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:46,946
[MACARON] C'mon, be a pal‐ron...
[TIRAMY] That was a bad idea.

00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:51,013

Wahoo!

Pulverize her!

That girl...

00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,613
[MOFFLE]
They like to market that red guy

233
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:05,946
as a laid‐back character.

234
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:08,313
But once he snaps
he gets pretty bloodthirsty.

00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:09,346

[LATIFAH]
(inhale, exhale)

244
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:28,079

Hm? It's about the written
estimate for the parade?

00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,479

00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,979

[NICK] First I need you to mince
all these onions.

256
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,579

This whole box? by myself?

00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:07,379

Please proceed according to
the schedule I sent.

263
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,513
[ASHE]
This is accounting.

264
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:14,479
Of course, give me one moment.

265
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,046
I'm pulling that
invoice for you.

266
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:18,913
Ah yes, this is the one...

267
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:21,646
Right, the payment

Excuse me sir,
I need to get something from

Sure.

I'm gonna eat you alive!
[BIINO] (scream)

[MOFFLE]
The blue koala supposedly has
a relaxed personality,

279
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:55,279
but once that moffer
loses his temper it's all over.

[BIINO] (scream)
[GRAND BLUE] Haahahahahahah!

281
00:12:56,913 --> 00:12:58,979

But that's exactly the same
as the first one!

282
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,413
[MOFFLE]
True. Except...

283
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,946

You've got nowhere to run,
you little rat!

Grand Blue down!
Biino Bando wins!

00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:18,013
Yayyyy!

Look everybody! I did it!

I'll throw in a little extra‐

[LATIFAH]
I see, so you'd like to change
tomorrow's meeting from 1 to 3?

Excuse me, I'm here about

[WRENCH]
Hey missy, I need a signature

[LATIFAH]
Yes... Yes...

312
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,446
Oh, you have two
separate meetings?

Spirit of the wind...
I'm Sylphy.

314
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,879
Want to be friends?

That was the worst yet! Again!

[MUSE]
Ah, yes!

319
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,379
[MUSE] Huh?

320
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,246
Now peel all the

329
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:50,679
[MER] (more gesturing)
[SALESGUY B] Got it.

330
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,279
[SALESGUY C]
I'm from Amagi Transport.

331
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:54,479
Could you sign
for these, please?

332
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:55,546
[SALESGUY D]
Excuse me sir,

333
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,746
but the unloading area's full.

334
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:58,379
Where would you like me
to put these?

335
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,446
Oh, I can just
leave 'em right here?

336
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:01,813
Okay thanks, have a good day.

337
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,579
[SALESGUY E]
Sorry to interrupt you sir,

338
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,013
but can I leave these here too?

339
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,479
Perfect. thanks a lot.

340
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:10,713
[SEIYA]
(annoyed)

341
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:13,313
[PRINCIPAL]
It's time for the final round!

342
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,946
Shiina Chujo versus Stay Gold!

343
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:18,546
[STAY GOLD]
I'll crush your bones to dust!
[SHIINA] Noooo!

344
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:19,979
[MOFFLE]
Looks like his personality's

345
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,946
a little different
than the other two, but yeah,

346
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,113
it's basically the same deal
whenever he gets angry.

347
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:26,546
[BIINO]
I'll remember that, sir!

348
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:28,079
[EIKO]
I wasn't aware it was acceptable

349
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:29,379
to attack your opponent
with a chain.

350
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,579
[SHIINA] (scream)
[STAY GOLD] Hraggghhh!

351
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,446
Moff, who cares as long
as she wins?

352
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:33,613
[BIINO]
Good thinking, sir!

353
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:35,679
[STAY GOLD]
You're mine, kid!

354
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:40,413
[SHIINA]
Huh?

355
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:41,446
[STAY GOLD]
(stunned)

356
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:42,746
[Kids]
(berserk cheers)

357
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:46,313
There it is!
The winner is Shiina Chujo!

358
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,279
[PRINCIPAL]
Amagi Brilliant Park wins 2‐1!

359
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:50,079
[BRAT A/BRAT B/BRAT C]
(sinister laughing)

360
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,879
[PRINCIPAL]
You put up a spectacular
fight, AmaBri.

361
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:53,979
[KING CRIMSON]
(grunt)

362
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,413
We'll be seeing you in the fall.

363
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:56,579
[MOFFLE]
Thank you.

364
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,313
You also get
both of the prizes...

365
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:00,379
Thank you again
for coming today.

366
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:02,679
[MOFFLE]
I appreciate that.

367
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:07,679
[SHIINA]
B‐b‐but I thought those p‐prizes
were f‐for the p‐preschoolers!

368
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:11,446
[MOFFLE]
Would you have come
if you had known?

369
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:14,646
[LATIFAH]
U‐unfortunately
the person in charge isn't
available that day...

370
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:16,346
...so I don't believe
we'll be able to, um...

371
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,079
[ASHE]
(gasp)Your Highness!

372
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:19,379
[LATIFAH]
Oh! Lady Ashe!

373
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,146
I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting!

374
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,413
[ASHE]
Um, do you need some help?

375
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:26,879
[LATIFAH]
Y‐yes, if you don't mind!
Thank you very much!

376
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:33,013
[ISUZU]
I'm the fire spirit... Salama.

377
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:34,746
I like internet flame wars...?

378
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:38,579
[DORNELL]
Why are you so bad?!
Start over from the top!

379
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,246
[ISUZU]
(surprised)
(dejected)

380
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,446
[KOBORY]
But it's well into
the evening by now.

381
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:44,446
[SALAMA]
Welp! Guess we're not
performing today.

382
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,013
[SYLPHY]
Caspian Sea Monster!

383
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:52,479
[SEIYA]
(annoyed) Jeez.

384
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,846
(approaching footsteps)

385
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:56,813
[SEIYA]
Huh?

386
00:16:56,913 --> 00:16:58,279
[TIRAMY]
(unwell "mii")

387
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:04,913
(straining mii"s)

388
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:06,046
MIIIII!

389
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:07,979
[SEIYA]
(big horrified)

390
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,613
(relieved "mii")

391
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,146
(disgusted)

392
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:14,246
(annoyed)

393
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:17,813
[MUSE]
Ugh... she's way tougher
than I thought.

394
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:21,379
How does she do this
by herself?!

395
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:32,979
[MOFFLE]
Moff, you're dismissed.

396
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,179
Bando, could you go put
the prizes in the admin room?

397
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,079
[BIINO]
Sure!

398
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:38,846
[LATIFAH]
Whew...

399
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:40,813
I finally finished it...

400
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:43,546
I'd better go report
to Sir Kanie now.

401
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,879
[BIINO]
(running up steps)

402
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:48,279
[BIINO]
Oh Princess!

403
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:50,013
[LATIFAH]
Hello there,
I was just going out...

404
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:51,679
Shall I leave this door open?

405
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,779
[BIINO]
Sure. I'll close it
when I get done.

406
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,513
[LATIFAH]
Excellent. take care then.

407
00:17:55,613 --> 00:17:57,546
[BIINO]
Thanks; you too!(run over)

408
00:17:57,646 --> 00:18:01,813
[BIINO]
Whew, there we go.(run out)

409
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:08,346
[MOFFLE]
Hey there Seiya,
what are you up to?

410
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:11,079
[SEIYA]
Working. The AC's broken
in the admin room.

411
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,179
[MOFFLE]
Moff... Well just so you know,
we got the preschool field trip.

412
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,779
[SEIYA]
Really? That's good to hear!

413
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:19,479
[MOFFLE]
It was all thanks to those
three new part‐timers...

414
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:20,679
Make sure you tell them thanks.

415
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:22,846
Sure thing. thanks for
your help today.

416
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:24,446
[MOFFLE]
Moff.

417
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,613
[ISUZU/LATIFAH/MUSE]
Good work, everyone.

418
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:37,446
[LATIFAH]
(giggling)

419
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,346
[MUSE/ISUZU]
(hm?)

420
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,779
(smile, into giggle)

421
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:43,646
[MUSE]
We should probably stick
to what we do best from now on.

422
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:45,013
[ISUZU]
I agree with that.

423
00:18:45,113 --> 00:18:46,346
[LATIFAH]
(giggle)

424
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:49,013
Oh that's right,
is your neck feeling better?

425
00:18:49,113 --> 00:18:52,546
[MUSE]
Yeah, I'm totally fine now.
Thanks for asking.

426
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:58,879
[ISUZU]
Ah... So the preschool visit
turned out to be a success.

427
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:08,346
[ISUZU]
(inhale‐exhale)

428
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:14,246
[SEIYA]
(big stretch)

429
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:15,713
[LATIFAH] Sir Kanie?
[SEIYA] Hm?

430
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:17,813
I don't suppose you could
spare a brief moment?

431
00:19:17,913 --> 00:19:20,279
[SEIYA]
I guess... What do you need?

432
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,413
[ISUZU]
You'll have to see for yourself.

433
00:19:27,196 --> 00:19:31,162
[ALL]
Happy Birthday!
Thanks for all you do!

434
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:33,396
[SEIYA]
(stunned)

435
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:34,229
Huh...?

436
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:35,596
[MACARON]
Ha! check it out!

437
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,262
he's so surprised
he can't even talk straight!

438
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:39,829
[MOFFLE]
The ambush mission
was a success!

439
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,062
[TIRAMY]
He's crying‐mii!

440
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:42,896
[SEIYA]
N‐no I'm not! don't be stupid!

441
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:45,262
(unsure)

442
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:48,596
W‐well, I guess I
should probably thank you
knuckleheads...

443
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:51,729
[LATIFAH/ISUZU]
(giggling)

444
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:53,196
[SEIYA]
Did you know about this too?

445
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:54,662
[LATIFAH]
Yes, I'm sorry...

446
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:57,162
Everyone asked me to keep it
secret. I had no choice.

447
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,896
[LATIFAH]
Like it or not,
we're here to celebrate
your birthday, Sir Kanie!

448
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:02,696
[ALL] Yeah!
[SEIYA] (startled)

449
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:09,062
[SEIYA]
(slurp)

450
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:11,796
[SEIYA]
Hmm... not bad.

451
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:12,962
(giggle)

452
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:14,962
Why are we having
somen noodles‐mii?

453
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:17,329
[MACARON]
It's the only thing I could get.

454
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:10,429
[ISUZU]
Her Majesty has retired
for the night.

455
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:13,329
[SEIYA]
That's good.
You know, that really
did surprise me.

456
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:16,596
I've never had a birthday party
like that in my whole life.

457
00:21:16,696 --> 00:21:18,429
You really haven't?

458
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:21,162
[SEIYA]
Those guys are way too busy
to put something
like this together.

459
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:22,729
What am I gonna do with them?

460
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,396
[ISUZU]
(smile)

461
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:27,729
[SEIYA]
Check out what Latifah gave me.

462
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,596
They're some kind of
scented candles.

463
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,229
[ISUZU]
Oh.

464
00:21:33,296 --> 00:21:34,796
[ISUZU] Actually...
[SEIYA] Hm?

465
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:37,662
[ISUZU]
I‐I got you a present too.

466
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,696
So, um... you know...

467
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:40,862
[SEIYA]
Huh?

468
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:42,862
[ISUZU]
It's not much, but... I...

469
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:46,562
I just thought it...

470
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:48,629
kind of suited you...

471
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:50,096
[SEIYA]
(speechless)

472
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:54,796
[ISUZU]
So if you wouldn't mind...

473
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,629
I... I want you to have it.

474
00:21:57,729 --> 00:21:59,462
[SEIYA]
Um, okay...

475
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:02,562
[ISUZU]
Well... goodnight!

476
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:03,629
[SEIYA]
(surprised)

477
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:06,362
(stunned)

478
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:14,029
[SEIYA]
Hm?!

479
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:16,362
[SEIYA]
(stunned)

480
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:19,296
[SEIYA]
Cicada shells?
