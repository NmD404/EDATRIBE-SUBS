[ON SPEAKER] Wow, did you
hear that, boys and girls?

10
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:43,328
Moffle wants to thank every

Ron, ron, rooooon!

[SEIYA]
Still not enough turnout.

19
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:12,994
Okay, then we're just gonna have
to kick the entertainment
factor up another notch.

20
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:15,661
[huh?]

21
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:18,828
[ISUZU] That's what we're
here for, isn't it?

22
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:25,028
Definitely.

23
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:28,461
Don't screw up.

00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:29,894
[umm]

25
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,194
What's wrong?

26
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,928
[SEIYA] Nothing.

[LITTLE BOY] (mm‐hm!)

00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:53,061
[LITTLE GIRL] (huh?)
[LITTLE BOY] (hmm?) A shark?

32
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:56,328
I wonder if he's
part of the show too?

00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:58,828

00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:07,928
[BOTH] (WAAHHHH!!!)

37
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:44,350
[SEIYA]
Why would you do that, Jaw?

38
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,750
I thought I told you to
always stay behind the scenes!

39
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,150
I apologize, sir!

40
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,917
Really, I do!
But I am a man of the sea!

41
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:56,550
And so I assumed that the pool
was the most appropriate place
for me to greet‐ (urk!)

42
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,183
Well, yeah, it wouldn't be a
problem if you could be tiny and
adorable all the time,

43
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,317
but whenever you get wet...

44
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,750
(waahh!)

45
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,283
[SEIYA]
You've never seen yourself?!
[JAW] (uhuhuh...)

46
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:10,483
[SEIYA] Ah, just go
hide in the machine room!
[JAW] (sobbing]

47
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:14,350
[JAW] I'm a disgrace.

48
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,750
I always thought it was my
destiny to live at sea,
and now...

49
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,550
[awkward laugh]

50
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,517

53
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:34,050
[SHIINA] Umm...

54
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,250
[JAW]
What in Neptune's name is this?

55
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,350
Oh, this is actually a magic
portal that connects AmaBri
directly to Maple Land.

56
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,117
[GENJURO]
When the park was first built,

57
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:46,583
this gate was set up so we
could easily transport supplies.

58
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,617
[SHIINA] M‐M‐Maple Land, that's
the m‐m‐magical k‐k‐kingdom

59
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:55,050
all of you used to l‐l‐live in,
isn't that r‐right?

60
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,483
Yeah, exactly.

61
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,517
But then we decided to have
the portal sealed shut

62
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:02,050
since we don't really have any
use for it anymore, you know?

63
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,897
Oh hey,
there's water leaking out.
[ALL] (hmm...)

64
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:12,281
[GENJURO] Well anyway,
I'll get the Facilities guys
to come take a look at it.

65
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:15,281
You two keep an eye on it, okay?

66
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,481

Avast, ye faithful crew!

You're one of my followers?

Oh my, it looks like the
performance is already underway!

96
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:50,814
Yes, I can't wait for the bows.

97
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:54,548
[hmm] I shouldn't have
made you sneak around with me.

98
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:55,914
Forgive me, Triken.

99
00:06:56,014 --> 00:07:00,114
Oh, no, I bow down before you,
Princess.
[LATIFAH] (hmmm?)

100
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:02,581
But only out of respect,
obviously.

00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,581
It should only take
a few minutes, right?

106
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,581

00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:05,414
At last,
we've found ourselves a port.

00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:07,314
Whoa,
what's going on over here?!

120
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:09,748
That big ugly guy's name
is Ironbeard.

121
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:13,581
Back in Maple Land,
he's known as the meanest
bully on the high seas.

122
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:19,181
[SEIYA] He must've gotten out
through the underground gate.
[MOFFLE] Probably.

123
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:23,381
[IRONBEARD] Arr, I was hopin'
to find meself some treasure

[hmm?] Ye might as well come
along quietly, mateys!

[EIKO ON SPEAKER] "No way,

138
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:04,414
A cryin' shame, that.

00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:08,614
And I was gonna let ye have

Coming up! Hold on a minute!

172
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:48,697

Listen!
It's okay, mii.

It's kinda funny!

333
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:49,830
[laughing]

334
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,630
Oh...

335
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:58,163
All's well that ends well, mii!

336
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:02,130
You know what? Nobody has
anything to be sorry for!

337
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,797
[nervous laugh]

338
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:05,530
[ISUZU] But YOU do.

339
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,697
[TIRAMY] Wh‐Who, mii?

340
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:09,663
[LATIFAH] Lady Isuzu?

341
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:12,263
Please, try not to be
too harsh on him.

342
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:14,730
[ISUZU] As you wish, Princess.

343
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:17,063
You're lucky, Tiramy.

344
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:19,697
I'll let you say some
parting words before you die.

345
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:22,497
I just wanna say that I
have faith in all of you!

346
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:26,697
I know you guys would never do
something like this to one of
your own, right, mii?!

347
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:29,097
[MACARON] Ha!
That's a good one, buddy‐ron.

348
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:33,130
[MOFFLE] Yeah, if that's the
case, then it's a good thing
you're not one of us.

349
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,130
[TIRAMY] Mii!

350
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,697
[BOTH]
(HUH?!)

351
00:20:36,797 --> 00:20:41,263
MMMIIII!!!
RROOONNNN!!!
MMOOOFFFF!!!

352
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:03,397
[TAKAYA] Well, well, well!

353
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:06,731
Never thought you'd end up
being acting manager.

354
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:11,664
Look, is there anything
I can do for you?

355
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:12,731
No, not really.

356
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,297
I just wanted to peek in
on you for a bit.

357
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:17,031
From what I understand,
your visitor count's

358
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:21,031
been looking a little more
optimistic since the
last time I saw you.

359
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:22,697
I think I get it.

360
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,264
[SEIYA] I really don't know
that I've done much of
anything yet.

361
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:31,764
[chuckle] Well, then, I suggest
you give it your best shot,
Mister Celebrity.

362
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,531
Tick‐tock!

363
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:03,731
All right,
let's do one last check!

364
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:07,931
[MACARON] Front!

365
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:09,964
Back!

366
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:11,897
Skirt!

367
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,664
Good! It's gonna be perfect!

368
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,331
[ISUZU & SEIYA] Time for
the attractions spotlight.

369
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:56,497
[ISUZU]
Today's feature is Blue Ocean.

370
00:23:56,597 --> 00:23:59,364
It's useful for drawing in
customers during the summer.

371
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:01,231
[SEIYA] Better than anything
else does, I guess.

372
00:24:01,331 --> 00:24:02,897
[ISUZU] But just like
what happened today,

373
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:05,731
it does connect to other worlds
from time to time.

374
00:24:05,831 --> 00:24:08,831
We've already had to deal with
a kraken and a giant octopus.

375
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,731
[SEIYA] And it wasn't
all over the news?!

376
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:13,331
[ISUZU] Genjuro, the dolphin,
always feels responsible,

377
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:15,897
so he usually commits
ritual suicide.

378
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,997
[SEIYA] He USUALLY does?!
