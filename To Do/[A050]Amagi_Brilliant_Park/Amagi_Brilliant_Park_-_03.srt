1
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:13,519
[sigh]

2
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:15,852
<i>I look great in anything.</i>

3
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:11,355
Seiya Kanieeee!
[SEIYA] (huh?) (urk!)

4
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:13,455
[MOFFLE]
You have to stop this now!
[SEIYA] (blocking effort)

5
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:16,022
Stop what?!
[MOFFLE] Closing for the day!

6
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:18,389
And what makes you think
I'm taking orders from you?!

7
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,355
In all twenty‐nine years
of operation,

8
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:23,455
this park has never once been
closed without notice!

9
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:26,389
The public's come to
trust us for that.

10
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,789
But now... you...

11
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,922
You're gonna pay for this!

12
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:33,255
[SEIYA] Hyaaah!

13
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:35,422
<i>Wait, I see a pattern!</i>

14
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,755
You scumbag...

15
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:38,789
Now it's YOUR turn to pay!

16
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:40,455
[gun fires]
[BOTH] (uhun...)

17
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:41,655
[ISUZU] No fighting.

18
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:44,122
[SEIYA] How did you fire twice
from a muzzleloader?

19
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:46,022
Try to calm down, Lord Moffle.

20
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:49,222
[MOFFLE] How can you
tell me to calm down?

21
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:51,122
Thanks to him, we're
gonna have to disappoint

22
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:53,222
all the attendees
who show up today!

23
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:56,222
I refuse to let this guy
disrespect our park!

24
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:58,489
[SEIYA]
We have to clean up the place.

25
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:59,955
That's the first step.

26
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,089
Shut your mouth! What does
a wise guy like you know

27
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:06,089
about a park he's only been at
for the last two days?!

28
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:07,922
[ISUZU] (sigh)
[SEIYA] (huh?)

29
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,355
[SEIYA] (hmm...)
I hate to admit it,
but you bring up a good point.

30
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:15,089
Maybe you'd better go take care
of the guests then.
[MOFFLE] Moff?!

31
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,889
[SEIYA]
I don't care how you do it.

32
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:20,755
Just go entertain the guests in
the square outside the main
entrance.

33
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:24,955
Huh? But what am I gonna do
in that big empty space?

34
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:26,622
What? You can't do it?

35
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:29,555
Uh! O‐Of course I can!

36
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:30,755
[hmpf!]

37
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,622
[MOFFLE] Watch and learn!

38
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:35,755
[SEIYA] <i>This building is</i>
<i>kept up pretty well.</i>

39
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:39,855
<i>It looks like the little rat</i>
<i>DOES take his job seriously</i>
<i>after all.</i>

40
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:44,122
Don't you still have a lot of
attractions you wanted us to
inspect today, Kanie?

41
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:46,089
[SEIYA] I know.

42
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:54,789
I see you all made it.

43
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,989
[SEIYA] Let's get this
administration meeting started.

44
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:00,689
Keeping it short,
we've got three goals.

45
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:02,722
[SEIYA] Number one!

46
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,555
I want the park
to stay open later!
[ALL] Boo...

47
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,789
[SEIYA] Stop complaining
like a bunch of kids!

48
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,789
Well, I figure that all depends
on how much later we're
talkin' about here.

49
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:15,455
We ain't got the facilities
to keep this place runnin'
after dark,

50
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,755
so I reckon after sundown
it'll be a no‐go.

51
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,322
I already thought of that.

52
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:23,855
First, we'll extend the park
hours to 7pm instead of 5.

53
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:25,455
In the meantime,
we can start setting up

54
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,055
whatever facilities we need so
that we can operate at night.

55
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:30,755
And THEN we'll stretch it to 9pm
when we're ready.

56
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:31,989
How's that?

57
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,355
Well, I guess that doesn't
sound too bad.

58
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:38,222
Second! There's no more
regular days off!
[ALL] Boo...

59
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:39,889
[SEIYA] Jeez, you people
are such babies!

60
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,889
I mean, seriously, how do you
expect your business to succeed

61
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:44,555
if you're closed on FRIDAYS?!

62
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:47,689
You never heard of TGIF?
[NICK] (chuckle)

63
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:51,389
Forget it! That's the
best possible time to
rake in the cash!

64
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:54,255
Listen! From tomorrow morning
until July 31st,

65
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:56,189
not one of you is getting
a single day off!

66
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,789
You understand?!
[ALL] Fine.

67
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,089
I guess we should have
seen that coming.

68
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:04,022
Third! And this is the big one.

69
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:06,422
I've decided that from now
until the end of July,

70
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:10,489
access to the park and
all attractions will be
totally free of charge!

71
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,322
[ALL] HUH?!

72
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:15,989
[ISUZU] (huh?)
[MOFFLE] You're kidding me!

73
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,655
[SEIYA] Nope.

74
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:21,489
With all due respect,
as Chief of Accounting,
I must disagree.

75
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,355
With AmaBri consistently
in the red,

76
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:26,422
there's no way we can afford
to do something like that.

77
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:30,355
[WRENCH] Can't pay the bills
on free admission, boss man.

78
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,689
[hmpf]

79
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,489
[MOFFLE] Besides, we're pros.

80
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:37,122
You can't expect us to entertain
without some kind of paycheck.

81
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:39,955
[SEIYA] Ha, you call punching
people entertainment?

82
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:43,455
Argh! I apologize for
what I did, all right?

83
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:47,255
But regardless of what
we're doing, we can't do it
for nothing.

84
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:49,689
If we make everything free,
even temporarily,

85
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:53,055
we'll never get people to
pay money for it again.

86
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:57,655
That'll be the end of
AmaBri for sure.

87
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:00,955
Hmm... Well, I knew you guys
wouldn't be too happy
with the changes.

88
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:04,522
And your concerns here
are pretty valid.

89
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:06,389
Let me think...

90
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:10,989
Okay, instead of nothing, we'll
charge 30 yen for everything.
[ALL] HUH?!

91
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,022
[MOFFLE] Why 30 of all things?

92
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,355
[SEIYA]
Because I hear this park's

93
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:17,989
about to hit its 30th
anniversary next year.

94
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:20,122
I'm sorry, but charging them
30 yen for everything

95
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:22,955
is essentially the same concept
as charging nothing at all.

96
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:25,389
Look, we need visitors
more than cash right now.

97
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:29,222
If we screw up, there won't BE
a park to pay bills on.

98
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,789
Now unless you have
more questions,

99
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,655
I'll adjourn the meeting so you
can get back to your posts.

100
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:36,589
Carry on!

101
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,355
[deep sigh]

102
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,722
[MOFFLE]
30 yen is pocket change!

103
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,122
You said that already.

104
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:48,689
Moffin' hardass!

105
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,655
That basically tells us our
skills are worth nothing to him!

106
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:53,055
I won't stand for this!

107
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:55,189
There's no point in
getting angry, ron.

108
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,022
Come on, Macaron,
aren't you mad at all?

109
00:06:58,122 --> 00:06:59,655
Think about it this way,
Moffle‐ron,

110
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:02,189
if we don't get visitors in the
door, we'll be done for,

111
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,022
so we gotta do whatever we can
do to survive for a while.

112
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:06,989
[MOFFLE] (grrr)

113
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:15,189
You ready to rock the house,
Mr. Sweets Fairy‐ron?

114
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,289
I wouldn't have it any
other way, Mr. Music Fairy.

115
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,055
(chuckle)

116
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,822
Okay, let's put this
behind us for a minute

117
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:28,155
and give those kids
a moffin' good show!

118
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:32,089
[MOFFLE] Moff!
[MACARON] Ron!

119
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,755
You're stupiiiiiiid!

120
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,789
[MOFFLE] (oof!)
[ALL] (huh?)

121
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,355
[TAKESHI]
I wanted to go to Digimarland,

122
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:42,022
and then we come here and
you're not even OPEN?!

123
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:43,955
Say you're sorry, ya knockoff!

124
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:47,655
[MOFFLE] (grrr!)
I'm really sorry, little guy.

125
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,822
Stop kicking that thing,
Takeshi!

126
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:51,255
(huh?)

127
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:53,022
[MOFFLE] Must be his mom.

128
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:55,555
Good thing she stopped him
or I might've killed him.

129
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,655
A lot of people put their grubby
hands on these costumes, dear.

130
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:02,122
Don't touch it or you might get
a disease! Do you understand me?

131
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:04,022
Yes, ma'am.
[MOFFLE] (grrr)

132
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:05,889
If anything happens
to my little boy,

133
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,855
your park will be hearing
from my lawyer.

134
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,255
You'd better watch yourself,
knockoff!

135
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:12,455
[SALAMA] Hashtag brutal!
[MUSE] (uh‐oh)

136
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:14,422
Please don't start
another flame war.

137
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:19,322
[MOFFLE]
Oh, so you were just worried
about your precious hellspawn.

138
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:22,055
But...
[TAKESHI'S MOM] (gasp)

139
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:24,455
You picked the wrong mouse!
[TAKESHI'S MOM] (ah!)

140
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:27,855
I don't think so, mister. I'll
make you regret toying with me!

141
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,589
Wait, did you just talk?
[TAKESHI] (huh?!)

142
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,489
Uh‐oh, ron.

143
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:34,922
[TAKESHI] Daddy, Daddy!
[TAKESHI'S DAD]
Yeah, little man?

144
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:38,755
Would you believe this
disgusting park employee
just assaulted me?

145
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,755
[TAKESHI'S DAD Oh, yeah?

146
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:45,189
Didn't your boss ever tell ya
the customer's always right?

147
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:49,289
Lose the stupid costume and I'll
teach you a lesson, ya knockoff!

148
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:51,689
[MOFFLE]
Every customer is a god.

149
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:53,089
Huh?

150
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:55,555
[MOFFLE] But still,
whether you're a god or not...

151
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:57,555
[TAKESHI'S DAD]
Speak up, I can't hear ya.

152
00:08:57,655 --> 00:09:00,522
There's certain things
that shouldn't be said!

153
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:01,989
What's that look for?

154
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,022
Do ya want me to give ya an
ass‐kickin'? Is that it?

155
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:07,855
All right...
Then say your prayers!

156
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:09,689
Don't do iiiiit!

157
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:10,989
[TAKESHI'S DAD] (hyung!)

158
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:13,122
(ooff!) (ungh)

159
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,655
[BOTH] (gasp!) (waahhh...)

160
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:19,722
Crap! I was too late, ron!

161
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:22,389
Hey, Mommy, there's something
funny about that mascot.

162
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:25,122
Shush! What did I tell you
about these things?

163
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:28,122
[MOFFLE] You just take
a little nap, okay?

164
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,555
[BOTH] (waahhh!)

165
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:35,222
Now it's your turn
to learn something.

166
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:38,455
Get ready to find out
what happens to mouthy
humans like you

167
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:42,322
who dare to accuse me
of being a knockoff!
[BOTH] (waaahhh!)

168
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,555
Thanks for visiting
Amagi Brilliant Park!

169
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,822
[BOTH] (WAAAHHH!!)

170
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,322
[MOFFLE] (oof!)
[SEIYA] I don't think so!

171
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,022
[gun fires]
[BOTH] (gasps!)

172
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:57,755
[BOTH] (waahhh...)

173
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:01,189
Forgotten Realm Bullets,
they're memory erasers.
[SEIYA] (aaahhh...)

174
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:02,922
I'm sure they'll wake up soon.

175
00:10:03,022 --> 00:10:06,722
[SEIYA] Oh God,
I just witnessed a crime...

176
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:08,455
Ah, you get used to
it eventually.

177
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,955
[SEIYA] Yeah, I doubt that!
More importantly,

178
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:14,289
why in the hell did you have to
use violence on customers
in the first place?!

179
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:16,555
If the public finds out,
we'll be screwed!

180
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:17,989
What were you thinking?!

181
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:20,889
I know it was a dumb
thing to do, all right?

182
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:24,622
[SEIYA]
Please don't tell me this is
like an everyday thing for you.

183
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:25,689
[hmpf!]

184
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,222
Not quite.
[SEIYA] (ah!)

185
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:30,389
[MACARON] Yeah, it's more like
once every year or so.

186
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:33,989
[SEIYA] (sigh) I'm surprised
the park's made it this far.

187
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:37,655
Moff... Well, anyway I'm sorry.

188
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:40,089
Go ahead and fire me
if you want.

189
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:44,589
<i>He's only saying that</i>
<i>because he knows how much</i>
<i>we need him around here.</i>

190
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:51,422
[SEIYA] All right, fine.

191
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:55,022
I'll let it slide
just this once.
[BOTH] (ah!)

192
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,189
[SEIYA] But next time,
I'll fire you on the spot.

193
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:00,422
You got that?

194
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,389
Moff!

195
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:05,222
[ISUZU]
I thought he was a goner.

196
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:06,989
[SEIYA]
He's our top character.

197
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,189
Plus, those memory‐wiping
bullets of yours came in
pretty handy too.

198
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,555
[ISUZU] Oh, right, about that...

199
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,855
Yeah, what is it?

200
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,355
Well, these
Forgotten Realm Bullets

201
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:18,122
happen to be ridiculously
hard to come by.

202
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:20,655
It takes a whole year
just to make one.

203
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:23,522
They're limited, so we can't
afford to waste them.

204
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:27,855
Oh jeez, I had no idea those
things were so valuable. Wait...

205
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:31,155
What about those super‐painful
ones you keep on firing
at me and Moffle

206
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,722
like it's going outta style?

207
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:34,755
[ISUZU]
Those were Pain Bringers.

208
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,822
They cost 30 yen for a 10‐pack.

209
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:38,322
(argh!) Really?!

210
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:40,189
I'm just saying that
certain ammunition

211
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:42,789
is intended to be used
more sparingly.

212
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:46,689
All right... Anyway,
I really appreciate you
saving our butts back there.

213
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,122
[ISUZU] Oh, no...

214
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:49,522
Regardless of what happens,

215
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:53,622
I've already decided to do
everything in my power.

216
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:57,622
I see. Then, I may need another
body for something soon.

217
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:00,022
[hmmm?]

218
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:11,480
I didn't realize THIS
was what he meant

219
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,480
when he said that
he needed a body!
[OTHERS] (uhhh...)

220
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:21,214
Aren't these...
a little bit too revealing?

221
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:25,514
WTF, guys? He actually expects
us to walk around in these?

222
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,314
Hashtag pervert, post.

223
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,047
Yeah, why couldn't it be
hot guys instead?

224
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:31,980
Vrksasana is the tree pose!

225
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,914
Whoa there, Sylphy! You can't
do yoga with your wings on.

226
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:37,614
[pop!]
[SYLPHY] Oh!

227
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:39,380
I didn't know those
could come off!
[SYLPHY] Virabhadrasana III!

228
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,280
Oh yeah, they're just
part of the costume.

229
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,080
They are?! How can a place
with actual magic

230
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,047
be so full of cheap gimmicks?

231
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:48,880
Sir Kanie,
are you certain it's all right

232
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,380
for me to be involved with
an operation like this?

233
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,880
Sure, I don't mind.
Actually, I was really grateful

234
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,814
that you agreed to
help me out with it.

235
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:57,614
Now, get ready!

236
00:12:57,714 --> 00:12:59,947
One, two, three, go!

237
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,580
[ALL] We're the AmaBri girls
and we're happy to say

238
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,414
just for 30 yen,
you can play all day.

239
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:07,247
Let me see some more energy!

240
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:08,814
Ready... go!

241
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,180
[ALL] We're the AmaBri girls
and we're happy to say

242
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,647
for just 30 yen,
you can play all day!

243
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:16,980
Latifah,
try not to look so stiff.

244
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,247
[SEIYA] Even more energy!

245
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:20,480
Aaand go!

246
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,014
[ALL] WE'RE THE AMABRI GIRLS
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SAY,

247
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:25,480
FOR JUST 30 YEN,
YOU CAN PLAY ALL DAY!

248
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,414
[SEIYA] Come on, Sento,
you're not even smiling.

249
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:30,014
One more time!

250
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:32,247
[ALL on VIDEO] We're the AmaBri
girls and we're happy to say,

251
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:36,280
for just 30 yen,
you can play all day!

252
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,814
[TRIKEN] Oh yes, this will do,
this will do just fine!

253
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:42,847
In fact,
I'm hunched over with joy!

254
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,147
[SEIYA] You don't LOOK
hunched over, but great.

255
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:47,447
[TRIKEN] You know,
I was surprised Mr. Moffle

256
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:50,380
allowed Princess Latifah
to be in the video.

257
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,014
Huh? Wait, what do you mean?

258
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:54,547
[TRIKEN] Oh, that's right,
perhaps nobody told you.

259
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,347
Mr. Moffle is actually
the princess'‐

260
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,514
[MOFFLE] Seiya Kanieeeee!

261
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:00,114
[whomp!]

262
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,914
You have to stop this now!

263
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:04,814
Now what's wrong?!
[MOFFLE] That ad is obscene!

264
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:07,680
I told you,
I'm not taking orders from you!

265
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,580
How dare you treat my
Latifah like that?!

266
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,214
You little...

267
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:16,247
I'm gonna make you pay for this!

268
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:17,680
[SEIYA] Hyaaaah!

269
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,580
<i>Wait, I see his pattern!</i>

270
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,547
[ungh!] You're mine!

271
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:23,314
[gun fires twice]
[BOTH] (ungh...]

272
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:24,980
[ISUZU] No fighting.

273
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,180
[SEIYA] This feels familiar.

274
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,580
[ISUZU]
Try to calm down, Lord Moffle.

275
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,414
[MOFFLE] Calm down?

276
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:32,480
Latifah's in bad health.

277
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,580
She was too exposed!

278
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,547
I can't forgive that!

279
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:38,047
What do you mean bad health?

280
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:40,280
Besides, I told her
she didn't have to do it

281
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,714
if she didn't want to.

282
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,647
Latifah's a very sweet girl.

283
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:46,914
She doesn't know how to say no.
And you took advantage of that!

284
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:51,947
[ISUZU] Relax. Her Highness
knew what was expected of her
before she agreed.

285
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,147
Well, even if she did, she‐

286
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:56,280
I've told you this
several times.

287
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,914
Making a fuss
about things like this

288
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:00,914
will only make Her Majesty
even more miserable.

289
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,314
You've got a point.

290
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:06,980
But please don't take her out of
the rooftop garden anymore

291
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,914
if at all possible, all right?

292
00:15:09,014 --> 00:15:11,214
That's her magic barrier.

293
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:13,447
[ISUZU] Of course, I know that.

294
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,214
Why? What happens?

295
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,947
[MOFFLE] (hmph!)

296
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,580
Why should I even bother
explaining that to you?

297
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,380
You'll be gone in
three months, right?

298
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,480
The truth is Princess Latifah
suffers from certain
complications

299
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,547
that make it difficult for her
to leave the magic protection
of the rooftop garden.

300
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:36,414
And is it such a big secret
that you can't even tell me
what's wrong with her?

301
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:38,247
No, not exactly.

302
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:41,480
It's just... it's not the sort
of thing a lot of people
should know about.

303
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,447
I don't think it'll get in
the way of your management
responsibilities,

304
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:47,980
but I do recommend that you
keep it in mind from now on.

305
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,514
[TRIKEN] (hmmm?)

306
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:52,714
[SEIYA] (sigh)

307
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:55,547
What do you propose we do,
Acting Manager?

308
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,180
Finish it like we planned.

309
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,614
I've got another video I
want you to edit after that,

310
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:02,014
so get this one done
as quick as you can.

311
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:04,147
[TRIKEN] Understood.

312
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:17,880
[MACARON] I gotta say,
that video's not getting
very many views so far.

313
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,880
[MOFFLE] Stop looking at it!
[MACARON] Okay!

314
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,414
[sigh] No surprise there.

315
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:28,014
Even swimsuits aren't enough
to get the public's attention
these days.

316
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:35,280
[SEIYA] Sento...

317
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,514
Yes?

318
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:39,047
Could you tell me the total
visitor count for today?

319
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:42,680
[ISUZU]
198, no different than normal.

320
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,447
Thank you.

321
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:51,314
[aha!]

322
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,447
So about the swimsuit video
we posted...

323
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:58,647
Well, it appears we've had
an unexpected turn of
events overnight.

324
00:16:58,747 --> 00:17:00,614
[hmpf] Oh, I know.

325
00:17:00,714 --> 00:17:01,947
[ISUZU] You do?

326
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:04,147
Good, then maybe we can
deal with it quickly.

327
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:07,180
Moff o' the morning!
[ISUZU] (hmmm?)

328
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,314
[MOFFLE] Check this out!
[TAKESHI'S DAD] (ungh)

329
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:13,080
[ISUZU]
Yes, I was just about to break
the news to Kanie, actually.

330
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,580
Aw, man! I'm a star mascot
no matter what I'm doing!

331
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,447
My charm can even turn the
stickiest of situations into
golden opportunities!

332
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:25,280
I'm so talented, I scare myself.

333
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,614
Say, how many hits does that
swimsuit video have now?

334
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,714
Last time I checked,
it was over 12,000.

335
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:34,447
But look at MY video!

336
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:37,080
Ta‐da! 200K!

337
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,047
Which means yours is probably
just getting attention

338
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:42,447
because it comes up as
related whenever somebody
clicks on mine!

339
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:47,280
Sure sucks to be you right now,
doesn't it?
[SEIYA] (chuckling)

340
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
What's with you?

341
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:53,114
(chuckling, into laughing)

342
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:55,214
[MOFFLE]
Wh‐what's so moffin' funny?!

343
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:58,580
Did you see who
posted the video?

344
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,280
[MOFFLE]
A, Y, I, E, S...

345
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,680
"Ayies"?

346
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,214
What's that s'posed to be?

347
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:07,180
[SEIYA]
Try reading it backwards.

348
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,614
[MOFFLE] Seiya!
[ISUZU] (gasp!)

349
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:09,847
You didn't!

350
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:11,180
Believe it or not, I did.

351
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,680
I was the one who
posted that video!

352
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,114
Right, Triken?
[TRIKEN] Right!

353
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:18,580
You see, Miss Salama captured
the footage of the fight

354
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,947
and then the acting manager and
I did the editing and posted it.

355
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:23,880
So, there you have it.

356
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,780
"Star mascot" huh?

357
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,714
If Triken and I hadn't
posted that video,

358
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:31,514
then nobody would've ever
found out that you did anything
in the first place!

359
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:33,014
And your charm?

360
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:34,780
If we hadn't cut it to look
like you were the good guy,

361
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,480
the Internet would hate your
little rat guts by now!
[MOFFLE] (grrr)

362
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,547
So, it looks like I'M the one
who knows how to turn

363
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:43,447
the stickiest of situations
into golden opportunities.

364
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:47,047
I'm so good I scare myself.
[MOFFLE] (grrr)

365
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:48,780
Lord Moffle's video aside,

366
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,014
the fact remains that
not many people have seen
the swimsuit ad yet.

367
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:54,914
Will this really
attract more people?

368
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,380
Even if it does,
it won't be that many.

369
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,747
[BOTH] (huh?)

370
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,680
My statistical knowledge
tells me that

371
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,880
fewer than 1% of the people
who saw that ad

372
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,814
will actually decide
to come here.

373
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:10,147
[ISUZU] Then why did you make us
wear those embarrassing
bathing suits?!

374
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:13,180
Because if it gets us one more
visitor, it's worth it!

375
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,180
[BOTH] Huh?!

376
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,180
I'm ready to do
whatever it takes.

377
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:26,414
I have to go.

378
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:29,014
The guests are waiting for me.

379
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,280
[sigh]

380
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,480
[CHILDREN]
(shouting & giggling)

381
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,880
Oh, good evening,
Mr. Acting Manager.
It's nice to see you.

382
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,847
Hey, how's today's
visitor count looking?

383
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:55,714
We managed to get
a few more today. 223!

384
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:59,280
That's great! It looks like
the changes are already
starting to pay off.

385
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,480
[OKURO]
Yeah, and that's not all.
[BOTH] (hmmm?)

386
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,880
[CHILDREN]
(shouting & giggling)
[SEIYA] Yeah?

387
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,914
[OKURO]
Mr. Moffle seems like he's extra
fired up today or something.

388
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:12,280
He's doing a great job.

389
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,514
[OKURO]
The kids look really happy.
[MOFFLE] Moff! Moff! Moff!

390
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,247
That's our star mascot for you.

391
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,614
[ISUZU]
I was told this was a party...

392
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:29,947
for boosting everyone's morale.

393
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,147
So why are there
only four of us?

394
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,380
[MOFFLE]
Nobody else wanted to come.

395
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,547
That's because bonding
over booze is something
old people do!

396
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:39,014
Didn't you know that?

397
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:42,547
Well, anyway,
good work today, guys! Moff...

398
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:43,714
[ALL] Cheers!

399
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:45,447
[ISUZU] Chee‐

400
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:54,552
[MACARON] Maybe you're not so
popular after all, Moffle‐ron.
[MOFFLE] (grrr)

401
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:58,352
[TIRAMY]
Yeah, some Cast Leader you are!
[MOFFLE] (ungh)

402
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:00,586
Plus, there's that
sister complex, mii.

403
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:02,786
[MOFFLE]
What are you talking about?

404
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,352
Everybody knows it.

405
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:06,619
The only reason you're
so protective of
Princess Latifah‐ron

406
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:10,119
is because she's the spitting
image of your sister, and you‐
[MOFFLE] (grrr!)

407
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:13,352
[BOTH] (ooowwww!)

408
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:16,786
You punks got a problem with
me caring about my niece?!

409
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:18,252
Oh, now you've done it!

410
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:20,552
You wanna piece of mii?!

411
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:24,319
[BOTH] You're goin' down!
[MOFFLE] Not today!

412
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:26,319
[guns firing]

413
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,852
[ISUZU] No fighting.
[OTHERS] (ow, ow, ow)

414
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:31,352
[TIRAMY] Jeez, Isuzu, a girl
should be more gentle, mii!

415
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:34,586
[ISUZU] What do I care about how
you think girls should behave?

416
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:37,986
Isuzu, you seem like
you're in a bad mood.

417
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:40,219
This is about Kanie, isn't it?

418
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,986
Why would you be bringing up
Kanie all of a sudden?

419
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:46,686
Well, it's just that I noticed
that every time you were
around him today,

420
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,619
you looked a little sad,
that's all.

421
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:50,986
Ooh, that sounds like
a scandal, mii!

422
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:52,919
That dirty dog, ron!

423
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,252
That was nothing.

424
00:21:54,352 --> 00:21:56,319
You know, Macaron,
I heard she spent the night

425
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:58,452
over at Kanie's place
not too long ago!

426
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:01,119
Oh, really?
So they're shackin' up?!
[ISUZU] (grrr)

427
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,619
[guns firing]

428
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,219
[ALL] (ow, ow, ow)
[ISUZU] (panting)

429
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,719
[WANIPEE] What'll we dooooo?!
[ISUZU] (huh?)

430
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:11,019
Princess Latifah, she...
[MOFFLE] Moffu?!

431
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,786
[gasp]

432
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:57,952
[ISUZU & SEIYA] Time for
the attractions spotlight.

433
00:23:58,052 --> 00:24:00,719
[ISUZU] Today's feature is
Tiramy's Flower Adventure.

434
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:04,286
[SEIYA] (ugh) You mean
the super‐uncomfortable
gondola ride?

435
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:07,152
[ISUZU] Apparently, Tiramy
offers a backstage tour.

436
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:09,019
[SEIYA]
What do you mean "apparently"?

437
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,919
Shouldn't you know
that for sure?

438
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:15,252
[ISUZU] Rumor has it the tour's
only available to attractive
female visitors.

439
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:16,852
[SEIYA] Oh, of COURSE it is!

440
00:24:16,952 --> 00:24:18,619
Shut it down!
