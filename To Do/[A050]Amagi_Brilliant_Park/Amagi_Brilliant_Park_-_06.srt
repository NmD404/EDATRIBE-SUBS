1
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:09,569
We don't have enough staff!

2
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:13,102
Aw,moff! First, it was money,
now it's personnel?

3
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:16,802
But, sir, you only just
hired several new employees
a few days ago.

4
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:20,635
With no consideration for the
cost of paying them all,
I might add.

5
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:22,135
[urk!]

6
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:23,969
Okay, so we did hire
a few more people,

7
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:26,502
but that was only in that
one specialized area.

8
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:28,402
We just need more in general.

9
00:00:28,502 --> 00:00:30,802
So, you're suggesting that
we do some new recruiting?

10
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:34,602
I'm not so sure about that.
Do you really think we'll
get enough applicants?

11
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,002
We won't know until we try.

12
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,569
There might be a whole flock
of beautiful girls

13
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:40,335
just dying to work here.

14
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:43,702
If that happens, I'll be bowing
down in gratitude.

15
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:48,269
Who knows, one of them might
even rival you, Miss Isuzu.

16
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,702
Possibly.
But if anyone who applies

17
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,502
is more suited for the
position than I am,

18
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:55,169
I'll gladly surrender my
post on the spot.

19
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:56,935
[ALL] Uh...

20
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:00,935
I'm sorry, Miss Isuzu,
that was a joke.
[ISUZU] (uh...)

21
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:07,002
Well, anyway, we can start
looking tomorrow.

22
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:08,935
That'll be all!

23
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:49,356
[GIRLS] Mr. Kanie!

24
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:50,456
[ah!]

25
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:52,456
You need a new secretary?

26
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:53,756
I can do it!

27
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:55,590
Pick me!

28
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,523
Huh?

29
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:58,290
(laughing)

30
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,956
[SEIYA] You're hired!
All of you start immediately!
[GIRLS] (giggling)

31
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,290
Wait a minute...

32
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,856
[SEIYA] I had a feeling
this interview process

33
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:06,256
would cause some pressure.

34
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:09,690
So you three just keep on
pressuring me, okay?

35
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,356
[grrr]
[GIRLS] (giggling)

36
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:15,923
Stop this right now!
It isn't professional!

37
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:19,223
[hmmm?] Oh, hey, Sento.
You're still here?

38
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,756
[gasp]

39
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:23,190
I don't need you anymore.

40
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,190
[gasp] No!
[gunshot]

41
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:33,356
[ah!] [huh?]

42
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,923
A dream?

43
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:44,556
<i>Why would I dream</i>
<i>something like that?</i>

44
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:47,590
You know, I've been through
my share of setbacks too.

45
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,823
If it gets us one more visitor,
then it's worth it!

46
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:53,623
I'm ready to do
whatever it takes.

47
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:56,156
I... well, uh...

48
00:03:56,256 --> 00:04:00,156
I couldn't deal with
high places, not anymore.

49
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,323
[sigh]

50
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:23,923
[ummm] [nervous giggle]

51
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:25,990
[gasp]

52
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:28,290
[sigh]

53
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,990
[background chatter]

54
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,490
[MACARON] Whoa, I can't believe
you actually eat the curry here.
[ISUZU] (hmmm?)

55
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,290
Oh, good morning, Macaron.

56
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,356
Good morning, ron.

57
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:43,490
Don't tell me you really
like that garbage.

58
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,856
I don't know, I just felt like
having something else today.

59
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:48,823
Okay, it's your funeral.

60
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:53,223
One time, Wanipee‐ron
exploded out both ends
after eating that junk.

61
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:55,590
Mind if I sit here?
[ISUZU] Sure.

62
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:57,923
[ughhh...]

63
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:00,656
Curry for breakfast is
gonna make you fat.

64
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:02,223
That doesn't really concern me.

65
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:05,190
And you look like a pathetic
loner when you eat by yourself.

66
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,056
That doesn't concern me either.

67
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:11,590
Oh, come on, it's almost like
you're being boring on purpose!
[ISUZU] (huh?)

68
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,090
Let me guess: You're the kind of
person who overthinks everything

69
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,490
and gets all
word‐constipated, right?!
[ISUZU] (ah!)

70
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:21,456
[ISUZU]
That doesn't concern me either.

71
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:23,856
[sigh]

72
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,456
[MACARON]
Look, there's Kanie‐ron!

73
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:29,890
[thrumming]

74
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,056
[splut!]

75
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:44,590
Nevermind! That wasn't him.
[ISUZU] Oh...

76
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:50,556
[heh, heh]

77
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:52,190
Yes!

78
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,623
[students arriving at school]

79
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,656
Hey, wait up, Sento!

80
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,623
You seem kinda sad today.

81
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:01,956
Yes, I had a terrible dream,

82
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:03,490
breakfast tasted disgusting,

83
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,823
my colleague criticized me,
[GIRL] (hmmm?)

84
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:08,323
and my job's going as
badly as it possibly can.

85
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:10,556
Oh, wow,
that sounds pretty tough.

86
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,990
Of course it is!

87
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,523
And I'm supposed to be
assisting Kanie with his work,

88
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:16,823
but what if I'm not
meeting his expectations?

89
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:20,156
I'm so afraid he
might decide to‐ [ah!]

90
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,456
Wait, did you say "Kanie"?
What's he got to‐

91
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:25,690
What's wrong, Sento?

92
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,290
[mmmm] I have to go!
[GIRL] (huh?)

93
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,890
Whoa!

94
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,623
[MOFFLE] One, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two...

95
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:40,556
And finish!

96
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:44,923
Only Sylphy got it
right, as usual.

97
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:47,590
Back to one!
[THREE] Aww...

98
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:49,290
No way, mii!

99
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,090
How did you get Isuzu to
swallow a ponesty bean?!

100
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,690
I snuck it into her food
this morning.

101
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,656
But, Macaron, I only gave you
that bean because you told me

102
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:59,590
you wanted to find out how
your daughter really feels
about you, mii!

103
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,123
I thought you were gonna try
to get custody back from
your ex‐wife, remember?

104
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,823
Oh yeah, that's still the plan.

105
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:09,590
But I wanted to test it on
Isuzu‐ron first, in case
it's dangerous.

106
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,790
Ooh, you ARE bad!

107
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,956
Poor Isuzu must be spilling
her guts all over the
place today, mii!

108
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:20,456
Too bad she went off to school
before I could see what kinda
funny stuff it made her say.

109
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:22,656
Aw man, that's a bummer!

110
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,256
Dude, if it were me,

111
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:26,756
I would've asked her how many
times a week she slaps the flap!

112
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:27,956
[MACARON] You're so nasty!
[BOTH] (giggling)

113
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,156
If you asked her
something like that,

114
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,556
she'd blow your brains out!
[clack]

115
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:36,290
[ISUZU] Don't worry about that.
[BOTH] (ah!) (uuuhhhh....)

116
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,290
If you want, I'll get it
over with right now!

117
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,956
[BOTH] (WAAAHHH!!!)
[gunshots]

118
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:44,590
What did you do now?

119
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,290
[panting]

120
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,890
[ISUZU] I had to.
They slipped me a ponesty bean

121
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,356
so they could ask me
inappropriate questions.

122
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:54,323
Inappropriate?

123
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:57,423
Like how many times a week‐
[mmff!]

124
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:59,256
Just forget it!

125
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:01,856
I still don't understand,
but whatever.

126
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:03,523
As soon as you clean up
all the bodies,

127
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,590
could you meet me in the
administration building?

128
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,423
We're starting the
interviews at 1.

129
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:10,356
[ISUZU] (ah!) I forgot?!

130
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,323
What? Do you have a
problem with that?

131
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,356
I have several
problems with that!

132
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:16,490
I can't keep from
speaking my mind!

133
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,523
I'm scared I might accidentally
reveal these strange feelings
I have for you‐

134
00:08:20,623 --> 00:08:22,956
ah!] [mmmm!]

135
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,823
[SEIYA] Are you okay there?

136
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,356
[ISUZU] Of course I'm not!
Let me call in sick!

137
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:33,023
If I stay here, you might find
out how I fee‐ [mmmmphf!]

138
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:35,456
[argh!] [argh!]

139
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:39,723
You look like you've got
plenty of energy to me, Sento.

140
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:42,190
Anyway, don't be late.

141
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,956
[ah!]

142
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:59,168
[JIRO] (forced laugh)

143
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:02,634
Well, y'see folks, I didn't
do so hot in the mayoral
election the other day,

144
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,434
so I was hoping I could just
work here until I find myself

145
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,801
and maybe shoot for
prime minister next time.

146
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:09,034
Good luck with that!

147
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:11,734
He's so determined.
[SEIYA] Yeah, we could hire him.

148
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,734
[MOFFLE]
Are you moffin' serious?!

149
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,601
[SEIYA] I figure somebody
who's that resilient

150
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:17,668
is less likely
to walk out on us.

151
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:18,901
Moff...

152
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:20,501
[PITCHER] (waaahh!)

153
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,901
Why? WHY did I decide
to make that stupid pitch

154
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,801
in the very last inning?!

155
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,434
I'm so ashamed!

156
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,768
And how does that
make you qualified?

157
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:32,868
High school athletes DO create
some interesting drama.

158
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,801
Okay, let's hire him.
[MOFFLE] What?!

159
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,601
Cast members are expected
to be entertaining for
the guests, right?

160
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:38,968
Moff...

161
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:42,301
I was recently fired from my job
as a professional wrestler.

162
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:44,634
See, I've always been
a little sensitive.

163
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,501
So I didn't really like doing
wrestling techniques on people.

164
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,334
I mean, I never wanted
to hurt anybody.

165
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:50,901
A wrestler who doesn't wrestle.

166
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:53,534
But Okuro in security is
already a masked man.

167
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,734
And we can't have two.

168
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,468
THAT'S what you
have a problem with?!

169
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:58,701
You mean, I don't get the job?

170
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,734
Well, you could take it off.

171
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,534
I refuse!
[MOFFLE] That was sudden!

172
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:04,268
Sorry, but you look
too similar to a character

173
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:05,801
we already have on the payroll.

174
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,401
I would rather die
than remove my mask!

175
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,234
[SEIYA] (grrr)

176
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:12,301
We need to get Okuro in here.

177
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:14,401
[BING!]
[BOTH] (ungh...)

178
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,901
[SEIYA] I thought you
couldn't hurt anybody?

179
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:20,068
[ISUZU] His pro‐wrestler
instincts took over.
[SEIYA] Hired.

180
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:23,734
Didn't know the requirements
were literally just living
and breathing.

181
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:27,134
I told you we were desperate
for new hires, stupid rat.

182
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,868
I am the legendary
shadow of Iga,

183
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:31,968
prepared to lay down my life
for my lord at any time.
[SEIYA] Hired.

184
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:34,301
Earth is mostly water‐
[COUNTDOWN] Five... four...
[SEIYA] Hired!

185
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,201
Hayoooooooooooooo!!
[SEIYA] Hired.

186
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:38,968
[EIKO] Excuse me.

187
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,168
[GONG!]

188
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:47,968
My name is Eiko Adachi.
Thank you for taking the
time to see me today.

189
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:49,568
She's normal!

190
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:52,601
And I was starting to think all
of them would be crazy people.

191
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:54,468
[gasp!]

192
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,968
She...

193
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,934
She was in my dream!

194
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:01,934
[hmm?]

195
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,101
[uhhh...]

196
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:06,068
Uh, right, let's see,
Eiko Adachi...

197
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:09,368
Oh, it says here you used to
work with a talent agency,

198
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,168
and that you've performed
in a few films.

199
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:14,968
Can you tell us a little bit
about the kind of movies
you've starred in?

200
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:17,468
Sure! I did AV.

201
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:19,934
That's pretty cool.
Wait, what?
[MOFFLE] (huh?!)

202
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,268
I did AV.

203
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:23,434
[BOTH] (wah!)
[ISUZU] (grrr)

204
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,068
I see...

205
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:27,001
Uh, did you do a lot of those?

206
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:30,134
Oh, no, I only ever worked
on about ten films.

207
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:31,601
Only ten films?!

208
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,101
Right.
[MOFFLE] Moff!

209
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:35,701
[MOFFLE] She did adult video?!
Ask for her stage name!

210
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,468
I'm not asking her for that!

211
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,701
For what?
[SEIYA] Ah, nothing!
Nothing at all!

212
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,834
Sorry about that, we were
just a little surprised

213
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,901
by your unusual
work history, that's all.

214
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,268
I get that all the time,
to tell you the truth.

215
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:49,401
So please don't worry.
I'm used to it by now.

216
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,068
Uh, so glad to hear that...

217
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,968
Why are YOU sweating? She's the
one who's getting interviewed!

218
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:57,168
Now hurry up and ask her
what her porn name is!

219
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:59,601
Quit acting like such a creep!

220
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,901
Moff, moff...

221
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:04,968
[small giggle]

222
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:07,701
[deep breath]
S‐Sento, what should we do?

223
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,301
[ISUZU] (grrr)
[SEIYA] (ungh!)

224
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:12,068
Do not rely on me
for advice today, Kanie!

225
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:13,301
I am a mess right now!

226
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:15,301
I'm sitting here about
to die from shock

227
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,668
because that woman looks
just like the one from the
nightmare I had last night!

228
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:21,701
And here you are getting
all excited about her
adult video career!

229
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:23,601
I understand that she's got
bigger breasts than I do,

230
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,168
and that she looks like one of
those mature, comforting types

231
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:29,468
and that her level of sexual
experience is probably
off the charts,

232
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:30,968
but you don't even know her!

233
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:33,434
Don't tell me! You're thinking
about making her your new

234
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:36,401
[gasp!] [mmmphf!]

235
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:38,934
[mmmphf!] [mmmphf!] [mmmphf!]

236
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,868
Uh, Sento?

237
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:43,301
So, why did you apply?

238
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:45,868
Uh, oh, yeah, good question.

239
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:48,768
Could you tell us why
you're interested in
working at our park?

240
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,768
Well, to be perfectly
honest with you,

241
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,934
I wasn't very good
at my last job.

242
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,934
Although it was satisfying.

243
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:56,501
[BOTH] Satisfying?!

244
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,368
But then I decided it would be
a lot more fulfilling

245
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:02,568
if I could see it with my own
eyes when the customers
enjoy the work I do.

246
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:05,201
Oh, but that isn't much of
a reason, now is it?

247
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:08,568
Oh, no, I think it's a
perfectly good reason actually.
[MOFFLE] (um‐hmm, um‐hmm)

248
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:10,668
So why did she come HERE?

249
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:11,901
Who cares!

250
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,401
You've been hired.

251
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,368
[EIKO] Thank you very much!

252
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:19,001
[phone alert]

253
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:21,468
So, what's that about?

254
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,501
Moff, I sent Triken
a picture of Eiko Adachi

255
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:26,168
so he could track her down.

256
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:28,234
He's kind of a porn expert.

257
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:31,334
Oh,I see, that's interesting.

258
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:33,334
Anyway, who we got next?

259
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:35,701
He found it?
[MOFFLE] Found what?

260
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:36,668
[ummm]

261
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:39,501
You know, uh,
did he find out the...

262
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:42,468
Oh, yeah, he figured out her
stage name and everything.

263
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,468
You're so nasty.
[SEIYA] (ah!) Look...

264
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:47,234
[door opening]
[BIINO] I'm sorry I'm late!

265
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,668
Hi there!

266
00:13:48,768 --> 00:13:52,468
My name's Biino Bando.
Thank you for seeing me today!

267
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:55,501
[ISUZU] Again?!
She was there too!

268
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:59,434
[hmm] She seems enthusia‐

269
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:02,001
Uh, Ms. Bando?
[BIINO] Yes, sir?

270
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:03,868
[SEIYA] Are you bleeding?

271
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,168
[BIINO] Oh, sorry about that,
I was in such a rush.

272
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:08,568
[SEIYA] Are you okay?!

273
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:09,768
Of course, I'm fine!

274
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:12,634
It's nothing but a scratch!
I promise!

275
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:15,701
[SEIYA] (ah!) Uhhh...

276
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:17,801
[MOFFLE] Moff!
Looks like a stab wound.

277
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:21,001
I'd say she's lost about a
liter's worth of blood so far.

278
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:22,268
[SEIYA] She needs help!

279
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:24,001
No really,
I don't need any help.

280
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:28,701
I'm putting everything on the
line for this interview...
[ungh...]

281
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,034
It's not worth your life!
Trust me!

282
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:35,901
[BIINO] No, I'll die
before I give this up... [hack]

283
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,868
All right, fine, you're hired!
You've got the job!

284
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:42,734
Now, please let me call an
ambulance before you die!

285
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:45,168
[panting]

286
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:46,634
[BOTH] (ah!)
[SEIYA] Who is this guy?!

287
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,101
He's my older brother.
[SEIYA] Your older brother?!

288
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:51,868
[BIINO] He said he didn't want
me to take on a part time job.

289
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:55,434
He wanted to stop me from coming
to the interview, so he‐

290
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:56,734
[SEIYA]
I'm really worried about you...

291
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:58,334
What do you think
we should do with him?

292
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:00,568
You got the job!
[SEIYA] No way!

293
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:04,268
[BROTHER] (wah!) (hyah!)

294
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:05,668
[splat!]

295
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:07,468
Hey, control your brother!

296
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:11,101
[grrr]
[gunshot]

297
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,768
Moff!
[BROTHER] (arrgghh!)

298
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,501
[unfffh!]

299
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:23,434
[splat!]

300
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:26,768
He's gonna be eating through
a tube from now on.

301
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:32,634
[MOFFLE] I wonder if we're
gonna regret hiring that one?
[SHIINA] Um...

302
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:34,401
I think we made
the right choice.

303
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,501
I know it's not normally
rational to hire someone

304
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,401
after an interview
goes that badly,

305
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,868
but she had the incredible
composure and fortitude

306
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:43,301
to keep smiling despite
having just been stabbed,

307
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,368
and I believe the park
could benefit from that.
[SEIYA] Hmm...

308
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,001
What's wrong?

309
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:49,968
Nothing, I think what
you're saying makes sense.
[SHIINA] Um...

310
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:52,434
But if you're really that
good at deciding what's
best for AmaBri,

311
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,968
maybe you should take a look
at your own behavior while
you're at it, huh?

312
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:58,234
[huh?!]
[MOFFLE] If only your brain
was as big as your boobs.

313
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,301
[grrr] Now you're both dead!

314
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:02,434
[BOTH]
THAT'S what we're talking about!

315
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,401
[SHIINA] (squeal)
[SEIYA] (hmm?)

316
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,701
Wait a second; who's that?

317
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:08,068
E‐E‐E‐Excuse me!
[ISUZU] (huh?!)

318
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,434
[gasp] She was in my dream too!

319
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:14,934
Dream? What the heck is
going on with you today?

320
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:17,134
[huh?] I'm perfectly fine.

321
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:19,468
Anyway,
this is the last applicant.

322
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,768
Isn't that the
Amagi High uniform?

323
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:25,034
Y‐Yes! M‐M‐My name's
Sh‐Sh‐Shiina Chujo!

324
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:29,968
U‐um, the reason I wanted t‐t‐to
work here is b‐because I‐

325
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:33,968
[SEIYA] Stop panicking!
[SHIINA] (ah! I‐I'm s‐sorry...

326
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,768
[sigh] So, what do you think?

327
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:39,234
I think she'll do.
We didn't end up hiring
very many girls today.

328
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:43,668
And she doesn't look like the
type who'd try to seduce y
[mmmphf!]

329
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:45,701
[SHIINA] (huh?) (ah!)
[ISUZU] [mmmphf!] [mmmphf!]

330
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,601
Moff, I'm not sure if she'd
be okay talking to guests

331
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:51,368
with a scaredy‐cat
personality like that.

332
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,368
But sure, let's give her a shot.

333
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:55,734
And here I was expecting you
to turn this one down.

334
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,168
After all the circus freaks
we've seen today,

335
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,901
I don't think I care anymore.

336
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,101
Good point.

337
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:02,434
Well,
I guess that settles it then.

338
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:04,668
Shiina Chujo, welcome aboard.

339
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:07,334
[aahhhh!]
Th‐thank you so much, sir!

340
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,468
I appreciate it!

341
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:12,934
[hmpf]

342
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,379
[SEIYA]
That should be all of it.

343
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,679
[stretch]

344
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:39,513
[hmm?] Need something?

345
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:41,746
[ISUZU] What you said before...
[SEIYA] Before?

346
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,146
Macaron said something
like that today too.

347
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:47,446
He says that I overthink things
and get tongue‐tied.

348
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:50,379
[hmmm?]

349
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:54,013
[ISUZU] I've never been
very good at interacting with
other people face‐to‐face.

350
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:56,146
[SEIYA] Hence, the gun.
[ISUZU] That's right.

351
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,479
If I'm the one who's in control,

352
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:01,246
then I can think about
the situation logically.

353
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,879
Technically, I criticized your
judgement of character,

354
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:07,579
not your ability to
talk to people.
[ISUZU] (ah!) (huh?)

355
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,746
[SEIYA]
So quit moping around, jeez.

356
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:13,646
I suppose this is your
backhanded way of
cheering me up?

357
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:17,779
Cheering you up?
Why would I do that?
[ISUZU] (sigh)

358
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:22,746
I'm envious of you in more
ways than one, you know.

359
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:25,579
To me, Kanie, you're very‐

360
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,046
[mphf!] [mphf!] [mphf!]
[SEIYA] Not that again!

361
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:29,913
Don't feel bad.
I can totally understand
[ISUZU] (panting)

362
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,146
you being jealous of
my superior genius.

363
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:34,146
Don't you think you ought
to do something about the way

364
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,646
you always talk down to everyone
as though you're better
than they are?

365
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:40,146
But that's the thing.
I AM better than everybody else.

366
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:41,746
What do you expect me to do?

367
00:18:41,846 --> 00:18:45,179
Goddess Libra, please unleash
your wrath on this wretched man.

368
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,579
[SEIYA] What did you say?

369
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,013
None of your business.

370
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:51,013
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd better go.

371
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,013
[satisfied sigh]

372
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,246
Hmm...

373
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:08,613
She was acting like
such a weirdo today.
[phone buzz]

374
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:13,746
Huh...

375
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:22,279
What's with that emoji?

376
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,246
[MACARON] What a dumbass, ron!

377
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:26,846
How could anybody
mistake this...

378
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:27,846
for THIS?!

379
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:30,179
I guess the aspect ratio
got moffed up

380
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,646
when I sent Triken
that picture.

381
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:34,146
We might as well
watch it anyway, mii!

382
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:35,213
No way!

383
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:36,913
Yeah, not my thing.

384
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:38,713
Eh, I can dig it.

385
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:39,646
[huh?]

386
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,113
[BOTH] (wah?!)
[TIRAMY] (giggling)

387
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,913
[BOTH] (UGGHHH!)

388
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:04,813
[nervous breath]

389
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:08,579
[gasp]

390
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:10,846
[EIKO]
Aw, look, it's a baby lamb!
[LAMB] (bleating)

391
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:15,846
It's amazing the way it sucks
and sucks on its mother's nipple
for dear life!
[ISUZU] (uuhhh...)

392
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:17,713
[EIKO]
And look at those kittens!

393
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,979
They love drinking
their mother's milk!

394
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,179
Next, we have piglets.

395
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,479
Oh my goodness, they're
fighting over their mommy!

396
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,613
[ISUZU]
Oh, so AV means "animal video".
[EIKO] Isn't that sweet?

397
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,313
[ALL] (wow!)
[SHIINA] It's Moffle!

398
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:37,013
[JIRO] The famous trio!

399
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:38,246
[ALL] (ah!)

400
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:40,113
Shut your pieholes!

401
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:41,979
And don't look so happy.

402
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,246
I want you maggots
in a straight line!

403
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,713
Listen up, punks!

404
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:48,579
From this day forward,
you are no longer human beings.

405
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,013
You are lower than scum!
Do you understand me?!

406
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:53,346
We're gonna beat you senseless
with everything you need to know

407
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:55,113
about excellent
customer service, ron!

408
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,946
There's nothing more
satisfying to us than

409
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:59,946
watching you losers break down
and cry after you fail, mii!

410
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:01,179
Lesson Number One:

411
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,746
The first and last words
out of your mouth are "sir!"

412
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:08,346
You got that?
[ALL] S‐Sir! Yes, sir!

413
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:10,546
I can't hear you!
[ALL] (wahh!)

414
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:13,579
I want you to say it
loud and clear! Say it!

415
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,579
[ALL] Sir, yes, sir!
[TIRAMY] Not loud enough!

416
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,646
[ALL] Sir, yes, sir!

417
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:21,413
You sound like a bunch of
wussy little girls!

418
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,113
You better learn to‐ [oofff!]

419
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:26,779
Stop scaring them!
What's gonna happen
if all of them quit?!

420
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:28,446
[MOFFLE] Perfect timing.

421
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:29,913
I'll make an example outta you!

422
00:21:30,013 --> 00:21:32,613
Somebody needs to cut you
down to size, rat face!

423
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:34,979
[gunshot]
[BOTH] (arrgghhh!)

424
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:37,979
[ISUZU] No fighting.
[ALL] (gasp)

425
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,713
Does anyone have questions?
[ALL] (gah!) (um‐um!)

426
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,979
[ISUZU & SEIYA] Time for
the attractions spotlight.

427
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,946
[ISUZU]
Today we have Tomb Ranger,

428
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:59,479
the crowd‐favorite
attraction of Wild Valley.

429
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,579
[ISUZU] Visitors are invited to
join Jack Randy on a Wild West
treasure‐hunting adventure.

430
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,746
[SEIYA] Oh, one of those
exploration‐type rides.

431
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,013
Those are fun.
What's the story like?

432
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:10,613
[ISUZU] You fight pirates.
[SEIYA] Uh...

433
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:12,613
[ISUZU] It's set in Japan.
[SEIYA] What?

434
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:14,746
[ISUZU] And the treasure
is miso rice crackers.

435
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:17,746
[SEIYA] Wait, how is
that a Wild West adventure?!
