1
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:18,582
We're out of money.

2
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:23,549
I told you the 30 yen plan
was a bad idea.
[SEIYA] (grrr)

3
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,482
Look, the point is,
I'm really sorry,

4
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:29,349
but we're not gonna be able to
pay anybody for this past month.
[chair rattling]

5
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:31,149
[BOTH] You're not
giving us a paycheck?!

6
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:33,615
[TIRAMY]
What's with that, mii?!
[MACARON] (hyperventilating)

7
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:36,182
Forget it! We can't give you
money we don't have!

8
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:39,482
But I have to go to the bars and
pick up all the loose women!

9
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:40,615
No, you don't.

10
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,549
And I have to play pachinko!

11
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,082
Again, no, you don't!

12
00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:46,915
Listen up! I need you to help me
brainstorm some ideas

13
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,215
to help bring in
some quick revenue.

14
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,082
Betting on horses!

15
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:52,315
[SEIYA] No gambling!

16
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:55,315
Ooh! Adults‐only attractions!

17
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:57,215
[SEIYA] That's probably illegal.

18
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:58,949
Moffle Punching Bag!

19
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,015
[SEIYA] You're just gonna
punch right back.

20
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:03,249
I have the solution here.

21
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:05,449
[SEIYA] Uh, I'm not
sure what that is...

22
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,449
Come on, think!
There's gotta be another way!

23
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,115
[ALL] Hmm...

24
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:12,315
Ron! Here's an idea!

25
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:15,015
Let's pay a visit to
Dornell's Cave!

26
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,315
Dornell's Cave?

27
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:18,782
You know about the
secondary park, don't you?

28
00:01:18,882 --> 00:01:21,682
Yeah, I did read a
little bit about it.

29
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:22,949
So, what's the big deal?

30
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,349
Dornell's Cave is
inside that park! [huh?]

31
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:31,849
Moff! A while back, there was
a flower fairy working here
by the name of Dornell.

32
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:34,182
But one dark night,
he got drunk,

33
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:37,315
and set off on a test of courage
with some of his buddies.

34
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,282
I don't have time for
the whole novel.

35
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:41,649
[tch!]

36
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:44,815
Anyway, they found some
treasure in that cave.

37
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:24,119
Hey, there...
Could we get two crepes please?

38
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:28,319
Uh, hello?

39
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:36,452
Huh? Didn't think it
would be this grand.

40
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:39,085
[ISUZU] The southern region was
supposed to be a second park

41
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,652
with a focus on sports.

42
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:45,885
This stadium was the first
element they built.

43
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:48,452
[MOFFLE] But after the bubble
burst, the plan fell apart

44
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:50,852
and they just kinda
left the building here.

45
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:54,219
[ISUZU]
It was quite disappointing.
Ever since that happened,

46
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,285
the entire southern area's
been completely untouched.

47
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,219
[hmm...]

48
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,119
And rumor has it Dornell never
came out of the cave again
after that night?

49
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,652
[MOFFLE] That's right. [ooff]

50
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:19,985
[SEIYA] Wait, you never told us
what happened to the friends
who came in here with him.

51
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,852
[MACARON] They looked pretty
beat‐up when they were found.

52
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:24,385
One guy said:

53
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:29,585
"There's a frickin' huge
labyrinth in there, dude."
[bleh]

54
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:31,552
[SEIYA] Does that mean they
ended up finding the treasure?

55
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:34,919
[TIRAMY] If that's true,
we're gonna be rich, mii!

56
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,285
[SEIYA] Don't get too excited.

57
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,219
It's a dead end.

58
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,452
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MOOLAH?!
[waaahhh!!!]

59
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,619
Tiramy, this is embarrassing.

60
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,519
I can't believe I wasted all
this time on that ridiculous
story you guys told me.

61
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:52,319
Come on, let's go‐
[TIRAMY] Check it out!

62
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,119
I found a secret switch, mii!
[SEIYA] You call that secret?!

63
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:57,319
[TIRAMY] Now, let's see what
happens when we push it!

64
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,552
No! Wait a second!
[TIRAMY] (shove)

65
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:01,785
[stone grinding]

66
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,552
[ALL] Whoa!

67
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,785
Moff! Seems legit.

68
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:12,719
I feel like a badass, ron!

69
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:15,985
Aw, yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about, mii!

70
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:17,785
Shall we go?
[SEIYA] (ah!)

71
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,952
Wait, Sento! Shouldn't we check
the place out before we just‐

72
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:24,585
[stone grinding]
[SEIYA] (huh?) (ah!)

73
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:27,885
[ALL]
We locked ourselves iiiiiin!

74
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:29,985
[MACARON]
We're gonna die in here!
[ALL] (waaahhh!)

75
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:31,985
[TIRAMY] It was a trap, mii!
[ALL] (waaahhh!)

76
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:34,485
[SEIYA] I told you idiots!

77
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,419
[SEIYA] (sigh)

78
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,019
No way to go but forward,
I guess.

79
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,419
[knock on door]

80
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,619
Can we come in?
Mr. Kanie, we were just hoping

81
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:45,452
we could talk to you
about a new show...

82
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:46,285
Huh?

83
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:47,619
[SYLPHY] Woohoooooo!

84
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:50,585
Miss Isuzu and Mr. Kanie
must've stepped away.

85
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,685
Maybe you should try
texting them real quick.

86
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:56,352
[hmm...] Let's see here...
[SYLPHY] Ina Bauerrrr!

87
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,885
[phone jingle]

88
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,119
[ISUZU] I'm surprised
we have a signal.

89
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:06,285
[phone chime]
[MUSE] (ah!)

90
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:08,919
[SYLPHY] Super Sylphy is at
the top of her game today!

91
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,285
Does that say "hole"?
[SYLPHY]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, goooo!

92
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:12,785
What kinda weird emoji is that?

93
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:14,785
[SYLPHY] Skeletooooon!

94
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,019
What the...

95
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:23,419
[GUARDIAN] (evil laughter)
[ALL] Whoa!

96
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,185
I am the guardian of
this accursed realm.

97
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:30,419
Come, adventurers, enter the
Forsaken Labyrinth of Doom!

98
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,452
Did he just talk?!
[MACARON] Oh my, ron!

99
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:35,285
Such a thing defies
scientific possibility, mii!

100
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:37,985
Oh, yeah, sure! This coming
from the talking pink cat!

101
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:40,152
[stone grinding]
[ALL] (wah!)

102
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:46,652
[BOTH] Wow!

103
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:49,119
[GUARDIAN]
Choose one of these coffins.

104
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:52,752
You will be granted a weapon
of ultimate power!

105
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:56,352
Is he seriously just
handing out weapons, mii?!

106
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:59,552
I hope we don't get
eternally cursed or something.

107
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:03,652
[hmmm?]

108
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:05,185
[SEIYA] A shovel?

109
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:07,285
And I got a stun gun. [crackle]

110
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,285
Check out this huge metal bat!

111
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:12,685
Molotov cocktails!
That's awesome!

112
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:14,152
Mine had a chain.

113
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:16,819
This stuff seems oddly violent
for a family theme park.

114
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,319
[GUARDIAN] Proceed into the
darkness, fearless heroes!

115
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,885
You may go!
[doors creaking]

116
00:07:25,352 --> 00:07:28,185
I feel like something's gonna
jump up out of nowhere.

117
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:30,085
[MOFFLE]
Don't let your guard down.

118
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,252
[loud click]
[TIRAMY] (hmm?)

119
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:32,685
What'd I step on?
[MACARON] (hmm?)

120
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,119
[BOTH] (waaahhh!!)

121
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,685
Oh man, that was close!
I thought we were goners, ron!
[TIRAMY] (waaahhh!)

122
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:40,952
[TIRAMY] Y‐yeah,
I don't wanna be rich after all!

123
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,852
Let's just go home now, mii!

124
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:44,752
[SEIYA] Go home?! How?!

125
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:46,185
Calm the moff down.

126
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:49,385
First, we need to come up
with a survival strategy.

127
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:50,785
Isuzu!

128
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:52,952
I'm ready!

129
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,685
[MOFFLE] Tiramy,
we'll take the front!

130
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:58,152
Macaron, bring up the rear and
keep an eye out for traps.

131
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:00,252
Isuzu, protect the kid!

132
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:02,452
[THREE]
Roger that, Captain Moffle!

133
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,219
Do you guys hear
how dumb you sound?

134
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,352
Now, let's get a moff on!
[loud click]

135
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,185
[gulp!]

136
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:10,285
I think I just moffed up.

137
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:11,652
[SEIYA] You what?!

138
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:13,152
[rumbling]

139
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:14,785
[ALL] Huh?

140
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:19,852
[THREE] ClichÃ© at 12 o' clock!

141
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:21,219
[MOFFLE] All units retreat!

142
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,652
[phone jingle]
[ISUZU] (huh?)

143
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:29,119
[phone chime]

144
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:31,719
[THREE] (oh...)
[SYLPHY] Whoo, Super
Sylphy takes the lead again!

145
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:36,477
Like I said, I don't get
her choice of emoji.
[SYLPHY] I'm a luge champion‐
(crash!)

146
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,648
[click]
[BOTH] (waaahhh!)

147
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:41,881
[ALL] (hyah!)

148
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,148
[waaahhh!!!]

149
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,648
[snick!]
[SEIYA] (ungh!)

150
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:48,315
[waahh!]

00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:51,648

[SEIYA] (argh!)

[ungh!] [oofff!]

153
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:55,781
[gasp!]

154
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:00,281
Sento!

155
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:01,581
ALL] (gasp!)

156
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,181
[OOOWWW!!!]

157
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,148
Sento!

158
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,348
You're more of a jerk
than I thought.

159
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:14,148
[MOFFLE] Moff!
Let's get outta here!
[SEIYA] (struggling)

160
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:18,548
[SEIYA] (panting)

161
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:22,081
They got her...

162
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:24,548
[MOFFLE]
No time to cry about that.

163
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,948
We have to find a way out of
this crazy place first.

164
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:29,781
[SEIYA] I know, I just...

165
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,281
Wait, mii!

166
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,681
Sounds like we got company.

167
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:39,715
[grunts & grumbles]

168
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:47,681
[SEIYA] What are those things?

169
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:50,048
They're ABOUT to get
their butts kicked.

170
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,581
Let's moff 'em up!

171
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:53,815
Why would you
pick a fight with them?!

172
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:54,981
[hmpf!]

173
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,281
Let the men handle this,
chicken boy.

174
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:00,648
[grrr]

175
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,915
[growls & slobbering]

176
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:04,281
[TIRAMY] Here they come!

177
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:07,115
Eat this!
[ORCS] (ungh!)

178
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:11,815
NOW, DANCE!
[ORCS] (waahh!!)

179
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,781
[clang!]
[ORC] (ungh...)

180
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,381
sigh]

181
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:17,948
[MOFFLE] Heh‐heh‐heh...

182
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:19,681
Let the bloodbath begin!

183
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:23,148
I'm gonna make you punks beg
for the sweet release of death!

184
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,448
Can we just go?

185
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:28,115
[ISUZU] (nnnhhh...)

186
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:31,648
[MACARON] (ugh...)

187
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:34,215
[gasp]

188
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:35,848
Where are we?

189
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:38,015
[MACARON]
Some kind of holding cell.

190
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,048
I need a nice long bath.

191
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:42,381
[MACARON]
Not till we get out of here.

192
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,881
[sigh]

193
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:45,648
[MACARON]
Now, how do we open this?

194
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:49,248
Do you have like a hairpin
or something to‐ [gasp!]
[gunshot]

195
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,781
I've got something much better.

196
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,881
I always liked you, ron.

197
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:58,815
That's odd.
Why is it so quiet?

198
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:01,748
You'd think an alarm would
go off or something like that.

199
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:05,648
[DORNELL] (giggle)
This picture is priceless!
[BOTH] (huh?)

200
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:09,848
[perverted laughter]

201
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:16,181
What kind of place is this?

202
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:19,115
[DORNELL]
Huh? Food's here already?

203
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:21,681
[huh?!] Dornell‐ron!

204
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,215
You're still alive?!

205
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:26,181
[hmm?]

206
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:37,002
[SEIYA] (panting)

207
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:39,502
[SEIYA] I'm so exhausted...

208
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:41,602
I can't dig anymore.

209
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,368
[TIRAMY] I'm all out
of Molotov cocktails.

210
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:47,968
If only there was some chemical
fertilizer lying around,

211
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:51,668
I could whip up some
sick explosives and wipe
this place out, mii.

212
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:54,435
[SEIYA] Great, the giant, pink
kitten makes bombs.

213
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:56,002
[BOTH] (hmm?)

214
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:57,935
[BOTH] (wah!)
[ORC] (gyah!)

215
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:01,868
[SEIYA] There's more of them!
[MOFFLE]
Are you moffin' serious?!

216
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,968
[DORNELL] ...and now here I am.
[MACARON] (hmm...)

217
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:07,102
So, you're telling us no one
ever came here to rescue you?

218
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:10,668
And you've spent all this
time collecting figures
and watching anime,

219
00:12:10,768 --> 00:12:14,702
even getting them to set up
internet so you could
play games?

220
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,268
(m‐hmm!)

221
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,635
And you've been down here
for ten years.

222
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:21,902
Uh‐huh!
It's so comfy down here.

223
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:27,135
Hey, would you mind bringing me
something to snack on?

224
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:29,802
I'm in the mood for some
potato chips today.

225
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:32,468
Oh, and some oolong tea
and three cups.

226
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:34,068
Thanks a bunch!

227
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:36,268
Listen... Don't you have
a problem with the fact

228
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:40,002
that everybody in the park
thought you were dead
for the past ten years?

229
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:42,502
[ISUZU] Why didn't you tell
anyone you were alive?

230
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:47,335
(hmmm...) At first I just wanted
it to be a long vacation.

231
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:50,535
But after a while, it was
too awkward to tell anyone.

232
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:54,635
Plus, that was around the same
time I got hooked on MMOs.

233
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:56,502
What's an MMO?
[MACARON] (ugh)

234
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,902
[DORNELL]
You know, online games.

235
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:02,935
For a while there, I was logging
in for like 20 hours every day.

236
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:04,868
That's pretty disgusting, ron.

237
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:07,735
But how did you live your life
in solitude for all these years
[DORNELL] (huh...)

238
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,835
without interacting with anyone?

239
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:12,268
[DORNELL] Well, I play as a
girl, so I'm kinda popular.

240
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,502
[MACARON] I'm not sure how
to respond to that...

241
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:16,835
[MOLE] Pardon me.
[BOTH] Huh?

242
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:20,335
I brought you the chips and
oolong tea you asked for.

243
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:22,668
Oh, perfect, thank you so much!

244
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,468
[BOTH] He's even got a servant?

245
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:26,602
[running feet]

246
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:29,068
[ALL] (hyah!)
[ORCS] (roar!)

247
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:33,302
[ALL] (panting)

248
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:38,484
I can't believe we almost died
over some stupid treasure!
[WAAHHH!!!]

249
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:42,064
[rumbling growl]

250
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,164
[SEIYA] A‐A‐A dragon?!

251
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:52,197
Moff, it's just one thing
after another today.

252
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,364
We're dead, mii!

253
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:56,864
I am known as Rubrum.

254
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:59,830
My wisdom surpasses that of man.

255
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,964
Tell me, why have you
disturbed my slumber?

256
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:05,630
Oh God, what do we do now?!
He's gonna eat us!

257
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,830
Just calm down.

258
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,764
Man up and look him
right in the eye!

259
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:12,097
If you're so brave,
stop using me as a meat shield!

260
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:15,264
[ahem] We're sorry for
bothering you, Mr. Rubrum, sir.

261
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:17,664
I promise you we're not here
to make trouble.

262
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:20,030
You see, the thing is we
kinda lost our way.

263
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,797
So all we're trying to do is
get back to our friends safely.

264
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:26,430
[RUBRUM] As I told you,
I surpass human wisdom.

265
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,864
How can you hope
to fool me with lies?

266
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:31,997
You have only come here
to obtain the hidden treasure!

267
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:34,264
[SEIYA] No, sir! I'm the
acting manager of this park.

268
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:37,030
I'm just here to do a
routine inspection of all
the attractions!

269
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,297
[RUBRUM] Ha! I have lived
in this world for eons now,

270
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:44,530
and my intelligence is
far greater than your own.
You cannot deceive me!

271
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,197
Yeah, yeah, we get it!
You're smart or whatever.
Can we move on now?

272
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:49,364
Tiramy!

273
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:51,130
[RUBRUM] You dare insult me?

274
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,830
Then, you will pay for your
impertinence with your lives!

275
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,264
[ORCS] (growls & roars)

276
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,997
[TIRAMY]
We're in trouble now, mii!

277
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:05,697
[MOFFLE] If I'm goin' down,
I'm takin' all these jokers
down with me!

278
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,730
Wait, I've got an idea.

279
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,664
Hey, Rubrum! You keep telling
us you're more intelligent
than all of mankind,

280
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:12,997
isn't that right?

281
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:16,130
Don't make me laugh!
I can tell you're a liar!

282
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,797
[RUBRUM] (angry growl)

283
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,530
What did you say, human?

284
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,497
I'm a hell of a lot
smarter than you are,
you overgrown lizard!

285
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:26,264
I'd certainly like to
see you prove it.

286
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:29,197
[SEIYA] You bet!
Ask me any question you want.

287
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:32,764
But if I get the right answer,
then you have to let us go free.

288
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,730
Deal?
[RUBRUM] Very well.

289
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,797
But if you cannot answer
correctly, you had better
be prepared to face my wrath.

290
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,330
You got it.
Let's go!

291
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,530
Then answer me this,
you pitiful fool of a mortal.

292
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,697
It has to do with
an ancient legend.

293
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:55,830
[RUBRUM] Back in the olden days,
Illimo the First from the
land of Legnum Sonim...

294
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,830
[RUBRUM] <i>This little whelp</i>
<i>couldn't possibly know the Holy</i>
<i>Grail of Noitomorp Runostargnoc</i>
<i>the Wise.</i>

295
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,730
[RUBRUM] ...still‐
[SEIYA] The Holy Grail of
Noitomorp Runostargnoc the Wise.

296
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,964
What?! B‐but I haven't
even finished asking you
the full question yet.

297
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:12,797
But I was correct, wasn't I?

298
00:16:12,897 --> 00:16:14,530
Uh, well, uh...

299
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,864
Was I right or not?

300
00:16:15,964 --> 00:16:17,630
[RUBRUM] You were.
[MOFFLE] Moff!

301
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,230
That was absolutely incredible!
How did you know the
answer to that?!

302
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,197
[SEIYA] Ha! Trade secret.

303
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:27,664
[RUBRUM]
Th‐there must be some mistake!
That question is taken from

304
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:29,764
the elite Schuvert
Agricultural University's

305
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,030
entrance exam for the
Livestock Alchemy department!

306
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,197
There was no way you
could have known that!

307
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:37,564
[SEIYA] It's an exam question?
[MOFFLE] Nerd.

308
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,697
Ah, don't make fun of me!

309
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:42,664
Regardless, I cannot
allow you to leave alive!

310
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:45,630
You know, he's not that
intimidating anymore.

311
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,930
[MOFFLE] That's a good point!

312
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,030
I feel like I can actually
take this guy now.

313
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,130
[hnngggh!]

314
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:56,964
[RUBRUM] (ungh!) (ooowww!)

315
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:59,630
You're tougher than I thought.
Fine!

316
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,730
Stop, Moffle.

317
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,630
[MOFFLE]
Get ready for some pain!

318
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,164
Dragon Slayer Technique!

319
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:07,364
[SEIYA] I said stop!
[MOFFLE] (ooff!)

320
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:08,664
What's your problem?!

321
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:10,897
You're wasting your breath.
[MOFFLE] (hmm?)

322
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:14,664
I'm really sorry, all right?
I just got a little too
carried away, that's all!

323
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:16,430
But still, you didn't have to
hit me like that!

324
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,430
I mean, to be fair,
I shouldn't have let myself
get all worked up

325
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,464
just because you're the
first guests I've had
in several years.

326
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:23,897
[SEIYA] Wait, "guests"?

327
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:26,664
Yes, you're only the
second group of adventurers

328
00:17:26,764 --> 00:17:28,564
to visit
Rubrum's Chamber of Trials

329
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:31,297
since this attraction
came into existence.

330
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:33,197
[ALL] It wasn't real?!

331
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,430
[ISUZU]
Rubrum's telling the truth.
[ALL] (huh?!)

332
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,630
[SEIYA] Sento!
[TIRAMY] I'm so glad
you guys are alive, mii!

333
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,197
[MOFFLE] Hey, wait, that's...
that's Dornell!

334
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:44,864
Why are you guys so
obsessed with me?

335
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:48,697
[MOLE] Whew, boy!
[SEIYA] (huh?)

336
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,264
[ALL] (sighs of relief)
[SEIYA] (ah!)

337
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:56,964
[SEIYA] An attraction
that never opened?

338
00:17:57,064 --> 00:18:00,164
[TARAMO] Let me explain
everything in detail.
[SEIYA] (huh?)

339
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,930
Name's Taramo.
Nice to meet ya!

340
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,030
I happen to be the leader
of the Digerry clan.

341
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,930
[SEIYA] So you're the
one in charge here?
All right, I'm all ears.

342
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,564
But I don't have all day, so
keep it to 20 seconds or less.

343
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:16,430
O‐kay!

344
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,230
While my people have a great
talent for construction,

345
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,764
we've always been kinda pushed
around by the powers that be.

346
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,264
Just when things were
gettin' rough,

347
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:27,797
the park authorities agreed to
let us take refuge here.

348
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:31,364
But we had to make it appear
on paper as an "attraction".

349
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:35,364
There ya go, with time to spare.
[MOLES] Hurray!

350
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:36,764
I'm lost.

351
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,530
The Digerry clan was starting
to get a lot of crap

352
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,130
from a bunch of bullies
who call themselves the
Polytia Empire.

353
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,464
From what I understand,
it was supposed to be a secret

354
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:47,130
that AmaBri helped get the
clan out of trouble with them.

355
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,164
Something suspicious was
happening with money as well.

356
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:52,230
You mean the park
spent money on this?

357
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,330
[TARAMO] They gave us some
construction funds to live on
at the beginning,

358
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,197
but when that was gone we had to
dip into our assets.

359
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:01,897
[ISUZU] Assets?
Are you referring to...

360
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:05,364
Oh yeah, our treasure used to
fill up this entire main hall,

361
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:07,297
but we spent every
last bit of it.

362
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,230
[ALL] Whaaaat?!

363
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,330
[TIRAMY] That's no fair, mii!
[ISUZU] (sigh)

364
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,830
[MACARON] So we came all the
way down here for nothing
and risked our lives?!

365
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,264
[phone chime]
[ALL] (ah!)

366
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,797
[SYLPHY] Rah, rah, rah! Whoo!

367
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:22,564
Do you think she's really okay?

368
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,956
[SYLPHY] Bobsled! (crash)

369
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,697
[LATIFAH] I hear you all had
quite the adventure today.

370
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:40,263
Yeah, I wanted to talk to
you about that actually.

371
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:42,197
[gasp]

372
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,497
[SEIYA] That's about it.

373
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,797
Oh my goodness,
that's quite a story.

374
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,530
[sigh] To tell you the truth,
well, I...

375
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,030
[TARAMO] Hey!
[LATIFAH] (gasp)

376
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,163
[TARAMO] Miss Manager!

377
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:04,530
[ALL] (ah!)
[RUMRUM] Whoa, there!

378
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,163
'Scuse me, coming through,
sorry everybody!

379
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:11,430
Please forgive me, friends.
You see, I wasn't able to fit
through the staff corridor...

380
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,163
[SEIYA]
Did you just fly your giant
dragon self over a public road?!

381
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:17,297
Evening, Miss Manager.

382
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,763
It's a pleasure to get
to speak with you.

383
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:23,263
Oh, no, the pleasure's all mine.

384
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,163
[TIRAMY] Kanie, mii!

385
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,197
We need to make an announcement.

386
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:30,697
Did something bad happen?

387
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,563
We did some digging, and it
turns out the Polytia Empire

388
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,997
fell apart after a
pretty nasty uprising.

389
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:39,897
Which means the Digerry clan's
got nothing to be afraid of
anymore, mii!

390
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:41,663
Well, that's convenient,
isn't it?

391
00:20:41,763 --> 00:20:44,030
Really?
Are you sure that's true?!

392
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,497
[MOFFLE] Yup!

393
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:47,497
So, we're finally free.

394
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:52,463
In that case, would you please
consider giving all of us a job?
[SEIYA] A job?!

395
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,530
I'd like to be employed
here as well.

396
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,730
I promise I'll do my VERY best
to scare the visitors!

397
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,830
[LATIFAH]
(mmm...) Interesting...

398
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,830
What do you say to that,
Sir Kanie?

399
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,063
Sure, I can put
you guys to work.

400
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:08,563
[TARAMO] Gosh, you mean it?

401
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:09,897
[SEIYA] Yeah, but fair warning,

402
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:12,263
I'm gonna work you to
the bone every day.

403
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:14,963
[ALL] Hurray! Way to go!

404
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:17,630
But, Kanie,
what'll we do about the money?

405
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,630
Oh! Just leave everything
to yours truly, ron.

406
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:31,463
Did they really build that
thing overnight?!

407
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:34,297
[GUY] (hmm...)
Yep, that's the total.

408
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:36,063
(huh?)

409
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:41,997
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Come back! (waahh!) (sobbing)

410
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:43,797
[ISUZU]
Selling off Dornell's collection

411
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:46,830
ought to get us through
the month at least.
[SEIYA] Good.

412
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,097
But that doesn't exactly take
care of our biggest problem.

413
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:54,197
What are you going to do now?
[SEIYA] (sigh)

414
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:05,697
[TIRAMY & MACARON] (snickering)

415
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:08,763
[TIRAMY]
I got the goods right here, mii!

416
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:11,463
Sweet, I can't wait
to try these babies out!

417
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,763
This is gonna be killer...

418
00:22:13,863 --> 00:22:17,063
[BOTH] (crazed laughing)

419
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,597
[ISUZU & SEIYA] Time for
the attractions spotlight.

420
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:56,930
[ISUZU] Today's feature
is Planet Dinosaur,

421
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,063
a prehistoric adventure where
dinosaurs still roam the Earth.

422
00:24:00,163 --> 00:24:02,897
I hear Triken makes an
appearance here sometimes.

423
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:05,097
[SEIYA] Oh, I thought he
was just Chief of Sales.

424
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:08,830
[ISUZU] Kids and parents alike
can't get enough of this
educational thrill ride

425
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,563
from the Triassic to the
Cretaceous Period.

426
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:14,397
[SEIYA] I see. Is there like a
grand finale, too?

427
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:15,863
[ISUZU] Yes, they go extinct.

428
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:18,163
[SEIYA] That's not fun at all!
