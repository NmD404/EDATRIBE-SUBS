1
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:04,835
[birds singing]

2
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:08,706
[LATIFAH]
Oh, no, it's all right.

3
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:11,339
I just got a little dizzy
and fell down.

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,572
I was worried.

5
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:14,339
I heard you fainted,
so I came running.

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,706
[giggle]

7
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:18,939
Everyone here can be so
dramatic sometimes.

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,606
But I do appreciate you
being concerned for me.

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,072
As you might've guessed,

10
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:27,739
Her Majesty's health is
in critical condition.

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,439
[SEIYA] (sigh) Let me guess:

12
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,372
because I made her go out in
that stupid swimsuit, right?

13
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:35,339
[MOFFLE]
I don't think that's it.

14
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:39,606
[ISUZU] Listen...

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,672
This does happen
from time to time,

16
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:43,639
so keep it in mind.

17
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:23,392
[MACARON] Ron‐ron‐ron...

18
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:26,526
Mi, mi, miii!

19
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:31,092
[MOFFLE]
Moff, moff, moff... Moff!
[KIDS] (cheers & laughing)

20
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,092
[SEIYA] Perfect, the mascots are
really stepping up their game.

21
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:38,392
That's true, but some of them
aren't quite as motivated
as the others.

22
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,426
Please tell me the
visitor count's up today.

23
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:45,959
It's rising. The 30 yen
campaign must be working. Huh?
[ground rumbling]

24
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,192
[ALL] (huh?!)
[ground rumbling]

25
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,692
[KIDS] (cheering)

26
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,659
Incoming!

27
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,192
[KIDS] (cheers & squealing)

28
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:53,759
[BRAT A] Field trip!
[BRAT B] Yeah!

29
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:55,192
[BRAT C] Let's beat 'em up!

30
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,459
[KIDS] (cheering & laughing)
[MASCOTS] (waaahh!)

31
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:00,759
[ISUZU] Field trip groups
are always a challenge.
[KIDS] (cheering & laughing)

32
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:02,326
This is brutal.
[KIDS] (cheering & laughing)

33
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:04,792
We should help.
[KIDS] (cheering & laughing)

34
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,092
[SEIYA] You okay?
[KIDS] (cheering & laughing)

35
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:07,559
Yes.
[KIDS] (cheering & laughing)

36
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,126
They're the same as
any other customers.

37
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:12,059
What? Is this too hard for you?

38
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,559
Of course not!
Don't be ridiculous.

39
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,326
You just watch.

40
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:18,926
Thank you for visiting AmaBri.

41
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:21,092
Is there anything
I can help you with?

42
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:23,026
[BRAT A] A girl!
[BRAT C] (evil laugh)

43
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:25,692
[BRATS] (maniacal laughter)

44
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,992
[BRAT B] Gimme, lady!

45
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,659
Hurry, there's a long
list of issues that need
to be addressed.

46
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,559
I AM hurrying.

47
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:38,726
We have to see the Sales
Department about the
new info board...

48
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:41,326
I know. We're on the way.

49
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:43,659
Oh...

50
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,426
I apologize for troubling you.

51
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:48,392
I just wanted to talk about
the new info board.

52
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:49,859
Do you have a design yet?

53
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,192
Yes, I've got
five drafts right here.

54
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:00,826
None of these work.

55
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:03,026
Huh?! Oh, dear...

56
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:06,526
But, Kanie, it took him a whole
week to create those designs.

57
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:07,659
Let me try.

58
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,659
See,
this is how you need to do it.

59
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,392
[SEIYA] One... two... three.
Much better!

60
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:14,792
[TRIKEN] Oh my, yes!

61
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:16,459
I quite agree.
[ISUZU] (hmmm)

62
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,826
I bow to your
superior expertise!

63
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,659
You can iron out the details.

64
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,792
Hurry up, Sento, let's go.

65
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,592
Jeez, Manager,
what took ya so long?

66
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,926
Sorry. So, how's the stock?

67
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:32,059
This is all we've got left.
[SEIYA] (hmm...)

68
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,359
At this rate, we're gonna be
outta food by next week!

69
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,759
And the usual supplier couldn't
do anything to help us out.

70
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:40,059
Okay, then we'll just have
to look for a new supplier.

71
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,126
We should try to come up with a
solution before next we‐

72
00:04:42,226 --> 00:04:43,626
[SEIYA] Amagi Brilliant Park...
[ISUZU] (huh?)

73
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:45,892
This is Kanie.
I spoke with you before.

74
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:47,792
We do need your help after all.

75
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:50,059
I'll pass the phone to the
chief of food service.

76
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:50,859
Huh?

77
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,592
Go on, order what you need.

78
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,592
[NICK] Uh, thanks I guess.

79
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:57,426
Keep moving, Sento.

80
00:04:57,526 --> 00:05:00,526
[ASHE] Some expenses on the
budget estimate might be...

81
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:02,559
a little unnecessary.

82
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:03,859
And what are those?

83
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,959
All of these have to do
with costume repair.

84
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:08,259
If you look at‐ [uh?]

85
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,859
So you mean this,
this, and this?

86
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,726
[ah!] Yes, sir.

87
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:17,326
[SEIYA] It's not unnecessary.
Leave it on there.

88
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:19,226
Right, I'll do that.

89
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:22,192
[SEIYA] What's next?

90
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:25,859
These ol' pumps are startin' to
get mighty rickety here lately,
Manager.

91
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,592
[ISUZU] Then, we'll
contact the manufacturer‐

92
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,126
We're too broke.
Shut one of them down

93
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:31,359
and use the parts
to run the other two.

94
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,559
Are you sure?

95
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,292
What'll we do
if something goes wrong?

96
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:35,692
That's a problem for later.

97
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:38,526
Whatever you say, boss.
[SEIYA] Next!

98
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:41,226
[ISUZU] We're running out of
space for merchandise.
[MER] (urgh...)

99
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:43,426
[SEIYA] This spot's free.
Move it all there.

100
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,026
[MER] (exasperated sigh)

101
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:46,992
[ISUZU] Our security
equipment is broken.

102
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:49,792
[SEIYA] Hyah!
No, it isn't!

103
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,526
The guests don't like the
liver and chive stir‐fry.

104
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:55,092
[SEIYA] Change the recipe!

105
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:57,992
[ISUZU] His favorite pop star
spent the night with a man.

106
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,426
Toss out the damn magazine.

107
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,792
[sigh]

108
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:04,726
What's next on the agenda?

109
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,426
[ISUZU] Finishing this
stack of paperwork,

110
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:09,626
and then a meeting about
which attractions to renew.

111
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:11,692
A meeting? Who's going?

112
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,992
[ISUZU] Just Moffle,
Macaron, and Tiramy.

113
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:17,326
Great, those three. Maybe I'll
leave the meeting to you.

114
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:18,559
[ISUZU] Are you sure?

115
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:19,926
I'm exhausted as it is.

116
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,659
I don't have the energy
for those clowns today.

117
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,892
Just Let me take care
of the paperwork.

118
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,859
[ISUZU] As you wish.

119
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:28,359
Hey, Sento?

120
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:32,159
Try to make everything
go smoothly, okay?

121
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,259
You understand?

122
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,892
I don't need you
to explain that to me.

123
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,192
Huh? You okay, Sento?

124
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,359
What's her problem?

125
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,592
[MUSE] Um, excuse us, sir!

126
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:51,826
The door's open; come on in.

127
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:54,359
Uh... (nervous giggle)

128
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,659
[SYLPHY] (humming)

129
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,126
What's up?

130
00:06:57,226 --> 00:07:00,092
[MUSE] Well, uh, it's kind
of a sensitive problem, sir,

131
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:03,092
but we were hoping we could
talk to you for a minute?

132
00:07:03,192 --> 00:07:06,792
Actually, I'm pretty busy
figuring out all this
paperwork right now.

133
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:09,126
Maybe you should go talk
to Sento about it?

134
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:12,992
Nah, if we could talk to her,
then we wouldn't have
bothered with you.

135
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:15,126
Oh, no, she didn't mean that
the way it sounded!

136
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,626
We just wanted to come
speak to you directly.
[SEIYA] So what's the problem?

137
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,259
Uh, well, you see, sir,
it's just that, um...
[KOBORY] (nervous cowering)

138
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:25,459
[sigh] All right fine, you win.
You just tell me what you want.

139
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:28,792
Okay, let's see, how can I
explain this delicately?

140
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:31,892
Um, maybe we'd better let him
see it for himself.

141
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:34,026
Oh, that's a good idea!

142
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:36,826
Can we borrow you
for a bit, sir?

143
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:38,726
This is embarrassing.

144
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,159
It's all busted up!

145
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,892
What's it gonna take
to convince you

146
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:43,792
to invest in some
new equipment?!

147
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:45,826
I can't. I told you
we don't have the money.

148
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:51,126
Come on! The kids aren't gonna
wanna play with an old broken
water gun like this!

149
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:53,959
As a mascot, you have control
over the guests' experience.

150
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:56,492
You'll just have to blow them
away with your charisma.

151
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,359
"Blow them away"?!

152
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,392
And I have more than enough of
these bullets to go around.

153
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:04,026
Moffu...

154
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,926
[SYLPHY] (awahhhh...)
[SEIYA] (sigh)

155
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,759
I can't work like this!

156
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:10,859
My accordi‐ron broke
and I need a new one!

157
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,459
[ISUZU] No, make do with
your other instruments.

158
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,159
Aw, man! But the whole audience
is gonna run for the hills!

159
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,759
Well, if that happens,
then you'll just have
to run them down.

160
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,226
"Run them down"?

161
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:25,626
I want you to take your
job seriously. Got that?

162
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:27,826
Ron...

163
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:29,559
Hey, look at this!
[gun shot]

164
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,859
[TIRAMY] (ungh!)

165
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,559
What are you asking for?

166
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,992
[TIRAMY]
Oops, wrong thing. Here!

167
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:40,926
This talking flower broke.
I think it might be dead!

168
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:42,826
Maybe we can save it!

169
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:44,959
No we can't. Deal with it.

170
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,359
But... but... [wahh!]

171
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,692
[ISUZU] I said deal.
[TIRAMY] (hysterical sobbing)

172
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,792
Bon appÃ©tit? Oui!

173
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:52,592
She's been acting weird!

174
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,726
We can't ask her for anything.

175
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,692
[ISUZU] What's this about?
[BOTH] (ah!)

176
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,726
[MUSE] Nothing, nothing at all!

177
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,826
[KOBORY] We were only
making conversation!

178
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:02,826
I'll listen to all
your complaints.

179
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:05,359
There's no need for you
to bother Kanie.

180
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,192
We didn't!
We just wanted to...

181
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:10,959
Sento, let's talk.

182
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,826
[SYLPHY] Comment allez‐vous?

183
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:16,092
I told you to make sure
things went smoothly.

184
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:19,426
[ISUZU] Right, I prevented any
conflicts from arising.

185
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,992
Prevented? You just threatened
them all into submission.

186
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:25,926
Just like the time you forced me
to come to this park.

187
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:26,759
[ummm]

188
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,126
You can't threaten people.

189
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:30,759
You have to find a way to
compromise with them.

190
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:33,859
What you're doing is oppressive
and it has to stop.

191
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,526
What? Don't you think YOU'RE
being oppressive too?!

192
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:42,192
Oh, I am, but I make sure
they understand the reason why.
[ISUZU] (hmpf!)

193
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,659
I sure hope this isn't the
way you handled conflicts

194
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,126
when you were the acting
manager for a year.

195
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:49,226
You think that's any
of your business?!

196
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:50,859
Yes!
[ISUZU] (wah?)

197
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,326
[SEIYA] You're my secretary now.

198
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:56,126
I'm not gonna let you keep
dragging me down like this.

199
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:59,226
You think that I drag you down?

200
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:00,759
Really?

201
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,359
At this rate, yeah.

202
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,326
[ISUZU] (arrgh!)
[SEIYA] (urk!)

203
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:11,959
Okay, then what else can I
possibly be doing?!

204
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:15,192
Sento...
[ISUZU] (huh?)

205
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:21,126
[SEIYA] Sento, wait!

206
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:24,426
Seriously, what's her deal?

207
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:41,492
[sob]

208
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:52,997
[knock on door]

209
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:55,130
[LATIFAH] Yes? Come in.

210
00:10:55,997 --> 00:10:58,464
Latifah, are you‐ [ah!]

211
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:00,797
[LATIFAH] (urk!)
Oh, S‐Sir Kanie?!

212
00:11:00,897 --> 00:11:03,030
[SEIYA] Oh, crap... Sorry.

213
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,997
[LATIFAH] It's all right.

214
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:08,464
You surprised me.

215
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:09,997
Are you feeling any better,
ma'am?

216
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:11,697
[LATIFAH] I've been getting a
little restless in here,

217
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:15,230
so I was just about to go
outside and take in
some fresh air.

218
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,697
[SEIYA] Oh, okay, that sounds
like a good idea.

219
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:23,164
Well, actually, would you mind
giving me a moment of
your time, please?

220
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,197
[LATIFAH] This old ride
is still so lovely.

221
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:28,797
[SEIYA] Yeah...
[LATIFAH] (ah!)

222
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,764
I've wanted to ride it with
you for a while now.

223
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:33,330
It almost feels like
we're out on a date.

224
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,864
Uh, I guess so...

225
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:38,230
[LATIFAH] Look,
there's the main entrance.
[SEIYA] (ugh!)

226
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,064
[LATIFAH]
Oh, and there's Etcet Land.
[SEIYA] Uh‐huh...

227
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:43,730
[LATIFAH] And Wild Valley's
right next to it, and...

228
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,497
Yeah...

229
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,197
Uh, are you all right there?

230
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:50,397
Sure I am.

231
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:52,230
Man, just look at that view!

232
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,130
Is it possible you're
afraid of h‐

233
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,730
No way! As if somebody as
awesome as me would
have that problem!

234
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,064
[forced laugh]

235
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:04,030
[metal clanking & groaning]

236
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:11,230
[LATIFAH] Sir Kanie?
[metal clanking & groaning]

237
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:19,364
S‐sorry, but to tell the truth
I'm EXTREMELY afraid of heights.

238
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,464
There's no need to fear.

239
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,130
Try to relax.

240
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,164
I'm so sorry.
If I had known about this,

241
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:34,930
I wouldn't have asked you
to come with me.

242
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,664
[SEIYA]
My ego got the best of me.

243
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:39,230
It wasn't your fault.
[LATIFAH] But...

244
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,930
Anyway, you think we could
just keep this between us?

245
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,164
[LATIFAH] Of course.

246
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,230
Wouldn't it be pertinent to at
least tell Lady Isuzu about it?

247
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,464
Are you kidding me?!
ESPECIALLY not her!

248
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:52,330
Ah, right.

249
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,430
[SEIYA] (sigh)

250
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,997
[LATIFAH] (giggle)
[SEIYA] (huh?)

251
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:57,997
[LATIFAH] I apologize for
laughing, it's just so funny...

252
00:12:58,097 --> 00:13:01,364
[LATIFAH] (giggling)
[SEIYA] (umm)

253
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:07,430
Hey, Latifah?
[LATIFAH] Yes?

254
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,064
Is there some chance we knew
each other a long time ago?

255
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:13,330
You're asking if
we've met before?

256
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,430
[SEIYA] Yeah.

257
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,797
[umm...]

258
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,497
I'm sorry, I don't think so.

259
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,097
[sigh]

260
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:25,730
[MACARON] (hmm...)
Nothing's happened.

261
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,797
Let's keep watching
just in case.

262
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:30,364
She's not safe out here.
[MACARON] Yeah, right.

263
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:34,397
You just don't like that
she's up there alone
with the manager‐ron.

264
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:37,930
[hmpf!]

265
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,397
Hey.
[ISUZU] (grrr)

266
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:51,430
[hmpf!]

267
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,597
[KOBORY] So much rain...

268
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,730
It's kind of unusual, isn't it?

269
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,530
At least, we can take a
little break right now.

270
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,430
Yeah, but we can't get visitors
if the park's rained out!

271
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,297
Hey, you're a water spirit,
aren't you, sweet stuff?
Stop the rain, mii!

272
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:23,397
I can't. All I can do is cute
little tricks like this.
[TIRAMY] Miiii!

273
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,797
Wonder what he's yelling about?
[WRENCH] Bad news! Bad news!

274
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,197
BAD NEWS! [panting]

275
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:30,564
[MOFFLE] What's wrong with you?
You're gonna rust!

276
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:34,297
It's the drainage system!

277
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:37,464
[WRENCH] Bucket o' bolts gave
out on me with all this rain.

278
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:41,297
If it keeps up, the underground
facilities are gonna flood!

279
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:42,530
[SEIYA] What?!

280
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,730
That's terrible!

281
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,864
We'd have to close down
for a month!

282
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:48,230
Why did these things have to
quit NOW of all times?

283
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,497
[WRENCH] Uh, boss?
We talked about this yesterday.

284
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:54,764
You told me to shut
one of 'em down.
[SEIYA] (gasp)

285
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,297
What'll we do if
something goes wrong?

286
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,897
So that must've made the
other two pumps work too hard.

287
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:01,197
[WRENCH] Yeah, I reckon.
[SEIYA] (hmm...)

288
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:04,164
We have to do something
about this, and fast!

289
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:05,230
[SEIYA] I know!

290
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,630
We'd better move all
the merchandise first.

291
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,030
No wait,
safety's more important.

292
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,397
Either way, we have to
stop it before it floods

293
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:14,397
or we'll be done before
we can even reopen.

294
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,097
[ISUZU]
We'll set up an emergency base.
[SEIYA] (huh?!)

295
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,564
[SEIYA] Sento!

296
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:24,030
Everything's ready.
Just come with me.

297
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,797
[wow...]

298
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:31,464
[ISUZU] We'll need fire
extinguishing pumps in
ten crucial locations.

299
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:35,297
This is the Music Theater.
We've got the pumps, Isuzu‐ron!

300
00:15:35,397 --> 00:15:41,130
[ISUZU] Flood control units,
please continue the bucket relay
until the pumps arrive.
[MUSE] (ugh, oof)

301
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,097
[ISUZU] In the meantime,
use sandbags to prevent
more flooding.

302
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:47,997
Facilities Unit! We stopped the
4th corridor from goin' under!

303
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:51,597
Now head for the west side
of the 5th corridor.
[WRENCH] Ten‐four!

304
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:53,364
All the pumps have been set up.

305
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:54,764
Excellent.

306
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,197
Ready? Begin drainage!

307
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,764
[ALL] Roger!
[ASHE] Please begin drainage!

308
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:01,530
[CREW 1] Begin drainage!
[CREW 2] Begin drainage!

309
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,630
Ron!

310
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,830
Mii!

311
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,830
Now, let's do this!
[engine starting]

312
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,464
Th‐this is the Elementario Unit!

313
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:13,064
We've been keeping up the
bucket relay for a while now.

314
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:15,464
Could you please send us a pump
as soon as you can?

315
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:19,564
We can't afford to move
the pumps away from the
badly affected areas.

316
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:21,264
I'll send security over.

317
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:24,297
Go help them, Okuro.
[OKURO] Yes, ma'am!

318
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:27,730
Hold on for another 20 minutes.
[MUSE] (awwww!)

319
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,930
[TRIKEN] Miss Isuzu,
the unit's immobilized!

320
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,597
[ISUZU] Don't abandon your post.
If you do, I'll gun you down.

321
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:33,497
Hey, Ashe, let me take over here

322
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:35,497
while you go get everyone some
food and a place to rest.
[TRIKEN] Y‐yes, ma'am!

323
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,530
[ASHE] Yes, sir.
[TRIKEN]
I'm bowing in subordination!

324
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,764
[WRENCH] Facilities Unit to HQ,
the drainage system's
back in business!

325
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:04,930
Repeat, the drainage system's
back in business!
[SYLPHY] (streeetch)

326
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,764
Message received.

327
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:08,764
[ASHE] (sigh of relief)
[ISUZU] (big sigh)

328
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:10,330
Well, good work.

329
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,497
[WRENCH]
Nah, I can't take the credit.
[ISUZU] (huh?)

330
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:15,864
[WRENCH] Good job,
Miss Former Manager.
[ISUZU] (huh?!)

331
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:21,030
[WRENCH] Well, I better get back
to work. Over and out.
[disconnect signal]

332
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,230
[ah!]

333
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:29,497
[SEIYA] No issues over here.

334
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:30,597
[ISUZU] Good.

335
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:32,130
Is this the of 'em?

336
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,930
That's right.

337
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:38,197
Look, Kanie...
[SEIYA] Uh‐huh?

338
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:41,564
I don't exactly have
a problem with you.

339
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:43,130
No?

340
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,664
The problem is with me,
actually.

341
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:51,064
Before this, I worked as
the acting manager of
Amagi Brilliant Park.

342
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,564
Since I was a soldier,

343
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:56,930
I thought I could solve every
problem with brute force.

344
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:59,097
"Soldier"?

345
00:17:59,197 --> 00:18:01,464
I'm a member of the Royal Guard.

346
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:03,230
I grew up in
a military household,

347
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,530
so I never thought twice
about becoming a soldier.

348
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,730
I came here because
I was commanded to
re‐energize this park.

349
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,064
That's kind of a tall order,
isn't it?

350
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:15,797
Yes, it is.

351
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:17,164
And I knew that.

352
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,497
I knew I wasn't cut out for
a mission like this.

353
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:22,930
But...

354
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,630
I didn't want to disappoint
or dishonor my family,

355
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,930
so I did my best anyway.

356
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:31,264
And I failed.

357
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:38,897
[hmm] So I take it that was
your first big setback as
a member of the elite.

358
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:41,597
A setback? Perhaps.

359
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:43,130
Then, why didn't you
just run away

360
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,164
and forget what your family
wanted you to do?

361
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:48,264
[hmm?] Sento?

362
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:49,430
Run away?

363
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,230
That never even crossed my mind.
[SEIYA] Jeez...

364
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,964
Well, in any case,
I ended up failing.

365
00:18:56,064 --> 00:19:01,264
And I couldn't decide how
to reconcile that fact
within myself.

366
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:04,797
[ISUZU] I know the cast members
all hate me now.

367
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:09,297
You know, I've been through
my share of setbacks too.
[ISUZU] (uh...)

368
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,230
Uh... [ahem...]

369
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:20,564
[SEIYA] The truth is
I'm afraid of heights.
[ISUZU] (huh?)

370
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:23,964
[SEIYA] Just when I was getting
popular as a child actor...

371
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,030
Well, I...

372
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,197
I just couldn't deal with
high places anymore.

373
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:34,464
It was kinda like your thing.

374
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:38,497
Maybe I was scared of making my
parents sad, or losing fans...

375
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,430
When I look back,
it doesn't make sense.

376
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:48,230
Being afraid of heights wasn't
the only reason or anything,

377
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,364
but I quit show business
around that time.

378
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:52,297
And of course they were
disappointed and yelled,

379
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:55,464
and the whole thing
caused a lot of problems.

380
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:57,864
It wasn't a fun time.

381
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,164
It sounds difficult.

382
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,930
But all of that aside...

383
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,364
My point is...
[ISUZU] (huh?)

384
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:08,864
[SEIYA] Those setbacks...

385
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:11,197
That's all they really are!
[ISUZU] (ah!)

386
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:14,997
That kind of stupid crap
happens to people every day!

387
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:18,497
If you're upset about
something like that,
then you're just weak!

388
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:22,830
Hear me?! Weak!
Right?!

389
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,464
What do you think about THAT?!
[ISUZU] (uh...)

390
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,997
[laughter]

391
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,230
I see...
[SEIYA] (continuing laughter)

392
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,964
Well then, I suppose that
means I'm weak.

393
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,364
I'm glad you understand.

394
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:39,497
Still, I never would've
expected you to tell me

395
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:42,097
about something so personal
as your fear of heights.

396
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:45,930
[huh?] Oh yeah, I did.
That's funny.

397
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:48,230
But why?

398
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:51,897
Oh well, now you know.

399
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:57,559
[CROWD] Hurray!
(laughing & celebrating)

400
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:58,826
[MUSE] Miss Isuzu!

401
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,792
[TIRAMY] That was amazing, mii!

402
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,259
[MACARON]
That's our Miss Isuzu‐ron!
[ISUZU] (huh?)

403
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,826
[MUSE] We're all tired,

404
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:09,392
but we wanted to take a
moment to say thank you!
[clapping]

405
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:15,592
Hey, weren't you trying to tell
me earlier that all the cast
members hated you?

406
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,692
How do you explain this?

407
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,326
[ah...]

408
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:24,359
[small chuckle]

409
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,392
Oh, I almost forgot!

410
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:32,226
I heard you rode on the
Ferris wheel with
Her Majesty yesterday.

411
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:36,559
Ah, uh...
So you know about that, huh?

412
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,459
[ISUZU] Macaron told me.

413
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,859
So? I assume you must've been
terrified of the height?

414
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,592
[ungh!] Don't go there.

415
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:47,092
[ISUZU] Does that mean
you've gotten over it?

416
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:48,759
Look, it's not important.

417
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:51,492
It is! I'm very interested.

418
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:54,459
[SEIYA] Just gimme a break.

419
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:14,559
[RUBRUM] (rumbling roar)

420
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,992
[ISUZU & SEIYA] Time for
the attractions spotlight.

421
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:59,659
[ISUZU] This is Elementario, the
home of the four nature spirits.

422
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,759
[SEIYA] Can't they use their
powers to make the show better?

423
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,126
[ISUZU] Not indoors. The flames
would set the place on fire,

424
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:09,226
water's difficult to clean up,
and they can't very well dig
holes through the floor.

425
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:11,192
[SEIYA]
What about Sylphy's wind magic?

426
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:12,526
[ISUZU] They use it sometimes,

427
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:14,326
but it's so drafty in there
during the winter,

428
00:24:14,426 --> 00:24:16,559
it ends up making
the audience freeze.

429
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:18,492
[SEIYA] Then get it fixed!
