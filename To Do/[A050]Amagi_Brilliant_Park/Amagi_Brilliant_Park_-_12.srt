00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:13,189
[SEIYA]
(gasp)

3
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:15,321
[ISUZU]
What?
But we made sure...

4
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,821
[SEIYA]
It's the ticket
utilization rate.

5
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:19,388
[ISUZU]
Utilization?

6
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:22,088
[SEIYA]
I was expecting a couple
of the tickets they sold

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,421
to end up being no‐shows...

8
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:26,721
but I didn't think
the number would be so high!

9
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:29,421
[SEIYA]
I miscalculated! Damn it!

10
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:34,221
[TRIKEN]
We'll never get 252 people
by 9 o'clock!

11
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:38,755
[TRIKEN]
Princess...
I think this may be the end!

00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:40,288

13
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:18,368

Please help!

C'mon... we're not
asking for much here!
Pretty please?

15
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:22,668
[MUSE]
All you have to do is walk
through the gate real quick!
[KOBORY]

16
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,734

It'll only take a second!

17
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,101
[JAW]
We beseech you, sir!

18
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:29,368
[FUTURE]
You'll be doing
our world a service!

19
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:30,201
How about you ladies?

20
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,568
Would you and your little ones

21
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:33,268
please come visit AmaBri
for just a quick second?

22
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:35,501
[MOTHER A]
Sorry... we're about
to be late for dinner!

23
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:38,001
[FUTURE] It won't take long!
[JAW] WE'RE DESPERATE!

[SEIYA]
Yes, immediately.

27
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,468
We're inviting you to
Amagi Brilliant Park.

28
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:45,634
Absolutely free!

[SEIYA]
Yes... yes...

30
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:47,734
[ISUZU]
That's right sir...

31
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,101
it won't cost you anything.

32
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,034
[ASHE]
Of course not...
That's not my intention.

33
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:52,201
[SEIYA] I see...
[ISUZU] Oh.

34
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:53,968
[SEIYA]
Sorry to bother you then.

35
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:55,101
[SEIYA]
No good.

36
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,468
[ISUZU]
I got turned down again.

37
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,468
[ASHE]
No luck here either.

38
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:01,034
Wanipee and the girls
are advertising at the station
right now, but...

39
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:03,534
[EIKO] Please come visit AmaBri!

[SHIINA] We really need your
help, ok?!

40
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:07,401

something we can do!

00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:12,268
[REALTOR A]
Come on now!

42
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:13,834
Don't you kids think
it's about time

43
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:15,601
for you to
throw in the towel?

44
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,134
[ISUZU/SEIYA/ASHE]
(speechless)

45
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:18,601
(all surprised)

46
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,434
[MOFFLE]
It's not over yet!

47
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,901
We've still got
a moffin' chance at this!

48
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:25,034
Let's fight 'til the end!

49
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:28,234
[SEIYA]
But...

50
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:31,368
[MOFFLE]
Hey Takami,
sorry to call you at work.

51
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:32,834
Yeah it's me. Listen.

52
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:35,168
Could you bring every
single customer you have

53
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:36,601
over to AmaBri right now?

54
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,601
It's really important.

55
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:39,801
[SEIYA]
Huh? Hey!

56
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:41,368
[MOFFLE]
Tell 'em I'll pay their tabs

57
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:42,201
if they come.

58
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:43,368
We came up short on visitors.

59
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:47,001
I'll never ask you
for moffin' else!

60
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,401
Uh‐huh...
Thanks a lot... See ya.

61
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:52,834
Don't just stand there!

62
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,001
Start calling!

63
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,934
Everyone you know!

[ALL]
(surprised, into search)

65
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:59,234
You're serious?
Cold‐calling?

Sorry to bother you.

Hello there.

but I actually have a bit
of a favor to ask of you.

75
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,034
[SEIYA]
It's 252 people...

76
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:26,668
I highly doubt this'll
make enough difference.

77
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,334
Sento, you're in on this too?

78
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,934

Yeah, I'll take a medium
Margherita pizza.

88
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:55,768

Uh... hey...

94
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:28,501
I was wondering if...
What? No, it's not that.

95
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:32,368
Listen. I still don't really
understand what happened but...

96
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:32,868
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:33,868

[TAKAMI]
Don't mention it.

106
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,601

[TIRAMY]
Heh. I told all their husbands

Do I wanna know?

136

Apparently she's an
internet celebrity‐ron.

They were the last people...

when this whole thing started,

I'll be stepping down as manager
from this day forward.

Huh?

I remember I was so shocked when
I saw how bad this place was.

to carry you guys through it.

we came out on the other side.

B‐be quiet!

257
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:23,264
Anyway, I have another
big announcement!

258
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:24,298
Earlier this evening.

259
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:25,598
We officially closed the deal

260
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:27,698
to sell off the secondary park
to the south!

261
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:29,898
The property was purchased
by Moll Mart.

262
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:32,031
[ALL] (surprised)
[TIRAMY] Wait a minute.

263
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,064
You're talking about that
supermarket chain

264
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:36,598
that's famous around
the world‐mii!

265
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:37,598
[SEIYA]
Yep.

266
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:38,798
It won't be any time soon,

267
00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:40,264
but eventually they're gonna
build

268
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:42,198
a giant shopping mall
right next to AmaBri.

269
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:46,664
That should lead to
a nice customer spillover
on both sides.

270
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:47,564
It'll be perfect synergy!

271
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:48,698
[ALL]
(amazed)

272
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:49,764
So when that happens,

273
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:50,831
you clowns are gonna be so busy

274
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:52,464

00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,864
[ISUZU]
(surprised)
Something wrong?

278
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:05,298
[SEIYA]
It's nothing.

279
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:11,264
(sarcastic applause)

280
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:13,598
[SEIYA]
What do you want?

281
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:16,231
[TAKAYA]
Very impressive.

282
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:19,164
It looks like that prophecy
was right about you after all.

283
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,564
[SEIYA]
(surprised)
How do you know about that?

284
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:23,164
[TAKAYA]
You tell me, Champ.

285
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:24,998
[SEIYA]
(angry)

286
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:28,098
[TAKAYA]
Oops. I guess you can't
read my mind anymore.

287
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:30,598
You may have gotten lucky
this time, my friend,

288
00:13:30,698 --> 00:13:32,131
but you can't rest on
your laurels forever.

289
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:34,264
[TAKAYA]
No matter how many visitors
the park may get,

290
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:37,298
the princess will still be
losing Animus.

291
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:40,231
In less than half an hour
the date will change over.

292
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:43,631
And a brand new year
will start from page one.
[SEIYA] (angry)

293
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:48,164
[TAKAYA]
Glimpsing an ember of hope
only to have it dashed
before your eyes.

294
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:50,464
[TAKAYA]
I can practically taste
your despair.

295
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:53,764
And I intend to savor
every morsel!

296
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:57,464

(startled)

297

299
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:06,098
So it was him! All this time!

300
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:09,131
Moff my words,
I'll crush that bastard!

301
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,698
[SEIYA] What the...?
[ISUZU] He's the one who cast
the curse...

302
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:14,298
The sorcerer I told you about.

303
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:16,464
[SEIYA]
(surprised)

304
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,231
[LATIFAH]
It's almost time.

305
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:32,264
[SEIYA]
Yeah.

306
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:33,298
[LATIFAH]
I should say...

307
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:34,531
[ISUZU]
Y‐yes?

308
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:36,898
Thank you for everything,
Lady Isuzu.

309
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:39,764
I'm not certain who
I'm going to be
when tomorrow comes but...

310
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,998
I hope you'll support me.

311
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,664
[ISUZU]
Yes... upon my life.

312
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,598
[LATIFAH]
(smile)

313
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:47,531
And Uncle?

314
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:48,598
[MOFFLE]
Moff...

315
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:50,764
Try not to drink so much.

316
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:53,831
[MOFFLE]
Okay, I'll try.

317
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,198
[LATIFAH]
(sad smile)

318
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,064

Please take care, you three.

00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,198
[ISUZU]
Lord Moffle...

321
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,131
[LATIFAH]
Sir Kanie.

322
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:25,264
I don't think I can ever
thank you enough.

323
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:26,431
[SEIYA]
Uh‐huh...

324
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:29,131
[LATIFAH]
You seem a little upset.

325
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:30,164
You think so?

326
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,031
[LATIFAH]
Yes! You haven't even boasted

327
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,364
about your "supreme
intellect" yet.

328
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:39,098
[LATIFAH]
(troubled)

329
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,264
(starting to cry)

(soft sob)

331
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:47,764
[LATIFAH]
The truth is...

332
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,031
[SEIYA]
(surprised)

333
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,564
[LATIFAH]
This isn't what I want at all!

334
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:56,531
Not after I met you... not after
the happy days we all shared!

335
00:15:56,631 --> 00:16:00,464
And not after the wonderful
miracle I witnessed tonight!

336
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:01,531
[SEIYA]
(stunned)

337
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:02,831
(sob)I just can't bear...

338
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:04,898
the fact that I'm
about to forget it all!

339
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,464
[SEIYA]
(choked up)

340
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:09,031
[LATIFAH]
(crying)

341
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:18,364
(gasp)

342
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:23,731
[SEIYA]
It's not much...
but this is all I can do.

343
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:26,998
[LATIFAH]
(sobbing)

344
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:31,131
[LATIFAH]
It helps.
(sobbing)

345
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:13,931
[LATIFAH]
(light snooze)

346
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:15,864
[ISUZU]
That tree...

347
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:19,964
I don't think it's ever
bloomed that much.

348
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:30,864
[SEIYA]
I failed her again...
I couldn't...

349
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:35,398
[LATIFAH]
(stir)

350
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:36,298
[ISUZU/MOFFLE/SEIYA]
(surprised)

351
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:37,698
[LATIFAH]
(waking)

352
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:42,564
[LATIFAH]
Sir Kanie...?

353
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:43,631
[MOFFLE]
Moff?!

354
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,831
[SEIYA]
You know who I am?!

355
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,464
[LATIFAH]
Well of course I do...

356
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:49,331
(gasp)

357
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:51,098
(trembling)

358
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:56,331
I DO remember!

359
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:58,831
(extended crying)

360
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:02,264
[MOFFLE]
(overwhelmed)
Latifah...

361
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:17,598
[ISUZU]
That tree is called Elpis.
It thrives on Animus for energy.

362
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:21,998
The amount it consumed
in these three months
was enough to make it bloom.

363
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:24,531
Animus also alleviates
Her Majesty's curse...

364
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:28,731
so I can only imagine the
combined happy thoughts
of all the park visitors

365
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,398
were what saved her in the end.

366
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:38,631
[ISUZU]
(surprised)
Kanie!

367
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:41,231
[SEIYA]
(surprised)
Sento... What's up?

368
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,764
Are you... leaving now?

369
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:45,498
Yep! Good riddance!

370
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:46,798
[ISUZU]
(speechless)

371
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:52,798
[SEIYA]
(focus, into sigh)

372
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:53,831
[SEIYA]
(realize)

373
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:57,398
(awkward squirming)

374
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:58,398
Look... Sento...

375
00:18:58,498 --> 00:18:59,464
[ISUZU]
Ah! Wh‐what?

376
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:00,564
[SEIYA]
Here's the thing...

377
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:01,664
[ISUZU]
Yes?

378
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:05,598
(straining)
It's nothing! Bye!

379
00:19:05,698 --> 00:19:07,031
[ISUZU]
(nervous)

380
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:21,164
[SEIYA]
(annoyed)

381
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,731
[SEIYA]
(bigger annoyed)

382
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:38,264
[SEIYA]
Agh, dammit!

383
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:49,143
[AISU]
(coming in)
Hey, sorry it's so late.

384
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:50,910
[SEIYA]
How'd things go at work?

385
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,676
[AISU]
Good, we delivered
ahead of schedule.

386
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:54,810
[SEIYA]
Ohh.

387
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,410
[AISU]
Guess YOU had a rough day.

388
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,310
[SEIYA]
I quit.

389
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,543
You quit?! Already?!

390
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:00,743
Well, that's a shame.

391
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:02,143
[SEIYA]
Why's that?

392
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,276
[AISU]
You just looked like
you were having fun.

393
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:05,076
[SEIYA]
Huh?

394
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:06,610
Yeah. you seemed excited!

395
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,010
Ever since you first started.

396
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,543
And you've never been
excited about ANYTHING.

397
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,376
Does that surprise you?

398
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,176
(stunned)

399
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:23,810
[MACARON] (groan)
[TIRAMY] I'm gonna puke‐mii...

400
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,010
[MUSE]
Oh good morning, you two!

401
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,476
[KOBORY]
You don't look well...

402
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:27,710
[SALAMA]
Are you hungover?

403
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,243
[SYLPHY]
Here comes the miracle dribble

404
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:30,076
past 11 opponents!

405
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:32,143
[MACARON]
Ah, youth‐ron...

406
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:34,810
[TIRAMY]
I'm not doin' squat today...

407
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,410
[SEIYA]
Hey, no lying down on the job!

408
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,943
[ALL] (surprised)
[TIRAMY] Kanie‐mii!
[MACARON] Kanie‐ron!

409
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:40,510
[MUSE]
I thought you quit yesterday!

410
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,543
[SEIYA]
I changed my mind.

411
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:42,676
[ALL]
(shock)

412
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:43,843
Without me, you'll go back

413
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,210
to slacking off all the time...

414
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,843
I'll be keeping an eye
on you from now on.

415
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:49,043
[MACARON]
Seriously?

416
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:50,843
[TIRAMY]
He's gone full Big Brother!

417
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:53,243
[SEIYA]
Quiet! It's almost time to open.

418
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:54,210
Moff?

419
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,843
We've got work to do,
you lousy rat.

420
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:58,043
Get busy.

421
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:01,476
[MOFFLE]
Well, I'll be moffed.

422
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,676
[SEIYA]
Perfect...
Not that I'm surprised.

423
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:08,876
[ISUZU]
(surprised)
You came back...

424
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,843
[SEIYA]
Sento... Late, I see.

425
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:12,243
[ISUZU]
Did I miss something?

426
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:14,943
[SEIYA]
Yeah, this place is a disaster.

427
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:18,943
If we let our guard down just
because we reached the goal,
it'll ruin everything.

428
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,543
[ISUZU]
You mean... you're...?

429
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:24,410
Yeah yeah... Enough chit‐chat!
How's the schedule today?

430
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,943
Ah... first we have a
pre‐shift meeting with
all the cast members.

431
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:29,843
[SEIYA]
Then let's go.

432
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,010
[ISUZU]
(smile)

433
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,376
[LATIFAH]
Sir Kanie!

434
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:39,910
[SEIYA]
I'm here to stay.

435
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,210
Well, at least until everyone

436
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,443
finally gets their
sorry selves together.

437
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:45,010
[LATIFAH]
Great!

438
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,743
[SEIYA]
I hope you're grateful!

439
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:50,010
[SEIYA]
I'm going out of my way
to bless you with my skills!

440
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:54,810
Is everything ready to go?!

441
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,643
[ALL]
Yeah!

442
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:59,110
I want you to give it
all you've got!

443
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,543
[SEIYA]
Open the gates!

444
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:03,310
[SEIYA]
Come on in!

445
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,043
[ALL]
Enjoy your day
at Amagi Brilliant Park!

446
00:23:52,276 --> 00:23:54,143
[ISUZU/SEIYA]
Attractions Spotlight!

447
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:57,476
[SEIYA]
The park is still open!
You wanna do the honors, Sento?

448
00:23:57,576 --> 00:24:01,043
[ISUZU]
Of course.
Today's feature is Space Captain

449
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:03,310
a thrilling retro sci‐fi
adventure ride.

450
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,210
The hero embarks
on an epic quest
to the far ends of the galaxy.

451
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,110
[SEIYA]
Let me guess, you're about to
tell me something lame that
ruins the whole thing.

452
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,576
[ISUZU]
How did you know?

453
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:14,043
The ride is currently shut down

454
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:16,610
because the Captain is suffering
from lower back pain.

455
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,410
[SEIYA]
I knew it.
