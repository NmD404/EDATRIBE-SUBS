00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:02,620
[deep thrumming]

2
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:13,253
[urk]

3
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:21,655
[ISUZU] I know it's sudden,
Seiya Kanie, but...

4
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,555
Are you free next Sunday?

5
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:27,222
I want to go to a theme park
together with you.

6
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:28,955
[confused stammer, gulp]

7
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:32,222
Is this your way of asking me
on a date or something?
[ISUZU] Sure.

8
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:33,655
And why are you packing heat?

9
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,155
[ISUZU]
To keep you from running.

10
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:36,555
You'll shoot if I say no?

11
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:38,489
[ISUZU] Correct. Your answer?

12
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:41,489
Look, you can't expect me to‐
[shot fired]

13
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:43,322
[nervous gulp]

14
00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:44,422
[ISUZU] Kanie...

15
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:45,422
[wah!]

16
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:46,455
Answer me.

17
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:48,055
[nervous gulp]

18
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:33,869
Mm‐hm!

19
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:37,069
How's it going today, handsome?
[BOY] Hey check out that weirdo.

20
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,869
Lookin' good as usual.
[BOY 2] Looks like he's checking
himself out.

21
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:40,702
Since I AM a total stud
[BOY 2] Probably just a jerk.

22
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:42,669
AND I'm one of the smartest
students in the school,
[BOY] What a loser.

23
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,869
the fact that I was
asked out on a date
[GUY] Did say he's a stud?

24
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,902
by some transfer student I've
never spoken to before,
[GIRL] Ugh, that's gross.

25
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,569
just doesn't surprise me.

26
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,169
[gah!]

27
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,502
Let's go.

28
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:55,936
[SEIYA] O‐okay...

29
00:02:58,902 --> 00:02:59,802
[SEIYA] Isuzu Sento...

30
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:00,969
[ISUZU] That's my name.

31
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:03,002
[SEIYA]
Where exactly are we going?

32
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:05,369
[ISUZU] AmaBri.
[SEIYA] "AmaBri"?

33
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:06,869
[ISUZU] Amagi Brilliant Park.

34
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,569
There's a bus that goes
straight to it from here.

35
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:11,436
[SEIYA] See ya.

36
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,569
[urk!]

37
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:13,969
Mommy!

38
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,102
That pretty lady's got
blue stripes on her panties.

39
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:17,602
Look over there!

40
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:20,736
Just be like everybody else and
pretend like you don't see it.

41
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:22,569
So if I don't come with you,
I'm dead?

42
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,936
That's the idea.

43
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,836
What's so great about this
amusement park anyway?

44
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:28,436
To put it more clearly,
it's a theme park.

45
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:30,069
What's the difference?
And besides,

46
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,002
don't you think you owe me an
explanation for all of this?

47
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:35,669
It hasn't been that long since
you transferred to our school,

48
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,669
and you're trying this hard
to get a date?

49
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,736
I mean I know
I'm devilishly good‐looking,

50
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,302
but there's gotta be
some other reason!

51
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:43,036
What are you trying
to accomplish here?

52
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:46,069
Why does it have to be THAT
specific park of all places?

53
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:48,036
Did you pull that out of your‐

54
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,569
[SEIYA]
Amagi Brilliant Park, huh?

55
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,536
Have you ever been there
before, Kanie?

56
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,402
I think I might've been to it
one time when I was
really little,

57
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:01,336
but I'm not sure if I...

58
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:04,702
[SEIYA] Doesn't look that bad.
[bus chime]

59
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:06,702
[PA]
Next stop, Amagi Brilliant Park.

60
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:08,769
I repeat,
Amagi Brilliant Park.

61
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:10,469
[ISUZU] Wait.
[PA]
Please take all your belongings

62
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,002
It's the next one.
[PA] and watch your step
as you exit the bus.

63
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:13,802
Then what's that big,
fancy castle thing?

64
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:15,302
A love hotel.

65
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:16,736
Oh...
WHAT?!

66
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:17,736
A love hotel.

67
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:18,802
Yeah, I get it!

68
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:20,136
It's a common mistake.

69
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:22,902
The main park entrance
used to be at that stop,

70
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:26,202
until the park was renovated
ten years ago.

71
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:30,002
The love hotel was built on
that land shortly after that.

72
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:31,836
[gulp] That's misleading!

73
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:34,502
Why don't they just change
the name of the bus stop then?

74
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:36,236
That request was made
a while ago,

75
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:38,802
but it keeps getting put off
for some reason.

76
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:42,236
Despite how many guests
get off the bus back there.

77
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:43,402
Wait, "guests"?

78
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:44,802
You know, customers.

79
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,536
That's what they're called
at most theme parks.

80
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:50,502
The customers are guests,
and the staff are
called cast members.

81
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:51,736
Try to remember that.

82
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,269
Isuzu Sento,

83
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:56,269
you're kind of a strange girl,
you know that?

84
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:16,802
[ISUZU] Here we are, Kanie.

85
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:21,002
[ugh]

86
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:23,102
[desolate wind blowing]

87
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:24,869
[SEIYA]
It's this dead on a Sunday?

88
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:26,836
[ISUZU]
Typical count on weekend days is

89
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:29,302
two thousand one hundred ten.

90
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:30,869
That's precise.

91
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:33,402
[ISUZU] Let's go to
Sorcerer's Hill first.

92
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:34,736
"Sorcerer's Hill"?

93
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,302
[ISUZU]
It's one of the areas of AmaBri.

94
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:39,669
Since it's home to the
lovable mascot characters

95
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,569
of the magical kingdom
of Maple Land,

96
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,202
it's bursting with
dreams and happiness.

97
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,702
[SEIYA]
The way you said that just now

98
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:48,102
makes me think it's bursting
with boredom.

99
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:50,469
[ISUZU] This is
Tiramy's Flower Adventure.

100
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:52,802
Tiramy's a flower fairy.

101
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:55,169
I'd like to recommend climbing
aboard the Fancy Train.

102
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:58,169
It'll whisk you away to a
delightful world full of
love and cheer.

103
00:05:58,269 --> 00:05:59,802
[SEIYA]
Like I told you the first time,

104
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,436
you're not making it sound
very delightful at all.

105
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,302
Welcome...

106
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:05,369
Two, please.

107
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,436
[ATTENDANT] Sure.

108
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,736
[gah!]

109
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,202
Seems the rails are misaligned.

110
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:17,202
That's dangerous!
[ISUZU] I quite agree.

111
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:20,836
[FLOWERS]
Weeelcome to Tiiiiramy's
Floooweerrrr Adventuuuure!

112
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:25,069
Weeelcome to Tiiiiramy's
Floooweerrrr Adventuuuure!

113
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:28,036
[SEIYA] What the...

114
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:30,302
This is the part where Tiramy's
supposed to come out

115
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:31,602
and wave at everyone.

116
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:33,469
But he's missing again.

117
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:34,969
[SEIYA] Again?
Wait a minute,

118
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,802
how many times have you
been to this place?

119
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:41,002
So, how was that?

120
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,802
Oh, God...

121
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,902
[ISUZU] Next we have
Macaron's Music Theater.

122
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:47,736
He's a music fairy.

123
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:51,436
Macaron's performances feature
sweet melodies and
uplifting rhythms.

124
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,002
It's guaranteed to make your
heart sing with delight.

125
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:56,736
[SEIYA] We need to have
a talk about this.

126
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:58,602
[ISUZU] He only works
when he feels like it.

127
00:06:58,702 --> 00:07:00,202
That's an artist for you.

128
00:07:00,302 --> 00:07:02,736
Seriously?!

129
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:04,536
[ISUZU]
This is Moffle's Sweets House.

130
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:09,069
Moffle is a sweets fairy as well
as the most popular mascot.

131
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:10,436
Just one bite of these treats

132
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:12,502
and you'll be floating through
a world of bliss.

133
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:13,836
[SEIYA] Oh, come on!

134
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:15,936
[CHEERFUL PA] Welcome to
Moffle's Sweets House!

135
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:19,036
Uh‐oh, the shop is full
of mischievous mice!

136
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,936
Use the magic water guns
to teach them a lesson!

137
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:23,869
So it's some kind of
shooting game?

138
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:25,969
All I have to do is shoot
the mice with this gun?

139
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:27,502
Correct.
[SEIYA] Hmph!

140
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:29,036
I'm a pro at these
kinds of games.

141
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:31,736
Get ready to marvel at
the work of a true master.

142
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:33,436
[CHEERFUL PA]
Let the slaughter begin!

143
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,369
Did she say "slaughter"?!

144
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:42,869
[mouse squeaks]
[SEIYA] (ah!)

145
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:45,902
They're fast!

146
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:48,869
I got one!

147
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,936
We're headed for the pantry.

148
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,069
Don't let your guard down.

149
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:55,536
This game is
freaking impossible!

150
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:57,136
Just try harder.

151
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,102
Okay, that was...
WAY too hard...

152
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:03,836
[CHEERFUL PA] Aww, darn!
You didn't kill very many!

153
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:05,302
Wait! I was killing them?!

154
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,169
But you said I was just
teaching them a lesson!

155
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,036
[ISUZU]
Right, the more mice you kill,

156
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,469
the bigger the reward
you can get for their corpses.

157
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:14,602
Do you even realize how
violent you sound right now?

158
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,102
Family‐friendly places like this

159
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:19,302
aren't supposed to use words
like "kill" or "corpses."

160
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:21,336
[CHEERFUL PA] But Moffle
appreciates all your help!

161
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:24,602
Be sure to take a photo with him
in the next room before you go!

162
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:27,736
This is the room where you get
your picture taken with Moffle.

163
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:29,069
[SEIYA] I don't really care
to take pictures

164
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,202
with a guy in a rat suit
or whatever.

165
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,202
[ISUZU] Just say hello.
It'll be fun, I promise.

166
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:35,869
Are you telling me
there are people

167
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,669
who find this crazy
death game FUN?

168
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:39,069
[ISUZU] Of course.

169
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,669
Those are photos of
all the guests

170
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:42,536
who have gotten high scores
in the past.

171
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:46,936
[SEIYA] Looks like it appeals to
a specific kind of person.
[door creaking]

172
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:53,436
[MOFFLE] Moff!

173
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,027
[ISUZU]
Moffle, the sweets fairy.

174
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,460
He's the most popular
mascot here.

175
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,227
Huh...

176
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,693
Something wrong?

177
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:12,993
No...

178
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:15,060
He just irks me for some reason.

179
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,727
We'd like to take a photo
with you, all right?

180
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:19,327
[MOFFLE] Moff.

181
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:22,927
Wait, what's the point
if you're not in it?!
[MOFFLE] (tch!)

182
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,893
Why are you copping
an attitude?!

183
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:26,160
I'm a customer, buddy!

184
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,293
Try to calm down, Kanie.

185
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:29,127
Right...

186
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:30,927
Don't worry, I can be calm.

187
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:33,360
I promise I won't lose my cool.

188
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,027
Whatever, I'm out.
I'm not gonna sit here

189
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,927
and take this crap from
a knockoff like‐ [gah!]

190
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:43,193
There's nothing Moffle
despises more than being
called a knockoff.

191
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:46,160
Oh, so that makes it okay
to throw a camera
at a customer's head?!

192
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,427
Why's he standing there like
he's ready to punch me out?!

193
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:50,293
Wahhhhahah!

194
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,660
All right, that's it.

195
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,427
NOW I'm angry! [gaaah!]

196
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:58,927
[SEIYA, MOFFLE] (ooofff!)
[ISUZU] That's better.

197
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:00,960
[SEIYA]
<i>That crazy woman just shot me!</i>

198
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,793
<i>She actually shot me!</i>

199
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:07,293
<i>Am I really gonna die</i>
<i>because of some stupid guy</i>
<i>in a mascot suit?!</i>

200
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:08,527
I lived...

201
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:10,860
You two were about to engage
in a fight to the death.

202
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,793
And I won't allow you to sully
the Sweets House of happiness
with your blood.

203
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:16,560
[SEIYA] I don't see any
happiness in here!

204
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,927
And besides, you've got
no right to talk,
Little Miss Sharpshooter!

205
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:21,260
Right. Well, Kanie,

206
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,193
did you have a good time
bonding with Moffle

207
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:24,427
through friendly competition?

208
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:25,993
[SEIYA] Is THAT what
you're calling it?!

209
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,893
You'll get along, right?
[SEIYA] No way!

210
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:29,860
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

211
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,360
Wait a second, he talks too?

212
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,960
[ISUZU]
Well, that's enough for now.

213
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,960
We got our souvenir photo,
so let's get moving.

214
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,793
We got what?

215
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:38,993
[groan]

216
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:41,160
[SEIYA] That sucked!
He's a total jerk!

217
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,160
You really think so?
[SEIYA] Why does this park need

218
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,727
an angry mouse character
wearing a goofy hat?

219
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:49,060
Seriously, the guy inside the
suit must have some kind of
attitude problem.

220
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,793
There's nobody inside the suit.
[SEIYA] 'Scuse me?

221
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:53,227
It's only Moffle.

222
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,027
There's nobody inside the suit.

223
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,193
Oh, right, I get it now.

224
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:58,760
You're supposed to
tell everybody

225
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,093
it's a real magical mouse thing
instead of a guy in a suit

226
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,660
so the kids don't stop believing
in Santa Claus or whatever.
Is that what's going on?

227
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,860
[ISUZU] No, I'm saying there's
no one inside the suit.

228
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,727
Moffle is a real resident of
the magical kingdom.

229
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,327
"Magical kingdom"?

230
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:16,793
All right, you win,
if it means that much to you.

231
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,793
[ISUZU]
This is the Elementario Theatre.

232
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:20,693
Here, the four elemental spirits

233
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:25,760
perform beautifully
choreographed dance numbers
and unbelievable wire stunts.

234
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,227
My name is Muse,
the water spirit! (giggle)

235
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:33,427
We hope you enjoy the
Elementario spectacular!

236
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,593
You can call me Sylphy.

237
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,727
I'm the spirit of wind.
You wanna be friends?

238
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,627
I'm the earth spirit known as
Kobory.

239
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:42,893
Uhmm...
it's lovely to meet you.

240
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,893
What's up?
I'm Salama.

241
00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:46,360
I'm the fire spirit.

242
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,227
All right, having fun?!
[SYLPHY] (giggling) (whoooo!)

243
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,560
Wow, it sure
sounds like you are!
[SYLPY] (giggling)

244
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,427
[MUSE] Let's get
this show on the road!
[SULPHY] (whoooo!)

245
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:58,060
This is sad.
[ISUZU]
That's about how it always is.

246
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,993
Let's continue the tour.

247
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,060
[ISUZU]
The Thrill Coaster...

248
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,493
A heart‐pounding adventure

249
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:05,993
aboard a speeding train
of fun and thrills.

250
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,593
Are you scared?

251
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,260
[SEIYA] You've gotta be joking.

252
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,560
[ISUZU] Good, let's take a ride.

253
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,693
Were you terrified?
[SEIYA] Not really.

254
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:27,160
Oh, well, let's keep moving.

255
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,293
[ISUZU] Brilliant Market...

256
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:31,727
Check out AmaBri's
hottest merchandise.

257
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:34,227
[SEIYA] This place
looks really outdated.

258
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:36,593
[ISUZU] Kiddie Play...

259
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:37,827
A spacious play area

260
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:39,627
glowing with the smiles
of children.

261
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:41,393
[SEIYA] Obviously.

262
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:43,360
[ISUZU] Free Fall...

263
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,493
They slowed it down

264
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,560
so it wouldn't scare the
little kids too much.

265
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,060
[SEIYA] So it's an elevator.

266
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,260
[ISUZU] The Coffee Cups...

267
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,760
They're famous for
their extreme speed.

268
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,660
[SEIYA]
I think I'm gonna puke...

269
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,693
I hate this!

270
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:56,893
Seems like you're upset.

271
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,060
Why wouldn't I be?

272
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,660
Every single attraction
in this park

273
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,093
is a lame piece of crap!

274
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:03,327
Nothing works right,
the service is terrible...

275
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:05,293
At least the love hotel
LOOKS nice!

276
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:07,527
And the worst part of it is
the people running this place

277
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:09,493
don't know the first thing
about entertainment!

278
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:13,427
Do they really think kids are
fooled by stupid gags like this?

279
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,227
Kids are a lot harder to trick
than you might think!

280
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:18,760
It's not something you can
just pull out of your ass!

281
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,960
You have to work hard
and commit to it!

282
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,093
But no, this place doesn't even
come CLOSE to that!

283
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:25,827
If they want to
make dreams come true,

284
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:29,427
the people who work here have to
believe in their own dreams
first!

285
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:31,693
I mean‐ (uh...)

286
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,293
(sigh)

287
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,627
If you want to make
dreams come true,

288
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:44,960
then the first thing you
have to do is believe
in dreams yourself.

289
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,627
You said it harshly,
but you're right.

290
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:51,960
But that doesn't sound like
something your normal everyday
high school student would say.

291
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,760
Just forget it.
I copied it from a book.

292
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,360
You know, at first, I assumed
that the reason you were
acting so irritated

293
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,293
was because a strange girl
forced you to come to
a theme park

294
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:02,960
and wander around
with her all day.

295
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,560
(hmph) So you DO know

296
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,693
you're being a huge
inconvenience to me then.

297
00:14:06,793 --> 00:14:10,793
But you're obviously frustrated
because of another issue
entirely, aren't you?

298
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,593
It's like you're angry
at the park itself.

299
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,227
Seiya Kanie... Amagi High School
Class 2‐4, age 16.

300
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,093
Currently resides with his aunt.

301
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:25,227
How did you know that?

302
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:27,027
[ISUZU] Attractive, intelligent,

303
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,693
superior athletic skills.

304
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,227
True, but what's your point?

305
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,060
[ISUZU] A man of many talents.

306
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,093
Can succeed at almost anything,
but notoriously narcissistic.
[SEIYA] Hm?

307
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:39,160
[ISUZU] Loves himself
so much it's disgusting.
[SEIYA] Whoa!

308
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,393
[ISUZU] That's why you don't
have friends or a girlfriend.

309
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:42,493
Hey, wait! (uh...)

310
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:43,827
[ISUZU] You always
eat your lunch by yourself

311
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,493
because no one likes you.

312
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,093
(aaaaghhhh!)

313
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:49,360
Where did you get all this
info about my life?

314
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,227
I've been doing
extensive research.

315
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:53,960
Okay, but WHY did you do
all that research?!

316
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,960
Seiya Kodama...
[SEIYA] (gasp)

317
00:14:58,193 --> 00:14:59,727
From what I've heard,

318
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:02,360
there was a successful child
actor by that name
a few years ago.

319
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,127
Any adult would've called him
the perfect child.

320
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:06,460
But for whatever reason,

321
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,093
Seiya Kodama suddenly retired
five years ago.

322
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:13,193
[ISUZU] He should be in
high school by now, right?

323
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:16,560
What do you think he would say
if he saw this place?

324
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:19,127
(small sigh)

325
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:22,160
Now I get it...
You made me come here

326
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,627
because you knew about that
from the start.

327
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,193
That's correct.

328
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,060
Look, I don't know what it is
you're trying to pull here,

329
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,327
but Seiya Kodama's been dead
for a long time, all right?

330
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:32,660
He disappeared.

331
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,293
So if you think you can use him
to your advantage somehow,

332
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,260
then you're wasting your time.

333
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,460
That's it.
Try to shoot me if you want,

334
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,527
but I'm outta here.

335
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:43,127
[ISUZU] Wait!

336
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:45,127
You have to eat these
before you go.

337
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,693
They'll be cold soon.

338
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:48,227
I don't care about
your croquettes.

339
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,360
[ISUZU] Just eat them, please.

340
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:01,627
<i>The crust isn't very thick,</i>
<i>but the crunch is exquisite.</i>

341
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,593
<i>The inside is juicy and warm.</i>

342
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:07,393
<i>Plus, the minced meat and</i>
<i>mashed potatoes make a</i>
<i>perfect combo of flavors!</i>

343
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,327
[ISUZU] Do you like them?

344
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:13,960
(ah!)Yeah...

345
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,893
Those are exclusive
to this park.

346
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:17,927
You can't get them
anywhere else.

347
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,593
Wow, did you make these?

348
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:20,860
I didn't.

349
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,327
But would you like to meet
the one who did?

350
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:32,827
[gates groaning]

351
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:35,127
[SEIYA] How are you affiliated
with this park?

352
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,427
[ISUZU] Did I say I was?

353
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:39,127
[SEIYA]
No, I just kinda figured it out.

354
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:44,093
Where are we going?

355
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:45,860
To the roof of Maple Castle.

356
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,360
You said you wanted to meet
the park manager.

357
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,127
I did?

358
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,560
[ISUZU] Kanie?
[SEIYA] (huh?)

359
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,560
Something wrong?

360
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,227
Uh, no, I'm okay.

361
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,327
Good...

362
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,693
Then you should go say hello
to Her Highness.

363
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,027
Huh?
[ISUZU] Go on.

364
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:25,260
Hello, you must be
Sir Seiya Kanie.

365
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,027
Uh, that's me.

366
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:30,027
I'm pleased to meet you.
My name is Latifah Fullanza.

367
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,893
And I happen to be the
manager of this park.

368
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,193
Manager?

369
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:37,027
Yes, I do so appreciate
you taking the time

370
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,527
to come and visit
our grounds today.

371
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:41,960
Uh, sure.

372
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:45,960
So you're the one who made
those croquettes?

373
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,193
[LATIFAH]
Oh, yes, I make them every day.

374
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:52,327
I like to do what I can
to help our guests enjoy
themselves here.

375
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:57,027
Um, don't take this the wrong
way, but what is it you want?

376
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,460
And who exactly are you?

377
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,660
The park is quite expansive.

378
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,127
Have you already seen all of it?

379
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:07,827
Uh‐huh, more than I wanted to.

380
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:09,960
[LATIFAH] What did you think?

381
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:13,193
Well, where do I start?

382
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:20,527
Say no more, I'm certain it
was far from ideal.

383
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:21,927
(sigh)

384
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:24,027
Sir Kanie...
[SEIYA] (huh?)

385
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,927
Please grant me this one favor.

386
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:28,660
Our precious park is
in danger of closing down,

387
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,160
and I was hoping that you
could be the one to rescue it.

388
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,227
What?

389
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:35,227
Amagi Brilliant Park
needs your leadership.

390
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,227
Please say you'll
be the manager for us!

391
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:40,460
You mean you want me
to be in charge of this place?

392
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,993
[LATIFAH] Yes...

393
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:45,227
You have what it takes to
save this park from ruin.

394
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:48,627
That is what the Oracle
has made clear to us.

395
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:49,793
[SEIYA] "Oracle"?

396
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,227
[LATIFAH] That's right.

397
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:56,027
We are residents of Maple Land,
a kingdom of magic.

398
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,927
Are you serious?

399
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,360
Yes. You see,
the kingdom where I was born

400
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,093
is different from the
world you live in,

401
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:05,193
because magical happenings
tend to be commonplace.

402
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:07,393
To tell you the truth,
most of the cast members

403
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,427
who live and work here at
Amagi Brilliant Park

404
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:13,260
are actually native to that
magical land the same as I am.

405
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,260
Huh?

406
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,793
However, if we don't succeed
in welcoming 250,000 visitors,

407
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,993
then the park will close
in three months.

408
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:26,127
If that happens, the people
of Maple Land will have
nowhere left to go,

409
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:28,727
which means we will cease
to exist forever.

410
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:33,960
Wait a second, you can't just
expect me to believe all this
magic stuff is real.

411
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,427
I understand this is difficult.

412
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:39,160
That's why I...

413
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:49,293
That's why I'm going to
demonstrate a bit of magic
for you right now, all right?

414
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:51,960
[SEIYA] Magic?
[LATIFAH] Indeed.

415
00:19:58,927 --> 00:19:59,727
[ah!]

416
00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:01,327
Now, Sir Kanie,

417
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:04,493
I need you to stay still please.
[SEIYA] (huh?)

418
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:19,393
[LATIFAH] Oh no, Sir Kanie!

419
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:20,527
Are you hurt?!

420
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:22,027
Please help me, Lady Isuzu!

421
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,460
We must move him
inside at once!

422
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,693
Sir Kanie, wake up!

423
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:42,669
Oh, I'm in my room?

424
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:48,752
Better wash up.

425
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:03,285
[ISUZU] [oh!]
[SEIYA] (wah! panting)

426
00:21:05,252 --> 00:21:07,219
[SEIYA] Hey, Aunt Aisu!
I know you're in there!

427
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,085
Open up, I need to talk to you!
Aunt Aisu! Come out, hurry!
[ISUZU] (ugh)

428
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,119
What in the world
do you want at this hour?

429
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:17,452
[SEIYA] Aunt Aisu,
why is that girl here?!

430
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:19,352
Oh, you mean Isuzu?

431
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:22,352
She brought you home last night
after the last train was gone

432
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:23,885
so I let her stay.

433
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:25,985
I think she told me you tripped
and knocked yourself out.

434
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,685
<i>Can't believe Seiya</i>
<i>had a date with a girl.</i>

435
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:31,319
He's really changed his ways.
[SEIYA] (gah!)

436
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:35,019
<i>Not that long ago, he thought</i>
<i>of every girl he met</i>
<i>as his nemesis.</i>

437
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,752
<i>Well, as his guardian,</i>
<i>I have to say I'm pleased.</i>

438
00:21:38,852 --> 00:21:40,852
That was really weird.
[AISU] Huh?

439
00:21:40,952 --> 00:21:42,585
Did you say something just now?

440
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:44,319
Something about me
changing my ways?

441
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:45,452
[ISUZU] (ah!)

442
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:46,519
What?! Nothing!

443
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:47,752
Wh‐what are you talking about?!

444
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,352
It looked like you had
your mouth closed,

445
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:50,585
but I know I heard your voice.

446
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,752
[AISU] Oh, that's right!

447
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,652
I must be really
hungover right now!

448
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:55,419
I should probably go
back to sleep for a while.

449
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,519
And you'd better be getting
ready for school,
don't you think?

450
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,352
See ya!

451
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,952
Kanie!
[SEIYA] (wah!)

452
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:05,285
It would appear that you've just
awakened to a magic ability.

453
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:07,052
Huh?!

454
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:12,552
I assume you believe
what I told you now?

455
00:22:12,652 --> 00:22:14,519
[SEIYA] (uuuhhh...)

456
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,519
[ISUZU & SEIYA] Time for
the attractions spotlight.

457
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:00,185
[ISUZU] This segment will
showcase all the exciting
attractions AmaBri has to offer.

458
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,585
[SEIYA] You don't sound excited.

459
00:24:01,685 --> 00:24:03,785
[ISUZU] Our first feature is
Moffle's Sweets House.

460
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:06,319
The difficulty is
actually adjustable.

461
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:07,319
[SEIYA] It is?

462
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:08,552
[ISUZU] Easy, Normal, Hard,

463
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:10,719
and for the toughest
challengers, Insane.

464
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:13,652
Insane is so brutal that some
guests lose their senses.

465
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,119
[SEIYA]
I wouldn't advertise that.

466
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:17,985
[ISUZU] Oh, and Kanie, you
played on Easy this time.

467
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:19,585
[SEIYA] Easy?!
