1
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:14,269
[SEIYA]
We're having a soccer match!

2
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:16,036
[ALL]
(confused)

3
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:18,402
[MOFFLE]
Finally lost your moffin'
marbles, huh?

4
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:19,402
[SEIYA]
No!

5
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:21,102
[SEIYA]
Check this out.

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,802
[SEIYA]
You know that stadium
to the south?

7
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,469
We'll hold a soccer match there.

8
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:32,302
That's our only shot at getting
100,000 people in only ten days.

9
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:35,269
[ASHE]
You mean we're hosting a
professional match?

10
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,402
[SEIYA]
That's right...
That stadium can hold 50,000.

11
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:41,269
This is the perfect
chance to use it.

12
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:43,702
[ISUZU]
As I'm sure some of you have
already surmised,

13
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:48,969
going by the current rate,
it's impossible to reach half
a million visitors by July 31st.

14
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:52,869
But if we account
for the projected number
of soccer spectators...

15
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:54,602
[ALL]
(amazed)

16
00:00:54,702 --> 00:00:55,902
[SEIYA]
Triken!

17
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,602
SIR! As per the acting
manager's orders...

18
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:00,102
secretly I might add...

19
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:04,469
...I've been conducting research
for quite some time now.

20
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,402
I followed the few leads I had
all across Japan,

21
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:09,469
to the north, south,
east, and west.

22
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,636
[TRIKEN]
Oh yes, I went to such great
pains during this whole process
[OKURO] (snore)

23
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:15,802
that I only wish I could bow
to myself in recogniti‐(pain)

24
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:17,269
[ISUZU]
Hurry and get to the point.

25
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,736
But Miss Isuzu, I was up all
night preparing‐ (gh!)

26
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:21,269
[ISUZU] What's that?
[TRIKEN] Yes ma'am!

27
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,145
[SEIYA]
Basically,

28
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:59,278
I wanted an event that would
make use of the stadium

29
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:00,778
and bring in more guests...

30
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,445
I was actually on the lookout
for a long time until now.

31
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:05,845
[MOFFLE]
I had no idea you were
up to something.

32
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:08,978
I didn't think there was much
chance of finding anything.

33
00:03:09,078 --> 00:03:10,278
[TRIKEN]
However...!

34
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:12,645
Last night I received a
positive response

35
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:14,178
from one of my contacts.

36
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,212
[TRIKEN]
This is the home stadium

37
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:18,645
of Division One team
Grandira Tokyo.

38
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:23,112
[TRIKEN]
The turf is ragged, so it's
scheduled for refurbishing...

39
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:24,478
but it's taking them too long

40
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,112
which means that the venue
won't be ready in time

41
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:28,845
for the commemorative
match on July 31st.

42
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,345
[MOFFLE]
July 31st, huh?

43
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:32,545
[ISUZU]
That's the date
the team was founded,

44
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,345
so they were hoping to hold
the match on that day.

45
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:39,478
[ISUZU]
From what we understand,
the annual match between
the current and retired

46
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:42,478
champion teams
attracts about 50,000.

47
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,378
[SEIYA]
As you might've guessed...

48
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:48,045
they're in a hurry
to find another venue.

49
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,212
[SEIYA]
So we'll invite them
to come here.

50
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:51,545
[GENJURO]
But, sir...

51
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:53,312
I assume we would
need to have some kind of

52
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:55,778
special license to host a
professional match, wouldn't we?

53
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:58,245
[ISUZU]
I don't think it's going to be
an official game.

54
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:00,512
I'm sure it'll work out
if we negotiate properly.

55
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:03,278
[SEIYA]
We'll tell you more
after we discuss it with them.

56
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:05,745
[SEIYA]
We're gonna be busy
if it happens.

57
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,212
So you'd better be ready!

58
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:17,412
[TRIKEN]
Are you sure you'd like ME
to act as AmaBri's main
representative, sir?

59
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,978
[SEIYA]
They won't take us seriously

60
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:21,512
with a high school
student in charge.

61
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,812
[SEIYA]
Did you bring that
Rarapazzi thing?

62
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:29,145
[TRIKEN]
Of course. As long as I
have this they won't even
care that I'm a dinosaur.

63
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:30,912
[SEIYA] (thinking)

64
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:32,812
[ISUZU] One question.
[SEIYA] Hm?

65
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:34,345
[ISUZU]
Tell me honestly...

66
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:37,412
How much of a chance
do you think we have?

67
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,145
[SEIYA]
I don't know.

68
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:49,278
[GUY A]
It looks like
it's the right size.

69
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:50,745
[GUY B]
We'll have to see the turf.

70
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:52,245
[GUY C]
(sigh)

71
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:55,145
[TRIKEN]
What do you think, sirs?

72
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:57,245
I'm confident that the capacity
of the stadium

73
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:58,978
will be enough
to meet your needs.

74
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:00,412
[GUY C]
From the looks of it,

75
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:02,878
the building was established
quite a long time ago.

76
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:04,012
[TRIKEN]
Ah yes...

77
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:05,978
I‐it's about 20 years old, sir.

78
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:08,678
[GUY D]
I understand the space
hasn't been used much but...

79
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:10,878
what kind of regular maintenance
have you been doing?

80
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,512
[TRIKEN]
Um... Well, let me consult
my notes here...

81
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,312
[GUY A]
What about access
from the train station?

82
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:17,612
How will you manage
50,000 patrons?

83
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:21,645
[TRIKEN]
(nervous)
I‐I was thinking hard work and
determination would suffice...

84
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:23,878
[GUY B]
But the most crucial issue
here is the turf...

85
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:26,845
It has to be all‐natural
and perfectly maintained...

86
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:29,345
Without that,
there can be no match.

87
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:30,612
[GUY B]
But I'm sure you know that.

88
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,945
[TRIKEN]
Yes of course I know that...

89
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,145
The turf is very important...
I know.

90
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,678
[ISUZU]
(No he didn't.)

91
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:39,012
[GUY B]
My concern is that it's
a multipurpose stadium

92
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,578
instead of a sports stadium.

93
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:44,312
Could you tell us more
about the turf maintenance?

94
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:46,878
[TRIKEN]
Ah, actually I'm only
Chief of Sales,

95
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:48,912
so I wouldn't
know the details, sir...

96
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:50,712
[GUYS]
(sigh)

97
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,978
[GUY C]
Well then, I appreciate
you all taking the time

98
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:54,145
to come speak with us today.

99
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:55,478
[ISUZU] (surprised)
[TRIKEN] (shock)

100
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:57,378
[GUY D]
I think we've heard enough
for now.

101
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:59,912
We'll get back to you with
a final decision in a few days.

102
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:01,512
[TRIKEN]
Wait! Please wait a moment!

103
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,978
I urge you to look over our
proposal one more time, please!

104
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:07,312
It would mean a lot!

105
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:08,412
[SEIYA]
First off...

106
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:09,678
you asked us about maintenance?

107
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:10,912
[GUY A/GUY C]
(surprised)

108
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,278
The park employees are very
dedicated

109
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,912
to keeping the stadium
in excellent condition.

110
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,478
We could do it tomorrow
if you wanted.

111
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:18,478
[GUY C]
Oh?

112
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,512
[SEIYA]
Then there's accessibility.

113
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:24,512
We'd be glad to ask a
local bus company to allocate
some shuttle buses.

114
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:28,312
And our parking lot
has enough space for 5,000 cars.

115
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:30,578
[GUY D]
(sigh)

116
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,112
[SEIYA]
And we actually have a
specialist on site

117
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:33,612
who takes care of the turf.

118
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:36,178
It's immaculately kept
and 100% natural,

119
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:38,945
so there's no need to worry.

120
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,245
[GUY B]
I'm not so sure.

121
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:42,112
I invite you to come see
for yourselves...

122
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:43,678
You won't be disappointed.

123
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:46,145
[GUY A]
Huh...

124
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:47,845
[GUY C]
That's all well and good, but...

125
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:53,345
[GUY D]
We'd rather not work with
a venue with no experience.

126
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:57,912
[GUY C]
We appreciate your proposal...
(Honestly, the main issue
is how much this'll cost us.)

127
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:01,312
[GUY D]
(With all the salary
increases, we're struggling
to stay afloat.

128
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:04,445
We can't afford this.)

129
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:07,945
[GUY B]
(We couldn't even afford
to finish the turf replacement.

130
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:12,745
I'm starting to doubt that
we'll be able to pay all
the bills this month.)

131
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:16,112
[GUY A]
Right... I believe
we have to decline...
(We need to talk the price down

132
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,845
without divulging our
financial problem.)

133
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:21,345
[SEIYA]
Oh that's right:
I forgot to mention something.

134
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,312
I've discussed this
with my team...

135
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:25,445
and we've decided
we'd like to waive the fees

136
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,678
and allow you to
use the stadium free of charge.

137
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:29,212
[GUY A/GUY B/GUY C/GUY D/TRIKEN]
No charge?!

138
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:30,378
[TRIKEN]
(panicking)

139
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:31,378
[SEIYA]
That's not all, either...

140
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,278
We recognize bus rentals,

141
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:35,112
security, advertising,

142
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:37,478
and ticket printing
can be expensive,

143
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:40,212
so we're prepared to cover
a portion of those costs as well

144
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:41,545
if that's alright with you.

145
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:43,812
[GUY A]
Y‐you're offering
to pay US money?!

146
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:45,012
[SEIYA]
That's right...

147
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:46,378
In other words,
Amagi Brilliant Park

148
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:48,612
is asking to participate
as a sort of sponsor.

149
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:51,312
[TRIKEN]
A‐are you sure
we can promise that, Mr. Kanie?

150
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:56,612
[GUY D]
Then we'd be interested
in hearing what kind of numbers
you have in mind specifically.

151
00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:58,145
[SEIYA]
Hm...

152
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,845
[TRIKEN]
(shocked)

153
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:01,178
[SEIYA]
I think this is reasonable.

154
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:02,578
[GUY A/GUY B/GUY C/GUY D]
(look)

155
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:03,478
(amazed)

156
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:04,678
[SEIYA]
That sound about right?

157
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:06,245
[GUY A]
W‐wait a minute;

158
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:08,512
are you sure that isn't some
kind of gross miscalculation?

159
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:10,412
[SEIYA]
Absolutely positive...

160
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:13,878
These instructions come directly
from the manager herself.

161
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,778
[GUY B]
It still seems a little high...

162
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:20,112
[GUY D]
Of course it's extremely
appealing to us, but...

163
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:23,078
[GUY C]
Aren't you going to
suffer a serious loss?

164
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:24,478
[SEIYA]
I assure you gentlemen,

165
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:26,212
our manager is in full support
of the sponsorship

166
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:28,678
as long as it serves to
bring in some new customers.

167
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:32,345
She'd like us to host
these soccer fans regardless of
how much it costs the park.

168
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,145
That's exactly what she said.

169
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:37,245
[GUY A/GUY B/GUY C/GUY D]
(unsure)

170
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:39,012
[SEIYA]
We do have one
small request, though.

171
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:41,078
[GUY B/GUY C] (hm?)
[GUY A] And what's that?

172
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:43,112
[SEIYA]
We'd like all the spectators

173
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:45,578
to go in through
the park's main gate.

174
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:48,278
[SEIYA]
Of course, if they have
a soccer ticket,

175
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,078
they'll receive free admission.

176
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:52,012
[GUY C]
Why would you want to do that?

177
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:55,145
[GUY D]
It looks like the stadium
has its own separate entrance,
doesn't it?

178
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,145
[SEIYA]
It's too complicated
to explain that...

179
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,745
but I'm afraid this
particular request is
absolutely non‐negotiable.

180
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,878
[GUY C]
Well, I don't see any reason
to take issue with that.

181
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,078
[SEIYA]
(smile)

182
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,512
[SEIYA]
What do you say, gentlemen?

183
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:09,678
Why don't you come pay us
a visit soon?

184
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:13,145
That way you can approve
the facility for yourselves.

185
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,645
[TRIKEN]
Are you sure that was wise?

186
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:17,778
Promising to pay
the expenses as well?

187
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:21,912
You must be well
aware of AmaBri's
financial situation, yes?

188
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:23,678
[SEIYA]
I have a plan.

189
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:24,645
[SEIYA]
Trust me.

190
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:25,778
[ISUZU]
(unsure)

191
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:29,012
[TRIKEN]
What about the turf maintenance?

192
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:30,678
I'm not familiar
with any "specialist".

193
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,778
[SEIYA]
What better landscaper
than a flower fairy?

194
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:35,612
He's got quite the green thumb.

195
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,178
[TIRAMY]
Alright!

196
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,312
Just leave everything to mii!

197
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:47,678
[TIRAMY] Mii!
[MACARON/MOFFLE] (amazed)

198
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:50,478
(panic)

199
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:52,645
[TIRAMY/MOFFLE/MACARON]
Killer plaaant!

200
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:53,712
[KILLER PLANT]
(hiss)

201
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:55,078
[TIRAMY]
(startled) (scream)

202
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,678
[MOFFLE/MACARON]
(scream)

203
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:58,745
[ISUZU]
I was expecting
something like that.

204
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,612
[SEIYA]
Are you guys ready?

205
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,712
[SEIYA]
Take it down!

206
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:10,145
[KILLER PLANT]
(dying)

207
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,445
[TARAMO]
Crisis averted, boss!

208
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:15,845
[ISUZU]
That's wonderful.

209
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:16,912
[SEIYA]
Yeah.

210
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:19,212
This oughta do the trick.

211
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:58,712
[GUY C]
The turf is what really sold us!

212
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:02,012
I only wish I could convince
you all to tell us your secret.

213
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:04,012
[GUY D]
Everything's not
exactly perfect...

214
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,612
but we can iron out
the details later on.

215
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:08,145
[GUY B]
There's not much time
to prepare,

216
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:09,678
but working together,

217
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:12,845
I think we'll be able to pull
off this event quite nicely.

218
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:14,378
[SEIYA]
I appreciate that, sir...

219
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:16,278
We'll do everything
we can to help out.

220
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,978
[TRIKEN]
We respectfully bow
to you gentlemen.

221
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,312
[GUY B]
Thank you so much...

222
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:23,245
We look forward to working
with you as well.

223
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:27,812
[TRIKEN]
(sigh)
That was nerve‐wracking.

224
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:31,545
[SEIYA]
Sento... tell everybody
to gather on the roof
of Maple Castle

225
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:33,645
as soon as the
park closes tonight...

226
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:34,945
I'm breaking the news.

227
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:36,045
[ISUZU]
I'll do that.

228
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,178
[TRIKEN]
(confused)

229
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:38,878
[TRIKEN]
What news is that?

230
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:40,645
[SEIYA]
(troubled)

231
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,512
[ISUZU]
Attention!

232
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:50,845
[SEIYA]
I have something
I need to tell you.

233
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:56,145
[SEIYA]
(prepare)
It's important.

234
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:59,212
[SEIYA]
We're selling off
the south area!

235
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:13,118
[TIRAMY]
Y‐you say the south area's
gonna be sold‐mii?

236
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:14,152
[SEIYA]
Right.

237
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:16,552
It's not up for discussion.

238
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,752
I was looking for a buyer
for a while...

239
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:22,552
[SEIYA]
...and the other day
I finally found one.

240
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:28,118
The money we make
from that should take care
of our financial issue...

241
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:30,618
I'm sure you all understand.

242
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:33,452
[WRENCH]
Heh, there ya go
droppin' another bomb on us.

243
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,585
[MUSE]
But Mr. Kanie, the southern
area's almost as big
as the main section!

244
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:38,618
[MUSE]
You can't‐

245
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:40,952
[SEIYA]
I can and I will.

246
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,985
[WANIPEE]
I always thought AmaBri would
get back on its feet one day

247
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:46,918
and maybe we could build
some nice attractions
over in that area.

248
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:49,352
[NICK]
Me too, I figured
that was the plan.

249
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:50,918
[DORNELL]
Yeah, if we could've expanded,

250
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:53,685
it would've really put AmaBri
on the map once and for all.

251
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:55,885
[SEIYA]
None of that stuff
is ever gonna happen!

252
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:58,418
Not before this park
runs itself into the ground!

253
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:03,118
If we have to cut off
a limb to survive, then
that's exactly what we'll do!

254
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:06,585
We can't afford to think about
what happens after this.

255
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:09,552
[MOFFLE] Okay.
[MUSE/SYLPHY] Huh?

256
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:12,285
Maybe it's not such a
bad idea‐ y'know?

257
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:14,218
[MUSE]
Mr. Moffle...

258
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:20,818
That's true, maybe hanging
onto land we're not using
is kind of a waste‐ron.

259
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:22,285
[TIRAMY]
Fair enough...

260
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,218
Guess I'm on board‐mii.

261
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:27,652
[ASHE]
It does make sense
from an accounting
perspective as well...

262
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:30,252
It's better if we can solve
everything at once.

263
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:34,685
[MUSE]
Maybe you're right...
I just think it'll be sad
to give up half of the property.

264
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:37,118
[KOBORY]
I know, but it's for
the good of the park.

265
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:40,152
[SALAMA]
Sounds like the best way for
us to keep working together...

266
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,952
so I can't really complain.

267
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:46,185
[SYLPHY]
You can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs!

268
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:49,818
[WRENCH] I reckon I'll allow it.

269
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:53,185
[GENJURO] Right! Lose the
battle, win the war!

270
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:54,318
[SEIYA]
(focus) Good!

271
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,485
That's all I needed to tell you.

272
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,985
[SEIYA]
We've got 9 days left,
and there's still a lot to do!

273
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,885
[SEIYA]
Starting tonight, nobody's
going home or taking days off!

274
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:06,252
Now get to work, everyone!

275
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:09,152
YEAH!

276
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,918
[LATIFAH]
How are the preparations going?

277
00:14:57,018 --> 00:14:58,652
[SEIYA]
Well, I can't say it's
a walk in the park,

278
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:00,018
but I think we can manage it.

279
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:02,652
[LATIFAH]
That's wonderful to hear,
Sir Kanie.

280
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:06,052
[SEIYA] I'm uh... sorry.
[LATIFAH] About what?

281
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:09,552
About my decision to sell almost
half of the park property.

282
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:11,818
I know I discussed it
with you first...

283
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:14,652
but I'm sorry it had to happen.

284
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:16,552
[LATIFAH]
How many times must I say it?

285
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:19,185
You are the manager
of our precious park, Sir Kanie.

286
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,585
[LATIFAH]
We trust you to serve
its best interest.

287
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,452
[SEIYA]
(speechless)

288
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:26,218
[LATIFAH]
More importantly, isn't there
something I can do to help?

289
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:30,918
I feel terrible sitting here
doing nothing while you're
all working so diligently.

290
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,385
[SEIYA]
For now, your job
is to get some rest...

291
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:35,152
Don't worry about anything else.

292
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:36,618
[LATIFAH] I don't know...

293
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:39,885
What? Now you can't follow
the acting manager's orders?

294
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:41,452
[LATIFAH]
(laugh) Very well then.

295
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:42,852
[SEIYA]
Just sit back and relax.

296
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:44,518
I mean... think about how
much better

297
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:46,618
this place is doing
lately all because of me.

298
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:49,385
And once we get to August,
it'll be even bet‐ (realize)

299
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:50,685
[LATIFAH]
(troubled)

300
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:52,485
[SEIYA]
Oh wait...
the first of August...

301
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:56,285
That's when you're gonna lose
all your memories again, right?

302
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:58,685
[SEIYA]
Even if the park stays open.

303
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,518
[LATIFAH]
Please don't let it trouble you.

304
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,652
It's just something
that happens every year.

305
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:06,552
I can't believe you've been
living your life this way
for such a long time now.

306
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:10,852
[LATIFAH]
Yes...
At the stroke of midnight
on the first day of August...

307
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:14,518
my physical body as well as my
memories are set back by a year.

308
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:18,418
[LATIFAH]
My uncle explained
the situation to me
when it happened the last time.

309
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:19,585
[LATIFAH]
The reason I'm here...

310
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:24,152
and what's happened
up until now.

311
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:29,352
I'm sure I must have met
the Digerry Clan and Sir Rubrum
at some point as well...

312
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:31,285
but I don't have
any memory of that.

313
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:32,618
[SEIYA]
Oh.

314
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:35,485
But I know that as long as
this park exists,

315
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:36,785
I'll always be here.

316
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:39,018
[LATIFAH]
Always and forever.

317
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:41,118
[SEIYA]
(sad)

318
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:42,385
[LATIFAH]
So please...

319
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:44,285
Come back and visit me
whenever you can,

320
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,018
even after
you finish working here.

321
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:49,018
For some odd reason I never
forget how to make croquettes.

322
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:52,418
[SEIYA]
Okay...
I do like your croquettes.

323
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:55,752
[LATIFAH]
Right! We can ride
the Ferris wheel again too!

324
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:57,752
[SEIYA]
Ah! Uh, maybe not that.

325
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,052
[LATIFAH]
Oh, I forgot!

326
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,652
I'm sorry. (giggles)

327
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:08,352
[TAKAYA]
Hey there, it's been a while.

328
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:10,085
You know, you're always
barging in.

329
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:13,385
[TAKAYA]
I just came to check
the old visitor counter.

330
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:16,618
Not giving up, are you?

331
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:19,685
[SEIYA]
Yeah, I think we'll
just barely make 500,000.

332
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:21,252
[TAKAYA]
Just to make this clear...

333
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:24,418
the contract deadline is at
closing time on the last day,

334
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:25,752
which is 9 o'clock sharp.

335
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:28,785
No extensions allowed...
Please remember that.

336
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:31,418
[SEIYA]
Well the soccer match
kicks off at 6PM...

337
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,552
So there's nothing
to worry about.

338
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,352
[TAKAYA]
I'll send one of my staff
the day‐of.

339
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:39,285
[TAKAYA]
July 31st at 9 p. m.

340
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,218
[TAKAYA]
I'll be looking forward to it.

341
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,485
[SEIYA]
(look)

342
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:12,685
[ISUZU]
Kanie... It's time to go.

343
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:15,085
[SEIYA]
Right.

344
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:16,552
[SEIYA]
Unlock the gate!

345
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:18,785
We're open!

346
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:27,952
[MOFFLE]
(juggling)

347
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:31,152
[MOTHER A]
Oh my, they're lovely!
[LITTLE GIRL]
How did he do that?

348
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:33,718
[MACARON]
Ro‐Ron!

349
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:35,452
[FUTURE]
Keep our planet clean!

350
00:18:35,552 --> 00:18:39,252
[GIRL]
Look at me so I can take your
picture with the ferret guy!

351
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:41,452
[MUSE]
Hey guys!

352
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,118
Ready?

353
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,318
[SALAMA]
That's awesome!

354
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,652
[KOBORY]
We sure hope all of you
enjoy the show today!

355
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:00,218
[ISUZU]
The numbers really
are climbing up.

356
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:02,685
[SEIYA]
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
we'll get even more.

357
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:04,085
We HAVE to get more.

358
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:19,618
[TRIKEN]
Current wait time is 20 minutes!

359
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:23,052
I repeat, the current
wait time is 20 minutes!

360
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:26,385
[TIRAMY]
Miii!!!

361
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:27,718
[GIRL B]
Aw, he's so cute!

362
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:32,552
[TIRAMY]
Mii! Mii! Mii‐heehee!

363
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:34,718
[TIRAMY]
(sigh) Jeez,
when's it gonna be over...

364
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:36,752
[GIRL C]
Look Mom! It's Tiramy!

365
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:38,185
[TIRAMY]
(startled) Another one?!

366
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:42,018
ENCORE ENCORE!

367
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:44,952
[MACARON]
How many encores
do they want from me‐ron?

368
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,818
[MOFFLE]
Moff! All units follow me!

369
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:53,752
[MOFFLE]
(panic) (dizzy falling) (oof!)

370
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:55,918
[GENJURO]
Hyahhhh!

371
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:57,585
[EIKO]
I'm sorry, we're full!

372
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:00,152
but please feel free
to wait for the next showtime!

373
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,185
I need two carbonaras,
an order of hotcakes,

374
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:07,552
three udon bowls,
and what was that other thing...

375
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:09,285
two bowls of ramen!

376
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:12,318
[SHIINA]
W‐w‐wait a minute‐ there's no
way I can remember all thaaat!

377
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:14,818
[NICK]
Hey Shiina! We're running low
on meat again!

378
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:17,018
Go pick some up from
that store near the station!

379
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:17,885
[SHIINA]
Not again!

380
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:19,718
Get as much as you can carry!

381
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,118
We're gonna need at least
200 pounds of it this time!

382
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:23,185
[BIINO/SHIINA]
(panic)

383
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:24,718
[LITTLE BOY A]
(loud crying)

384
00:20:24,818 --> 00:20:26,152
[WANIPEE]
We don't have
enough personnel!

385
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:29,585
Send some backup to
the Lost Child Center ASAP!

386
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:33,385
[MACARON]
Ugh, I'm so exhausted.

387
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:37,152
[KOBORY]
I've never even seen this many
people at comic conventions.

388
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:40,018
[SALAMA]
This has gotta be
some kind of park record.

389
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,485
[TIRAMY]
I can't feel my feet, mii.

390
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:44,885
Sure wish a nice girl
would give me a massage.

391
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:46,618
[MUSE]
Sorry! that's
never gonna happen.

392
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:49,685
[MOFFLE]
It's only gonna get busier
in the afternoon.

393
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:53,652
[MOFFLE]
We'll just have to stick it out.

394
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,585
[PA VOICE]
It's time for
the special event...

395
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:58,418
All cast members
please be on standby.

396
00:20:58,518 --> 00:20:59,552
[MACARON]
Already?!

397
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:00,948
[KOBORY/MUSE/SALAMA]
(weary)

398
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:26,925
[BOY A]
Come on Dad!

399
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:28,958
It's almost time!

400
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,392
[DAD]
Slow down buddy,
we'll get there.

401
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,725
[MUSE]
(smile)

402
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:38,125
[MOFFLE]
Someday we'll be this crowded

403
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:41,225
without the help
of some soccer match.

404
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,458
[MUSE]
Yeah.

405
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:46,925
[GUY E] It's over there!
[GUY F] Sweet, let's go!

406
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,925
[ISUZU]
The people who came in
on the last bus

407
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,558
just went through the gate.

408
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:54,292
[SEIYA]
(gasp, into shock)

409
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:55,858
[ISUZU]
(startled) Kanie!

410
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,725
[SEIYA]
(look)

411
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:14,358
[SEIYA]
We fell short.

412
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:54,425
[ISUZU/SEIYA]
Time for the
attractions spotlight.

413
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:57,158
[ISUZU]
Today's feature is
Fisherman's Dive.

414
00:23:57,258 --> 00:23:58,758
[SEIYA]
Is this really necessary?

415
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:00,392
The park might
be about to shut down.

416
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:02,625
[ISUZU]
That's exactly
why it's important.

417
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:04,292
[SEIYA]
Fine.

418
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,158
[SEIYA]
So, what's Fisherman's Dive?

419
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:08,358
[ISUZU]
A coaster ride in Splash Ocean,

420
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:11,292
based on Hemingway's
famous masterpiece.

421
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:16,558
[ISUZU]
Visitors struggle desperately
to catch an impressive marlin
only to be thwarted by sharks.

422
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:18,492
[SEIYA]
That's not fun!
