1
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:05,824
[EIKO]
And so peace was restored to the
enchanted forest.

2
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:08,491
And the miracle brought about
by the four spirits

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:09,491
became known as

4
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:11,624
the Legend of Elementario!

5
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:13,024
[MUSE]
(small effort x4)

6
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:18,458
[MUSE/SALAMA] (impact)
[KOBORY] Wh‐whoaaa!
[SALAMA] Ah, jeez...

7
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:22,424
[MUSE]
Thank you everyone!

8
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:23,824
See you soon!

9
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,958
[KOBORY]
W‐we hope you liked the
performance...

10
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:27,458
[SALAMA]
Yeah! whatever.

11
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:30,624
[SYLPHY]
Dhanyavadah te!

12
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:31,991
[SEIYA]
This is terrible.

13
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:33,658
[ISUZU]
It seems the four of you don't

14
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:34,824
know the meaning of harmony.

15
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:36,358
[MUSE]
We're sorry.

16
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,891
[MOFFLE]
Moff... Do you even get along
with each other?

17
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:18,267
[MUSE]
Why would the princess
invite us all to dinner?

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,900
[SALAMA]
Maybe we're about to get fired.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,700
[KOBORY]
Oh! I certainly hope not...

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
[MUSE]
(smile)

21
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,134
(notice)

22
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:26,667
What is it, Sylphy?

23
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:29,800
[KOBORY]
Is it just me or does this tree

24
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,300
have more flowers
than it did before?

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,067
[MUSE]
Now that you mention it...

26
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,767
[LATIFAH]
Welcome!

27
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:36,934
[KOBORY]
The princess.

28
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,367
I'm so glad you all could
attend!

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,567
[LATIFAH]
Please help yourselves

30
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:42,867
to whatever you like.

31
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,000
[MUSE]
Thank you so much Your Highness!

32
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,967
[SYLPHY]
Don't mind if I do!

33
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,700
Ahhh...

34
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,900
(bite)

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,700
[MUSE]
So uh... Your Majesty?

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,734
[LATIFAH]
Yes?

37
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:55,467
Why did you invite us here?

38
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:56,967
[LATIFAH]
Well... I heard from Sir Kanie

39
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,567
that you ladies
were having difficulties

40
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,800
rehearsing your new show.

41
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,934
So I invited you over
for sukiyaki.

42
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:04,000
I thought it might
help you relax.

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,700
[MUSE]
That's the reason?

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
[LATIFAH]
Of course!

45
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,134
[SALAMA]
Sheesh who cares why?

46
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:09,934
[MUSE]
(surprised)
Don't say that, Salama!

47
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:12,034
That's rude, and you shouldn't
be messing around

48
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:14,234
on your phone
in front of Her Majesty!

49
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:16,034
[SALAMA]
Fine. Sorry, princess,

50
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:17,434
I just need to finish this post.

51
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:18,667
[MUSE]
(annoyed)

52
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:21,534
Oh dear! Perhaps this wasn't a
good idea after all.

53
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,767
[MUSE]
No! of course it is.

54
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:23,934
we're having a great time!

55
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:25,000
[MUSE]
Having fun, Kobory?

56
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,967
[KOBORY]
(eager nod)

57
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,067
Sylphy too... Tell her!

58
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,234
[SYLPHY]
Oishii ne!

59
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,734
[MUSE]
And Salama might LOOK bored‐

60
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,434
but check out what she's typing!

61
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,134
She's raving about it!

62
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:36,734
[LATIFAH]
(nervous laugh)

63
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,700
Alright then! if you're certain.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
[SALAMA]
Come on Muse,

65
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,434
quit acting so prim and proper.

66
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,567
I'm sure the princess would want
us to be upfront with each other

67
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,134
whether she's listening or not!

68
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:46,767
[MUSE]
(surprised)

69
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,000
[LATIFAH]
(smile)

70
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
You all formed your
performance troupe

71
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,834
less than six months ago.

72
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:51,667
Isn't that correct?

73
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:53,000
[MUSE]
Y‐yes...

74
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,834
The original performers
quit out of nowhere

75
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,400
so they asked us to replace
them.

76
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,334
You know! Moffle and the others
were the ones

77
00:03:58,434 --> 00:03:59,867
who suggested
we meet like this.

78
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,034
[KOBORY]
That's right!

79
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:02,034
He does
like to bond over drinks.

80
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:03,367
[SALAMA]
That's so lame.

81
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,734
Why do you have to say
such negative things?

82
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,700
Mr. Moffle's obviously
worried about us!

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,100
[SALAMA]
(annoyed) Well sorry...

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,500
Little Miss Goody Two‐Shoes.

85
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,000
[MUSE]
(offended) At least
I KNOW how to be nice.

86
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,434
[KOBORY] No! stop...
please don't fight! okay?
[SALAMA] Yeah, sure you do.

87
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:16,734
[MUSE]
What's that supposed to mean?

88
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:17,900
[KOBORY] Sylphy! make them stop.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,067
[SALAMA]
Like you're being extra nice

90
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,067
in front of the princess.

91
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,234
[MUSE]
Will you drop it?

92
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,767
You should be honored to!

93
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:24,067
[LATIFAH]
(gasp)

94
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,334
[LATIFAH]
Please excuse me! ladies.

95
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,534
But unfortunately, this is
all the sauce we have left.

96
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:30,500
[MUSE]
Okay, then I'll just‐!

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,567
[LATIFAH]
No!

98
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:32,834
I have to be a proper hostess

99
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,067
for my guests.

100
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,067
But we couldn't possibly
make you go out!

101
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,134
[LATIFAH]
It's quite alright...
Please wait here.

102
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,034
[MUSE]
(speechless)

103
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:41,267
(overdramatic gasp)

104
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,934
[MUSE]
What's the matter,
Your Highness?

105
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,834
[LATIFAH]
I almost forgot to tell you all

106
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,134
something very important.

107
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:48,767
[LATIFAH]
That red button over there...

108
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:49,800
[LATIFAH]
Whatever you do,

109
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
please do not touch it.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,867
[MUSE]
Um... okay?

111
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,934
[LATIFAH]
It controls a crucial mechanism.

112
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,967
Am I clear?

113
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,100
No matter what happens,

114
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,567
you must never
touch that button.

115
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,934
[MUSE]
(gulp)

116
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:06,000
[MUSE]
Great. Now I'm starting
to get curious.

117
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,434
[KOBORY]
I wonder what would happen
if we touched it.

118
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:11,800
[SALAMA]
Welp! Only one way to find out!
Djdjdjdjdjdj!

119
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,800
Stop it Salama,
she said not to!

120
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,834
WHAT PART OF 'STOP IT'
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?!

121
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:16,834
[KOBORY]
Ah! (impact) Whoaaaa!

122
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,034
[SYLPHY]
(happy chewing)

123
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:20,634
[SALAMA]
Ow!

124
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:21,534
[MUSE]
(startled)

125
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:22,467
Hey watch it! Aaah!

126
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,367
<alarms>

127
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,567
[MUSE] (panicking)
[SALAMA] (scared)
[KOBORY] (hand‐over‐mouth fret)

128
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,967
[LATIFAH]
Oh goodness! what's happening?

129
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:33,367
[LATIFAH]
(gasp x 2)

130
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,400
(worried)

131
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,667
(surprised)

132
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,734
It couldn't be!

133
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,034
(gasp)

134
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,567
[OKURO]
(running)

135
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:04,000
[OKURO]
(panic)

136
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,534
[OKURO]
Luchaaa!

137
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,967
[SEIYA]
There's an automated
defense mode?

138
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,200
[LATIFAH]
Yes. As soon as someone
activates it‐

139
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,767
the system automatically
eradicates

140
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:15,934
anyone or anything attempting to
gain entry to the castle.

141
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,234
[SEIYA]
Why would a theme park castle

142
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,600
come equipped with
such a dangerous system?

143
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,034
[LATIFAH]
Because...

144
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:23,367
It's designed for Princess
Latifah's protection...

145
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,134
You never know when an enemy
might try to infiltrate.

146
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:28,067
[TRIKEN]
Right! Aim to the right!

147
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,200
[ISUZU]
She's a member of
the Maple Land royal family...

148
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,634
so we have to take
the necessary precautions.

149
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,767
[MACARON]
Chaaarge!

150
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:39,167
[ISUZU]
The automatic cannons
are devastatingly accurate.

151
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,067
[SEIYA]
But wait‐ the four spirits
are inside the castle.

152
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,900
Maybe we can get
in touch with them somehow.

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,867
[ISUZU]
Apparently they have
internet access,

154
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:49,467
but they're not able
to get out of the room.

155
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,534
[SEIYA]
Ugh, great,

156
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:51,800
the whole point of this thing

157
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,934
is to protect Latifah,

158
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:54,700
but she's sitting
outside with us.

159
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
What good does that do?

160
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,734
[LATIFAH]
Ah...

161
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,834
[ISUZU]
In any case,

162
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:00,334
it'll be impossible to get past

163
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:02,434
that cannon without casualties.

164
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:03,900
[TIRAMY]
(weak)

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
[SEIYA]
(sigh) So what,

166
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,467
it's gonna be like this forever?

167
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:07,500
[ISUZU]
No...

168
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,934
It says here that the system

169
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,900
deactivates after 24 hours.

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,867
All we can do for now
is wait it out, I suppose.

171
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,700
[SEIYA]
Until 9PM tomorrow?

172
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,767
[ISUZU]
Yes...

173
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:17,967
It'll fire on anyone

174
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,634
who gets
close to the castle,

175
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:22,434
which means we have no choice
but to close the park

176
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:23,834
in the meantime.

177
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,434
[SEIYA]
Seriously?! Tomorrow's Saturday!

178
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,467
The visitor count's been on a
steady climb,

179
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,600
we're not closing a whole day.
[WANIPEE]
This wasn't supposed to happen.

180
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,800
[ISUZU]
You'd rather endanger guests?
[WANIPEE]
We were gonna get married

181
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,934
[GENJURO]
She's not your girlfriend!

182
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:39,400
[MOFFLE]
Hmph... What a buncha
moffin' amateurs.

183
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,234
[SEIYA]
Moffle?

184
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,234
Leave this to me, you hear?

185
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:44,367
[SEIYA]
What are you planning to do?

186
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:46,234
[MOFFLE]
I can't attack from the ground,

187
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,100
but I've still got the sky!

188
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,567
[MOFFLE]
Rubrum!

189
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:52,034
[RUBRUM]
(awkward howl)

190
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,067
[RUBRUM]
Sorry...

191
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,267
I'm sort of an
indoor‐type dragon

192
00:07:58,367 --> 00:07:59,900
so flying's
not really my thing...

193
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,667
[MOFFLE]
Yeah, well it's about to be!

194
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:05,100
[MOFFLE]
Let's go!

195
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,167
[RUBRUM]
O‐okay!

196
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,634
[MOFFLE]
Lightning God Blast Technique!

197
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,900
[RUBRUM]
(amazed) Incredible!

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,934
[MOFFLE]
Hmph... piece o' moffin' cake.

199
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,300
Alright! I'd better‐

200
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,867
[RUBRUM]
(panic)

201
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,100
[RUBRUM]
M‐Mr. Moffle!

202
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:31,667
[MOFFLE/MACARON/TIRAMY]
We didn't make it.

203
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:32,867
[SEIYA]
Obviously.

204
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,400
[ISUZU]
That means all we can do now

205
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,267
is try to flip the emergency
stop switch from the inside.

206
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,167
[SEIYA]
Emergency stop switch?

207
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:42,167
If it was that easy then why
didn't you say so in the first
place!

208
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:44,067
[MOFFLE/MACARON/TIRAMY]
(raging)

209
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,900
[ISUZU]
It would seem there's a hidden

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
passage in Her Majesty's
bedroom.

211
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,400
[MOFFLE/MACARON/TIRAMY]
(pout)

212
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,867
It leads to the room where
the switch is located.

213
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:51,834
[LATIFAH]
Oh really?

214
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:52,700
I wasn't aware of that!

215
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,934
[ISUZU]
Yes...

216
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,734
It also says that activating

217
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,167
the switch requires four people.

218
00:08:58,267 --> 00:08:59,467
[SEIYA]
And you didn't know?

219
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:00,434
[LATIFAH]
(surprised)

220
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,234
Well, I suppose there's
a possIbility that

221
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,700
I knew about it previously.

222
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,934
[SEIYA]
Hm?

223
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:07,234
[ISUZU]
Then the best course of action

224
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:10,234
is to try to get
in contact with them.

225
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:14,500
[MUSE]
Light blue vase, got it.
You just want me to turn it?

226
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,167
Okay then... If you say so.

227
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,100
(determined)

228
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,467
[KOBORY]
(startled) What's that?

229
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:26,967
[MUSE]
Wow...

230
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,058
[KOBORY]
So the emergency stop switch
is at the end of this tunnel?

231
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:43,391
[MUSE]
That's what she told me.

232
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:46,425
But I wonder why it needs
four people?

233
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,591
[MUSE]
"The first challenge."

234
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:51,925
[MUSE]
Well, here goes.

235
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,591
[KOBORY]
Be careful, Muse.

236
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:56,325
[MUSE]
Huh?

237
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:59,458
[KOBORY/SALAMA/MUSE/SYLPHY]
What IS this?!

238
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,791
[SALAMA]
Why is there a
karaoke room in here?

239
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:03,858
[KOBORY]
Who knows?

240
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,825
[MUSE/SALAMA]
(startled)

241
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:09,025
[MUSE]
"All four have to sing
to reach 300 points"...

242
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,291
Oh, gosh...

243
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:12,825
What do they mean by
"painful punishment"?

244
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,258
[TIRAMY]
Anddd there!

245
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,258
I think I set this thing up
right, mii.

246
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:18,525
[MACARON]
I see the girls‐ron!

247
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:22,091
[MUSE]
FUN!TASY Time, FUN! TASY Fly,

248
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:24,358
FUN!TASY World, oh yeah!

249
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,458
[SEIYA]
[Why] Are they singing karaoke?

250
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:28,458
[ISUZU]
In order to reach the stop
switch...

251
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:31,125
the four of them have to
overcome a series of challenges.

252
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,525
[MUSE]
FUN!TASY Time, FUN! TASY Fly,
FUN! TASY World, oh yeah!

253
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,891
[ISUZU]
The first one is karaoke.

254
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:38,825
[MUSE]
I can always tell when
you've been thinkin'

255
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:41,725
[TIRAMY]
Muse is killin' it‐mii!

256
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,991
[LATIFAH]
At this rate,
they're sure to succeed!

257
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:45,791
[ISUZU]
I'm not so sure.

258
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:46,925
[SEIYA]
Why is that?

259
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,258
Whether or not they pass
is based

260
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:49,625
on the total
of all their scores.

261
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:52,291
Which means that if even one
is a poor singer,

262
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:54,691
the entire
operation will fail.

263
00:10:56,925 --> 00:11:02,158
[KOBORY]
If you're too afraid to go,
there's no way you'll ever know

264
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:07,791
[KOBORY]
It's not hard to learn the
dance, if you take a chance

265
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:13,458
[KOBORY]
Hold on tight to what you love,
like a precious little dove

266
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:20,258
[KOBORY]
It can set you free,
just believe me

267
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:26,125
[MUSE/KOBORY]
It's a wonderful wonderful
wonderful wonderful world
just for you

268
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:28,091
[TIRAMY]
They're surprisingly
good singers!

269
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:31,158
[MACARON]
Yeah! I thought Kobory‐ron
was dull as a wet paper bag.

270
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,391
[SEIYA]
That was uncalled for...

271
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:36,891
[MOFFLE]
Moff, that's a
pretty good score so far.

272
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:42,058
[MUSE/KOBORY]
And it lives
inside of you and me

273
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:46,491
[MUSE/KOBORY]
Catch my heart

274
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:49,225
[MUSE/KOBORY]
FUN!TASY Time, FUN! TASY Fly,

275
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:58,225
[MACARON]
Looks like Sylphy‐ron's up next.

276
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:02,591
[SYLPHY]
Couldn't bear to see you
looking so sad

277
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:07,591
All I wanted was
to take you by the hand

278
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,591
[MACARON]
Hmm... her voice is unique,
but not bad.

279
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:13,725
[ISUZU]
Uniqueness won't get her
a high score.

280
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:17,058
[LATIFAH]
But everything should be alright
if she gets a DECENT score.

281
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:20,591
[LATIFAH]
Let's see how Salama performs.

282
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:25,591
[SALAMA (Badly)]
Hadn't seen you in a while,
but you wouldn't even smile

283
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:29,091
[SALAMA (Badly)]
Made me wanna take that frown,
turn it upside down

284
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,025
[SEIYA]
Oh my god... It's over.

285
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,125
[TIRAMY]
I always wondered why she
never came with us to karaoke

286
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:35,491
but I think I get it now.

287
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:37,058
[LATIFAH]
Poor Salama.

288
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:40,691
They can still make it if she
racks up at least 50 points.

289
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:49,025
[SALAMA (Badly)/SYLPHY]
It's a wonderful wonderful
wonderful wonderful world
just for you

290
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:55,325
[SALAMA (Badly)/SYLPHY]
And just when you think
you've seen it all,
you'll find something new

291
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,058
[SALAMA/KOBORY/MUSE/SYLPHY]
(scream)

292
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:04,291
[SEIYA]
Am I supposed to be able to
see their skeletons?!

293
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:07,558
[ISUZU]
Unfortunately,
they failed the challenge.

294
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:10,591
[MACARON]
Hey look, I think Muse‐ron's
ready to try again.

295
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:15,091
[KOBORY]
Oh no...

296
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,191
I guess we have no choice

297
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,358
but to give it another go.

298
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,891
[SALAMA]
What good will that do?!

299
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:20,025
I'm so sorry you guys‐

300
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,858
I'm just not a good singer.

301
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:28,691
[MUSE]
Don't you worry...

302
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,358
I've got you!

303
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,458
[SALAMA]
(amazed)

304
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:38,591
[MUSE]
Feel the wind and kiss the rain,
let them take away the pain

305
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:44,158
[MUSE]
Think of flowers every day,
or a flame that lights your way

306
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:50,191
[MUSE]
Every miracle here on Earth,
can't you see what they're worth

307
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,758
Your dreams can be reality

308
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:54,791
[SEIYA] Much better.
[LATIFAH] She sings so
beautifully!

309
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:58,391
[MUSE]
If you only believe

310
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:00,425
It's a wonderful wonderful

311
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:03,225
wonderful wonderful world
just for you

312
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:08,991
[MUSE]
And just when you think
you've seen it all,
you'll find something new

313
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:14,658
It's a wonderful wonderful
wonderful wonderful world
don't you see

314
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:19,758
And it lives inside
of you and me

315
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:23,291
Catch my heart!

316
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,491
[SALAMA/KOBORY/MUSE/SYLPHY]
We did it!

317
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:31,891
[SEIYA]
A hundred points?!

318
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:35,225
I knew Muse would be
enough to pull them through!

319
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,725
[SALAMA/MUSE]
(realize)

320
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,758
[SALAMA]
Um... thanks for that.

321
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:43,691
[MUSE]
Oh, sure.

322
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:52,291
[MUSE]
"All four have to dance
to reach 300 points."

323
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,425
Again with the punishment?!

324
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,591
[KOBORY]
Oh no!! Anything but dancing!

325
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,591
[SALAMA]
At least it's not more singing.

326
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:04,791
[MOFFLE]
Interesting, so Kobory's
the weakest link this time.

327
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:07,491
[TIRAMY]
Yeah that girl couldn't dance
if her life depended on it.

328
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:10,625
[SEIYA]
That's too bad since that's
EXACTLY what's happening here.

329
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:18,191
[SYLPHY]
(cheerful)

330
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,125
[SALAMA]
(light efforts)

331
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:21,225

(stumbling)

332
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:25,225
It's moving too fast!
I can't keep up!

(worried)

337
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:53,291

Ha!

338
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:54,191
[SALAMA/SYLPHY]
Hup!

00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,325

Flour of all things?

342
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:06,691
[KOBORY]
I'm so sorry!

343
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,658
[MOFFLE]
Saw that comin' a mile away.

344
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:10,125
[LATIFAH]
But they're working so hard‐

345
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:11,791
this isn't fair at all! (pout)

346
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,558
[SEIYA]
I still don't understand why
an emergency security system

347
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:16,425
needs a goofy entertainment
feature like this.

348
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:19,058
[ISUZU]
Whoever designed this castle
a long time ago

349
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:22,091
seemed to think it was
necessary.

350
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,058
Perhaps they thought
it was appropriate

351
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:25,658
since this is a theme park.

352
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,825

(pant)

357
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:43,691
[KOBORY]
I knew I would fail this...

358
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:46,191
[SYLPHY]
I got your back!

359
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,491
[KOBORY]
(huh?) (look)

360
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:52,525

(giggle)

361
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,658

I sure hope so.

372
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:38,325
[SEIYA]
They managed to get
through another round.

373
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,291
That's interesting.

374
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,225
They've all got different

375
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,091
strengths and weaknesses

376
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:42,591
don't they‐ron?

377
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:44,558
Watching those brave girls put
their heads together

378
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,858
to help each other succeed
is truly touching!

379
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,958
[MOFFLE]
There's still a chance they
could moff up the next round.

380
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:54,925
[MUSE]
"Aim for 300 points

00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:07,958
[MUSE]
(scared)

00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:09,358
[SYLPHY/MUSE/KOBORY/SALAMA]
(impact)

386
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,958
These penalties
are starting to feel lazy.

387
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,425
[TIRAMY]
Muse is the worst typist
I've ever seen‐mii.

388
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:16,958
[MACARON]
But Salama‐ron's
finally found her true calling.

389
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:18,391
[SALAMA]
(focusing)

390
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:19,558
[SALAMA]
Got it!

391
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:23,391
[MUSE]
(painful impact)

392
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:26,791
[MUSE]
(horror)

393
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:31,725
[SALAMA]
(concentrating)

394
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:34,591
[SALAMA]
There!

395
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:36,891
[MUSE/KOBORY]
(flinch)

396
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,058
[KOBORY]
(realize)

397
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:40,158
Wow! look at Salama's points.

398
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:41,125
[MUSE]
(huh?)

399
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:42,458
[KOBORY] She maxed out!

400
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:46,091
[SALAMA]
Aww yeah!

401
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,591
[KOBORY]
We passed! Salama, you saved us!

402
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:48,391
[MUSE] (whimper)

403
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:49,625
[SALAMA] Eh, it was nothing.

404
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:51,758
[KOBORY]
No, really, you were great!

405
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:56,291
[MUSE]
(slapped) (huh?)

406
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,791
[MUSE]
(smile)

407
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:01,525
[MOFFLE]
Tough little moffers
aren't they?

408
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,725
[MACARON]
Everything's so perfect
it's kinda boring.

409
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:07,325
[TIRAMY]
I agree! I would've expected 'em
to give up a long time ago‐mii.

410
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:08,458
[SEIYA]
You guys suck.

411
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:09,925
Well, according to the
manual...

412
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,691
this is the final challenge.

413
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,991
[MUSE]
I guess we're each supposed
to get into one of these pods.

414
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:17,858
[SYLPHY]
(amazed)

415
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,425
[MUSE]
Here goes.

416
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,658
[MUSE]
"Sacrifice"... Huh? (shriek)

417
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:33,258
[KOBORY] (shocked)
[SYLPHY] (huh?)
[SALAMA] (stunned)

418
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:34,458
[KOBORY]
I don't like this at all!

419
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:36,191
The system will prompt each
person

420
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,558
to vote for one of their peers‐

421
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:39,125
and whoever gets the most votes

422
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,791
will fall victim
to a giant drill.

423
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,691
[ISUZU] But wait...
[SEIYA] What is it?

424
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,191
[ISUZU]
If none of the candidates
are voted for more than once,

425
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,791
then all four drills
will be deactivated

426
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,525
and everyone will be
released immediately.

427
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,558
So basically if they all
want to make it out in one piece

428
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:53,291
the safest strategy is for
everybody to vote for themselves

429
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:54,491
as the sacrifice, right?

430
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:55,425
[MOFFLE]
But they can't see each other,

431
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:56,591
so if even one of them

432
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:59,558
betrays the other,
somebody dies.

433
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:02,391
[MUSE]
What should I do?

434
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,458
Choose a sacrifice...

435
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:07,925
Maybe I should choose myself?

436
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,525
Or...

437
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,658
[MUSE]
I should...

438
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:17,325
(sob)

439
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:20,491
Right.

440
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,191
All I want is for the four of us

441
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,991
to stand in the spotlight
together again.

442
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:31,291
[MUSE]
That's why...

443
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,125
[MUSE]
(surprised)

444
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,791

[ALL]
(giggles)

448
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:54,091
[TIRAMY]
Oh! come on
that was a total copout‐mii!

449
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,591
[MACARON]
Yeah! where's the bloodshed‐ron!

450
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:58,525
[MOFFLE]
Shut up, you two,
I'm glad it worked out.

451
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,825
[LATIFAH]
What a beautiful ending this is!

452
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:05,158
[SEIYA]
I guess that sukiyaki
worked its magic after all.

453
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,091
[ISUZU]
They opened up to each other.

454
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:08,591
[SEIYA]
Yeah.

455
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:11,158
Alright, get all cast members
besides the rescue squad

456
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:14,058
over to the castle
so they can fix things up.

457
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:15,858
[SEIYA]
We're about to be busy.

458
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,791
[EIKO]
And so peace was restored
to the enchanted forest.

459
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:25,425
And the miracle brought about
by the four spirits

460
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:28,891
became known as the
Legend of Elementario!

461
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:29,858
[MUSE]
(dance exert)

462
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:30,891

00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,491
[SYLPHY]
(happy)

465
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:36,458
(cheering)

466
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:38,658
[MUSE]
Thank you! everybody!

467
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:40,491
[KOBORY]
We hope you enjoyed
the show today!

468
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,391
[SALAMA]
See ya again soon dudes!

469
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:44,925
[SYLPHY]
Dhanyavadah te!

470
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,153
[ISUZU]
Their show sold out today.

471
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:06,053
The other attractions are
gaining in popularity as well.

472
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:07,553
[LATIFAH]
Wonderful.

473
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:10,953
It seems there may still be
a miracle in store for us.

474
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,353
[ISUZU]
(troubled)

475
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:15,019
[LATIFAH]
Remember, Lady Isuzu...

476
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,153
there's one thing
you mustn't tell Sir Kanie.

477
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,053
[ISUZU]
Of course.

478
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,719
[ISUZU/SEIYA]
Time for the attractions
spotlight.

479
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:58,219
[ISUZU]
I'm sure you're familiar
with Maple Castle now.

480
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,919
Princess Latifah resides here.

481
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:02,819
[SEIYA]
Does it really need all those
extra security features?

482
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,853
[ISUZU]
The king of Maple Land
has a tendency to worry...

483
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:09,919
His life motto has always been
"better safe than sorry."

484
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,486
[SEIYA]
Maybe we can make that alarm
system

485
00:24:11,586 --> 00:24:13,419
into something interesting
for the guests.

486
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,619
[ISUZU]
It costs us 2 million yen
every time it goes off.

487
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:19,153
[SEIYA]
Whoa, nevermind!
