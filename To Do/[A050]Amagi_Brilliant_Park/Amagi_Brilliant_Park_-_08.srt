1
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,172
[ISUZU]
Amagi Transport says
they can add more buses.

2
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:09,905
[ISUZU]
And as for the sports stadium...

3
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,039
I haven't gotten
a definite response yet.

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:14,472
[SEIYA]
Sounds good... Keep it up.

5
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:18,072
[ISUZU]
I did get an answer from Moll
Mart about the‐

6
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:19,205
...other thing.

7
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:20,439
[ISUZU]
Kanie?

8
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:23,972
[SEIYA]
Sorry... I feel kinda dizzy...

9
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,805
[ISUZU]
(scared) Kanie! What's wrong?!

10
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,792
[MUSE]
Mr. Kanie passed out?!

11
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,259
[KOBORY]
What'd the doctor say?

12
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,292
[ISUZU]
Probably just exhaustion
mixed with a cold.

13
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,559
[MUSE]
Good, that's not too serious.

14
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,525
[KOBORY] We'd be in trouble if
he had to go to the hospital.
[SYLPHY] Nice poker face!

15
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,759
[SYLPHY] I'm stuck...

16
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:15,392
[MUSE]
I wonder if we can help him.

17
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:18,459
[MUSE]
I know! I could keep him
hydrated with my water spells!

18
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:20,992
[SALAMA]
And I'll keep him warm with my
fire.

19
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:23,259
[KOBORY]
And I'll bury him
to leech out the poison.

20
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:24,659
[SALAMA] I don't think that'll
work for a cold...

21
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,359
[SYLPHY] Whoa! I'm not worthy!

22
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,825
[LATIFAH]
I'm sorry, I won't let you.

23
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:31,659
[SEIYA]
But it's just a little cold.
The paperwork's piling up‐

24
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,992
[LATIFAH]
Absolutely not‐

25
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:34,325
I command you to remain at home

26
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:36,292
until you've made a complete
recovery.

27
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:39,425
[SEIYA]
Let me guess‐ you're not gonna
let me go to school either.

28
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,192
[LATIFAH]
Sir Kanie.

29
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:44,225
Do not underestimate
the importance of your health.

30
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:49,025
[SEIYA]
(watching)

31
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,525
I hope you feel better soon...

32
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,625
Now get some rest.

33
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,692
[SEIYA]
Well that's great...

34
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,492
[ISUZU]
How are you feeling, Kanie?

35
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:09,259
[SEIYA]
Hey Sento.

36
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,825
[SEIYA]
Look, could you please tell
that princess of yours

37
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,125
not to worry so much?

38
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:17,959
[SEIYA]
Hold on... What's that
weird thing on your head?

39
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:20,459
[ISUZU]
Just ignore it.

40
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,392
[SEIYA]
I've missed a lot of
school days already.

41
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:24,559
I can't afford to take
any more ti‐

42
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,825
[SEIYA]
S‐Sento?!

43
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:28,825
[SEIYA]
Hey! (nervous)

44
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,825
[ISUZU]
I want to be more than
just your secretary‐ Kanie...

45
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:34,659
[SEIYA]
Whoa, I think this summer heat's
getting to your head!

46
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,292
[ISUZU] Don't pull away.
[SEIYA] (extended awkwardness)

47
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:39,392
[ISUZU]
I need to tell you...
I... I want you...

48
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:43,859
[TIRAMY]
Just kidding‐ it was me
all along mii!

49
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:44,859
[MACARON]
You sucker‐ron!

50
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,859
[SEIYA]
What the...?

51
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,125
[TIRAMY]
(chortling)

52
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:48,859
[SEIYA]
How did you...

53
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,259
[TIRAMY/MACARON]
(explode into laughter)

54
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:52,425
[TIRAMY]
It's a magic Isuzu costume!

55
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:58,025
[MACARON]
Yeah, we modified it from
the ones they use in the
Diggery Clan‐ron!

56
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,459
[SEIYA]
That's messed up.

57
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:00,992
[TIRAMY]
Well at least now you don't have
to worry

58
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:02,259
about missing your classes‐mii!

59
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:04,359
[SEIYA]
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

60
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,325
You guys want to make
a costume of me and go to my‐

61
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:09,059
[MACARON]
Mhm! That's right‐ we wanna go
to school in your place!

62
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,759
[TIRAMY]
It's a pretty complete
prototype.

63
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,325
Unfortunately‐ we weren't
able to get an exact reference

64
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:14,792
for the parts underneath
the clothes...

65
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:17,392
so we used our
imaginations‐mii!

66
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,359
[MACARON/TIRAMY]
(realize)

67
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,859
[TIRAMY]
Oh... when'd you get here Isuzu?

68
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,725
[MACARON/TIRAMY]
(trembling)

69
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:29,693
[MOFFLE]
Moff... I don't think
it's a bad idea.

70
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:31,593
I mean‐ what else
are you gonna do?

71
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:34,259
It's not like you have
any friends.
[SEIYA] (offended)

72
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,259
[MOFFLE]
It'll be fine
if they keep quiet.

73
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,293
[SEIYA]
(annoyed) (stunned) Ugh...

74
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:38,593
[ISUZU]
Then it's settled.

75
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:44,059
[GIRL]
Oh, I know. What about
spaghetti?

76
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,893
[ISUZU]
What an amazing item...

77
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,993
It's exactly like the original.

78
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:48,793
(incoming stampede)

79
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:50,026
[SEIYA]
(gasp)

80
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:53,026
[BRAT A/BRAT B/BRAT C]
Wahoo! Heh heh!

81
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,393
[BRAT A]
Jackpot!

82
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:55,293
I smell a girl!

83
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:56,426
[BRAT A/BRAT B/BRAT C]
(menacing)

84
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:57,593
[BRAT A/BRAT B/BRAT C]
(MENACING)

85
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:58,759
[SEIYA]
(gulp)

86
00:04:58,859 --> 00:04:59,893
[BRAT C]
False alarm.

87
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:02,093
[BRAT A/BRAT B/BRAT C]
(cackling)

88
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:03,026
[SEIYA]
(relieved)

89
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:04,059
[SHIINA]
K... Kanie?

90
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:05,093
[SEIYA]
(startled)

91
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,593
[SHIINA]
Good morning, sir!

92
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:08,893
I heard you passed out from a
cold recently and um...

93
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,293
Wait. what's that?

94
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,559
[SEIYA] (like Isuzu) G‐good
morning, Miss Chujo...

95
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,359
It's nothing.

96
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:13,326
[SHIINA]
What?

97
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,893
Ah, I mean,
good morning, Chujo...

98
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:17,559
And yeah, I'm not sick anymore.

99
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:18,826
Oh...

100
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:21,093
Anyway do I look nice
and handsome today?

101
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:23,359
[SHIINA]
I'm not sure how to respond
to that...

102
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,393
But you seem like you're in a
good mood!

103
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:26,726
[SEIYA] You think so?
[SHIINA] Yeah...

104
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,826
I mean, most of the time

105
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:29,359
you just kind of ignore me.

106
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:34,093
[SHIINA]
So I... I'm uh... I'm happy, I
guess!(turn away)

107
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:36,526
[ISUZU]
Goodness...

108
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:39,559
Kanie must really
treat that girl poorly.

109
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,259
[SEIYA]
Hm?

110
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:53,159
(reading)
"I've liked you ever
since my first year.

111
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,059
No matter what people
say about you,

112
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,193
I can tell you're
a really nice person.

113
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:58,926
If it isn't too much trouble,

114
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,993
I'd like you to meet me
behind the gymnasium

115
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,393
after school this afternoon.

116
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:05,559
Please give me the chance to
tell you how I feel"?!

117
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:09,193
[TEACHER]
(drones on lesson under)

118
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:10,759
[ISUZU]
What should I do?

119
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:13,526
I thought of texting Kanie
to see what he thinks about it,

120
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:18,093
but he's still resting
and I'd hate to bother him.

121
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:20,693
[TEACHER]
This concept is sure to be on
your test.

122
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,126
[SEIYA]
It was a mistake?

123
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:24,993
[KANAE]
Yeah, I could've sworn that
shoebox

124
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,026
belonged to Kimura
from class 2‐5.

125
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:31,959
So I never meant for that love
letter to go to you.

126
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,859
Um... what's that on your head?

127
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,893
[SEIYA]
Just ignore it.

128
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:35,959
Uh, so what you're saying is

129
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,359
you're not in love with Kanie...

130
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,593
I mean, so I'm not the guy
you're in love with huh?

131
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:44,259
[KANAE]
No... I guess you're upset...
I really am sorry about this!

132
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:46,259
[SEIYA] It's quite alright.
[KANAE] Huh?

133
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,926
[SEIYA]
Everyone makes mistakes
sometimes.

134
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:48,959
You didn't sign the letter,

135
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,026
so you could've just run away

136
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:51,293
when you realized what happened,

137
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:52,426
but you went out of your way

138
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:53,893
to apologize and
set things right.

139
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,393
That was very professional.

140
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:56,959
[KANAE]
Does that mean you forgive me?

141
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:58,959
There's nothing to forgive
you for...

142
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:00,393
Thanks for being considerate.

143
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,726
[KANAE]
(happy) Wow, thank you so much,
Kanie.

144
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,359
When I realized what I had done,

145
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,693
I was so afraid you were going
to yell at me or something.

146
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,359
[SEIYA]
It's fine... In fact...

147
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,926
I wish you the best in all your
endeavors, Miss Kanae Tsuchida.

148
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:14,926
[KANAE]
You know... I'm kind of happy
I misplaced that letter.

149
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:15,859
[SEIYA]
(confused)

150
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,393
Well, goodbye for now!

151
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:21,693
[SEIYA]
"For now"?

152
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:23,693
[MACARON]
So you didn't have any
major issues?

153
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:26,193
[ISUZU]
No, there was nothing worth
reporting...

154
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:28,126
I hope you'll be as
successful tomorrow.

155
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:31,126
[MACARON]
Ah high school...
so many memories‐ron!

156
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:35,059
I don't suppose you've ever
heard of Dokidoki Melody High
School in Maple Land?

157
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,426
It's super‐famous for being full
of troublemakers‐ron.

158
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:39,959
[ISUZU]
Yes, I'm always hearing about
violent incidents.

159
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,659
[MACARON]
I was top sheep back in the day.
Got expelled halfway through,
though.

160
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,593
We had a little scrap with some
guys from another school
so they gave me the boot‐

161
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:49,626
[ISUZU] I'm not interested.
[MACARON] Oh. Well.

162
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:51,893
[ISUZU]
Just try not to cause any
problems.

163
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,259
[MACARON]
Don't worry about me.

164
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,626
I can blend right in
with those youngsters‐ron.

165
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:59,059
[SEIYA]
(relaxing)

166
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,226
[TEACHER]
Ah... Listen, son...

167
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:05,893
You can't do that in class...
and what's that on your head?

168
00:08:05,993 --> 00:08:08,926
[SEIYA]
Just ignore it and focus on
doing your job, old man.

169
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,693
[TEACHER]
Wh... what did you say?!

170
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:12,693
[SEIYA]
You're such a drag‐ron!

171
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:13,459
[TEACHER]
(startled)

172
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,059
S‐stay back!

173
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:16,426
I don't want to fi‐(speechless)

174
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:18,793
[SEIYA]
Hey teach...
I'm not feelin' so good,

175
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:20,693
so I'm gonna go see
the nurse now.

176
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:21,826
See ya.

177
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:23,026
[TEACHER]
Huh?

178
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,226
[SHIINA]
Um, is that you, Mr. Kanie?

179
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:33,226
[SEIYA]
Hm? Oh... it's you‐ron.

180
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:35,126
[SHIINA]
You‐ron? I don't‐

181
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:37,659
[SEIYA]
I forgot you were my
classmate‐ron.

182
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,793
[SHIINA]
What?

183
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,293
[SEIYA]
Lunchtime already, huh?

184
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:41,693
Man, this place is so boring

185
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:43,159
I can't even smoke a cigarette.

186
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,259
I don't know how much I can take
before I snap.

187
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,493
[SHIINA]
Did you say "snap"?

188
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,426
[SEIYA]
Hey, wanna skip class with me?

189
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,626
I'm gonna go play some
pachinko later.

190
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:51,659
[SHIINA]
(shock)

191
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,726
N‐no thanks, I'm good, bye!

192
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,126
Jeez, was it something I said?

193
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:59,259
[KIMURA]
What do you mean, mistake?

194
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:01,693
[KIMURA]
Terano told me you were planning
to give me a letter...

195
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:03,193
What happened to that?

196
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,526
[KANAE]
I was going to...

197
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,593
but now I can't figure out
my true feelings.

198
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:09,793
[KANAE]
I'm having trouble deciding if
that's what I really want to do.

199
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:11,226
[KIMURA]
But how can you say that?!

200
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:12,393
If you had asked me out,

201
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,326
I would've said yes in a
heartbeat!

202
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:17,359
[KANAE]
I know, but things have
changed...

203
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,193
[MACARON]
They could use some love advice
from yours truly‐ron.

204
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,826
[SEIYA]
Take it easy there, son.

205
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:22,693
[KANAE/KIMURA]
(surprised)

206
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:23,959
[KANAE]
Kanie?!

207
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:25,459
[KIMURA]
Were you spying on us?!

208
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,526
[SEIYA]
Oh, don't have a cow, ron.

209
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:28,593
[KIMURA]
"Ron"?

210
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,059
[SEIYA]
I mean, uh...(ahem)

211
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,593
Take it from me kid,

212
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:34,026
the harder you chase after
a lady the faster she runs away.

213
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:36,393
You just gotta be cool...
Better to step aside

214
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,993
and let her collect her
thoughts for a while

215
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:40,026
than make an ass of
yourself‐ron... Understand?

216
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,193
[KIMURA]
Who asked you?!
And what's that?!

217
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:43,359
[SEIYA]
Just ignore it.

218
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,993
[KIMURA]
I don't need advice from

219
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:46,826
the guy who got Tsuchida's
love letter by mistake!

220
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,293
[SEIYA]
Huh?!

221
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:50,659
[KIMURA]
She had her eye on me
in the first place,

222
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,126
and then THIS had
to happen!

223
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,793
You're the last person
I want to talk to about this,

224
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:55,726
you got that?!

225
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:56,859
[SEIYA]
Wait a sec...

226
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,659
Did you say she gave
ME a letter?

227
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,026
[KANAE]
Y‐yes.

228
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:01,726
I wasn't trying to make
you guys fight over me

229
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:03,059
or anything bad like that...

230
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,926
but you were just so
nice to me...

231
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:08,059
and now I can't decide
who I like!

232
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,626
I don't remember any of this
from the report.

233
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:11,626
[KIMURA] (ggh!)
[SEIYA] Maybe it happened a
while ago...

234
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:14,293
Why are you trying to pretend
like you don't remember?!

235
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:15,626
What, are you making fun of me?!

236
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:16,926
[SEIYA]
Don't be silly.

237
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:18,393
I would never make
fun of you, buddy‐ron.

238
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,259
[KIMURA]
It sure as heck sounds
like you are to me!

239
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:23,659
I'm heartbroken... You jerk...
You're gonna pay!

240
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,393
[MACARON]
Too slow! I could easily
beat this guy‐ggh!

241
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:30,326
[KIMURA]
(look)Huh?

242
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:32,326
Huh... That was a pretty
good punch,

243
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,426
but it's still kinda flimsy
if you ask me.

244
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:38,726
You're never gonna knock out the
king of Doki‐Melo High with an
arm like that.

245
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:40,059
[KIMURA]
Uh, Kanie...

246
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,059
[SEIYA]
What's up?

247
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,826
Your head is sort of uh...

248
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:44,959
[SEIYA]
Hm? Oh jeez, you're right.

249
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:46,593
[KIMURA]
(horrified)

250
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,693
[SEIYA]
Anyway, what was I
just talking about?

251
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:50,793
[KIMURA]
(scream)

252
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,026
[SEIYA]
See ya...

253
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:54,093
[KANAE]
Um, are you sure you're okay?

254
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:55,859
[SEIYA]
Oh, yeah I'm alright...

255
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,326
Just really flexible, is all.

256
00:10:57,426 --> 00:11:00,159
[KANAE]
I‐I guess that makes sense...
Good to hear.

257
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,093
[MACARON]
This girl's got serious issues

258
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:04,593
if she's willing to
believe that.

259
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:05,859
[KANAE]
I'm sorry, Kanie.

260
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,626
You didn't do anything to
deserve that.

261
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:08,826
Don't sweat it...

262
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:10,526
Everybody makes mistakes,
don't they?

263
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:11,359
[KANAE]
But I...

264
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,726
Look honey‐ron,

265
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:14,926
I learned a lot about this kinda
thing from being divorced...

266
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:16,293
[KANAE]
D... divorced?!

267
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:18,126
[SEIYA]
It's always better
if you can have

268
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:20,459
a third party
for your arguments.

269
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,093
If it's just the two of you
fighting about it,

270
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,793
you tend to get emotional and
not solve anything.

271
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,693
[KANAE]
Oh...
[SEIYA] Find a friend
both of you trust

272
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:31,026
and discuss everything over
coffee or something like that.

273
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:32,926
You're less likely
to lose your cool

274
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,193
in front of a friend. Bye!

275
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,326
[KANAE] One more thing, Kanie!
[SEIYA] Hm?

276
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:39,459
That could've been really bad if
you hadn't stepped in like that.

277
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,093
Thank you so much!

278
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:42,793
Don't bow... It makes
you look weak

279
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,259
and you're a lot stronger
than that.

280
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:47,993
[KANAE]
(gasp) Right!

281
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:49,459
[ISUZU]
You didn't have any
catastrophes then?

282
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,459
Well, I did have a few hiccups
here and there,

283
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,193
but I don't think it was
anything worth getting
concerned about.

284
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:55,859
[TIRAMY]
Tomorrow's my turn!

285
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,459
This really takes me back
to my days

286
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,359
at Wakuwaku Garden
High School‐mii!

287
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,393
[MACARON]
Oh wow, Tiramy‐ron, I had no
idea

288
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:03,426
you went to such a
competitive high school!

289
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:05,093
[ISUZU]
If I remember correctly,

290
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,359
that school had some kind of
explosion years ago.

291
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,426
Yeah that may or may not
have been me‐mii.

292
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:11,993
[TIRAMY] I was in the science
club back then,
[SALAMA] So how's the boss?

293
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:13,659
[TIRAMY] I was in the science
club back then,
[MUSE] Princess won't let him
come back to work.

294
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,693
[MUSE] Princess won't let him
come back to work.

295
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,426
[TIRAMY] But I didn't know
how strong it was,
[SALAMA/MUSE/KOBORY] Uhh...

296
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:20,659
and it sorta blew the whole
building to kingdom come.

297
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,059
I felt pretty bad about it
when it happened‐(ggh!)

298
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,326
[ISUZU]
It doesn't sound like you felt
bad enough.

299
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:27,259
[MACARON]
That's an interesting story,
Tiramy.

300
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,926
[ISUZU]
Don't encourage him. You'd
better hope you don't blow up

301
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:30,959
Kanie's school or else.

302
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,359
[TIRAMY]
Don't worry, I know

303
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,240
exactly how to think like
a high school boy‐mii!

304
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,195
[TIRAMY]
Hot damn!

305
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:54,261
This place is just crawling with
cute girls in miniskirts!

306
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:57,595
[SEIYA]
Ahhh, how'm I gonna behave
myself‐mii?

307
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:59,228
[KANAE]
Um, Kanie?

308
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:00,061
[SEIYA]
Mii?

309
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:01,295
[KANAE]
Um...

310
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:04,161
I was hoping I could have
a little chat with you.

311
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,361
[KANAE]
Do you mind?

312
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:09,528
[SEIYA]
Yes please!

313
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:10,961
[KANAE]
S‐sure...

314
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,661
[TIRAMY]
YES! Yes yes yes yes YES!

315
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,161
Attaboy, Kanie!

316
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:23,461
I never knew you were friends
with such a gorgeous babe!

317
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,828
I'm gonna bag her for sure‐mii!

318
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:27,428
[SEIYA]
Let me ask you something.

319
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:28,961
[KANAE]
Yes?

320
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:32,295
[SEIYA]
Your name... what is it?

321
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,328
[KANAE]
(gasp)

322
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:34,928
My name's Kanae Tsuchida...

323
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:37,295
[KANAE]
How could you forget already?

324
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:38,861
[SEIYA]
Aw, I didn't forget it!

325
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:41,428
I just like to hear you say it
with your sexy voice‐mii.

326
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:42,661
[KANAE]
"Mii"?

327
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,261
[SEIYA]
Yeah you. Now say it again...

328
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,628
What's your name?

329
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,528
[KANAE]
Kanae... Tsuchida.

330
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:52,428
[SEIYA]
Yeah... that was beautiful...
I wanna hear it again!

331
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:54,128
[KANAE]
Stop teasing me, Kanie!

332
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:56,961
[SEIYA]
(giggle) No way... How could I
possibly stop teasing you

333
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:59,361
when you're just so deliciously
cute‐mii?

334
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:00,428
[KANAE]
(surprised)

335
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:02,595
Come on... Follow mii.

336
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:04,228
[KANAE]
The stairway?

337
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:05,228
[SEIYA]
Hehehe...

338
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:06,328
I wanna go someplace quiet

339
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,495
so I can tease you more.

340
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:09,728
[KANAE]
Huh?

341
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,661
[SEIYA]
No need to be scared‐mii...

342
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:14,328
I'll hold your hand every step
of the way, okay?

343
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:15,495
[KANAE]
(shy)

344
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:17,328
[TIRAMY]
Damn, that was easy, mii!

345
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:20,495
This costume is gonna come in
real handy from now on!

346
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:21,595
[SHIINA]
Mr. Kanie?

347
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,461
[SEIYA]
Mii?

348
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,728
Oh... Hey Shiina.

349
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,228
[SHIINA]
Um, who is she?

350
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:28,695
Come on, do I really have to
spell it out for you‐mii?

351
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:31,361
Me and this cutie are about to
get busy!

352
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:32,361
[KANAE]
K‐Kanie!

353
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:34,195
[SEIYA]
Trust mii.

354
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:35,128
[SEIYA]
(blow)

355
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:36,128
[KANAE]
(flustered)

356
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:37,461
Sorry babe...

357
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:39,895
You're just gonna have to wait
in line for the next ti‐Mii!

358
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:43,061
That's gross! How can you talk
like that?!

359
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:44,228
You'll be sorry.

360
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:47,595
I'm telling Miss Sento!

361
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:49,561
[SEIYA]
Shiina's acting weird today‐mii.

362
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:51,761
[KANAE]
Kanie, how do you know
that girl?

363
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:53,895
[SEIYA]
She's just some chick
I work with‐mii.

364
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:56,161
Anyway, I think we're alone now
so why don't you‐

365
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:57,695
[SEIYA]
What now‐mii?

366
00:14:57,795 --> 00:14:59,528
[KANAE]
I don't know what to think of
you saying "mii"

367
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:00,895
every 10
seconds like that, Kanie.

368
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:02,995
[SEIYA]
Who cares‐mii?...
Now come over here

369
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:04,895
and let me show you the
meaning of pleasure‐mii!

370
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,061
[KANAE]
What kind of relationship
do you have with her?

371
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:11,961
Plus, isn't Sento that quiet
girl who's been really
friendly with you lately?

372
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:13,995
Does that make me
girlfriend number 3?

373
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:16,961
[SEIYA]
Listen baby, the whole thing's
pretty complicated, alright?

374
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:19,295
[KANAE]
You've been acting really weird
these past couple of days...

375
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:22,728
I'm starting to get the idea
you mess around with girls'
hearts all the time.

376
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:25,028
And I just thought you were more
trustworthy than that.

377
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:28,761
[SEIYA]
I AM trustworthy! I promise I can
be faithful‐mii!

378
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,228
[KANAE]
Okay... Then what's my name?

379
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:32,395
[SEIYA]
Ah...

380
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:33,795
Uh...

381
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:35,795
It's uh... Sanae!

382
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:38,295
[KANAE]
I'm going home.

383
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,861
[SEIYA]
(sob)But I was so close...

384
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:41,761
Mii...

385
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:43,661
[ISUZU]
Nothing happened at all?

386
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,628
You're sure?

387
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:46,128
Something almost happened,

388
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,561
but rest assured,
absolutely nothing happened.

389
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:49,561
[ISUZU]
Well that's good.

390
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:50,761
You're next, Lord Moffle.

391
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:52,228
[MOFFLE]
High school...

392
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,328
That sure brings back memories.

393
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,328
I went to a strict
boarding school

394
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,495
called Fuwafuwa
Military Academy.

395
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:00,161
[MOFFLE]
The upperclassmen were all so‐

396
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,628
[ISUZU] I've heard enough.
[MOFFLE] Moff?

397
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,228
Just get through it
with no trouble.

398
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:10,028
[SEIYA]
What the moff is going on?

399
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:13,261
[ISUZU]
I don't know. They just asked us
to meet them here.

400
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:14,661
[TERANO]
Kanie and Sento...

401
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:15,995
I heard one of my classmates

402
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,095
got her feelings hurt
by you two jerks.

403
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:20,295
And what's that weird thing
on your head?

404
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:21,795
Moff‐ just ignore it...

405
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,828
Anyway, I don't understand
what you're mad about‐

406
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:24,928
[TERANO]
Don't play dumb!

407
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,361
[KANAE]
It's okay Terano,

408
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,661
it really doesn't
bother me that much.

409
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:28,828
[YAMAMOTO]
Doesn't bother you?

410
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:29,861
I thought you said this guy

411
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:30,861
tried to put the moves on you

412
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:32,395
in the stairwell yesterday!

413
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:35,295
[SASAKI]
That Sento girl and
some first‐year named Chujo

414
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,028
are both Kanie's girlfriends.

415
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:39,095
They worked together
to break your heart!

416
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:41,928
[KANAE]
But I... but I never said that!

417
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:43,828
[TERANO]
But that's pretty much what
happened.

418
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:47,295
[ISUZU]
That's ridiculous! I swear upon
the Goddess Libra that

419
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:49,428
Kanie and I have done no such
thing to this girl!

420
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:53,028
And you expect me to believe
that? Besides, who's Libra?

421
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:55,595
[ISUZU]
If you wish to behold
the wrath of Libra,

422
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,195
then I'll show it to you.

423
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:58,528
[TERANO]
What are you doing?

424
00:16:58,628 --> 00:17:00,128
[SEIYA] Hold it‐moff.
[ISUZU] Are you sure?

425
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,928
[TERANO]
What's with the "moff" thing?

426
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:03,561
[SEIYA] Let me handle this.
[TERANO] Whatever, I don't care.

427
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:05,595
just hurry up and apologize to
Kanae. right now!

428
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:07,261
[SEIYA] I'm sorry.
[TERANO] (shocked)

429
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,128
[MOFFLE]
Eh, moff, who cares about
the kid's pride, anyway?

430
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:12,195
[TERANO]
No way. I want you to grovel!

431
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:13,695
[SEIYA]
Okay... how's this?

432
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:14,595
[TERANO]
Too easy!

433
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:15,928
Where's your pride?

434
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:17,895
Don't you dare talk to her
ever again!

435
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,595
[SEIYA]
As moff as my witness.

436
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,461
From the bottom of my heart,
I really do apologize.

437
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:23,961
[KANAE]
No... wait...

438
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:25,928
[TERANO]
I'm starting to think
he's making fun of us.

439
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,861
[SEIYA]
No, I honestly feel bad
about it.

440
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:30,261
[TERANO]
Yeah right. you're just saying
whatever you have to say!

441
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:33,161
You obviously don't care
about this poor girl's
feelings for you!

442
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,728
[TERANO]
I mean nothing you've said
or done has had a shred of
sincerity to it!

443
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:38,961
It's like you knocked it off
from a TV show!

444
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,128
<snap!>

445
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,028
[SEIYA] You...

446
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,495
[SASAKI] (hm?)
[YAMAMOTO] (huh?)

447
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,161
You just said the worst
possible thing.

448
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,361
[TERANO]
Huh?

449
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:47,595
[ISUZU]
Hearing the word "knock‐off"

450
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:48,895
is extremely
problematic for him.

451
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:50,695
I have had enough of
you arrogant bitches

452
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:51,828
and your bullshit!

453
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,228
[TERANO/SASAKI/YAMAMOTO]
(stunned)

454
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:55,028
Running your mouths
about love and sincerity...

455
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:57,795
You can't just throw those words
around like they're nothing!

456
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,328
You're a bunch of kids!

457
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:00,828
Don't make me laugh.

458
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:02,895
you three don't know the first
moffin' thing about love!

459
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:04,761
[ISUZU]
Please don't get upset,
Lord Moffle.

460
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:06,428
[SEIYA]
You date some boy
you barely know,

461
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:07,795
you think you're in love,

462
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:10,328
then you complain about
heartbreak afterwards?!

463
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:12,061
You think life's that easy?!

464
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:13,628
[SEIYA]
What, does it make you feel cool

465
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:15,895
to pretend to be angry for
your friend's sake,

466
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:16,528
is that it?

467
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,595
You're full of it!

468
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:18,695
[TERANO/YAMAMOTO/SASAKI]
(gasp)

469
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,428
[TERANO]
(stunned)Whoa!

470
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:24,695
[SEIYA]
When the pain is bad enough

471
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:26,161
to make you wish
you were dead...

472
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,995
THAT... THAT'S what love is!

473
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:30,828
Wait 'til the woman you've
loved for over ten years

474
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:32,695
gets married to some
bastard you hate!

475
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:35,661
You can't even imagine the agony
I felt that day!

476
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,128
[SEIYA]
And then ten years later,

477
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:39,328
she comes and asks me to take
care of her daughter?

478
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:40,861
Do you know how that feels?!

479
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:42,861
[ISUZU] (surprised)
[SEIYA] No! Because you're
children!

480
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:44,295
[ISUZU]
Wait a minute sir.

481
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:46,161
Is this in reference to
Princess Latifah's mother?

482
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,528
[SEIYA]
Shut the moff up,
it's hypothetical!

483
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,861
[TERANO]
What's his problem?!

484
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,795
[SASAKI]
Yeah. he's really creeping
me out.

485
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,461
[YAMAMOTO]
And what does "moff" mean?

486
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:54,661
[KIMURA]
Stop it, guys!

487
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:55,961
[SASAKI/YAMAMOTO/TERANO]
(surprised)

488
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:57,561
[KANAE]
Kimura!

489
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,061
[KIMURA]
I'm sorry...

490
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,628
The only reason Kanie acted
like that was for my sake!

491
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:03,028
[ALL]
Huh?!

492
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:04,495
[KIMURA]
He said all those crazy things

493
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:05,695
and acted like a scumbag
on purpose

494
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:07,728
to make Tsuchida hate his guts!

495
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:11,095
That way maybe she'd
want to be with me instead!

496
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:12,295
[KIMURA]
Right, Kanie?

497
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:14,395
[SEIYA]
I what...? Uhhh, yeah...

498
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:15,861
[KIMURA]
When I asked Kanie for advice

499
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,961
about how to patch everything up
with Tsuchida...

500
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:20,928
he had a plan...
He said the only way to get
things back to normal

501
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,961
was to make her not
like him anymore.

502
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,928
I know this mess ended up making
me look bad too...

503
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:28,895
But I swear I'll try really hard
to be the best guy for you.

504
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:31,095
[KIMURA]
So do you think maybe
you could give me a chance?

505
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:34,361
[KANAE]
O‐okay... If you're sure that's
what you want too.

506
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:35,695
[TERANO]
Well then if the two of you

507
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:37,395
don't have anything left to be
upset over...

508
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:39,328
I guess I have nothing to say.

509
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,361
[KIMURA]
Awesome!...

510
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:41,828
Thank you for understanding!

511
00:19:41,928 --> 00:19:46,961
[KIMURA]
It's nice to have friends,
huh?(big laughter)

512
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:52,328
[SEIYA] (unzipping)
Thanks for the
heads‐up, Chujo...

513
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,995
It all worked out,
thanks to you.

514
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:57,061
[SHIINA]
Sure... I knew something weird
must be going on...

515
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:00,728
It's a good thing I was able to
get in contact with you.

516
00:20:00,828 --> 00:20:02,061
[SEIYA]
I appreciate it.

517
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,961
[SEIYA]
Hopefully I can figure out a way

518
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:05,995
to explain all this
to Kimura later.

519
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:09,161
[SHIINA]
I'm surprised you didn't get mad
at Mr. Moffle and the other two.

520
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,795
You almost made a lot of enemies
because of this mess.

521
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:13,761
[SEIYA]
Nah... I'm not mad...

522
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,395
Either way, those idiots only
did it

523
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:16,961
because they wanted to
help me out.

524
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:19,428
[SEIYA]
How could I be mad at that?

525
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:20,261
[SHIINA]
(smile)

526
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:21,261
[SEIYA]
What?

527
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,161
[SHIINA]
Oh it's nothing.

528
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:23,528
I was just thinking

529
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:25,595
how you reacted the way
I expected you would.

530
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,495
[SEIYA]
Huh?

531
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:28,095
It's no big deal...

532
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,295
I gotta go!

533
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:37,228
[SEIYA]
Sento. you made it.

534
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:38,595
[LATIFAH]
(happy)

535
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,495
It's good to see that you're
back on the job...

536
00:20:40,595 --> 00:20:42,895
I take it you've fully
recovered then.

537
00:20:42,995 --> 00:20:44,661
[LATIFAH]
Look at this, Lady Isuzu...

538
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:46,928
Sir Kanie is very
peculiar!(giggle)

539
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:48,461
[ISUZU]
Did something happen?

540
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:49,928
[LATIFAH]
Just look at the way

541
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:51,861
he tries his best to preserve
the strawberry on top

542
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,428
until the last possible moment!

543
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:55,761
[SEIYA]
(surprised)What? is that weird?

544
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:58,928
You appear to be healthy enough
to return to school tomorrow.

545
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:00,928
Oh yeah. I'm perfectly fine
now...

546
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:02,928
Sorry for the trouble. Sento.

547
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,395
[ISUZU]
No... I probably wasn't of very
much help to you in the end.

548
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:09,695
In fact, I may have caused YOU
trouble.

549
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:13,061
Well, you can fill me in
later... Are you hungry?

550
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:15,261
[LATIFAH]
Yes, we have croquettes!

551
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,628
[ISUZU]
Thank you.

552
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:17,895
[LATIFAH]
Speaking of which,

553
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:19,695
I've thought of a
new croquette recipe!

554
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:21,595
[LATIFAH]
If I add sugar to the batter...

555
00:21:21,695 --> 00:21:22,995
they'll be even more appealing

556
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:25,261
to visitors with a sweet tooth
won't they?

557
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:27,561
[SEIYA]
Sounds good... I think the
Maple Kitchen

558
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,995
could benefit from
a new menu item.

559
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:30,695
[LATIFAH]
Then would it be alright if you

560
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:32,661
sampled the new recipe to make
sure it's perfect

561
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:34,161
before we serve it to the
guests?

562
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:36,628
[SEIYA]
Oh I get it.
So I'm a guinea pig now.

563
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,561
[LATIFAH] Oh no...!
I didn't mean it that way!

564
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:40,461
[SEIYA]
(laugh) It's fine.

565
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:43,528
[LATIFAH]
Then I'll go ahead and make a
few first thing in the morning.

566
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:44,595
[SEIYA]
Can't wait to try 'em.

567
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:45,695
[LATIFAH]
Perfect!

568
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:47,695
I'm sure you'll like them.

569
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,195
[MUSE]
(determined)

570
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:14,629
[MUSE]
(exert) Haaa! Agghh!

571
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:19,895
[MUSE]
It's not good enough!

572
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:54,595
[ISUZU/SEIYA]
Time for the
attractions spotlight.

573
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:56,729
[ISUZU]
Today's feature is Save the
Earth.

574
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:59,795
It's a fun‐filled presentation
about Earth science.

575
00:23:59,895 --> 00:24:02,062
[SEIYA]
Oh okay, so it's like a
documentary type thing?

576
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:05,529
[ISUZU]
Sort of. The audience
experiences a lengthy lecture

577
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:06,429
from Future the globe

578
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,762
about the many ways

579
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:09,962
in which humanity destroys
our precious planet.

580
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:12,262
[SEIYA]
That doesn't sound fun at all.

581
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:13,695
[ISUZU]
And then after the show,

582
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:15,829
he demands a 2,000 yen donation
from each visitor.

583
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:18,129
[SEIYA]
We should shut that down!
