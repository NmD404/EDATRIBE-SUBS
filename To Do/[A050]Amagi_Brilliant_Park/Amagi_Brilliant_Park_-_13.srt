1
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:17,096
[EIKO]
Come meet the lovable mascot
characters from Maple Land,

2
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:18,296
the kingdom of dreams!

3
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:20,496
[EIKO]
Where fairy tales come to life!

4
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:21,963
[GAL A/GAL B]
(laughing)

5
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:26,096
[EIKO]
With so many great
attractions...

6
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:29,063
there's always something fun
for the whole family!

7
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,896
[BOY C] Yeah!
[GIRL B] (happy)

8
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:32,196
[GIRL C/GIRL D]
(happy jumping)

9
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:34,230
[EIKO]
The memories will
last a lifetime.

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,263
[GIRL E] Yum!(chomp)
[TODDLER A] (big bite)

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,696
[EIKO]
So plan your visit to
Amagi Brilliant Park today!

12
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:58,130
[TRIKEN]
So what do you think of it?

13
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,196
I wanted this promotional video
to be perfect

14
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:02,630
so I poured my blood sweat
and tears into it.

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,830
[SEIYA]
It's okay...
Not bad, but not good either.

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,096
Actually, the whole thing
is pretty bland.

17
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:10,530
[TRIKEN]
So you don't like it?

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,063
[SEIYA]
No, not at all...

19
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:13,496
It looks like you created

20
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,963
a visual representation of your
boring personality.

21
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:17,330
[TRIKEN]
(frown)

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,296
[SEIYA]
I see this happen a lot.

23
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:24,530
All the fundamentals are there,
but it still puts me to sleep.

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,430
[SEIYA]
To be totally frank,
the product is boring

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,030
because the person
who made it is boring.

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,896
[SEIYA]
You get it?

27
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:32,963
[TRIKEN]
And he wonders why
he has no friends.

28
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:35,196
[SEIYA] Did you say something?
[TRIKEN] Not at all!

29
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,830
[SEIYA]
Here's the thing, Triken,

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,996
I am way too busy to hold your
hand through all of this today.

31
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,796
[SEIYA]
Sento.

32
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,163
[ISUZU]
Yes?

33
00:01:42,263 --> 00:01:44,563
[SEIYA]
You were listening, weren't you?

34
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:46,063
Tell Triken what he needs to do.

35
00:01:46,163 --> 00:01:48,063
[ISUZU]
Well alright... but to be fair,

36
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:50,363
I don't know anything about
making videos either.

37
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:53,330
[SEIYA]
Yeah, but two heads
are better than one.

38
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:55,230
[ISUZU] Understood.

39
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,030
It might be smart to ask
the other workers

40
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,496
for their input too...

41
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,763
I'll look over the final
product when you're finished.

42
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:02,563
[TRIKEN]
Thank you for your assistance!

43
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:06,630
Please excuse me...
It's time to
hunch over and work!

44
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:43,394
[ISUZU]
PV... "Promotional video"
is that right?

45
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,894
Unfortunately,
as I told you before...

46
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,761
I don't know
the first thing about this.

47
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,561
I don't understand
what makes the video
so unsatisfactory.

48
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:54,394
But I do agree with Kanie
that something's not right.

49
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:56,461
[TRIKEN]
You think so too, do you?

50
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:59,661
[ISUZU]
I believe the logical first
step is to follow his advice

51
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,961
and gather input from the
rest of the cast.

52
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:04,327
[TRIKEN]
Input? What do you mean "input"?

53
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:07,727
[ISUZU]
Why don't we go see what
our star mascots think?

54
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:13,061
[MOFFLE]
Moff, this is no good.

55
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:14,594
[TRIKEN]
You didn't like it either.

56
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:18,094
[MOFFLE]
How do I describe it? Too plain?

57
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:19,761
This happens a lot.

58
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:23,561
All the fundamentals are there
but it still puts me to sleep.

59
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:28,194
It's like you've created
a visual representation of
your boring personality.

60
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:30,861
[TRIKEN]
He just said exactly what
Mr. Kanie said...

61
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,227
They're BOTH terrible.

62
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:35,361
[MOFFLE] You say something?
[TRIKEN] Not at all!

63
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,361
[MOFFLE]
If I had to pick out
the biggest problem,

64
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:39,494
I'd say it needs more action.

65
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:41,961
Like the fireworks
at the beginning...

66
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:43,894
explosions would be better.

67
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:46,327
[TRIKEN]
Did... you say explosions?

68
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:50,461
[MOFFLE]
All you need is a bit
of gasoline and then MOFF!

69
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:53,261
Get a shot of somebody running
past a bunch of explosions

70
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,994
and jumping straight
off a cliff!

71
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,194
Then at the end
you see the park logo

72
00:04:57,294 --> 00:04:59,161
in front of the aftermath!

73
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,661
[TRIKEN]
Are you sure that's wise?

74
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,961
This park's supposed
to be family‐friendly.

75
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:04,261
[MOFFLE]
Don't think about too much.

76
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:07,127
Let's just try it
and see what happens!

77
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,194
[MOFFLE]
("moff" kicks)

78
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:24,494
[SWAT MAN A] (oof!)
[SWAT MAN B] (kicked)

79
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,261
[MOFFLE]
Moff.

80
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:44,727
[MACARON]
Ron!

81
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:51,594
[WANIPEE]
(nervous glances)

82
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:05,427
[TIRAMY]
Heheh...

83
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,094
[TRIKEN]
Is this any better?

84
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:12,061
[ISUZU]
Let's see...
I can't say for certain...

85
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,427
but I think so.

86
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,194
[TRIKEN]
Oh...! That's surprising.

87
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:18,261
[ISUZU]
For one... it's definitely
not boring now.

88
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:21,361
And the explosion scenes
are especially convincing.

89
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:23,627
You should proceed
along these lines.

90
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:27,561
[TRIKEN]
Yes Miss Isuzu... I'll see
what else we can add to it.

91
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,994
[MACARON]
Hmm...

92
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,194
This is okay I guess,

93
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:33,794
but doesn't tell
the audience anything

94
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,494
about the kind of music
I perform at the music
theater‐ron.

95
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:37,627
[TRIKEN]
Oh, I see.

96
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:40,061
If you ask me, the visuals
AND the soundtrack

97
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:42,427
could benefit from a more
"aggressive" tone.

98
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,361
[TRIKEN]
What do you mean by
"aggressive"?

99
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,994
[TIRAMY]
I'm thinkin' you gotta
crank up the libido‐mii!

100
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:50,561
[TRIKEN]
Uh... libido as in sex drive...?

101
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,394
[TIRAMY]
That's right. you know
what I'm talking about.

102
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:55,061
To put it in simple terms
I think we need to go lewder.

103
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,227
[TRIKEN]
Lewdness?!
Now THAT I understand!

104
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:59,461
[TIRAMY]
Swimsuits! Short skirts!
Low angles!

105
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,994
All you gotta do is
squeeze in as much fanservice

106
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:04,027
as you can legally
get away with‐mii!

107
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:09,094
But... we don't exactly
have enough room in the budget
to hire any models.

108
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,761
[TIRAMY]
No problem!

109
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:15,161
Lucky for you I've been building
my sexy secret stash for years!

110
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,561
[TRIKEN]
Secret stash?!

111
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:17,361
[TIRAMY]
(snicker)

112
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:18,794
Who needs to hire a model

113
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:21,827
when there's this many
gorgeous babes on the payroll?

114
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:23,594
[TRIKEN]
(amazed)

115
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,294
[TIRAMY]
It's about a terabyte's worth...

116
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:28,494
Perfectly organized, tagged,
and thumbnailed of course!

117
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:30,394
[TIRAMY]
I'll just go ahead and give you
complete access to the server

118
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:31,994
so you can do
whatever you want with 'em...

119
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:33,994
and I DO mean
whatever‐mii.(giggle)

120
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:35,661
[TRIKEN]
Ah! This is wonderful!

121
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:39,494
The Goddess Libra will
surely bless your generosity,
my friend!

122
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,627
[TRIKEN]
Ooh, right there...!

123
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,027
Ahhh that's good...

124
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,227
YEEEEEEEEES! (lewd laughter)

125
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:51,827
[MACARON]
(metal scream)

126
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:55,827
[CROWD]
(synchronized headbanging)

127
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:58,094
[MODEL A]
Ooh...

128
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:59,827
[MODEL B]
(sexy giggle)

129
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:03,427
[MODEL C]
(moan)

130
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:06,261
[TRIKEN]
How do you like that?!
I'd say it's a masterpiece!

131
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,661
[ISUZU]
Since I'm clearly
not the target audience...

132
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:12,427
I shouldn't complain...
It's not my place to argue.

133
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:15,694
Personally... I think
it's extremely revolting but...

134
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:18,361
Oh well... I guess that's
just how the world works.

135
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,927
[TRIKEN]
I appreciate your understanding,
Miss Isuzu.

136
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:24,894
[ISUZU]
You know...
a few of these outfits
look strangely familiar...

137
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:27,194
I get the feeling
I've seen them before...

138
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:29,561
But you hired models
for this project right?

139
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:31,327
[TRIKEN]
Oh yes...! Of course I did!

140
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,727
[ISUZU]
These thighs, for example.
They're bothering me.

141
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:36,627
[TRIKEN]
You and me both!

142
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:39,427
[ISUZU]
Fair enough...
We'll keep this part in.

143
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:41,161
[TRIKEN]
Thank you so much, Miss Isuzu!

144
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,327
Look, I'm hunched over
with gratitude‐

145
00:08:42,427 --> 00:08:44,061
[ISUZU]
Anyway... It seems unfair

146
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:46,161
to cater exclusively
to the male guests.

147
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:48,161
[TRIKEN]
What do you propose we do?

148
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,294
[ISUZU]
Let's get some advice
from the girls next.

149
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:54,861
[MODEL A]
Ooh...

150
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,494
[MODEL B]
(sexy giggle)

151
00:08:56,594 --> 00:08:58,594
[MODEL C]
(moan)

152
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:01,594
[MUSE]
This looks kinda familiar to me.

153
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:02,661
[TRIKEN]
No it doesn't.

154
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:03,894
[KOBORY]
It's just...

155
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:06,227
explosions and sexy
pictures of girls.

156
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:08,527
[SALAMA]
Yeah, I'm kinda grossed out now.

157
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:11,127
[SALAMA]
Let's see what the internet
thinks about this.

158
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:14,727
[TRIKEN]
Ok... how can I make it better?
[SYLPHY] Ohh noo I misfired!

159
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:16,694
[MUSE] Where do I start?
[SYLPHY] We're all out of ammo!

160
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:21,194
[KOBORY]
Uh, listen... This is...
just a... suggestion...

161
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,961
but right now there's
nothing at all in this video

162
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,761
that appeals to
a female audience.

163
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:29,527
[KOBORY] So um...
We need male nudity...!
[SYLPHY] Request evac ASAP!

164
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:32,527
As many hot naked guys
as possible!
[TRIKEN] Huh?

165
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:34,027
[KOBORY]
Girls want to see lots of

166
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:35,661
guy‐on‐guy action
and tiny speedos...!

167
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:38,627
Oh and plenty of close‐up shots
of their bulging muscles too!

168
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:40,794
[SALAMA]
I think that's just what
YOU want to see.

169
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:43,461
[TRIKEN]
Oh no, any suggestions
you girls can give

170
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,661
[TRIKEN] are more than welcome.
[SYLPHY] Ready for liftoff!

171
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:47,494
[TRIKEN] After all,
that's what I'm here for.
[SYLPHY] Searching for target...

172
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:49,027
Enemy target sighted
at one o'clock.

173
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,794
[MUSE]
Well, if you're asking
what we like,

174
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,994
I wouldn't mind
some shots of water.
[SYLPHY] Wind 0. Visibility...

175
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:55,094
[TRIKEN]
You just mean normal
water scenes, right?
[SYLPHY] Liftoff countdown...

176
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,594
[MUSE]
Yes! Looking at the water
is so relaxing.
[SYLPHY] Ready and...

177
00:09:58,694 --> 00:10:00,861
I have lots of footage
of rivers and oceans

178
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,094
if you want me to
send them to you.

179
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:03,661
[SYLPHY]
Waaahhh the mission failed...!

180
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:05,427
[SALAMA] If that's the case,
‐Thank you for your sacrifice!

181
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:07,494
[SALAMA] I think I might have
a contribution to make too!

182
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:10,327
[TRIKEN]
Oh?

183
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:12,661

I'm pretty sure you'll like it.

185
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:18,194

186
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:19,727
Delete it right now!
(freaking out)

187
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,961
[SALAMA]
They're from that sleepover
at your place.

188
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,227
[MUSE]
(flustered, into surprised)

189
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:24,761
[SALAMA]
I just sent them to you, Triken.

190
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:26,827
Hopefully you'll be able to
use them for something good.

191
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:30,094
[TRIKEN]
Yes ma'am...! I assure you
they'll be VERY beneficial.

192
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,327
[MUSE]
No way! I won't
let you have them!

00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,027
[MODEL F]
Yum...

198
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:06,327
[TRIKEN]
So what do you think of it?

199
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:09,561
[ISUZU]
I'm not... sure WHAT to think.

200
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:12,294
I can't believe these are
the models you selected.

201
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:14,794
[TRIKEN]
Well... actually
we were low on funding

202
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:17,561
after I DEFINITELY hired models
for the first one,

203
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:19,961
so I asked the gentlemen
from security to help us out.

204
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:21,794
[ISUZU]
You mean Okuro and the others?

205
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:23,627
[TRIKEN]
Yes, luckily some of the new

206
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:26,794
part‐timers were willing
to play along too.

207
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,994
[ISUZU]
Couldn't you have
enlisted someone else?

208
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:32,461
Surely they're not
the most attractive men
you could've asked.

209
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,694
[TRIKEN]
Oh? Is there anyone in
particular?

210
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,727
[ISUZU]
Well...

211
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:40,427
Nevermind.

212
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,327
[TRIKEN]
You were talking about
Mr. Kanie, weren't you?

213
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:43,461
[ISUZU]
Shut your mouth.

214
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:45,161
[TRIKEN]
I nailed it, didn't I?!

215
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:46,927
Nothing gets past old Triken!

216
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:48,027
Don't even bother trying to‐

217
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:49,061
[ISUZU]
I said shut it.

218
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,027
[TRIKEN]
Consider it shut.

219
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,761
[ISUZU]
Anyway... do we really need

220
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:55,927
footage of a river flowing
or Muse taking a nap?

221
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:57,494
[ISUZU]
Surprisingly,

222
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:59,461
Sylphy's contribution
is the most relevant.

223
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,927
[TRIKEN]
You're right, that's kind of an
unexpected twist, isn't it?

224
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:06,094
[ISUZU]
I think we need to ask for other
people's opinions now.

225
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:07,827
What about the
most important person?

226
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,161
Talk to her next.

227
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,394
[TRIKEN]
The most important person,
you say?

228
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:17,594
[LATIFAH]
Yes...? Did you need me?

229
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:29,805
[LATIFAH]
A promotional video?
I'm sorry...

230
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,605
but I wouldn't know how to help
with something like that.

231
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:34,105
[TRIKEN]
Anything will be helpful...

232
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,872
Perhaps you could tell me
what sort of things

233
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,105
you'd like the video
to be about.

234
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:39,505

Hmm...

235

00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:43,005
This is the
perfect opportunity...!

237
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,705
Why don't you feature
the park employees

238
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,072
who work behind the scenes

239
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:48,805
so they can have a chance
to shine for a change?

you're looking for.

could get a shot of you cooking?

Huh? You're filming again?

251
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:19,772
Yes. But this time
I want to focus on the
security force as a whole.

252
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:22,105
Perhaps I'll get some footage
of you working the gate

253
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:25,705
or training other employees,
things of that nature.

254

I'm sorry, I'm not sure how to
make accounting

256
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:32,472
look interesting on video...
So what should I do?

257
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:36,272
[TRIKEN]
That's alright, Miss Ashe,
it doesn't have to be your job;

258
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:38,139
it could be something you do
on your days off.

259
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:40,972
It just needs to represent
who you are as a person.

260
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:44,405
[ASHE]
Who I am? Well then...

261
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,339
[RUBRUM]
I might have something
interesting...

262
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:49,939
from back in my school days.

263
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,872
[TRIKEN]
Ah... and what is that?

264
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:55,305
[RUBRUM]
Footage of my club activities.

265
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,805
[DORNELL]
You need help with a promo?

266
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,839
[TRIKEN]
Right, I'm looking
for suggestions

267
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:03,005
from as many park employees
as possible.

268
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:06,805
I'd love to come up
with something unique
that makes a big impact.

Wouldn't you know it
I have just the thing.

270
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:13,305
It's something I made
with a group of
like‐minded individuals.

If you gimme some time...

272
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:20,372
I'll go on a wild west adventure
and film it for ya.

273
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:22,972

I think this noble endeavor
could greatly benefit

274
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,639
from the spirit of the samurai!

Aye lads, an' I'd wager
a fine pirate like meself'd

276
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,105
be a perfect addition.

00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,705

[TRIKEN]
Do you ever talk at all?
Ah! What's that?

281
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,539
Okay, today
I'm gonna demonstrate

282
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,372
the proper method
for slicing meat...

283
00:14:58,472 --> 00:15:01,372
First you hold the knife
just like this and then...

284
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:04,039

What?! THIS is what we want?

302
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,772
[ISUZU]
I'm curious about Ashe's part...

303
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:36,205
What on earth was she doing?

304
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:39,105
It's a competitive sport
known as extreme ironing...

305
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:42,305
Apparently you're supposed to
iron clothes in bizarre places.

306
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:44,705
Well, I suppose we all have
our hobbies, don't we?

307
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:47,972
[ISUZU]
I didn't really understand
the part with Dornell
visiting the dam either.

308
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:52,970
[TRIKEN]
I wasn't aware of it before,
but it turns out there's quite
a fan base for dams.

309
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:58,510
[ISUZU]
Well alright then...
Each part of the video does seem
special in its own way,

310
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,810
so it covers a wide range
of interests.

311
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,944

Indeed... and I believe
we have enough footage

312
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:05,277
to work with at this point,
wouldn't you agree?

313
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:07,310
[ISUZU]
Oh I don't think
I'd say that yet...

314
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,610
The next step is to hear
the opinion of someone

315
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,677
who's closer to
a visitor's viewpoint.

316

going to get that?

00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:24,544
that creep them out, don't they?

322
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,677
So just throw in a bit
of violence and it'll be
a masterpiece.

323
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:31,544
Trust me on this one...
It's gonna be a big hit
with the visitors.

324
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:35,310
[TRIKEN]
Well... i‐if you're
sure about it...

325
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,844
[SHIINA]
I... I think the video
looks fonderwul!

326
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:41,877
N‐no wait I mean... W‐wonderful!

327
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,010
[TRIKEN]
Is that how you honestly feel?

328
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,977
[SHIINA]
W‐well... maybe...
you uh... (nervous)

329
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:50,077
Actually nevermind,
don't worry about it!

330
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:50,977
[TRIKEN]
Hmmm...

331
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:52,910
[EIKO]
Wow Triken...

332
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,777
I think you've done
a beautiful job with this.

333
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:56,444
[TRIKEN]
You think it's beautiful?

334
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,744
[EIKO]
Of course...! Although...

335
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,744
if you wouldn't mind me stating
my own personal opinion...

336
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:03,310
I just can't help
but feel that it's

337
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,010
lacking a certain emotional
quality in its current state.

338
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,910
[TRIKEN]
Emotional?
Do you have an example?

339
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,310
[EIKO]
You see... I happen to be quite
interested in horses.

340
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,077
They've been a hobby of mine
since I was a girl, actually.

341
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:16,944
[TRIKEN]
Huh.

342
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:18,310
[EIKO]
And not too long ago,

343
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,277
I was lucky enough
to have a chance to witness

344
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:21,677
a mother horse giving birth.

345
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:23,710
It was a horse that's been
very special to me

346
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,010
since I was in high school...

347
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,010
Her name's Kikuno Scepter,
isn't that sweet?

348
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,577
[TRIKEN]
That's an interesting name...

349
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:30,810
[EIKO]
The delivery was
extremely difficult...

350
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,677
but now she's a proud mother!

351
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:34,810
In all my life...

352
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,977
I've never been so moved!

353
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:45,210

Finished!

354
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,144

Ah yes, I knew I'd get a big
reaction from you, Mr. Kanie.

400
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:24,204
Sento...!
You were supposed to be
supervising this project!

is the music selection‐ron.

Actually Mr. Kanie,

00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:12,004
I took it upon myself
to upload the other video
to the internet as well.

You what?!

421
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:15,071
And it's going viral.

Did you need to repeat that?

430
00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:08,771
Come on down to Whip Antique.

431
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:11,604
[SEIYA]
I get it. This is some kind of
advertisement.

432
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:14,138
[ISUZU]
Remember, it's Whip Antique.

433
00:24:14,238 --> 00:24:16,704
I'm not sure what kind of shop
it is, or what they sell.

Don't you think
that's important?!
