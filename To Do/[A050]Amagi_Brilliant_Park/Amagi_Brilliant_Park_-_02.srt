1
00:00:01,947 --> 00:00:05,847
<i>Darn, that cute office girl</i>
<i>isn't here today.</i>

2
00:00:05,947 --> 00:00:09,014
<i>Oh, no, I hope this skirt</i>
<i>isn't too short.</i>

3
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:10,714
<i>Yoritomo, 1185...</i>

4
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:12,314
No!
[ISUZU] What happened?

5
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:15,014
It's 1192!
He's got his years mixed up!

6
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,180
[ISUZU] Just leave him alone.
[SEIYA] (grrr)

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,614
[ISUZU] Can I assume you
believe what I've told you now?

8
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:22,280
A kiss from a member of the
Maple Land royal family

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,814
has the ability to
grant magic powers.

10
00:00:25,914 --> 00:00:27,514
[SEIYA]
Did you say "royal family"?

11
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:28,914
[ISUZU] Yes, she's a princess.

12
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:30,847
It would appear that you've
been given the power

13
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,314
to perceive what the people
around you are thinking.

14
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:35,447
Try it on me.

15
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:38,580
<i>There was one other person</i>
<i>who possessed this power</i>
<i>in the past,</i>

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,014
<i>but it could never work</i>
<i>more than once on</i>
<i>the same individual.</i>

17
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:44,980
Wait, you mean if I tried to
read your mind again later...

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,980
It wouldn't work.

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,547
You tricked me into
doing it this time

20
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,514
so that I'll never know
what you're thinking.

21
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:51,180
That might be the reason.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,380
But why would you guys want
to give me some superpower
like this?

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,514
So you'd be more inclined to
take the manager position.
[SEIYA] (grrrr)

24
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:58,547
[ISUZU] We'll be returning to
the park after school.

25
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:00,280
No way‐ (urk!)

26
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:46,407
[door opens] (ah!)

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
[LATIFAH] Uncle! (giggles)

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,400
[MOFFLE]
I'm sorry I couldn't stop by and
visit you yesterday, Latifah.

29
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,933
Oh, no, that's all right.

30
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:57,133
Did you get acquainted with
that Kanie kid?

31
00:02:57,233 --> 00:03:00,933
Yes, but he fell unconscious
during the magic‐granting
ritual.

32
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,067
So, I asked Lady Isuzu to
watch over him after that.

33
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,567
Moff, that means he
and Latifah must've...

34
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,467
What?

35
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,900
Don't worry about it.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,500
I just hope he's not
inappropriate with Isuzu.

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,167
What do you mean by
"inappropriate"?

38
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:18,733
Moff! Uh, well, you'll
understand when you're older...

39
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,133
[gasp] Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

40
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,733
(sigh)

41
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,733
I know it might not
happen this year,

42
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,000
but I'll keep on wishing for it.

43
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,533
I believe that,
with Sir Kanie's help,

44
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:34,200
things might just
turn around for us.

45
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,267
Moff...

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,633
Macaron! (laughing)

47
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,767
Tiramy! (laughing)

48
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,833
[MACARON] Ron!
[TIRAMY] Mii!

49
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:44,667
Aw, isn't that sweet? You've
got them all to yourselves.

50
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,233
That was fun!

51
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,167
I wanna stay, Mom!

52
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:50,067
[MACARON] Ron! Ron!
[TIRAMY] Mii!

53
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,900
[MACARON & TIRAMY] (uhhhhhh...)

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,367
I swear, I was this close to
murdalizing those little brats!

55
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,600
Try to relax.

56
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,033
You'll never make it
in this business

57
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,900
if you get upset every time
the kids beat you up.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,100
But they kept punching the
crap out of me like THIS!
[MACARON] (ow, ow, ow)

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
And then they were
hitting me like THAT!
[MACARON] (ow, ow, ow)

60
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,167
[fight bell rings]
[MACARON] HIT ME AGAIN, PUNK!

61
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,033
[TIRAMY] First, they
came at me like THAT and THAT,

62
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,533
and then they were‐
[MOFFLE] It's too moffin'
early for this.

63
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,733
[MACARON] Oh, hey, it's Moffle!

64
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,567
[TIRAMY] Good morning, mii!

65
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,733
You look even more
cranky than usual.

66
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,300
[MOFFLE]
Yeah, it's about the kid.

67
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,033
Oh, you mean the one Isuzu was
giving the grand tour?

68
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,800
So, what did you think of him?

69
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,633
[MOFFLE] He's a narcissist
with a bad attitude.

70
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,733
Just thinking about him
pisses me off.

71
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,533
[MUSE]
Well, good morning, everybody!

72
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,633
[MOFFLE] (huh?)
[TIRAMY] (ah!) Oh, wow, you look
cute as always, Muse!

73
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:35,100
[giggles]
[TIRAMY] And Kobory,
you're as elegant as usual.

74
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Thank you.
[TIRAMY] Salama,
you're as callous as ever.

75
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,900
And of course Sylphy's not
listening at all!
[SYLPHY] (laughing)

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,533
I'm a helicopter!

77
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,300
Are You girls off
to Elementario?
[SYLPHY] (helicopter noises)

78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,233
Yes, it's time for the
first show of the day.

79
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,100
[MOFFLE] If that little
ingrate takes over,
[SALAMA] Who cares,

80
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,933
we don't stand a chance.
[SALAMA] nobody's gonna show up.

81
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:52,433
[SEIYA]
I still have a ton of questions.

82
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:55,267
I mean, what kind of place is
this Maple Land anyway?

83
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:58,233
It's a magical kingdom resting
on the edge of land and water,

84
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,133
and Latifah happens
to be its princess.

85
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,033
Actually, there was another
thing she said before
I passed out

86
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,100
that struck me as weird.

87
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,300
I think she was talking about

88
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,867
losing the power to live
or something?

89
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,433
That would be Animus.

90
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:09,667
Animus?

91
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,067
[ISUZU]
It's the crystallized happiness

92
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,333
of all the guests
who visit the park.

93
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:17,300
Basically,
Animus is our life energy.
[SEIYA] Huh?

94
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,433
AmaBri is a facility used to
gather the Animus we need.

95
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:24,533
All of the establishments that
exist for that purpose are what
we call Argels.

96
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:28,033
Are you trying to tell me that
whether or not they decide to
close that old rundown park

97
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:30,433
is a life‐or‐death situation
for you people?

98
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,067
Yes, of course.

99
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:35,533
[ISUZU] Several other theme
parks are secretly
Argels as well.

100
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,900
You mean Maple Land built all
those other big parks
in the area too?

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
Oh, no, there are multiple
magical worlds,

102
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,367
so each one of them establishes
an Argel for themselves.

103
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:47,433
Magical realms are powerless
without a supply of Animus.

104
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:50,300
That's why the parks are
so desperate to get guests.

105
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,033
And what happens if the
kingdom runs out of Animus?

106
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:57,167
[sad sigh]
Then we cease to exist.

107
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,533
How are you doing this morning,
Miss Isuzu?

108
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,967
[ISUZU] Hello.

109
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,867
[SEIYA] Is that guy from
the magical land?

110
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,533
No, actually Okuro's an
ordinary human being.

111
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:13,400
There are several other
non‐magical residents
working at AmaBri as well.

112
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,800
[SEIYA] What's this?
[ISUZU] Staff housing.
I also live in there.

113
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,467
But the place I wanted you to
visit today is the
administrative building.

114
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,067
[ISUZU] Here we are.

115
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:27,333
Moff...

116
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:28,367
[grrr]

117
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:29,633
Are you going to fight?

118
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,333
No getting around it.

119
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,767
[air raid siren]

120
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,667
Moff moff moff moff!

121
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:39,100
[SEIYA] Bring it on! (urk!)

122
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,933
Are you two done bonding now?

123
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,133
You really think
this is bonding?!

124
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,133
We should go.

125
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,700
We'll be late
if we don't hurry up.

126
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,767
Great, NOW what are you
gonna put me through?

127
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,367
I want to introduce you
to the enemy.

128
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:51,800
Huh?

129
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,833
My name is Takaya Kurisu.

130
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:57,367
I'm here from Amagi Development.

131
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,833
Uh, thank you.

132
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,533
I don't think we've met before.

133
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,667
That's Seiya Kanie;
he's an intern.

134
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,700
Shouldn't the manager
be here as well?

135
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,867
She wasn't feeling
very well today.

136
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,400
Since I'm the acting manager,

137
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,033
I'll be the one to consider
your proposal.
[SEIYA] (huh?)

138
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,300
[TAKAYA]
I see; that's all right then.

139
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,967
[TAKAYA] I'm sure you
already know this,

140
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,533
but your contract stipulates
that the annual visitor count

141
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:21,667
must be calculated beginning on
August 1st of every year,

142
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:25,033
and that if you fall short of
half a million guests for
five years in a row,

143
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:28,367
Amagi Development receives
full control of the park.
[ISUZU] Yes.

144
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:31,167
[TAKAYA] The park has
fallen below 500,000 attendees
[SEIYA] (hmm?)

145
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,533
for four consecutive years now.

146
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,667
You're at 250,000 for the year.

147
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,133
And it's already May.

148
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:41,133
I'm afraid you have less than
three months remaining.

149
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,800
And you see,
from where I'm standing,

150
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,367
you haven't even begun
preparations to shut down.

151
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,767
That's correct.
Because we can't be certain
that the visitor count

152
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,800
won't surpass 500,000 before
the deadline is up.

153
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,433
(big sigh)

154
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,067
Tell me you're not serious.

155
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,767
Summer break is
just around the corner!
I'm sure we'll get‐

156
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:01,367
[TAKAYA] Summer break
starts in late July.

157
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:04,933
Two weeks won't be enough
to save your park.

158
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,467
You're generating a
considerable deficit.

159
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,967
If I were you, I'd start
getting my assets in order.

160
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,333
Allow me to give you
a little example here.

161
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:17,533
Let's say a family of four
takes a vacation to
Amagi Brilliant Park.

162
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:21,000
Would you make a profit based on
last year's attendance?

163
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,067
Well, it depends on how much the
family needs to spend every day,

164
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,667
which is...

165
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,967
85,000 yen.

166
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,967
That's almost on the nose.

167
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:37,867
It's actually 83,200.

168
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,600
[TAKAYA]
That was quite impressive.
[ISUZU] (huh?)

169
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,567
[TAKAYA] How would you like
to come work with us?
[ISUZU] (ah!)

170
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,800
Nah, don't think I'm interested.

171
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,300
Well that's a shame.

172
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,233
In any case, those are the
numbers we're looking at here.

173
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,200
You just can't keep up this
indulgence of yours
for much longer.

174
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,433
But, sir, if you give us a
chance, then maybe we could...

175
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,733
A chance, huh?

176
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,400
Face it, the only thing
you can do now

177
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
is pray that another quarter
million people are stupid enough

178
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,833
to waste their time
at this dump.
[ISUZU] (grrr)

179
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,800
[TAKAYA] No offense.

180
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,494
You didn't tell me you were
the acting manager.

181
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:26,194
[ISUZU]
Princess Latifah needed me to do
it for a year to take her place.

182
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:29,994
[ISUZU] Did you come up with
the 85,000 yen

183
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:32,761
because you were reading
Mr. Kurisu's mind earlier?

184
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:34,627
No, all I did was
make a rough estimate

185
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:37,427
based on the size of the park
and yesterday's visitor count.

186
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,127
It's a little math trick
called a Fermi estimate.

187
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:41,327
[ISUZU] I don't understand.

188
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,461
Look it up sometime.
More importantly,

189
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:46,061
why did you bring me here
to meet with those people?

190
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:48,527
[umm...]

191
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,894
If you're going to be
the manager of AmaBri,

192
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:53,727
you'll need to know
who we're up against.

193
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,361
Would you just drop it?

194
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:57,961
[sigh]

195
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:01,661
You take away my free time after
school and on the weekends,

196
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:04,161
you repeatedly threaten me with
that ridiculous gun of yours,

197
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:07,494
and yet you STILL expect me to
help you save this stupid
theme park?

198
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:10,694
Who in their right mind would
say yes after all that?

199
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:15,927
I'm sorry, I'm not quite
accustomed to this world yet.

200
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:19,527
I don't know the appropriate way
to ask for someone's help.

201
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,761
So you shoot them?
[ISUZU] Yes.

202
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:22,794
[waaah!]

203
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:24,694
[ISUZU]
Steinberger is a magical weapon

204
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:27,361
compatible with several
types of bullets.
[SEIYA] Put that away!

205
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,261
The bullet I shot you with
before was called a
Pain Bringer.

206
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:34,494
That variety is enough to cause
double the amount of pain of
stubbing your pinky toe.

207
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:35,594
[SEIYA] Put it down!

208
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:37,194
I don't see why you would ask me

209
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:39,861
instead of somebody with
professional management
experience.

210
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:43,161
We tried that,
but then they all quit on us.
[SEIYA] Why?

211
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,661
Perhaps they
didn't like being shot at.
[SEIYA] Really?!

212
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:47,427
I feel like this is
all my fault.

213
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:49,027
That's why I came
to your school.

214
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:51,461
I was so desperate,
I needed you to agree to help

215
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:53,594
no matter what the cost!

216
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:55,861
[sigh]

217
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:57,327
I've had enough.

218
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:58,827
You're leaving?!
[SEIYA] Yep.

219
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:01,561
But you can't! You're the only
chance we've got, Kanie!

220
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,594
Please save our park!

221
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:03,627
I can't help you.

222
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,761
But what about the Princess?!

223
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,661
Hey, there.

224
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:24,061
Hey.

225
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,861
[hmm?]

226
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:31,527
What now?

227
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:34,561
You're Seiya Kodama,
the child actor!

228
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,527
[SEIYA] You're mistaken.

229
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,327
No, no, I'm sure.

230
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:40,061
ut why's a big
celebrity like you

231
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:43,761
working part‐time in
a rundown amusement park?

232
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,394
I said‐

233
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:46,794
[grumpy sigh]

234
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,494
It's none of your business.

235
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:50,727
[TAKAYA] Well, I'm sure
you've got your reasons,

236
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:52,427
but here's some advice:

237
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:54,561
Don't be stupid, all right?

238
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,427
If you spend your time
around losers,

239
00:11:57,527 --> 00:11:59,894
you'll end up a loser yourself.

240
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:01,027
[grrr]

241
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:03,561
Take care.
[car door shuts]

242
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:22,161
I guess the corners are round
so kids don't get hurt.

243
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,561
How can they have time for
little details like that

244
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:40,694
when the place is such a wreck?

245
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,861
Jeez, get your
priorities in order.

246
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:55,827
Either way, I should get them to
do something about these crazy
psychic powers.

247
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:02,627
[panting]

248
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:06,594
[lots of people talking]

249
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:09,094
I hope they're not gonna give
us some kind of bad news.

250
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:12,294
I'm surprised you haven't
already heard something,
Mr. Moffle.

251
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:14,994
What's your take on it,
Mr. Cast Leader?
[SYLPHY] Un, deux, trois!

252
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:19,261
Moff, I bet it's exactly
what you think it is.
[SYLPHY] Un, deux, trois!

253
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:22,061
[ISUZU]
Everyone, your attention please!
[SYLPHY] Wheee!

254
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:26,327
[ISUZU] The first princess
of Maple Land, Her Royal
Highness Latifah Fullanza

255
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:28,361
would like to address
her subjects!

256
00:13:28,461 --> 00:13:30,127
This is an important message!

257
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,027
[CAST GUY] All right,
let's get this over with.
[concerned murmurs]

258
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,894
[CAST GIRL] I had a feeling
this was coming.

259
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:36,161
These people sure do
give up easily.

260
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:38,094
Can't really blame 'em.

261
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:43,727
Good evening, my friends.
It is with a heavy heart

262
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:47,161
that I must impart some
very upsetting news today.

263
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,661
In three months' time,

264
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,461
our Amagi Brilliant Park will
be permanently shut down.

265
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:53,594
[shoked gasps & confusion]

266
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,527
[LATIFAH]
I know it hurts to say goodbye,

267
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:00,194
but I promise I'll do everything
I can to find new jobs for
every one of you.

268
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:03,561
And even though the road ahead
is certain to introduce
some challenges‐

269
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:05,261
[WANIPEE] Challenges, really?!
[LATIFAH & ISUZU] (gasps)

270
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:08,861
But, Your Majesty, hardly
anybody out there even
knows who I am!

271
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:11,327
It's too late for me to
build up a fan base now!

272
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:12,394
What am I gonna do?!

273
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:14,027
Well I...

274
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,961
I'm not quite sure,
but if you try hard then‐

275
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,794
[WANIPEE]
What's the use of trying?!

276
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:19,627
I'll just wind up
passing out tissues

277
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,127
in front of some
train station anyway!

278
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:23,661
And then before you know it,

279
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:26,594
everybody'll forget about me
forever! (hysterical sobbing)

280
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:28,194
[concerned gasps]

281
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:30,561
[WANIPEE] Without fans,
I'll just disappear!
[LATIFAH] (sigh)

282
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,194
How could you let us down
like this, Princess?! (sobbing)

283
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:36,461
[MOFFLE]
Put a sock in it, Wanipee.

284
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:37,761
But I'm sad!

285
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:40,461
How many years have you
worked at AmaBri?

286
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:42,527
[WANIPEE] About twelve.

287
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:45,527
Then you've had more
than enough chances.

288
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:47,794
It's your own fault you
relied too much on the park

289
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:50,961
and didn't establish
your own fan base.
[WANIPEE] (gasp)

290
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:53,694
[MOFFLE]
So why are you making a scene?

291
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:58,594
Because... becaaaaause!
(sobbing)

292
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:01,027
[MOFFLE] Don't worry, Wanipee.

293
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:04,294
I'll be right there passing
out tissues with you, okay?

294
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:07,394
If you work hard,
you still have a chance
of being successful

295
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:10,827
as a local mascot
or something like that.

296
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,927
[WANIPEE] Easy for you to say.

297
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:14,227
Moff?

298
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:15,894
Come on, Moffle, we both know

299
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:18,494
you could easily move on
to some other theme park.

300
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:20,361
Why would I do a
fool thing like that?

301
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,994
You're practically identical to
Macky at Urayasu Digimarland!

302
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:26,527
Did you really think
nobody noticed?!
[MOFFLE] Moff...

303
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,761
[WANIPEE] He's a mouse too,
I'm sure you could get a good
gig as a sidekick‐(choking)

304
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,261
[MOFFLE]
I'm nobody's sidekick! Got it?!

305
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:32,761
I've built my career on
originality!

306
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:35,361
I'm not a knockoff or a
sidekick, buster!
[WANIPEE] (crying)

307
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:36,827
That hurts! Let me go!

308
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,227
Both of you, cut it out!
[BOTH] (huh?)

309
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:42,094
[MACARON] We're in front
of the princess, ron!
[MOFFLE] (concerned)

310
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:44,427
[MACARON] She's suffering more
than anybody right now.

311
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,861
Can't you two see that?

312
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,294
[WANIPEE] (oofff)

313
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:51,727
Sorry I got upset.

314
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:53,627
No...

315
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:55,927
This is all my fault.

316
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:58,194
I've failed.

317
00:15:58,294 --> 00:15:59,794
I'm so sorry!

318
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:03,627
If only I'd been able
to save this place...

319
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,527
I know it's not enough, but...

320
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:07,994
I truly do apologize.

321
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:09,694
And I hope...

322
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,227
I hope you'll all forgive me...

323
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,527
if you can.

324
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,661
Don't you think it's a little
early for you to apologize?

325
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:23,494
[BOTH] (gasp!)
[ALL] (huh?)

326
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:27,694
[deep breath]

327
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,061
You really are
a hopeless bunch.

328
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,827
If you're gonna feel sorry
for yourselves,

329
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:35,027
at least wait until
you've actually lost.

330
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,161
Is he the one the prophesy
told us about?
[MOFFLE] (grrr)

331
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:40,461
Huh?

332
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:42,427
What are you doing
back here, punk?

333
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:43,827
If I remember correctly,

334
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:45,794
you clowns forced me to
come here against my will.

335
00:16:45,894 --> 00:16:48,394
[MOFFLE] They told me you turned
down the manager position.

336
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:49,927
Just get lost already!

337
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:51,827
I don't think so.
I'm actually in the mood

338
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,894
to help you losers with
your little problem now.
[BOTH] (gasp!)

339
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:56,694
We can handle it
just fine on our own!

340
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:58,727
We don't need help
from the likes of you!

341
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:01,294
Heh! Yeah, you LOOK like
you're handling it.

342
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:02,427
Moffu?

343
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:03,461
Come on!

344
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,261
Every one of you is useless!

345
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:07,361
You can't attract business
or make money,

346
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,494
and now you're all about
to lose your jobs!

347
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:12,827
Oh, and guess what that guy
from Amagi Development
said to me earlier.

348
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:16,061
That you'd have to be a moron
to spend your money at
this trash heap!

349
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,461
[MOFFLE] (grrr)
[ALL] (grrr)

350
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:19,361
He's right! The poor,
misguided saps who DO come

351
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,727
are wasting their hard‐earned
cash on a pitiful excuse
for an amusement park

352
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:25,394
that's not even bad enough
to be so‐bad‐it's‐good!

353
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,527
Seriously, even I don't know
what to say to that!

354
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,494
And what have you idiots
been doing in the meantime?

355
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:33,461
Nothing! You're just whining
and complaining!

356
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:35,361
It's true!
I'd feel pretty stupid

357
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:37,861
if I gave my money to a
pathetic lot like you!

358
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:40,027
All right,
now I'm really getting mad!

359
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,661
[LATIFAH] Please stand down.
[MOFFLE] Huh?

360
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,861
[LATIFAH]
I do apologize, Sir Kanie.

361
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:47,061
Would you please come
and join us on the balcony?

362
00:17:47,161 --> 00:17:48,661
Heh...

363
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,261
[SEIYA]
I should introduce myself.

364
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:54,661
Name's Seiya Kanie.

365
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,427
And I don't even have
to read your minds

366
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:57,994
to know what you're
all thinking.

367
00:17:58,094 --> 00:17:59,294
Let me see here, uh...

368
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:02,427
Aha! That's right, you hate
my guts already, don't you?

369
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:03,894
"Where'd this jerk come from?"

370
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:06,727
"How can we entrust HIM
with our precious park?"

371
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:09,494
"What could he possibly do
in three months?"

372
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,061
And that's not all!

373
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,927
"Princess Latifah with
a jackass like him?"
[LATIFAH (ah!)

374
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,494
[SEIYA] "I can't bear
to think about it!"

375
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,761
Have I pissed you off enough?
Good!

376
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:21,794
From now on,
it's not in your hands anymore.

377
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,161
I'm your new dictator!
[MOFFLE] (grrr)

378
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,727
If you don't like that,
I'll fire you right now!

379
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:29,061
You will do exactly
as I tell you to do!

380
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,427
This lousy park is gonna
close down either way,

381
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,161
so I might as well
do what I want!

382
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:37,761
That said, I guarantee you'll
be amazed in the end.

383
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:40,127
In these three months,
this random kid you hate

384
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:43,694
is gonna pull off a miracle
like you've never seen!
[CAST] (wow!)

385
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:46,794
I'll get you those
250,000 customers.

386
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:48,727
And that prophesy
or whatever?

387
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,527
I WILL make it come true!

388
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,525
[ISUZU] A stunt?

389
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,291
[SEIYA] Yeah,
I made them angry on purpose.

390
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:05,291
[LATIFAH] Why would you do that?

391
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:08,158
Well, when I told them your
customers were all morons,

392
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:10,058
that made the cast
get really mad.

393
00:19:10,158 --> 00:19:13,858
The fact that they were that
offended by me talking smack
about the customers

394
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,658
means they're serious.

395
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:17,358
So, there's still hope.

396
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,391
Oh, I never thought of that.

397
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,325
You mean, you've decided to
help us out after all?

398
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:23,991
[SEIYA] Yeah.
[ISUZU & LATIFAH]
(relieved sigh)

399
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:26,391
Three months, no more, no less.

400
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:29,391
After that, I'm washing
my hands of all of this.

401
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:32,691
Right.
You have my deepest gratitude.

402
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,525
[sigh]

403
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,325
Don't go thanking me just yet.
[LATIFAH] (huh?)

404
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:39,491
Well, I'm gonna give it
my best shot, but...

405
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:41,425
Just don't get your hopes up.

406
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,125
It's virtually impossible.

407
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,091
But what about your
big speech earlier?!

408
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:46,558
[SEIYA] I said what I had to.

409
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:48,358
[ISUZU] (ah!)
[LATIFAH] (hmm...)

410
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,625
[SEIYA]
If we want to succeed here,

411
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:52,325
we need them to have
a little hope left.

412
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:56,391
Well, in that case,
I won't give up either.

413
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:59,125
Because your prophesy tells you
I'm gonna make this happen?

414
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:03,758
[LATIFAH]
No. The Oracle does give us a
little guidance for our lives,

415
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:07,691
but I have no idea what the
future truly holds for us.

416
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,191
Then what's your reason?

417
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,258
Because you agreed to help us
save the park, Sir Kanie.

418
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:14,691
I know things are
going to change.

419
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:16,658
And I believe that AmaBri

420
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,491
has a chance to make
a brighter future.

421
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:21,258
[resigned sigh]

422
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:26,025
[ISUZU] These are the
documents you asked for.
[SEIYA] Thanks.

423
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,191
[ISUZU] Is there anything else?
[SEIYA] No.

424
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:34,025
[ISUZU]
Did you let your family know you
wouldn't be going home tonight?
[SEIYA] Yeah.

425
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,591
[ISUZU] I'll leave a blanket for
you so you can get some sleep.
[SEIYA] 'Kay.

426
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,891
And Kanie?
[SEIYA] (hmmm?)

427
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:46,358
Thanks for this.

428
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,125
Sure.

429
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:55,458
Hey! Good to see
you again, Mr. Moffle!

430
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,091
Chilled tomatoes and a beer.

431
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:59,158
'Kay!

432
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,291
[MACARON] Yo buddy, ron!
Started without ya.

433
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,025
[TIRAMY] Mii, what took ya?
[MOFFLE] Moff!

434
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,258
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.
I brought you a beer!
[MOFFLE] Moff.

435
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:10,925
Hey, baby, ron, could you bring
us two more of those, please?
[TAKAMI] Uh‐huh.

436
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:14,491
[TIRAMY] And hurry back
with that sweet ass, mii!
[TAKAMI] Oh, you!

437
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:17,625
You really ought to watch your
language when you go out
in public, Tiramy.

438
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:20,258
You never know who might be
listening to what you say.

439
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:23,558
[TIRAMY] Relax, that's what
these Rarapazzi charms are for.

440
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,391
As long as we're
wearing these babies,

441
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:27,291
nobody'll find out
we're fairies!

442
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:29,491
Those only change your
appearance, you knucklehead.

443
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:32,158
We'd be in hot water if word
got out that an AmaBri mascot

444
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:35,425
was drinking beer and
checking out women's butts!
[TIRAMY] (grrr)

445
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:38,325
Mii! Stop tellin' me
how to live my life!

446
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:42,458
What's the fun of goin' out
drinkin' if you can't check out
the tits and ass?!

447
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:44,225
[MACARON] You better zip
that dirty mouth!
[TIRAMY] (choking)

448
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:45,825
Stop acting so stupid!

449
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:47,458
[ALL] We're sorry.

450
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,358
And cheers!

451
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,225
What's gotcha down today,
Moff‐man?
[MACARON] (chugging) (ah!)

452
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:54,525
Is it that Kanie kid again?
[MOFFLE] Moff!

453
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,958
Well, we might as well stick
it out till the end, right?

454
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:00,525
I'm kinda curious to see what
his game plan is, honestly.

455
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:03,358
[grrr]

456
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,091
[confusion murmurs]

457
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:09,758
[grrr]

458
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:14,425
[MOFFLE] What the hell does that
rat bastard think he's doing?!

459
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:58,825
[ISUZU & SEIYA] Time for
the attractions spotlight.

460
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:01,758
[ISUZU] Today's feature is
Macaron's Music Theatre.

461
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,358
[SEIYA]
I haven't been in there yet.
What's it like?

462
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,491
[ISUZU] A sanctuary of sound
filled to the brim

463
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:08,558
with the most
prestigious of legends.

464
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:11,891
[SEIYA] Wow, that sounds
pretty sophisticated.
What kind of legends?

465
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:15,358
[ISUZU] Like when Macaron got
into a fist‐fight with some
rude audience members

466
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,025
and the whole stage collapsed.

467
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,325
[SEIYA] That's prestigious?!
