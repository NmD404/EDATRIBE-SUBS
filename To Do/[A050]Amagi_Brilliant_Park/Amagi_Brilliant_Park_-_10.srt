46
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:45,441

Would you take a few of these

163
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:37,008
croquettes to Sir Kanie for me?

164
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,808
I'd like him
to sample them as well.

You'll enjoy these...

168
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,575
I made them with Earl... Grey...

169
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:50,608
[ISUZU]
(gasp)

170
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:53,108
[ISUZU]
Your Majesty!

171
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,908
[LATIFAH]
(pant)

172
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:58,875
I'm alright...

173
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:04,308
I'm just feeling a little...
dizzy... nothing more...

174
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:05,341
[ISUZU]
(gasp)

175
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:07,808
Princess?! Princess!

176
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,097
[SEIYA]
How is she?

177
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,897
[ISUZU]
She's getting some rest for now.

178
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,564
[SEIYA]
That's good.

179
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,197
So what's wrong...?

180
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:30,231
Does she have
some kind of illness?

181
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:34,197
[SEIYA]
Does she...? Tell me the truth.

182
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:37,031
[MOFFLE]
No... Don't worry about it.

183
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:40,997
[MOFFLE]
She'll be fine
when she's rested up.

184
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:42,831
[SEIYA]
Hey...! Moffle!

185
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,031
<door closes>

186
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:49,564
[SEIYA]
You know what's going on here,
don't you?

187
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,297
[SEIYA]
Say something!

188
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:56,631
[ISUZU]
(sigh)

189
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:01,964
[ISUZU]
Maple Land's residents
can't live without Animus...

190
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:06,531
...the feelings of fun and
happiness experienced
by the people of this world.

191
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,664
[SEIYA]
You already told me all that.

192
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:13,464
[ISUZU]
A long time ago...

193
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:17,897
Maple Land fell under attack...
by a fearsome dragon.

194
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:19,664
[SEIYA]
A dragon...?

195
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:21,864
As in a dragon like Rubrum?

196
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:24,464
[ISUZU]
It was a lot bigger than Rubrum.

197
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,964
[SEIYA]
Oh...

198
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:28,464
[ISUZU]
The army did
everything they could,

199
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:31,697
but they were unable
to defeat such an imposing foe.

200
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:36,297
[ISUZU]
That was when the King
was visited by a sorcerer.

201
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:39,464
He promised the King
that he would slay the dragon

202
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:43,164
in exchange for
the princess' hand in marriage.

203
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:45,497
[ISUZU]
The king agreed.

204
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:50,597
And so the sorcerer
made quick work of the dragon.

205
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:57,297
[SEIYA]
I'm guessing they didn't
live happily ever after.

206
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,531
[ISUZU]
The King didn't want to
surrender his daughter's hand...

207
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:05,197
so he sent the army to attack
the sorcerer.

208
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,231
[ISUZU]
Wounded and filled with rage,

209
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,897
the sorcerer placed a curse upon
the princess

210
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,864
that slowly drained
her Animus supply

211
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:15,431
just before he fell off a cliff.

212
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:21,164
[SEIYA]
So she's... really cursed?

213
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,531
[ISUZU]
(sad)

214
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:26,631
There was only one way to save
the princess from certain death.

215
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:29,497
She was sent to this world
to recuperate because there's

216
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:33,464
an abundant amount of Animus
here to keep her healthy.

217
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:38,531
[SEIYA]
And that's what the park is for.

218
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:42,697
[ISUZU]
Correct.

219
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:43,831
[SEIYA]
Which means...

220
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:46,197
if AmaBri has to shut down...!

221
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,597
[ISUZU]
(sigh)

222
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:52,564
[ISUZU]
She won't make it.

223
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:53,931
[SEIYA]
(breathless)

224
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:56,231
(choked up)

225
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:04,164
[SEIYA]
How do you feel?

226
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,231
[LATIFAH]
Sorry to make you worry.

227
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,797
I'll be alright
if I rest a little.

228
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:11,264
[SEIYA]
Good to hear.

229
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:14,097
[LATIFAH]
(surprised)

230
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:15,631
(sad smile)

231
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:19,497
I understand you heard about my
condition from Lady Isuzu.

232
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:20,897
Is that true?

233
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,597
[SEIYA]
Yeah.

234
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,831
[LATIFAH]
I told everyone
not to tell you...

235
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:28,464
I was afraid that you would be
worried about me if you knew it.

236
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,731
[LATIFAH]
I'm so sorry.

237
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:38,297
I'm sorry I kept it a secret,
Sir Kanie.

238
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:42,597
[SEIYA]
It's fine.

239
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:46,097
[LATIFAH]
How are things in the park
these days?

240
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:48,331
[SEIYA]
Everyone's working hard
out there.

241
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:49,031
But uh...

242
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,097
[LATIFAH]
Hm?

243
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,531
If something doesn't change...

244
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:54,297
getting enough visitors
to stay open is probably...

245
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,764
not possible.

246
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:58,364
[LATIFAH]
I see.

247
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,497
[SEIYA]
(stunned)

248
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:05,097
What's with you?

249
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:06,531
[LATIFAH]
Hm?

250
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:09,464
How can you possibly be calm
at a time like this?!

251
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:12,231
If AmaBri closes down,
you're gonna‐

252
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,064
(realize)

253
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:15,831
(troubled)

254
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:16,831
[LATIFAH]
(smile)

255
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,164
You have a point...

256
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:20,764
I know I probably won't
be alive much longer.

257
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:22,764
[SEIYA]
So why...?!

258
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:25,031
But I refuse to give up hope...

259
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:28,097
not yet.

260
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:29,897
[SEIYA]
I told you it doesn't look good.

261
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:34,297
What's the point of waiting
for a miracle that probably
won't happen?

262
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:36,231
But a miracle
already DID happen.

263
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:37,531
[SEIYA]
(surprised)

264
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,731
Just take a look
at everyone in the park...

265
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:43,697
Everything started changing
when you came into our lives,

266
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,731
[SEIYA] Really?
[LATIFAH] Yes!

267
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,131
You've filled our beloved park
with the smiles and laughter

268
00:12:48,231 --> 00:12:50,664
of so many happy visitors
since you came to work here.

269
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:53,231
[SEIYA]
I don't know if
I would consider that a miracle.

270
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:54,997
[LATIFAH]
Sir Kanie...

271
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:59,197
I realize it may not seem
like anything special
in your eyes but...

272
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:01,897
...to me, what
you've done for us...

273
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:03,864
it means the whole world!

274
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:05,397
[SEIYA]
(surprised)

275
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:11,531
Yeah but... you're still in
serious trouble and...

276
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:13,997
(realize)

277
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,697
[LATIFAH]
(sad smile)

278
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,097
Sir Kanie?

279
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:26,097
Is everything alright?

280
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:31,097
[SEIYA]
Latifah.

281
00:13:32,664 --> 00:13:34,531
[SEIYA]
Are you really okay with this?

282
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:39,131
[LATIFAH]
Yes.

283
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:41,764
Are you sure?

284
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,797
[LATIFAH]
(deep breath, determined)

285
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:44,997
Certainly.

286
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:46,597
(smile)

287
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,531
[SEIYA]
Okay then.

288
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:59,297
[SEIYA]
These ideas all suck!

289
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:00,297
[SYLPHY/MUSE/DORNELL/WANIPEE]
(startled)

290
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:01,139
[KOBORY/SALAMA]
(wince)

291
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,112
[WANIPEE]
B‐but the visitor count's
been getting better

292
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:03,346
since we started
working at night.

293
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:04,846
So if we stretch it
to 24 hours then‐

294
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:06,512
[SEIYA]
Yeah maybe in the long term...

295
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,279
But that won't make enough of a
difference before the deadline!

296
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:12,146
Unless you can give me
a clear guarantee!

297
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:13,546
[WANIPEE]
W‐well uh...

298
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:15,412
[SEIYA]
And promoting outside the park?

299
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:16,879
[DORNELL]
It's good publicity.

300
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:18,812
[SEIYA]
Advertising takes way too long

301
00:14:18,912 --> 00:14:20,179
to bring in actual results...!

302
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,979
We don't have time
for stuff like that!

303
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,112
[SEIYA]
For right now,

304
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,212
we have to do whatever it takes

305
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:25,446
to get that visitor count up!

306
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:26,679
And you!

307
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,979
[SEIYA] The 0 yen campaign!
[MUSE/KOBORY] (startled)

308
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,312
That's no different from the

309
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,946
30 yen push we're doing NOW...!

310
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:33,746
It won't give us
enough of a boost!

311
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:35,179
[MUSE]
(nervous)

312
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,712
You're right; I'm sorry
that's a dumb idea...

313
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,679
[SEIYA]
It's almost July 31st...

314
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,279
What this park needs right now

315
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:45,312
is a solid idea that'll
guarantee 134,000 guests
before then.

316
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:48,012
Come up with something better!

317
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:49,646
[WANIPEE]
He was outta line!

318
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:52,079
It wasn't nice of him to yell at
us when we're trying to help!

319
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:54,246
[SYLPHY] (happy humming)
[SALAMA] Yeah that was #rude.

320
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:55,212
[MUSE]
Calm down, you guys...

321
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,446
[KOBORY]
I don't know.

322
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:58,012
maybe something's
been bothering him.

323
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:00,546
[DORNELL]
He's just aggro
over the deadline.

324
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,046
[SALAMA]
(pouting)

325
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:03,646
[KOBORY]
(realize)

326
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:06,212
[KOBORY]
The classic boy‐in‐a
desperate‐situation scenario!

327
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:07,879
[SYLPHY]
Oooooh... Aaaahhhh...

328
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:10,412
[KOBORY]
We should pair him with a guy
who's more experienced!

329
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:12,379
[DORNELL] It's not a BL manga...
[SALAMA] Hit Like if you agree!

330
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,812
[MUSE] Let's get going.
[SYLPHY] Moscow Mule!

331
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:08,489
[MOFFLE]
You're making
a lot of enemies lately.

332
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:09,756
[SEIYA]
I know!

333
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:11,289
But if I don't pull out
all the stops,

334
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:13,489
we're not gonna sell enough
tickets before the deadline.

335
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,923
[MOFFLE]
Gettin' all moffin' mad
won't help.

336
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:19,623
[ISUZU]
Everybody's trying
their hardest.

337
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:20,789
[SEIYA]
(smile)

338
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:21,889
I don't need you to
tell me that.

339
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:23,256
[MOFFLE]
(annoyed)

340
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:24,856
But if we don't have something
to show for it,

341
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:27,289
they might as well
be doing nothing!

342
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:29,356
[MOFFLE]
What happened to
what you said before?

343
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:32,956
"Whatever it takes
to get even one more guest"?

344
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,289
[SEIYA]
You're right...

345
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,789
That kinda crap
is why we're about to fail!

346
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,189
[MOFFLE]
Moff!

347
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,823
[ISUZU]
Lord Moffle!

348
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:42,123
[SEIYA]
Even if AmaBri closes down,

349
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:44,889
the cast members
can find another job.

350
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:46,323
[ISUZU]
(surprised)

351
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,956
[SEIYA]
But Latifah's not so lucky.

352
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:50,889
[MOFFLE]
(surprised)

353
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:54,456
You told him, didn't you, Isuzu?

354
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,056
[ISUZU]
Yes.

355
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:00,823
[MOFFLE]
(small sigh)

356
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:11,856
[SEIYA]
(angry)

357
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:16,623
[SEIYA]
I'm exhausted.

358
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:18,856
[AISU]
Working too hard, huh?

359
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,389
Something like that.

360
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:21,889
[AISU]
(sigh)

361
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,589
[AISU]
(gulp)

362
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,056
Ahhh...

363
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,223
[SEIYA]
Hey Aunt Aisu?

364
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:28,723
[AISU]
Yeah?

365
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:30,389
[SEIYA]
Being a magazine editor...

366
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:31,623
is it hard?

367
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:33,323
[AISU]
Not really.

368
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:35,956
Except when the
manuscripts are late and the
printers get pissed.

369
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,756
And sometimes authors
straight‐up run from us.

370
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:39,689
[SEIYA]
(sigh)

371
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:40,923
So uh...

372
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:43,056
whenever something
goes wrong at work...

373
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:44,623
what do you do about it?

374
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:46,456
[AISU]
Grab a beer and forget it!

375
00:17:46,556 --> 00:17:48,489
[SEIYA]
What?!

376
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:51,823
[TEACHER]
Now, have a safe summer break
and set the best example you can

377
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:55,056
for your fellow students, okay?
You're excused.

378
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:57,123
[GIRL]
Don't forget your books!

379
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:18,889
[MOFFLE]
You're 10 years too young to be
lookin' this depressed, Kid.

380
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:23,823
[SEIYA]
What's this about?

381
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,889
[MOFFLE]
Don't worry about it.

382
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,123
[SEIYA]
(sigh)

383
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:32,589
[MOFFLE]
That'll cost ya.

384
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:33,556
[SEIYA]
(spit take)

385
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:34,523
You expect me to pay?!

386
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,323
[MOFFLE]
Just moffin' ya.

387
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,523
(drinking)

388
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:41,689
[SEIYA]
I really can't stand you.
You know that?

389
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,123
[MOFFLE]
(ahh) Right back atcha.

390
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:46,689
[MOFFLE]
I don't get it.

391
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:48,056
[SEIYA]
What do you mean?

392
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:51,123
[MOFFLE]
Why are you so desperate
to fix this?

393
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,356
[SEIYA]
I met Latifah a long time ago.

394
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:55,389
[MOFFLE]
Moff?

395
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:56,789
[SEIYA]
When I was a kid.

396
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:58,923
I wandered into
the garden by mistake...

397
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:02,056
She was sitting there crying.

398
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,189
[SEIYA]
When I asked her what was wrong,

399
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:08,889
she told me some story
about a sorcerer's curse...

400
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:11,556
and how she was really lonely.

401
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:12,789
[MOFFLE]
She told you?

402
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:13,889
[SEIYA]
Yeah.

403
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:16,189
I wanted her to stop crying

404
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,023
so I showed her my impression of
the legendary Prince Shotoku‐

405
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,489
[MOFFLE]
What‐?! I wanna see!

406
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:20,423
[SEIYA]
Not now.

407
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:21,489
[MOFFLE]
(angry spit)

408
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:23,389
[SEIYA]
What's your problem?

409
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:24,423
As I was saying,

410
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:25,723
I was so desperate to put

411
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,389
a smile on her face that day.

412
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:28,823
But I failed.

413
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:30,956
[MOFFLE]
You failed?

414
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:34,556
[SEIYA]
Well, she did smile
when she saw my impression...

415
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,823
...but it was a sad smile.

416
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:41,356
Like she was just trying
to make me feel better.

417
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,589
[MOFFLE]
That's the
kind of person she is.

418
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,256
[SEIYA]
When I saw that...

419
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:50,089
I promised Latifah that
I would find a way to save her.

420
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:56,789
[SEIYA]
Come to think of it...

421
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,523
I was noticing that she looks
exactly the same

422
00:19:58,623 --> 00:20:01,323
as she did when I first met her
all those years ago.

423
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:04,523
Do the people of Maple Land
just not age or something?

424
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:08,089
[MOFFLE]
Latifah's a special case.

425
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:12,689
That curse does more
than make her weak.

426
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:14,556
[SEIYA]
(listen)

427
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:18,623
Every year, it erases a whole
year's worth of memories and
physical growth,

428
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:20,523
which makes her eternally young.

429
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:21,389
[SEIYA]
(stunned)

430
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:22,556
Wha...?

431
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:23,923
[MOFFLE]
For more than a decade now,

432
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,556
she's been living
as a 14‐year‐old girl.

433
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:28,189
[SEIYA]
(quiet shock)

434
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:34,423
[SEIYA]
So that's why her looks
haven't changed since we met.

435
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:35,856
[MOFFLE]
That's right.

436
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:39,456
August 1st is the anniversary
of Latifah's curse.

437
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:42,656
[MOFFLE]
And when that day gets here,
she'll forget you too.

438
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:43,723
[SEIYA]
(gasp)

439
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:45,489
(choked up)

440
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,223
[SEIYA]
Who cares... if she forgets me?

441
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:54,223
[MOFFLE]
Moff?

442
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:56,089
[SEIYA]
This is my problem to solve.

443
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,556
After I was lucky enough
to be given another chance

444
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:00,123
to make Latifah smile.

445
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:01,656
[SEIYA]
I can't fail her again.

446
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:04,856
Wait and see... I can do this!

447
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:08,989
[MOFFLE]
Moff...

448
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:12,323
[SEIYA]
Why do YOU care
so much about Latifah?

449
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:15,656
Because Latifah's my niece,
of course.

450
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:16,956
[SEIYA]
Like, by blood?!

451
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,089
[MOFFLE]
Yeah. What about it?

452
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,356
[SEIYA]
(comic horror)

453
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,389
Never mind.

454
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,956
[MOFFLE]
Not long ago...

455
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,889
the plan was to take her with me
when the park closed down

456
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:27,089
and become a street performer.

457
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:30,956
[MOFFLE]
I figured a simple life
like that wouldn't be so bad.

458
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,156
Even if it couldn't
last for long.

459
00:21:34,923 --> 00:21:37,789
[MOFFLE]
I'd accepted it.

460
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:40,356
But when you showed up,
you changed my mind.

461
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:43,056
Even if we go down...

462
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:46,823
I want to fight
to the moffin' end.

463
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:48,523
[MOFFLE]
What are you gonna do?

464
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,289
[SEIYA]
(smile)

465
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,656
[SEIYA]
Right!

466
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,456
(door open)

467
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:07,823
[TRIKEN]
(pant)

468
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:08,923
I found one...!

469
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:10,989
I did it, Mr. Kanie!

470
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:13,623
We just might reach
our goal after all!

471
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,023
[SEIYA]
(happy)

472
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:55,389
[ISUZU/SEIYA]
Time for the
attractions spotlight.

473
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:58,323
[ISUZU]
Today we have
Rubrum's Chamber of Trials.

474
00:23:58,423 --> 00:24:00,356
[SEIYA]
We've been to this one before,

475
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:03,089
but I'm glad to see it's getting
more popular these days.

476
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:06,456
[ISUZU]
The traps we fell into
the first time are still intact.

477
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:08,956
Rubrum's excited to have
more work to do as well.

478
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:10,456
[SEIYA]
Are the prison cells
still there?

479
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:13,289
[ISUZU]
Yes. I hear the
hospitality's so good

480
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:16,089
that some visitors refuse
to leave at the end of the day.

481
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,456
[SEIYA]
It's not a hotel!
