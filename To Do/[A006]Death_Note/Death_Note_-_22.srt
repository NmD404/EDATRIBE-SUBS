00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:35,469
HIGUCHI (ON PHONE):
And once you're

3
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:37,536
fully convinced I'm
the real thing, you

4
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,627
and I can get married.

5
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,058
-And so, based on what
he said, Higuchi is Kira!

6
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:59,591
L (VOICEOVER): If the killing
of criminals stops now,

7
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,025
then there's no
doubt that Higuchi

8
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:03,691
is the one with Kira's powers.

9
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:08,691
However, I know Amane would
do almost anything for Light.

10
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:11,325
But to think that she
would actually go this far?

11
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:12,925
If criminals do stop
dying after this,

12
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:16,425
it will make it difficult to
determine a critical element,

13
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,091
how Kira conducts his murders.

14
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:23,091
I have to think of a plan.

15
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,358
-Misa.

16
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:26,191
How did you get
Higuchi to confess?

17
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:27,125
-Easy.

18
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:28,725
That guy's totally
in love with me.

19
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:30,791
All I had to do was
tell him I'd marry him

20
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:32,291
if he was really Kira.

21
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:36,225
Plus, I managed to convince
him that I'm the second Kira.

22
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:37,958
If I didn't say this
now, I'd probably

23
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,258
end up contradicting
my story later.

24
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:40,758
-Misa.

25
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,425
You idiot!

26
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,725
Didn't I tell you
to deny all that?

27
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:46,591
-But-- But now we know
Higuchi's Kira, right?

28
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,525
So what's the problem?

29
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:50,391
Can't we just catch him?

30
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:52,958
-I suppose this is what you
would call a victory, right

31
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:54,891
Matsuda?

32
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,558
-But right now, we
still don't know

33
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:59,125
exactly how he kills
his victims, do we?

34
00:02:59,158 --> 00:02:59,925
-Yes.

35
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:00,991
That's what I was thinking.

36
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:03,325
Before we move to
arrest Higuchi,

37
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:05,958
I want to find out
how he kills people.

38
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:09,291
-If the criminals stop dying, we
won't be able to figure it out,

39
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:10,958
unless we come up
with another idea.

40
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,025
Isn't that right?

41
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,191
-Yes.

42
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:15,191
At any rate, even if
we do arrest Higuchi,

43
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:16,691
we're not going to
do it until we're

44
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,725
certain that criminals
have stopped dying.

45
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:23,125
Let me think about
this for a moment.

46
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,725
Wedy.

47
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:25,858
WEDY (ON COMPUTER): Yeah.

48
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:27,625
-An update on the current
situation, please.

49
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:29,625
WEDY (ON COMPUTER):
Everything's going smoothly.

50
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:32,025
We should be able to track
70% of their movements

51
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:34,958
using our cameras inside
the office building.

52
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,825
-What about outside the office?

53
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:40,258
-That's not gonna be possible
with just Watari and me.

54
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,625
-What if you focus
solely on Higuchi?

55
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:43,991
-Higuchi?

56
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,758
I've only been able to enter
the houses of five of the men

57
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,891
so far, but Mido,
Namikawa, and Higuchi all

58
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:53,758
have super high tech security
systems, especially Higuchi.

59
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,558
He recently constructed
a dampening room

60
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:57,491
that shuts out any
electronic waves.

61
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,891
It took me two days just
to break into the place.

62
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:02,058
-This guy sure does
sound suspicious.

63
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,058
-Hm.

64
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:04,191
All right.

65
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,091
Then begin installing
microphones, trackers,

66
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,225
and cameras, but
not in the house.

67
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:10,591
Instead, just put
them in every car.

68
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,658
WEDY (ON COMPUTER): What?

69
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:13,058
After getting this far?

70
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:16,258
Do you know how difficult it is
to break into someone's house?

71
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,058
Besides, do you have any idea
of how many cars this guy has?

72
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,958
-(MUMBLING) He has six.

73
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:22,191
WEDY (ON COMPUTER): Fine then.

74
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:25,891
I just have to install them
in all his cars, right?

75
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:26,691
-Yes, thank you.

76
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:31,425
MISA (VOICEOVER): If Higuchi
had been bugged earlier,

77
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,791
I would have been
in big trouble.

00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:39,258
-Light.

79
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,491
I'm sorry to keep coming
back to this topic.

80
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:44,825
I'll just get
right to the point.

81
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:46,325
-What is it?

82
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:48,191
-Do you remember?

83
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:50,591
Killing anyone, I mean?

84
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,825
-Huh?

85
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,691
Are you still going about that?

86
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:54,958
Look, I'm not Kira!

87
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,291
How many times do I--

88

answer the question.

Well, do you remember?

90

-No, I don't.

-Miso, what about you?

92
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:06,725
-I don't remember.

93
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:10,725
How could I, 'cause
I'm not Kira.

94
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:11,791
Look, Light.

95
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:14,158
Please listen to what
I'm about to say.

96
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:17,891
I'd like you to thoroughly
analyze my current theory.

97
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:21,291
This could determine the way in
which we end up catching Kira.

98
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,625
Light Yagami used to be Kira.

99
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:30,058
Kira's power has somehow
passed onto another person.

100
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:33,491
Light Yagami now has no
memory of ever being Kira.

101
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,425
I need your analysis based
on these assumptions.

102
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,625
Do you think you
can do that for me?

103
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:40,291
-Yeah.

104
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:41,091
I'll give it a try.

105
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,658
-Light Yagami used to be Kira.

106
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:49,025
Kira's power has somehow
passed onto another person.

107
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,425
Was that because Light
Yagami wanted it to happen,

108
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,125
or was there someone
else in control

109
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:54,758
of Light, lurking in
the background, who

110
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,158
gave him the power?

111
00:05:56,191 --> 00:06:00,025
Was it that person who passed
Light's powers to someone else?

112
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,025
-Given your premise,
it would be my will.

113
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,858
-Yes, of course.

114
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:25,091
If there is a third
party with the ability

115
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,291
to bestow or
transfer Kira's power

116
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,391
and they didn't want their
method to be discovered,

117
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,791
it makes no sense that
they would wait so long

118
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,325
to transfer it from
you to the next Kira.

119
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:37,625
If we believe that this was the
work of some being watching us

120
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,391
from above, then
we'd have to accept

121
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:41,458
that they are
impossible to catch, not

122
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,725
to mention I'd already be dead.

123
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:45,625
Or at the very
least, I'm being made

124
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:47,791
to be a fool by
eternally dancing

125
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,458
in the palm of someone's hand.

126
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:52,558
It's highly unlikely
that such a being exists.

127
00:06:55,525 --> 00:07:01,158
Even if Light Yagami
was Kira, Kira's power

128
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:04,658
can be transferred by the will
of the person who possesses it.

129
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,325
Thank you, Light.

130
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:10,291
I can now say that
I feel 99% better.

[music playing]

132
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,358
-We'll create a
situation where Higuchi

133
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:24,791
won't be able to pass off
his power to anyone else.

134
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:26,725
We'll have him show
us how he kills.

135
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,591
-So, what are you gonna do?

136
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,991
-I'm going to trick
Higuchi using Sakura TV.

137
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:32,825
-Like a hidden camera show!

138
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:34,225
WOMAN: What?

139
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:37,225
L: We'll use the Kira special
that Demegawa airs every week.

140
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:38,591
We'll book a three
hour timeslot.

141
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,225
It'll be announced that
Kira's identity will

142
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:44,158
be revealed near the
end of the special.

143
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,125
-Would anyone actually
buy that, though?

144
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:48,458
This is Sakura TV after all.

145
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:52,158
For all we know, Higuchi might
not even watch that program.

146
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:55,591
-We'll get Namikawa to call
him and say, this is bad.

147
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,825
Turn on your TV.

148
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,958
That should be enough
to get him watching.

149
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:01,058
Higuchi will buy
it once he realizes

150
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:05,158

someone who knows his secret.

-Oh, I get it.

152
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,291
So we'll be using Aiber, then.

153
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:10,958
He'll reveal that he
was a spy all along!

154
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,858
-No, I'm afraid
you're incorrect.

155
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:16,825
We will not be using Aiber.

156
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:20,525
Whoever appears on
the show has to be

157
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:24,225
someone who Higuchi believes
he'll be able to kill.

158
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:26,758
In other words, it
has to be someone

159
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,258
whose name he can
look up easily.

160
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,025

a person like that, are we?

161

one who can do it.

-Matsu?

165
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:39,925
-Higuchi probably thinks
that you were listening in

166
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,258
on their meeting and overheard
their plan to kill people.

167
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,891
It would make sense that Misa's
manager who he thought was dead

168
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,258
is the one revealing his secret.

169
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,458
-That's right.

170
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:50,025
We'll have Sakura TV use
a voice filter and frosted

glass to protect your identity.

172
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,458
Higuchi will probably
realize from the announcement

and accidentally
reveal your face

176
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,691
from behind the frosted glass.

177
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:04,425
-Wow!

178
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,658
That sounds exciting!

179
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:07,258
L: Until the show
ends, the announcer

180
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,391
will keep saying they'll
reveal the full name of H,

181
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,358
who's acting as Kira.

182
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:12,791
-Higuchi would feel cornered.

183
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:15,391
He'd have no choice but to find
out the manager's name as soon

184
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:16,458
as possible.

185
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:19,258
We can anticipate what
actions he'll take.

186
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,291
-We'll witness his
killing method.

187
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:24,958
After that, we arrest him.

188
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,658
There is one potential
problem with this plan.

189
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:31,591
If Higuchi can kill by simply
looking at someone's face,

190
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:37,058
just like the second
Kira, Matsuda will die.

191
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:40,758
-But, considering the fact
that you're still alive,

192
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,425
and how he's pursuing Misa,
I doubt that's the case.

193
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,125
-At any rate, we're
only going to do this

194
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,391
once criminals stop dying.

195
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:47,825
We'll have to wait
for two or three

196
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,725
days to see whether
or not that happens.

197
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:51,391
In the meantime,
Matsuda will have

198
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,691
to decide if he wants to
go through with this plan.

199
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:05,225
-I don't need two or
three days to decide.

200
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:06,458
I want to do this.

201
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:30,850
-Well, I'm here.

202
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:33,017
What's with this
private meeting?

203
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,083
-Namikawa.

204
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,383
Tell me, who do
you think is Kira?

205
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:37,383
-Ha.

206
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,450
Why do you want to
know what I think?

207
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:42,217
Besides, for all I know,
it could be you, Shimura.

208
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,150
Or maybe even Mido.

209
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:46,683
-Shimura can't be Kira.

210
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:48,650
He was the one who came
crying to me about how

211
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:51,050
he can't go along with
Kira's crimes anymore.

212
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,050
-Really?

213
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,350
But if Mido had
turned out to be Kira,

214
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:55,150
you would have been killed.

215
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:56,383
-No.

216
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:59,083
You and Mido would have
been successful on your own.

217
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,450
There's no way
either of you would

218
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:03,050
need to hold those
stupid meetings.

219
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,217
Let alone with seven others.

220
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,617
I can at least see that much.

221
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,317
We're all cooperating
with these killings

222
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,750
because we're afraid
of Kira turning on us.

223
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,483
I mean, it's only
a matter of time

224
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,750
to until the public finds out.

225
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:17,450
And this isn't going to
stop until that happens.

226
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:19,550
-So, Shimura, let
me ask you, then,

227
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:23,150
who do you think Kira might be?

228
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,917
-Takahasi or Higuchi.

229
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,750
-No.

230
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:28,250
Takahashi is just a decoy.

231
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:31,950
Kira would make sure there are
people less clever than him.

232
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,483
-Well, then, it looks like we
all know the truth already.

233
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,150
It's Higuchi, isn't it?

234
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:38,283
-Yes.

235
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:40,017
He's the one who's the
most obsessed with money

236
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,650
and success.

237
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:44,683
He might always act as if he's
not interested in those things,

238
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,017
but that just proves
it all the more.

239
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,183
-And he always insults
everyone around him,

240
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:51,283
and can't use his people well.

241
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,083
I believe that's
why he was demoted

242
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:55,650
from being head of the
development department.

243
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:58,783
By the way, I meant to ask-- was
I the only one you invited her?

244
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:01,450
-I also invited
Ooi, but he said you

245
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:04,517
can hold your stupid private
meetings by yourself.

246
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,483
Go figure.

247
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,417
-Heh.

248
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,350
Good old Ooi, always
the blunt one.

249
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:11,250
-We can also rule out Kida
as a possible suspect,

250
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:13,983
as he was the one who provided
the account for funds in order

251
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,817
to commission Coil.

252
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,950
-Namikawa.

253
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:19,183
During that first meeting
after Hatori died,

254
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:20,717
you got a call on
your cell phone.

255
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,450
I was wondering who it was from.

256
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:26,283
-You know, Shimura, you
really are a sharp one.

257
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:28,683
Kira probably selected
you because he

258
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:29,983
appreciates your caution.

259
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:33,817
[phone ringing] Hm.

260
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:38,550
Namikawa speaking.

261
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,417
-It's L. Before I go
on, are you by yourself?

262
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,817
-No.

263
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,350
LIGHT (ON PHONE): Then just act
like it's a normal call again.

264
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:46,650
-I don't think there's
any need for that.

265
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,517
One of the people
here with me was just

266
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,683
expressing his suspicions
about your last phone call.

267
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:52,917
-Who is that on the line?

268
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,283
Namikawa?

269
00:12:54,317 --> 00:13:01,917
-It's L. L, Mido and
Shimura are here as well.

270
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,183
I'm reasonable certain that
neither of them are Kira.

271
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,583
In fact, they seem fed
up with it at this point.

272
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:08,050
I'll speak for them
and say they'll

273
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,850
choose to stand back and watch
your face-off with Kira, like I

274
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,650
plan to.

275
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,017
-That's fine.

276
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,783
Tonight, I'm gonna catch Kira.

277
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:18,183
But I'll need a favor from you.

278
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:20,617
-Hm?

279
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,350
Then it's the end for Higuchi.

280
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:23,050
-What?

281
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,317
You know that it's him?

282
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,550
-Ha!

283
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,050
So even the great
L can be tricked.

284
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,383
Based on your reaction,
I'm now 100% certain

285
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,483
that Higuchi is Kira.

286
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:34,883
-Namikawa's pretty smart, huh?

287
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,617
But then, I always thought he
was, from looking at his face.

288
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,583
I guess this proves it.

289
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,583
-No.

290
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:42,350
That was just because
Light messed up.

291
00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:45,817
-I'm baiting Higuchi with a
staged TV special tonight.

292
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,450
Sakura TV.

293
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:50,550
A few minutes into the program,
I want you to contact Higuchi,

294
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,717
tell him to tune in.

295
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,317
Do that for me, and
I won't go after you,

296
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,650
or any of the other five.

297
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:58,883
As for the others,
Kida, Takahasi, and Ooi,

298
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,850
if they try to do anything,
make sure to stop them.

299
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:02,417
-All right.

300
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,117
I understand.

301
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:09,417
It seems it really was Higuchi.

302
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,350
He'll be captured tonight.

303
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,783
Apparently.

304
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:15,483
[laughter]

305
00:14:15,517 --> 00:14:17,117
-It's been about
three days since I

306
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,217
stopped killing criminals.

307
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,150
That should be good
enough, shouldn't it?

308
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,617
Now, when I marry Misa
Amane, the second Kira,

309
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,883
I'll have the Shinigami eyes.

310
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,150
With that power in
my hands, Yotsuba

311
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,283
will be under my control.

312
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:35,183
[laughter]

313
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:40,250
[phone ringing]

314
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,817
-Higuchi, we've got a problem.

315
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,950
Turn on the television.

316
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,850
Check out Sakura TV.

317
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,850
-Hm?

318
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:49,617
-So you're saying one of
those people is Kira, right?

319
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,750
-(MODIFIED VOICE) Yes.

320
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:53,017
I've got a lot of
evidence to prove it, too.

321
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,250
-What the hell is this?

322
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:55,650
Come in, it's probably a hoax.

323
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,383
This is Sakura TV.

324
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:58,417
-No, it's more than that.

325
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,917
At the beginning
of the show he said

326
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,250
that he overheard a meeting.

327
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:03,617
Between eight people.

328
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,650
-What?

329
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:05,717
Someone who knows
about the meetings?

330
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,617
Who is it?

331
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,917
Did someone betray us?

332
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,083
-(MODIFIED VOICE) Then one
of them was killed by Kira,

333
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,817
and now there are
only seven left.

334
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,150
The man who died was Mr. H.

335
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:15,383
-(VOICEOVER) Mr. H?

336
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,717
Hatori.

337
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,950
If he knows this much, he
could be one of the other six.

338
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:21,350
No, maybe it's Coil.

339
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,483
(MODIFIED VOICE) Mr. H wanted
to leave the meetings, and was

340
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,917
killed by Kira because of that.

341
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,850
-(VOICEOVER) No, it can't
be any of the others.

342
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,950
There's no benefit
for them to do this.

343
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,417
But no one else knows about
the meetings, do they?

344
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,783
Dammit, who is it?

345
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:34,750
What?

346
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:35,317
Wait.

347
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,683
Could it be--

348
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:37,650
-Huh?

349
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:40,117
Oh!

350
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,083
Ah!

351
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:43,017
-It's-- it's him!

352
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,017
-Cover him up!

353
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,450
Cover him up!

354
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:47,317
-It's Misa's manager.

355
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,883
Matsui.

356
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:48,583
That's his name.

357
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:49,850
Why is he still alive?

358
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:53,983
NAMIKAWA (ON
PHONE): He explained

359
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:56,117
earlier that he thought
he was going to be killed.

360
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,117
He pretended to fall out
of the apartment window

361
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,783
and escaped to a balcony
a few floors below.

362
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:03,050
-(VOICEOVER) But that can't be.

363
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,783
Just to be careful, I
went home that night

364
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:06,217
and wrote his name
in the notebook

365
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,117
like it was written
on his business card.

366
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,050
Why is he still alive, then?

367
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,683
Could he be a former
entertainer who

368
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:14,017
became a manager
using his stage name?

369
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,783
Is that possible?

370
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,350
-If that weren't
bad enough, he said

371
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:19,883
that he continued to investigate
Yotsuba up until now,

372
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,250
and he's figured out
which one of us is Kira.

373
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:25,550
I'm contacting everyone
right now to let them now.

374
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,317
-All right.

375
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,483
We'll talk later.

376
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:30,850
MAN (ON TV): Sir, we're terribly
sorry for that accident.

377
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:32,183
Are you all right?

378
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:33,750
We can stop, if you want.

379
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:34,850
-(MODIFIED VOICE) No.

380
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,617
I knew I was gonna be in
danger going into this.

381
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,017
This is for the sake
of justice, so I'll

382
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,283
see it through to the end,
even if it means my death.

383
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,183
-Yeah, that's perfect.

384
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:46,617
Listen, just be sure to hold
off on the Kira announcement

385
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,183
until the last
minute, all right?

386
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,317
-I have to kill him!

387
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,917
Calm down.

388
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,950
Misa knows his face, so
if she's the second Kira,

389
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:59,417
she should know what
his real name is.

390
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,317
[phone ringing]

391
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,683
-It's him.

392
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:05,683
[beeping]

393
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:07,083
-Oh, what the hell?

394
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,117
-(MODIFIED VOICE) To be honest,
I've been debating for a long

395
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,317
time whether or not I should
make this announcement.

396
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,750
But now that I'm
here, I know I've

397
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,417
done the right thing
in coming forward.

398
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,550
-This is bad.

399
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,317
Who knows then he'll
make the announcement?

400
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,517
MAN (ON TV): Kira's identity
will be announced soon.

401
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,617
[phone ringing]

402
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,050
WOMAN (ON TV): Cosme
Misa, a devilish charm.

403
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,783
An angel's glitter.

404
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:31,083
Misa's new line of
lipstick, just for you.

405
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,283
-Mido, it's me.

406
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,883
Are you watching Sakura TV?

407
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,383
Why don't you call your father
in the House of Counselors?

408
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,683
Have him pull some strings
at the Ministry of Internal

409
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:40,517
Affairs to stop this broadcast.

410
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,783
-I'm watching, but I don't
think we could stop it.

411
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:44,850
No one believes this
program, so we'd only

412
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:47,883
make ourselves look
suspicious if we stop it.

413
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,450
Besides, there shouldn't
be anything to worry about.

414
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,550
The guy revealed
his face earlier.

415
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:56,083
Everyone knows it's
really Taro Matsui.

416
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,383
Namikawa's already gone
ahead and told everyone

417
00:17:58,417 --> 00:17:59,417
to watch the show.

418
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,550
Since one of us
seven has to be Kira,

419
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,150
that should mean Taro
Matsui will soon be dead.

420
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:04,817
Right?

421
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,950
-(VOICEOVER) Of course.

422
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:08,217
I'm the only one who
knows, or even suspects

423
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,183
that Taro Matsui
isn't his real name.

424
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:13,583
That means if I
say anything, it'll

425
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,250
reveal the fact that I'm Kira.

426
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:18,383
Yeah.

427
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,083
It's true.

428
00:18:19,117 --> 00:18:21,417
I'll talk to you later.

429
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,650
-Stay tuned to Sakura TV.

430
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:25,850
-Dammit!

431
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:27,083
WATARI: Ryuzaki.

432
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:29,717
Mogi is in position in front
of Yoshida productions.

433
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,917
He's just received
a call from Higuchi.

434
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,783
-Yes, it's time for phase two.

435
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:34,883
Everything's as planned.

436
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:35,450
HIGUCHI: Moji.

437
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:36,483
Where's Misa?

438
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,117
MOJI: Oh, Mr. Higuchi.

439
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,417
Pleasure to hear from you.

440
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,117
I'm sorry, but Misa Misa's
taking a much needed vacation

441
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,350
right now.

442
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:44,917
She should be back by, oh,
tomorrow morning, though.

443
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,017
You can reach her then.

444
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,317
HIGUCHI: I'm asking
you where she is now.

445
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,917
MOJI: Well, that's
private information.

446
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,383
She's requested that no
one know where she is.

447
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,583
I'm very sorry.

448
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:55,750
I'll have her contact you
tomorrow, first thing.

449
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:56,517
-(VOICEOVER) Damn!

450
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,850
I know his face.

451
00:18:57,883 --> 00:19:01,550
I could kill him at any time,
if only I knew his name.

452
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,617
Do you know if
Misa's former manager

453
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,050
was an entertainer
at some point?

454
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,250
-Come again?

455
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:08,050
HIGUCHI (ON PHONE): I'm
talking about Taro Matsui!

456
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,417
-Oh.

457
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,983
I was only recently hired, so
I don't know much about him.

458
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,417
If you need some
information, I can

459
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,083
let you talk to someone
from the office.

460
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:16,317
I just remembered.

461
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,950
Everyone's in Okinawa
at the moment.

462
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:19,783
You could try calling
the president, though.

463
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:22,117
-This is going
exactly as I planned.

464
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,483
It's almost scary.

465
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:25,050
-You shouldn't be scared, Light.

466
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,283
You should be happy.

467
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:28,117
WATARI: I'm patching
you in to Higuchi's call

468
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,917
with the president of
Yoshida Productions.

469
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,883
HIGUCHI: This is
Higuchi from Yotsuba.

470
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:34,483
That manager's real name
isn't Taro Matsui, is it?

471
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:36,217
-He's not even
pretending to hide

472
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,650
what he's asking
about now, is he?

473
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:39,050
Stupid Higuchi.

474
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,483
-If he's acting like that, it's
proof he's beginning to panic.

475
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:42,683
-Then what was his real name?

476
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,350
PRESIDENT (ON PHONE):
I think it Yamada.

477
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,217
No.

478
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,850
Wait.

479
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:46,717
Yamashida.

480
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,950
Yeah.

481
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:50,817
And his first name was--
I'm sorry, I can't remember.

482
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,183
-Don't screw with me!

483
00:19:52,217 --> 00:19:54,250
Why the hell can't you remember
the names of the people you

484
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:55,083
hire!?

485
00:19:55,117 --> 00:19:56,317
PRESIDENT (ON PHONE): All right.

486
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,117
No need for that
kind of language.

487
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,650
I've got his personnel
file back at the office.

488
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,550
-Then go back there and get it.

489
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,483
PRESIDENT (ON PHONE):
You gotta be kidding me.

490
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:05,683
Give me a break.

491
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,750
We're on our first company
vacation in two years!

492
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:10,417
If you wanna know
that badly, I'll

493
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,217
give you the pin code
for the office lock.

494
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,283
You can go in yourself
and look it up.

495
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:15,683
How's that?

496
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:17,850
The personnel files are in the
desk in the back to the left.

497
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,683
You'll find them filed
in the bottom drawer.

498
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,450
They should all be
sorted alphabetically.

499
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:24,317
But I'm pretty sure
it was Yamashida.

500
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,617
-(VOICEOVER) If they're going
to announce it at the end

501
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,217
of the program, that
means I have two hours.

502
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,217
-So what's he gonna do?

503
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,050
-I see Higuchi.

504
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,050
He's only carrying a single bag.

505
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:02,017
I'm in pursuit.

506
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,450
-Everything's still
going according to plan.

507
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:04,950
-Yes.

508
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,417
-(VOICEOVER) I'll kill him.

509
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,883
I'll kill him no matter what.

510
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:13,817
I've come this far.

511
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,317
I won't let them stop me.

512
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,083
I'm not giving up until
I have everything.

513
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:22,050
[maniacal laughter]

514
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:41,955
[theme music]

515
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:52,688
HIGUCHI: With these
eyes, I'm invincible!

516
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:53,955
MAN: Higuchi has a gun on him!

517
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:54,921
The chief has been shot.

518
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:56,055
MISA: This isn't
sounding very good.

519
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:56,721
CHIEF YAGAMI: Higuchi.

520
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:57,688
Hold it right there.

521
00:22:57,721 --> 00:22:58,488
DEMEGAWA: With this
show, I'm gonna

522
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:00,555
have 100% ratings for sure!

523
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,988
HIGUCHI: I made it in time.
