[theme music]

2
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:38,649
MAN: Hey.

3
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,271
I thought we were supposed to
be meeting every other week.

4
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:42,738
Not this often.

5
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:43,804
-It can't be helped.

6
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,838
We just received a
new report from Coil.

7
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:51,071
He says that Misa Amane might
know L. According to Coil,

8
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,438
L once questioned Amane as
part of his Kira investigation.

9
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,704
But see, here's the problem.

10
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:58,638
He says, I've been
able to deduce

11
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:01,504
that Amane worships Kira.

12
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,071
At the moment,
Yoshida Productions

13
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:06,004
is trying to promote Amane
as the new face of Yotsuba.

14
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:09,604
My recommendation is that
Yotsuba use her for the next ad

15
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,538
campaign and take
the opportunity

16
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,538
to extract information
about L. Personally,

17
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:15,971
I don't like the idea.

18
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:18,004
It's unacceptable,
if you ask me.

19
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,404
-Oh really?

20
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,304
It seems like a
perfectly good plan.

21
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:24,071
-I don't think that's what
Ooi was trying to say.

22
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:27,504
It's supposed to be Coil's job
to investigate L's identity.

23
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:30,104
It doesn't make sense for him to
leave all the hard work to us,

24
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:31,904
in my opinion.

25
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:33,104
-Exactly.

26
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:36,204
We're paying him to uncover
L's identity, after all.

27
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:39,604
-Why don't we contact Coil
and see what he has to say?

28
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:40,271
MAN: Yes.

29
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:41,338
That's a good idea.

30
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,071
-Mr. Kida.

31
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:46,371
I thought we agreed
before that you'd only

32
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:47,938
call me if it was urgent.

33
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,004
So, is it an emergency?

34
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,438
Yes, I understand.

35
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,704
In that case, I think I
have an even better idea.

36
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:00,171
HIGUCHI: Even after
those meetings are over,

37
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,538
I have to come home
to punish criminals.

38
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:05,304
Being Kira is so time consuming.

39
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:08,804
But things sure have become
more interesting lately.

40
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:12,138
It's pretty clear that Misa
Amane was the second Kira,

41
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,938
and that L must've
caught her at some point.

42
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:17,304
The only way she could've
gotten out of that situation

43
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:19,671
is by forfeiting ownership
of her Death Note

44
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:23,204
and losing all memories
of what she did with it.

45
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:26,738
I'm not about to leave
things as they are.

46
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,404
I'm going to make
Misa Amane my wife.

47
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:29,904
-Huh?

48
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,371
-Everything I could ever want.

49
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:41,438
Money, power, and
a beautiful wife.

50
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,838
That'll be enough to
make anyone envious.

51
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:47,804
Once we're married, I'll
just invest a large lump sum

52
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:50,738
in her life insurance.

53
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:55,104
REM (VOICEOVER): She would never
marry such a disgusting fool.

54
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:56,338
-Rem.

55
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:58,271
Make sure you hide the
notebook in the usual place.

56
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:10,771
REM (VOICEOVER): Right
now, this is the only thing

57
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:11,971
I can do, for Misa's sake.

58
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:16,838
L: All right.

59
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,138
Let's try again, from the top.

60
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,471
-Tell me, Misa.

61
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,704
Is it true you once said that
you came to Tokyo in order

62
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:24,304
to meet Kira?

63
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:25,204
-What?

64
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:26,338
-Misa.

65
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:27,404
Please stop overacting.

66
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,904
It looks too cheesy,
not to mention fake.

67
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,038
-Huh?

68
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,338
But I thought that was
a realistic performance.

69
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,338
-Just do it again.

70
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:36,738
-Whatever you say,
oh so great director.

71
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:38,971
-If you don't get serious
about this, I'll kick you.

72
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:39,471
-Hmph.

73
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:45,171
-Uh, Misa Misa?

74
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:47,171
-You're not smiling
enough, Motchi!

75
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,804
And you can just call
me Misa, you know.

76
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,571
MOGI (VOICEOVER): I'm
not cut out for this,

77
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:56,471
but it's part of my
job, so-- Misa-Misa!

78
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,938
-What is it, Motchi?

79
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,571
-(EXCITEDLY) Today you have
an interview with the Yotsuba

80
00:04:59,604 --> 00:05:01,771
group to see if they'll use
you in their new ad campaign.

81
00:05:01,804 --> 00:05:03,971
But remember, this is also
an infiltration mission,

82
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,371
so stay sharp!

83
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:06,571
-Don't you worry.

84
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:07,838
I already know about that.

85
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:09,538
And of course, that
means you can't

86
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:11,038
let your cover fall either.

87
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:13,671
You're gonna play the character
of the hyper-energetic manager,

88
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:14,138
OK?

89
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:14,671
-Right!

90
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:16,038
Bring it on!

91
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:16,538
Hooah!

92
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:21,171
MAN: Sorry to keep you waiting.

93
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,704
-Good morning!

94
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:26,171
I'm Misa Misa's manager, Kanichi
Moji, also known as Motchi!

95
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:27,971
-Mr. Ooi, Mr. Shimura.

96
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:29,471
It's so nice to see you again.

97
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:30,471
-Good luck, Misa Misa!

98
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:31,871
MISA (VOICEOVER):
Way to go, Motchi.

99
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:33,271
You're a natural.

100
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:36,038
-I'll be here ready to celebrate
when they decide to hire you!

101
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,438
I don't think I'm
cut out for this.

102
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:46,871
-Now then.

103
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,838
I don't believe you and I
have met before, have we Miso?

104
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,204
My name is John Wallace.

105
00:05:51,238 --> 00:05:54,104
I'm the executive adviser for
the advertising department.

106
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:54,938
Nice to meet you.

107
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:55,804
-Thank you!

108
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:57,904
I'm very pleased
to meet you too!

109
00:05:57,938 --> 00:05:59,771
-Well, this might seem
a little bit sudden,

110
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:01,638
but I'd like to be
honest with you.

111
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,004
We've been talking about
it, and we've pretty much

112
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:05,971
decided to hire you already.

113
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:07,971
But before we make
it official, we'd

114
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,271
like to clarify a few things.

115
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:11,071
-Yes?

116
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,471
-We've been doing a little
background check on you,

117
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:15,271
and according to our
sources, a burglar

118
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:16,904
killed your parents
during a robbery.

119
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:19,604
You worship Kira because
he killed the suspect.

120
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,604
Isn't it true that
you came to Tokyo

121
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,938
in hopes of finding
and meeting Kira?

122
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:25,471
-Uh, what?

123
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:28,138
Who did you hear that from?

124
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:29,504
-I'm afraid I can't answer that.

125
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:33,138
The information is reliable,
and now I'd say it's confirmed.

126
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:35,538
The look in your face tells
me that these are the facts.

127
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,204
-Coil.

128
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:41,738
I never thought you
investigated that far.

129
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:43,138
-Also.

130
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:46,171
You're still hiding something
from us, aren't you?

131
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:49,171
Something you'd prefer
the world not to know.

132
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:54,671
MISA (VOICEOVER): OK.

133
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:57,771
Here's where I pause
and look nervous.

134
00:06:57,804 --> 00:06:59,904
-It seems you were
detained by the detective L

135
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,671
for a short period of time.

136
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,671
We'd like you to tell us
the full story of what

137
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:04,971
really happened.

138
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:07,238
It would be a problem if
the new face of Yotsuba

139
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:08,904
turned out to be Kira.

140
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:10,104
-Yes.

141
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,771
We would appreciate it if
you were honest with us.

142
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:13,338
-All right.

143
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:15,171
I understand.

144
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:18,438
I'll tell you everything.

145
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,238
Yes.

146
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,871
I was held for questioning.

147
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,804
I didn't think it
was L, but he did

148
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:25,971
ask me lots of
questions about Kira.

149
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:29,204
But I'm not the second
Kira, and I never was.

150
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:31,604
I was released because he
realised I didn't have anything

151
00:07:31,638 --> 00:07:34,038
to do with Kira after all.

152
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:37,238
-Did you manage to see who it
was that was restraining you?

153
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:38,171
-No.

154
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,604
I was blindfolded
the whole time.

155
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:41,738
-But if he asked you
questions, surely you

156
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:43,704
heard his voice, right?

157
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,738
-Only through a speaker
and voice filter, so--

158
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:47,038
-Come on.

159
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:48,238
What the hell is this anyway?

160
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:51,104
A job interview or a
police interrogation?

161
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,038
How long are we
gonna keep this up?

162
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,504
I'm going to the bathroom.

163
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:55,704
-He has a point.

164
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:58,171
It seems the interview
veered a little off track.

165
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,938
We're very sorry.

166
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:06,104
Excuse me, but would you mind if
I went to the bathroom as well?

167
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:08,738
This is getting exhausting.

168
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:10,871
But everything's
going well so far.

169
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,138
I just have to keep it up.

170
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:22,804
REM (VOICEOVER): Being
touched by this scrap of paper

171
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:25,571
alone will not restore her
memories of the Death Note,

172
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:29,371
but at least now Misa
can see me once again.

173
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:30,904
MISA (VOICEOVER):
What is this thing?

174
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:33,538
Some kind of monster?

175
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:34,671
-Misa.

176
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:36,871
You're in a dangerous
situation right now.

177
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:40,771
There are people within Yotsuba
who can easily have you killed.

178
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:43,171
I've come here to warn you.

179
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:44,938
Calm down and listen to me.

180
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,104
MISA (VOICEOVER): Calm down?

181
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:47,171
How can I?

182
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:50,704
This thing looks like
it's gonna kill me.

183
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,638
-Please believe me.

184
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,104
I'm your ally.

185
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:55,396
MISA (VOICEOVER): My ally?

186
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,204
-Oh, man, I wonder if
Misa Misa's all right.

187
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,104
Maybe we should've wired
her or used something

188
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:02,438
to track her movements.

189
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:03,971
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Just as I thought.

190
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:06,704
The Kira before I was
detained and the one that

191
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:07,938
surfaced afterwards.

192
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:09,338
They must be two
different people.

193
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,838
The MO clearly doesn't match.

194
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:13,871
This Kira is killing
criminals as soon as they've

195
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:18,171
had their crime broadcast on
TV, regardless of the situation.

196
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:21,071
He's punishing people who
never intended to kill.

197
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:23,671
Those who sincerely regretted
their crimes or people

198
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:26,071
with excusable circumstances.

199
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:30,171
To original Kira would've never
punished those kinds of people.

200
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:34,971
That's the sort of distinction
I'd make if I were him.

201
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:38,404
The way the original
Kira acted is

202
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:40,104
disturbingly close to my ideals.

203
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:45,804
What the hell am I thinking?

204
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,104
I'm not Kira.

205
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:48,571
Something's got to
be wrong with me

206
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:52,304
if I'm seriously comparing
myself to that murder.

207
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:55,538
-Light Yagami is Kira.

208
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:56,504
Tell me.

209
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:59,271
What is Light doing
at the moment?

210
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:02,204
[mumbling]

211
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:09,338
-Wha-- What are you?

212
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:11,304
I mean, I can tell
you're not a stalker,

213
00:10:11,338 --> 00:10:14,238
but-- but you don't look
like a human at all.

214
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:15,738
-No, of course not.

215
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:18,938
I am a Shinigami.

216
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:21,404
Before you were
captured by L, you and I

217
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:22,638
worked closely together.

218
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,338
-What are you talking about?

219
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:25,804
I don't understand.

220
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:29,671
You know me and Light is Kira?

221
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:31,804
-The Death Note.

222
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:34,904
It grants its owner the
power to kill someone simply

223
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,071
by writing that
person's name in it.

224
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:42,604
Light Yagami took
it upon himself

225
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:45,338
to punish criminals
using that notebook.

226
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:47,604
He soon became known
to the world as Kira.

227
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:53,871
You also possess
that same power.

228
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:57,738
In fact, your ability was
even greater than his.

229
00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:00,938
You managed to find
Light by using your power

230
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:03,604
to determine that he
was, in fact, Kira.

231
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:05,138
-Light is Kira?

232
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:07,471
And I'm the second Kira?

233
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:08,438
REM: That's right.

234
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:11,171
Or rather, that
used to be the case.

235
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,071
Light arranged it so you
would both lose this power.

236
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:16,871
This was all
according to his plan.

237
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:18,271
-He did?

238
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:21,071
Then Ryuzaki was right.

239
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:24,804
-Misa, do you still love
Light enough to die for him?

240
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:29,671
-Unbelievable.

241
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:31,338
You've got to be
telling the truth.

242
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:34,304
You already know
everything about me.

243
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:37,338
I totally believe you now.

244
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:39,871
And yes, I do love him.

245
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:41,171
To death.

246
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:43,638
Not to mention how amazing
it is that Light and I were

247
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:44,871
both Kira.

248
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,638
Of course I'd want to
believe something like that.

249
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:50,171
I only wish I could remember it.

250
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:52,771
-You haven't changed, Misa.

251
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:55,138
And it seems your
feelings for Light

252
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:57,404
will never change, either.

253
00:11:57,438 --> 00:12:00,638
It's enough to convince me that
the only way you can be truly

254
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:04,571
happy in life is if you can
support him in his plan.

255
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:06,771
-Thank you, Shinigami.

256
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:08,104
-It's Rem.

257
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:11,638
The current Kira is a vile
and pathetic human being.

258
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:14,204
I don't know what
he's capable of.

259
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:18,204
Be careful, and beware of
the others from Yotsuba.

260
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,271
Trust Light.

261
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:21,504
Let him do whatever
he feels necessary.

262
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,232
-OK.

263
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:23,830
I got it.

264
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:26,071
I guess I should just act normal
in the meantime though, right?

265
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:27,471
REM: That's right.

266
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:29,238
When you go back
to the interview,

267
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:32,804
you will be able to see for
yourself who the real Kira is.

268
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:36,838
Be on your guard,
and do not trust him.

269
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,871
-Oh my gosh, I'm so
sorry I took so long.

270
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:40,538
I was just fixing up
my makeup a little.

271
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,238
REM: Listen.

272
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:46,638
When you return, I
will be in the room.

273
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:50,438
The man sitting in front
of me will be Kira.

274
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,704
-(VOICEOVER) The person
in front of you is Kira.

275
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:04,838
Higuchi's Kira?

276
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:05,671
That bastard!

277
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:23,776
-Misa Misa sure is late.

278
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,209
[door closing]

279
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:25,776
-Hm?

280
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,642
-They're back.

281
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:30,442
-Hey!

282
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,109
I'm exhausted.

283
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:33,742
-Hey.

284
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:34,976
-How did it go?

285
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,742
-Yotsuba agreed to hire Misa
on as their spokesperson

286
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,709
for the new ad campaign.

287
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:40,376
L: I see.

288
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:41,809
That's good to hear.

289
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:45,209
-And I made sure to give
them my cell phone number.

290
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,876
Would you believe three out of
seven guys already messaged me

291
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:49,642
asking for a private date?

292
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:50,576
-What?

293
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:52,276
-So now I accept
their invitations

294
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:53,709
and investigate them, right?

295
00:13:53,742 --> 00:13:55,309
Oh, it's going
exactly as I planned.

296
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:56,342
LIGHT: No.

297
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,842
The plan's getting
canceled right now.

298
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:58,342
-Huh?

299
00:13:58,376 --> 00:13:59,509
But why.

300
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,342
Everything's been going
so smoothly up until now.

301
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:04,609
-If w go any further,
you'll be in danger.

302
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:07,009
You can still appear
in their commercials,

303
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:09,342
but from now on you should
deny that you were suspecting

304
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:12,942
of being the second Kira,
and was detained by Lo.

305
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:15,109
Mogi will continue
being your bodyguard,

306
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:17,276
but you'll be working
solely as a celebrity.

307
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,542
-If that's what you want,
Light, then that's what I'll do.

308
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:26,909
Oh, well.

309
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:27,942
I'm feeling pretty tired.

310
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:29,209
Tomorrow's shoot is
bright and early,

311
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:31,676
so I'd better get some sleep.

312
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,309
(VOICEOVER) Thank you, Light.

313
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:36,176
You're so sweet to
be worried about me.

314
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,042
But I've thought of
the best plan ever.

315
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,009
I'm gonna be useful to you.

316
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:41,776
I promise.

317
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:46,342
Hey, Light?

318
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:48,609
Wanna come sleep
with me tonight?

319
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:50,376
-Wh-- what are
you talking about?

320
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:51,576
-Just kidding.

321
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:53,842
You're saving it for after
we catch Kira, right?

322
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,776
You don't have to
be shy about it.

323
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:56,742
-Hm?

324
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:57,776
-Yes, Light.

325
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,376
There's no need to be shy.

326
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:00,809
-I'm not being shy.

327
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:04,442
-No need to be so
serious, either.

328
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:06,442
DIRECTOR: Cut!

329
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:08,076
OK, that's a wrap.

330
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:09,409
-Good work, everyone!

331
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,176
-Good job!

332
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,242
Thanks a lot, Miss Amane!

333
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,042
-Great job, Misa Misa.

334
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:14,242
-Thanks, Motchi.

335
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:16,176
Can you take me to the
restroom in that hospital?

336
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,176
-No problem.

337
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,242
I'll be waiting!

338
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:21,442
-I'll be sure not to
take too long, OK?

339
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,276
WOMAN: Yes?

340
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:28,209
Misa.

341
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:29,909
You actually made it.

342
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:33,276
-Nori, you look so cute
in that nurse's outfit.

343
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:34,609
-You really think so?

344
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:42,409
-That went well.

345
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,909
What an amazing car.

346
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,109
-If you like it, I'll
give you a ride anytime.

347
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:57,242
Or buy you one of your own.

348
00:15:57,276 --> 00:16:00,342
By the way, loving that
nurse's outfit, Misa.

349
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,442
MISA: I'm glad you like it.

350
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,342
-That took a while.

351
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:06,709
[giggling]

352
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:13,842
-Ah!

353
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:14,809
Where's Misa?

354
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,076
-She's on a date.

355
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,209
-You've got to be kiddin'.

356
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:31,676
-(VOICEOVER) Kyosuke Higuchi.

357
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:33,476
The sleazy pervert
who's been sending me

358
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:35,509
text messages ever
since that party.

359
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:38,776
He's been even more persistent
than any of the other guys.

360
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,209
He's Kira?

361
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:43,542
It can't get any
worse than that.

362
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:44,342
HIGUCHI: Hey, Misa?

363
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:45,442
-Huh?

364
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:47,909
HIGUCHI: How about we
grab a bite to eat?

365
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:50,909
-Are you planning to take me
somewhere and do pervy things

366
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:51,842
to me?

367
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:54,076
Well, even if you
are, that's OK.

368
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:54,776
I'll be fine.

369
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:55,709
Since I can kill people.

370
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,109
(VOICEOVER) What are
you saying, Misa?

371
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:03,476
Is this part of
Light Yagami's plan?

372
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:05,776
Is this what he wants you to do?

373
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,376
Or is this your
way of telling me

374
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,709
that you want me to kill
Higuchi the moment he

375
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,242
tries to do anything?

376
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:14,942
-Come on you're just getting
with me, aren't you, Misa?

377
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:16,709
-You can kill people?

378
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:17,209
-Yep.

379
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,142
It's true.

380
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:19,742
And you know why?

381
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:23,642
Because I'm the second Kira.

382
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,009
-(VOICEOVER) That can't be.

383
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:27,142
Even if she was the
second Kira before,

384
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:29,209
there's no way she still is.

385
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:31,442
She's not supposed to have
any memory of it, either.

386
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:34,576
What the hell's going on?

387
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:35,976
(OUT LOUD) Oh, Misa.

388
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,709
You don't have to make up stuff
like that to feel safe with me.

389
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:41,576
I'm sure you'll find that
I'm quite the gentleman.

390
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:43,442
-MISA: Yeah, maybe.

391
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,709
Anyway, I'll only prove
that I'm the second Kira

392
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:47,276
to the real Kira.

393
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:49,209
-You'll only show proof to Kira?

394
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,776
Why?

395
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,509
MISA: I'd show him
because it's always

396
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,676
been my dream to
become Kira's wife.

397
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:58,709
I know he'll need me by
his side once I tell him.

398
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:00,676
-(VOICEOVER) If she
really is the second Kira,

399
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:03,542
then it's pretty clear from the
Sakura TV incident that she has

400
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:05,742
the Shinigami eyes.

401
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:07,409
If that's the case,
I need to make

402
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:09,209
sure I keep this
girl by my side.

403
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:11,242
At all costs.

404
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:12,942
I've got to test her, first.

405
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:21,747
Well, since I happen to be Kira,
does that mean you'll marry me?

406
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:26,909
Hm?

407
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,876
-Really?

408
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,309
-Yeah.

409
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,142
I mean it.

410
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,076
-What?

411
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:33,276
Then prove it to me.

412
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:35,542
Come on, let's prove
it to each other.

413
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:37,109
-I can't do that.

414
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:39,276
It'd be a pretty bad idea
to let someone witness how

415
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:40,442
I kill people.

416
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:42,276
-You think so?

417
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:43,276
-I dunno.

418
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:44,809
I thought someone
was Kira, I think

419
00:18:44,842 --> 00:18:46,542
I'd be willing to show them.

420
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:49,142
We'd never get
anywhere if I didn't.

421
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:51,209
-Then why don't
you kill someone?

422
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,542
After all, I could
be the real Kira.

423
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:54,509
-All right.

424
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,776
But I only kill bad people, OK?

425
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,042
-That's right.

426
00:18:58,076 --> 00:18:59,076
Bad person, huh?

427
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:06,442
This is Ginzo Kaneboshi,
president of a major finance

428
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:07,709
company.

429
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:09,342
He's infamous for his
immoral collection methods.

430
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:12,276
Sometimes he even makes people
pay with their insurance money.

431
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:13,609
How about him?

432
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:15,842
MISA: Would you be able to
confirm his death right away?

433
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:16,542
HIGUCHI: Yeah.

434
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:17,776
As soon as I call him.

435
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:18,976
MISA: OK, then.

436
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:20,542
Could you turn around
for just a sec?

437
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:25,976
-(VOICEOVER) Misa.

438
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:29,176
You want me to kill Ginzo
Kaneboshi, don't you?

439
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,276
Then Higuchi will
believe your claim

440
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,609
about being the second Kira.

441
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,942
Very well.

442
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:36,709
-All right.

443
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,442
He should be dead by now.

444
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:43,009
HIGUCHI: Hello, this is
Higuchi from Yotsuba--

445
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,209
MAN: Sorry.

446
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:45,542
Our president just collapsed
and stopped breathing.

447
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,076
Call back later.

448
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:53,409
[beeping]

449
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,542
-Told ya.

450
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:57,842
-She killed him.

451
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:00,776
The same guy I chose
just a minute ago.

452
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:02,142
It would've been
impossible to do

453
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:04,042
that unless she had the power.

454
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:05,109
This proves it.

455
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,342
So.

456
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:16,042
If I'm Kira, you'll
marry me, right?

457
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,942
-Wha-- Hey, why are you getting
so serious all of a sudden?

458
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:20,742
-Because I'm Kira.

459
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:22,476
-Then prove it.

460
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:23,676
-Hm.

461
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:26,376
I'm not going to be able
to kill until I get home.

462
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,342
You understand?

463
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:31,409
-Oh, well, that's no good then.

464
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:33,476
For all I know, you're
just making all this up

465
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,776
so you have an excuse to
take me to your place.

466
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:36,276
Wait!

467
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:37,209
I know.

468
00:20:37,242 --> 00:20:38,409
-Huh?

469
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:40,576
-Why don't you stop killing
the criminals on TV.

470
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:41,976
That should prove it.

471
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,109
If you're Kira, it
should be no problem.

472
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,276
You can start killing
again when I tell you to.

473
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:48,409
If all the times
and deaths match up,

474
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:49,876
then I'll believe you.

475
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:51,609
After all, killing
criminals in that way

476
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:54,542
is something that
only Kira can do.

477
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:55,876
-I see what you mean.

478
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:58,576
That's a good idea.

479
00:20:58,609 --> 00:20:59,809
All right, Misa.

480
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,642
I'm Kira, so in order to
make you trust me and prove

481
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:05,742
that I'm him, I'll stop killing
criminals for the time being.

482
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:08,209
Then, once you're fully
convinced I'm the real thing,

483
00:21:08,242 --> 00:21:09,409
you and I can get married.

484
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:17,709
-And so, based on what
he said, Higuchi is Kira!

485
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:19,742
-Now we not only
know Kira's identity,

486
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:21,776
but all those deaths that
were worrying the chief

487
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:22,976
are gonna stop!

488
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:24,242
That's amazing, Misa Misa!

489
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,980
[theme music]

490
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:51,865
HIGUCHI: It's been
three days since I

491
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:53,096
stopped killing criminals.

492
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,323
That should be good enough.

493
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:57,390
Now if I marry Misa
Amane, the second Kira,

494
00:22:57,423 --> 00:22:59,890
I'll have the Shinigami eyes.

495
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:03,790
With that power, Yotsuba
will be under my control.
