[theme music]

2
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:38,843
SOICHIRO YAGAMI (ON
PHONE): Light, Ryuzaki

3
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:41,643
has decided that he'd like you
to help with the investigation.

4
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:43,143
If you're still
interested, then you

5
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:44,809
need to come here right away.

6
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:45,609
LIGHT: OK, Dad.

7
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:49,609
(VOICEOVER) All along,
I've been trying

8
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,309
to find a way to get involved
in the investigation,

9
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:54,643
but I never thought they
would actually approach me.

10
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:57,243
Now I'll have access to
classified information

11
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:59,376
about the case, which
means I can learn more

12
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,209
about this other Kira.

13
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:03,543
I need to figure out what
this impostor is all about

14
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:08,143
before someone else on the
task force beats me to it.

15
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,676
L: Thank you, Light.

16
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,009
LIGHT: Not at all.

17
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:14,176
After all, I want to catch
Kira as much as you do, Ryuga.

18
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,276
-I'll have to ask that
you call me Ryuzaki here.

19
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:17,143
-Eh?

20
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:18,443
MATSUDA: I'm Matsui.

21
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:19,709
AIZAWA: I'm Aihara.

22
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:22,409
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: And I'm Asahi.

23
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:23,976
-Yes, of course.

24
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:27,109
Then perhaps I should
call myself Light Asahi?

25
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:28,509
L: Yes, please do.

26
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:32,276
To keep things simple from this
point on, I'll call you Light.

27
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:33,876
OK, let's get down to work.

28
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:36,176
You can start by looking over
all the information we've

29
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:37,276
collected.

30
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:39,243
I'd also like you to
examine these videos.

31
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:42,109
They were sent to the TV
station but were never aired.

32
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:44,576
For security reasons, you're
not permitted to take notes,

33
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:46,876
and all materials
must remain here.

34
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:47,543
-I understand.

35
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:49,476
L: We will begin now.

36
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:51,543
[beep]

37
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,009
SOICHIRO YAGAMI
(VOICEOVER): Light.

38
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:57,909
L: Well, then.

39
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:00,209
We need to ask Light
Yagami to assist us.

40
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:02,476
However, we cannot tell
him that we're considering

41
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:04,709
the possibility
of a second Kira.

42
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:06,043
-Are you serious?

43
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:08,443
But wouldn't that make working
together a bit difficult?

44
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:09,543
AIZAWA: He's right.

45
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:12,076
Why even bother asking
him to work with us?

46
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,343
L: Well, I didn't
mean indefinitely.

47
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:16,643
I'm curious to see what his
impression of these tapes

48
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:18,676
will be prior to knowing hours.

49
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,843
Light's deductive reasoning
is really quite incredible.

50
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:23,643
He may suspect that
these tapes are

51
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:27,176
the work of a second Kira, an
impostor or copycat imitating

52
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,243
the original.

53
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:29,676
-But the basis for
the second Kira theory

54
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,509
is that the victims of
these recent killings

55
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:34,209
were minor criminals who
don't fit the normal profile.

56
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:37,143
Without hearing our explanation,
how would Light ever know that?

57
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,843
L: Yes, but there's
more to it than that.

58
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,009
-Huh?

59
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:41,976
-The suspect that we've
been pursuing up until now

60
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:45,476
has needed both a need and
a face to kill his victims.

61
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:48,009
But there is something
different happening here.

62
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:50,276
Recall that Mr. Ukita
was killed the moment

63
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:52,109
he arrived at the station.

64
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:55,143
And this Kira demanded
only that I appear on TV

65
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:57,176
but made no request for my name.

66
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,443
This implies that
the second Kira only

67
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:02,376
needs to see a person's
face to kill them.

68
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,943
So I'll ask Light to look
over all of our information,

69
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:06,343
as well as our video evidence.

70
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,109
If he comes to the
conclusion that there

71
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:09,676
could be a second
suspect, then he'd

72
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,543
be almost completely cleared
of suspicion in this case.

73
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:14,776
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: But how
will that prove anything?

74
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,276
-Logically, if he's
really Kira, he'll

75
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:19,076
want me dead, seeing
as I'm the one leading

76
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,043
the investigation
against him right now.

77
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:22,643
And the way things
are going, if I

78
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,409
comply with this new
subject's demands

79
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:26,243
and appear on TV in
three days, there's

80
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:28,776
a very good chance I will die.

81
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,409
I can't see the real
Kira jeopardizing

82
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:33,509
such an easy opportunity
to get rid of me.

83
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:34,643
-OK.

84
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,009
But are you suggesting
that if my son does not

85
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,509
come to the same
conclusion, there's

86
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,509
an even greater chance
that he is guilty?

87
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:40,709
-No.

88
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:43,676
In that case, there will
still only be a 5% chance.

89
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,476
We'll inform him that
we are investigating

90
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:47,276
the possibility of
a copycat and have

91
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:49,976
him cooperate with
us as planned.

92
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,776
-Hmm.

93
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:53,709
DISTORTED VOICE (ON
RECORDING): Now that you've

94
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:55,343
seen proof of my
powers, you should

95
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:58,076
have no trouble
believing that I am Kira.

96
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,209
On the designated--

97
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:01,176
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): This
video is so mediocre.

98
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:03,409
It's making me
sick to my stomach.

99
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:05,843
I don't know, maybe it's
because I'm the real one,

100
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:10,843
but this is a complete disgrace
to everything Kira stands for.

101
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,043
Something's not right here.

102
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:14,376
It seems unusual
that no one bothered

103
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:16,109
to explain this video to me.

104
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:17,343
It's not like them.

105
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:20,576
Well, in any case, I'd be
stupid to comment on it.

106
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:22,476
It's probably best
thing if I say nothing.

107
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,609
If I just leave
it alone, L dies.

108
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:27,543
-So what do you
make of this, Light?

109
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,109
Have you come to
any conclusions?

110
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:29,609
-Hmm?

111
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:35,309
(VOICEOVER) Damn, it's a test.

112
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:37,843
It's hard to say for sure, but
there might be another person

113
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,143
out there with Kira's power.

114
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:40,976
-With Kira's power?

115
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,043
But what do you
mean by that, Light?

116
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,009
-At the very least, I'd
say this tape was not

117
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,543
created by the Kira
we're familiar with.

118
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:49,509
It's extremely out
of character for him

119
00:05:49,543 --> 00:05:52,209
to use these kinds of
victims for his killings.

120
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:54,209
And since we've established
that he needs a name

121
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:56,076
and face to kill,
it makes you wonder

122
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:58,243
how he was able to kill
that detective and those two

123
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:01,943
officers right outside the
television station like that.

124
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:03,776
-I-- it's the same.

125
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:06,943
-That's almost exactly how
L-- I mean, Ryuzaki said it.

126
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:09,276
SOICHIRO YAGAMI (VOICEOVER):
That was incredible, Light.

127
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:13,043
Now any doubts about
you should be resolved.

128
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:15,443
-I think you're exactly
right about that.

129
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:18,643
We also believe that this is
the work of a second Kira.

130
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:20,276
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I knew it.

131
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:24,109
So you knew about this all
along, Ryuga-- sorry, Ryuzaki?

132
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:26,743
Which means this was just
another one of your tests?

133
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,943
-It wasn't my
intention to test you.

134
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:30,843
The truth is if I
was the only one who

135
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:33,909
thought there was a second Kira,
it wouldn't be too convincing.

136
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:36,343
But the fact that we both
came to the same conclusion

137
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,909
makes the theory that
much more believable.

138
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:41,509
As expected, you did
not disappoint us.

139
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:43,509
You've been a great help.

140
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,243
It's decided, then.

141
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:48,443
First, we must focus on
stopping this copycat.

142
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,876
From what we've seen, he
sympathizes with the real Kira

143
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:53,543
but clearly lacks
his sophistication.

144
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:56,709
I think he might even be
willing to obey the original.

145
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:59,409
If so, we could
lure him into a trap

146
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:02,976
by sending our own message
from the real Kira.

147
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,776
LIGHT: I guess I
shouldn't be surprised.

148
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:07,909
You literally took the
words right out of my mouth.

149
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:11,409
L: Oh, and Light,
I would like you

150
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:13,376
to play the part
of the real Kira.

151
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:14,309
-Huh?

152
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:15,543
Me as Kira?

153
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:16,609
L: Yes.

154
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:18,009
You're the only one
I can think of who'd

155
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,809
be able to pull
something like this off.

156
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:22,276
At any rate, we don't
have time to waste.

157
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,209
Do you think you could script
a message from Kira in time

158
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,476
for it to be aired on this
evening's national news?

159
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:29,009
[laughing]

160
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:30,209
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Damn him.

161
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:32,676
He must have been planning
this from the beginning.

162
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:36,043
It's the only reason I'm here.

163
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,409
Ryuzaki, does this look OK?

164
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:41,776
I think I managed to
make it believable.

165
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:45,143
-Mm, I think you've done
an excellent job with this.

166
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:46,776
However, if we don't
omit the part that

167
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:50,243
says you're free to kill L,
then I'm going to end up dead.

168
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,776
-[laughing] Uh, sorry.

169
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:54,909
I guess I got carried
away playing the part.

170
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:56,509
I figured if I was
him, I'd probably

171
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,676
demand that you'd be killed.

172
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,409
I was improvising.

173
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:02,443
Feel free to change it
to whatever you like.

174
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:05,309
-That sounds good.

175
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:06,076
OK, Aihara.

176
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:06,909
The script is ready.

177
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:08,176
I'll leave it to you.

178
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,043
AIZAWA: All right.

179
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,276
-And now, a shocking
announcement.

180
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:13,843
In response to the
frightening Kira

181
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:16,909
video aired on Sakura
TV only a few days ago,

182
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,743
an anonymous individual
has contacted

183
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:21,376
us claiming to be the real Kira.

184
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:24,243
In short, he has demanded
of this network, as well as

185
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,776
several others, that we
air the message you are now

186
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,109
about to see.

187
00:08:28,143 --> 00:08:30,543
I would also like to mention
that the NPA has granted us

188
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,443
permission to air this video.

189
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:34,276
Is this the real Kira?

190
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,709
No one knows for sure.

191
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:37,843
But we can only hope this
video will provide us

192
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:40,443
with some much needed answers.

193
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:41,909
DISTORTED VOICE
(ON TV): I am Kira.

194
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:42,809
-It worked!

195
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:45,109
I knew he'd answer me.

196
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:46,743
DISTORTED VOICE (ON
TV): The true Kira.

197
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,209
The one who was
broadcast on Sakura TV

198
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:52,309
several days ago is
a pretender, a fake.

199
00:08:52,343 --> 00:08:55,643
The purpose of this message
is to communicate my will

200
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:56,943
to this impostor.

201
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:59,909
I have chosen to be lenient
with him for the time being

202
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:01,776
only because I believe
he wishes to cooperate

203
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,509
with me in the creation
of a new world.

204
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,576
But I want to make
it absolutely clear

205
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:09,809
that the taking of innocent
lives is against my will.

206
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:12,143
If this person
claiming to be me is

207
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,909
truly sympathetic to my cause
and wishes to be of some help,

208
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,676
I ask two things of him.

209
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,909
That he refrain from killing
aimlessly, and that he

210
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:21,043
agree to abide by
my basic principles.

211
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:21,843
-Yay!

212
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:23,509
Now where is that camcorder?

213
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,876
-What are you planning to do?

214
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:26,643
MISA: Uh, hello?

215
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:27,643
Do you really need to ask?

216
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:30,009
I'm going to reply
to him, of course.

217
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:30,976
[beep]

218
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,276
WATARI (ON COMPUTER):
Ryuzaki, we

219
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,076
have a reply from
the second Kira.

220
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:35,343
-What?

221
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:36,709
-Really?

222
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,743
WATARI (ON COMPUTER): I will
be bringing over the envelope

223
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:39,243
and tape that we received.

224
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:41,509
But in the meantime, I'm
streaming a copy of the video

225
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:43,143
so you can view it on your end.

226
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:48,543
DISTORTED VOICE (RECORDING):
Kira, thank you for your reply.

227
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:49,709
Please do not worry.

228
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:51,976
I will follow orders
and do as you say.

229
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:52,843
-Whoa.

230
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,276
-It worked.

231
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,676
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): "I
will do as you say," huh?

232
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,743
This guy's going to
be no help at all.

233
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:01,409
If this fake had any
idea what my wishes were,

234
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:05,076
he'd insist that L appear on
TV and then kill him anyway.

235
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:07,809
How could you fall for
something like this?

236
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:09,809
Damn it.

237
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,343
DISTORTED VOICE (RECORDING):
I really want to meet you.

238
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:14,609
I don't think you have the eyes.

239
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:15,409
[gasp]

240
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:16,243
But you don't have to worry.

241
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:18,143
I would never try to kill you.

242
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,176
That's a promise.

243
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,076
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
What the hell is he

244
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:22,843
thinking, talking
about Shinigami

245
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:25,976
eyes in a public
message like this?

246
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,543
AIZAWA: What's this "having
the eyes" supposed to mean?

247
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:29,743
Is it a code?

248
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:30,843
-Yeah.

249
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,043
DISTORTED VOICE
(RECORDING): Please tell me

250
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,409
how I can meet you without
the police knowing.

251
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:35,676
You'll think of something.

252
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,743
And when we meet, we can
confirm our identities

253
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:40,209
by showing our
Shinigami to each other.

254
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:41,176
[gasp]

255
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:42,309
-Shinigami?

256
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:43,809
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
He's a liability.

257
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,609
If I don't do something
about him quickly--

258
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:49,576
[shout]

259
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:55,709
-Ryuzaki!

260
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:57,776
You all right?

261
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:01,343
-Sh-- Shinigami?

262
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:04,809
Am I supposed to believe that,
that Shinigami actually exist?

263
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:24,025
Sh-- Shinigami?

264
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:28,691
Am I supposed to believe that,
that Shinigami actually exist?

265
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,591
MATSUDA: That's impossible.

266
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,691
AIZAWA: Obviously,
they don't exist.

267
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,825
-Yes, that's right, Ryuzaki.

268
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:34,991
Listen to yourself.

269
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,925
Of course Shinigami don't exist.

270
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,458
-Hmm.

271
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,158
You're probably
right, but I remember

272
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:44,025
that Kira had those prisoners
write something suggesting

273
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:45,625
the existence of Shinigami.

274
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:48,191
-So based on that
fact, perhaps we're

275
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,458
dealing with the same
person after all.

276
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:51,825
That would definitely
explain why

277
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,258
we're hearing the same words.

278
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:57,325
-I don't think so because
if this was the same person,

279
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:59,225
it's highly unlikely
he would have responded

280
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:01,158
to our video in the first place.

281
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:03,091
And why would he
agree to let L live

282
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,225
after going to all the trouble
of getting him to appear on TV?

283
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,958
The real Kira wants him dead.

284
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:09,358
So it doesn't make sense.

285
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:10,691
AIZAWA: Then maybe there's
some other connection

286
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:12,258
between the real one
and this new guy.

287
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,258
They could have
already met and decided

288
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,891
to use the word Shinigami
as a way to confuse us.

289
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:18,325
L: No, I'd say that's unlikely.

290
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:19,825
-Hmm?

291
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:20,825
-It's as Light says.

292
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,558
If the two Kiras
were connected, I

293
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:23,958
don't think the
impostor would be

294
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:27,091
so willing to give up
on his plan to kill me.

295
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,091
All of this suggests to me that
the copycat has his own agenda

296
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,291
and is acting
independently of the first.

297
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:36,691
I believe his actual motivation
is to meet the original.

298
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:38,358
-I think you're right.

299
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,425
He's acting out of
an interest in Kira.

300
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,325
The word Shinigami
could very well

301
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:46,225
be some reference to
their killing power.

302
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:48,225
Saying, "We can
confirm our identities

303
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,058
by showing our
Shinigami to each other"

304
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:52,425
probably means that they'd
confirm their identities

305
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,491
by somehow demonstrating
their ability to kill.

306
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,791
-Yes, that's it.

307
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,891
Based on their messages, we can
assume that the word Shinigami

308
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:03,458
must hold some other meaning
that only the real Kira

309
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,258
and the second
Kira are aware of.

310
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,291
Now, we just need to
convince this copycat

311
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,725
to tell us what that is.

312
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:13,425
LIGHT: So will you respond and
force him to be more specific?

313
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,258
We have to be careful
how we handle this.

314
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,225
We can't make it too
obvious that we're asking,

315
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:20,291
otherwise he'll
realize we're not Kira.

316
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:23,291
L: No, from now on, it's
best that we leave it up

317
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:24,525
to the two Kiras.

318
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:25,325
-Huh?

319
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:26,625
-What do you mean?

320
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:29,258
L: I imagine that the
second Kira is probably

321
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,491
quite satisfied with
the current situation

322
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:34,491
now that he's received
a televised response.

323
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,691
He sent a message to
get Kira's attention.

324
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:39,625
And as far as he
knows, he now has it.

325
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:42,925
Also, there's that word he used,
one that only the two of them

326
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,225
would understand.

327
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,825
We'll arrange to have
this reply broadcast today

328
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,725
on Sakura 6 o'clock news.

329
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,591
Naturally, this will
be of interest to Kira,

330
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,391
and he'll be following
this exchange

331
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:55,091
between the copycat and
the one we've invented.

332
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,291
Now, if I were Kira
himself, my priority

333
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,725
would be to prevent
this impostor

334
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:01,791
from coming into
contact with the police.

335
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:05,391
This is good for us because it
means that the real Kira may

336
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:07,991
feel pressure to
respond this time.

337
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:09,025
-OK.

338
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,525
But let's say that
he doesn't respond.

339
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,825
Then what do we do?

340
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:13,025
-Yes.

341
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:14,825
I've been thinking about
what the second Kira might

342
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:16,525
do if he gets no response.

343
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:18,558
For one, he might
reveal more information

344
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,058
that he knows Kira wants
kept secret, to pressure him

345
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,125
into a meeting.

346
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,225
Of course, that would
make Kira nervous.

347
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:26,858
It could be interesting.

348
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:29,591
And what would be
more interesting

349
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,858
is if Kira sends a
message of his own

350
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:33,325
to prevent this from happening.

351
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,858
Ideally, this could provide
us with the physical evidence

352
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:38,791
we'll need to build
a case against him.

353
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:40,958
In the meantime, let's
gather all the information

354
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,125
we can on this copycat.

355
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:49,225
PHOTOGRAPHER: Oh, that's good.

356
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:50,391
Yes.

357
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:50,958
Beautiful.

358
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:51,958
Just like that.

359
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,258
Perfect.

360
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,391
I'm telling you, these
are gonna knock them dead.

361
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:58,691
You'll look like a
little angel, Misa.

362
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:01,125
MISA: Ah, I'm so tired.

363
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,725
That shoot went on forever.

364
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:05,891
Modeling takes a lot of energy.

365
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:07,091
Hey, Rem.

366
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:07,958
-Huh?

367
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,458
-Can I ask you something?

368
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:11,791
-What is it?

369
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:14,991
-Each Shinigami has to have
one Death Note of their own.

370
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:17,625
For a Shinigami to give
a notebook to a human,

371
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:18,825
he needs to have two.

372
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:21,525
Ryuk could give a
Death Note to Kira

373
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:23,591
because he somehow
found a way to sneak

374
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,191
an extra one past
the Shinigami King?

375
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,625
-Right.

376
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,058
-What about you?

377
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:32,291
-The Shinigami King isn't
someone who's easily fooled.

378
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:33,391
It doesn't happen often.

379
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:36,425
-Oh, then how did I get mine?

380
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,625
-Let's just say it has a
lot to do with the fact

381
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:41,158
that I'm one of the few
in the Shinigami realm

382
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,191
who knows how to kill
another of my kind.

383
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,358
That's how I ended up with two.

384
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:46,991
-Oh.

385
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:48,658
I think I get it.

386
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:51,625
You killed a Shinigami, and then
you gave his notebook to me,

387
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:52,491
right?

388
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:53,858
-It's not like that.

389
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:56,091
I wasn't the one who killed him.

390
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,625
I just happened to be
around when he died.

391
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,791
It was coincidence, really.

392
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:03,191
-So how do you kill a Shinigami?

393
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:05,425
I have to know.

394
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,258
Well?

395
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,558
-Never repeat this to anyone.

396
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:13,291
I learned the only way
to kill a Shinigami is

397
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:15,191
to make them fall in
love with a human.

398
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,058
-What a beautiful way to kill.

399
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:31,358
-There once was
a Shinigami named

400
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,091
Gelus who spent all
of his time watching

401
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,325
over a certain human girl.

402
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:39,225
Gelus wanted nothing
more than to look at her

403
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:41,091
as she went about
her daily life.

404
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:53,625
It's today, isn't it?

405
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:56,091
Her last day alive.

406
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,925
-She looks so full of life.

407
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,325
I wonder why today?

408
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:04,891
It's-- it's just not fair.

409
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,791
REM (VOICEOVER): I
also wanted to find out

410
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:15,391
how she was going to die, so
I stayed and watched with him.

411
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:21,925
It was nighttime, and
she was walking alone.

412
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,858
No one else was around.

413
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:24,891
And then it happened.

414
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,625
A man suddenly appeared
and blocked her path.

415
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:34,858
He was clearly
infatuated with the girl.

416
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:37,058
-I love you more than
anyone else in the world!

417
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:38,058
I'm always watching you.

418
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,558
I want to protect you forever!

419
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,225
REM (VOICEOVER): She'd
never seen the man before

420
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:44,391
and, of course, turned him down.

421
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:50,358
[manic laughter]

422
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:56,358
-Then if I can't have you,
(SHOUTING) I'll kill us both!

423
00:17:56,391 --> 00:18:01,391
[shouting]

424
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:01,891
-Wait!

425
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:02,658
Stop it!

426
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:03,658
What are you doing?

427
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,991
[crying]

428
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:07,625
REM (VOICEOVER):
Without even thinking,

429
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:10,525
Gelus did something that
we Shinigami must never do.

430
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,358
[heartbeat, screaming]

431
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,858
Gelus used his Death Note
to kill the man instantly

432
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,458
and therefore saved
the girl's life.

433
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:34,458
it was the wrong thing to do.

434
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:38,925
Shinigami exist only to
shorten and take human lives.

435
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,725
We aren't permitted to undo
that which has been fated.

436
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:46,691
[crying]

437
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:02,025
At that moment, Gelus
became something

438
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:06,058
which was neither sand nor
rust and disappeared forever.

439
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,825
He died.

440
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,891
The only reminder
of his existence

441
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,058
was his Death Note, left behind.

442
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:18,025
The rest of his life
span was added to hers.

443
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,525
So not only had
he saved her life,

444
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:25,525
he'd accidentally extended it
well beyond its natural end.

445
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:27,925
-So if he'd never fallen
in love with this girl,

446
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,958
he'd probably still be
alive today, wouldn't he?

447
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:33,458
REM: That's right.

448
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:35,958
-Hmm.

449
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:37,758
I had no idea.

450
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,591
All this time, I
thought it was luck.

451
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,558
But it was a Shinigami who
saved my life that day.

452
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,191
-Yes.

453
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,325
Gelus loved you
enough to die for you.

454
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:52,625
So that Death Note
is now yours to keep.

455
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,125
-Hmm.

456
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:59,325
I see.

457
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:01,025
For a Shinigami
to die, they have

458
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:02,458
to love a human
enough that they'd

459
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,558
prevent their death
from happening.

460
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:05,625
So what about you, Rem?

461
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:07,358
You're not in love
with me, are you?

462
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:08,591
Be honest.

463
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,091
-Just forget it.

464
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,725
You really think you
can kill me that easily?

465
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:13,425
-Oops.

466
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,225
You saw through that?

467
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:18,191
[laughing] I'm so glad.

468
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:21,191
At least now I have something
interesting to tell Kira.

469
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:28,191
But I wonder, does he know--
how to K-I-L-L a Shinigami?

470
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:31,091
I asked him on TV to find a
way for us to meet each other,

471
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,125
but he hasn't replied to me yet.

472
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:34,658
What's taking him so long?

473
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,691
Maybe I should just send
him another message.

474
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,558
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
This isn't good.

475
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,858
I can't allow this second
Kira to act on his own

476
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:45,791
for much longer.

477
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:46,958
He's careless.

478
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:49,358
So it's only a matter of
time before he slips up.

479
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:51,391
And when he does, the
police will be waiting.

480
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:56,891
With him in custody, they could
find out about the Death Note.

481
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:58,358
-Something to start?

482
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,325
-Hmm.

483
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,091
A strawberry sundae, please.

484
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:01,925
-Of course.

485
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,825
Be right back.

486
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,725
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
What should I do?

487
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,291
How can I contact
the second Kira

488
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:11,425
without L noticing anything?

489
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,358
-Here you go.

490
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:12,858
-Ah, mmm.

491
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:13,332
-Enjoy.

492
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:17,732
-Mm.

493
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:20,232
(VOICEOVER) I can't
wait to meet Kira!

494
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:23,099
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I
wonder, what kind of person

495
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,932
are you, impostor?

496
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:29,199
MISA (VOICEOVER): I wonder, what
kind of person are you, Kira?

497
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:30,166
Mmm [giggle].

498
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,993
[theme music]

499
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:52,360
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): May 22nd.

500
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:54,960
My friend and I showed off
our notebooks in Aoyama.

501
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:57,327
If this fake Kira slips
up and gets apprehended,

502
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,760
at the very least, I have to
get my hands on his notebook.

503
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:02,793
I may end up having to
kill everyone there.
