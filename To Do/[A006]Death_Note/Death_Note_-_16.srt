00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:15,366
[theme music]

2
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:51,939
-I hereby relinquish
ownership of this Death Note.

3
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:53,039
-Take care of her.

4
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,872
You gave your word.

5
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:03,272
-Huh?

6
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:15,505
[whimpers] Mr. Stalker?

7
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:16,339
Hello, Mister?

8
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:18,639
Where are you right now?

9
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:22,072
Do-- do you think we
could stop this game?

10
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:22,905
-Huh?

11
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:23,605
MAN: Stalker?

12
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,872
Where'd she get that?

13
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:27,939
What's with the new
attitude all of a sudden?

14
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:35,605
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Just as I thought.

15
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,772
As long as I still
have Ryuk's notebook,

16
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:41,305
even though I gave up Rem's, all
awareness I have of Rem still

17
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,639
remains.

18
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:46,005
Rem, the only reason I have
to go through all this trouble

19
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:50,205
is because you brought another
Death Note to the human world.

20
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,439
-Is this really what
you want, Light?

21
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:56,239
-Yeah.

22
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:57,239
-OK.

23
00:02:57,272 --> 00:02:59,039
I never thought the
Death Note I gave

24
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:01,772
you would end up
buried and abandoned.

25
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,272
Listen, Ryuk.

26
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:05,572
For the time being,
I'm just hiding it.

27
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:09,272
But it stays mine,
until the next time

28
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:13,239
you hear me say the following
words-- get rid of it.

29
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:15,839
When I say that,
regardless of the context,

30
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:19,139
assume that I want to relinquish
ownership of this Death Note.

31
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:21,005
-Got it.

32
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,905
-Mr. Stalker?

33
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:22,872
This is illegal.

34
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:24,272
You have to stop.

35
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:24,839
OK?

36
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,339
Come on, please?

37
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,439
-She's been acting
like this ever

38
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,605
since she regained
consciousness.

39
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,005
-Seriously.

40
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,439
Does she think she can get out
of this just by playing dumb?

41
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:35,072
-OK.

42
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:36,405
How about this?

43
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,105
You could at least
take off my blindfold.

44
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:39,205
Don't you think?

45
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,339
It'll be nice to see
what you look like.

46
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,472
-Matsuda, call Mogi for me.

47
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:46,639
-Huh?

48
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:49,739
Just a second.

49
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,139
Here.

50
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,939
-Mr. Mogi, when you apprehended
Misa Amane, you made it clear

51
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:56,172
that she was a
suspect, am I correct?

52
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,472
-Yes, like you told me.

53
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,739
First, I blindfolded her
and covered her mouth.

54
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:03,805
I told her that we knew
she was the second Kira.

55
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,705
I made sure that she heard me.

56
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,205
She didn't struggle when I put
the blindfold and handcuffs

57
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,039
on her.

58
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,805
It was like she'd accepted it.

59
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:14,005
-What if I gave you an
autograph, or shook your hang?

60
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,139
I know.

61
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,772
I can give you a kiss on
the cheek of you want.

62
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:17,672
Oh, come on.

63
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:18,605
I won't run away.

64
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,972
I promise.

65
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:22,572
L (VOICEOVER): We'd already
made so much progress with her,

66
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:23,872
I actually thought she'd crack.

67
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:28,305
Why is she suddenly
talking about a stalker?

68
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,005
DISTORTED VOICE (ON
SPEAKER): Misa Amane.

69
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:30,772
-Huh?

70
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,339
What's that, Mr. Stalker?

71
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,839
Are you planning to release me?

72
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,005
DISTORTED VOICE (ON SPEAKER):
Before you passed out,

73
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,205
you barely spoke.

74
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:39,472
And you even asked
me to kill you.

75
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:40,905
And now you're
claiming ignorance?

76
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:41,572
-Hm?

77
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:42,905
I don't understand.

78
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,272
I mean, you're the one who
knocked me out and then brought

79
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:46,372
me here, remember?

80
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:47,072
Wait.

81
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:48,439
I get it.

82
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:52,239
This is some kind of Misa Amane
interrogation fantasy, right?

83
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:53,605
-Huh?

84
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,305
-Do you know why I'm
detaining you here?

85
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:56,305
You must have some idea.

86
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,805
MISA (ON SPEAKER):
What do you mean?

87
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,505
Because I'm a
celebrity, obviously.

88
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:01,572
But you're definitely
the first stalker

89
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:02,705
who's ever gone this far.

90
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:05,972
And you're starting to scare me.

91
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:06,939
-Hey, Amane!

92
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:09,172
No one's buying
this, so cut it out.

93
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:10,939
-Oh, this is scary.

94
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:12,072
What's going on?

95
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,572
I can't stand it anymore!

96
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,072
Please let me go!

97
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,072
You have to let me go!

98
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,072
I-- I need to go
to the bathroom.

99
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:20,905
I have to go to the
bathroom again, OK?

100
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,205
DISTORTED VOICE (ON
SPEAKER): It's only

101
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,739
been four minutes since you
last went to the bathroom.

102
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,872
I'm afraid you'll
have to hold it.

103
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,205
-You have to.

104
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,772
It's the only time you'll
untie me and let me move.

105
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:31,539
Plus, you'd be able to watch.

106
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:33,005
Isn't that what you want?

107
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,972
Isn't it?

108
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:35,872
You pervert!

109
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:39,272
-I'm a pervert?

110
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,439
Amane, let's get back
to the conversation

111
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:44,072
we were having before
you lost consciousness.

112
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:46,705
First of all, do you
know who Light Yagami is.

113
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,139
And if so, why did
you approach him?

114
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:49,772
-Huh?

115
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,572
What do you mean?

116
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:53,139
How can I not know
my own boyfriend?

117
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:55,472
L (VOICEOVER): She was so
tight-lipped about it earlier.

118
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:58,039
Now she's openly admitting
he's her boyfriend?

119
00:05:58,072 --> 00:05:59,505
-Where is this coming from?

120
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,105
[phone ringing]

121
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:02,972
-Good timing.

122
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:04,805
It's Light.

123
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,539
-Please turn the
video and audio off.

124
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:09,305
WATARI (ON SPEAKER): Yes.

125
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,439
L: Yes?

126
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:11,572
Yes, I understand.

127
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:15,472
We'll be expecting
you in room K-2801.

128
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:17,772
-Are you saying my
son's coming here?

129
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:37,305
-Ryuzaki, like I said over
the phone, I could be Kira.

130
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,505
-[gasp] No, Light.

131
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,039
What are you talking about?

132
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,572
Why would you even say
something like that?

133
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:45,505
Why?

134
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,639
L (VOICEOVER):
There's no real proof

135
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,039
that Light Yagami
is Kira, so why

136
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:51,739
come here that
you could be Kira?

137
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:52,872
It's an act.

138
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:54,972
There's no "could be" about it.

139
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:56,172
You are Kira.

140
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:59,205
What do you hope to
accomplish by this?

141
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,439
-Look, Dad.

142
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:02,605
If Ryuzaki is L,
then it's safe to say

143
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,272
that he is the world's
best detective.

144
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:07,572
And right now, he seems
pretty sure that I'm Kira.

145
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:09,939
We know L's never
been wrong before.

146
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,405
-What-- what are
you saying, Light?

147
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,539
Stop this.

148
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:16,472
LIGHT: What about that
FBI agent, Ray Penber?

149
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:20,005
It was me he was investigating
immediately before he died.

150
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,805
And I was in Oyama on May 22.

151
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,972
Also, I'm the first
person in the Kanto region

152
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:27,772
that Misa, the alleged
second Kira, approached.

153
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:31,339
It's all been me.

154
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,472
If I were in L's
place, even I would

155
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,172
have come to the
same conclusion.

156
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,972
You see, subconsciously,
I might be Kira.

157
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:42,105
If that were the case, I could
be him and not even know it.

158
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,072
-No, Light.

159
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:45,072
L (VOICEOVER): I see.

160
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:48,072
So you're not
conscious of it, huh?

161
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:51,472
-I-- I'm not sure
of anything anymore.

162
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,405
I'd never kill someone,
but unconsciously,

163
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,572
who knows what I'm capable of?

164
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:58,705
Another me could be
killing people as I sleep.

165
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,705
-I'm afraid that's not possible.

166
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:01,272
-Huh?

167
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:02,072
Not possible?

168
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:03,405
What do you mean?

169
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,472
-Well, I never mentioned this
to you, but at one point,

170
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,439
I had hidden surveillance
cameras installed

171
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:09,072
in your room for five days.

172
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,305
-Cameras?

173
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,405
-Yes.

174
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,739
Every single night,
you slept normally.

175
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:17,272
Criminals whose
names were broadcast

176
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:19,105
were still dying,
even though you

177
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,939
would have had no way
of knowing about them.

178
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:23,139
But this didn't prove
your innocence to me.

179
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:25,305
All it proved was
that if you were Kira,

180
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,305
no amount of camera surveillance
would reveal that fact.

181
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:32,372
-Wouldn't reveal that fact, huh?

182
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:33,572
I don't know.

183
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,305
It could be true.

184
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,172
I have to admit, I
found myself thinking

185
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:41,105
that some criminals
deserve to die.

186
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,572
If I can think
like Kira, then how

187
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,939
can I be sure that
I'm not actually him?

188
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:47,239
-Hold on, Light.

189
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,639
I feel exactly the same way.

190
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,839
I found myself thinking
before that some people would

191
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:52,872
be better off dead.

192
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:54,305
But still, that
doesn't mean we're

193
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,439
going to go out and kill people.

194
00:08:56,472 --> 00:08:57,505
Isn't that right?

195
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,039
Besides, criminals
were still being

196
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,539
killed, even while you
had no knowledge of them.

197
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:04,605
I mean, the surveillance
cameras proved it, didn't they?

198
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,839
-Well, no.

199
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:07,905
Because we were short
of investigators then,

200
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:10,172
we only watched him
while he was at home.

201
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:12,072
Truth is, we weren't
able to watch

202
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:13,905
him every hour of the day.

203
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,605
It's possible he could
have found some way

204
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,605
to kill those criminals
well he wasn't at home.

205
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:22,739
L (VOICEOVER): This
was premeditated.

206
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,439
It's no accident he
chose to do this now.

207
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:28,672
Well, what if we
incarcerate you for a while,

208
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:30,472
imprison you like we did Amane?

209
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:34,572
If criminals whose names
are made public keep dying,

210
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:39,539
then it would lead us to think
that you're innocent, right?

211
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:41,172
Is that how you imagined it?

212
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:49,205
L: Honestly, I don't like the
way that this is going at all,

213
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:52,005
but what choice do I have?

214
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,205
Let's do it.

215
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,805
I need you to fully
restrain Light Yagami

216
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,505
and place him in
solitary confinement.

217
00:09:58,539 --> 00:09:59,239
-What?

218
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:00,239
You can't!

219
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:02,005
-You want us to confine him?

220
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,039
Seriously?

221
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:04,339
L: If we're going
to do this, then it

222
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:06,372
has to happen immediately.

223
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,072
From this point on,
you can't be allowed

224
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:09,772
to go anywhere where
I can't see you.

225
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,105
-This is crazy.

226
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:13,505
There's no way my
son could be Kira.

227
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:15,105
My son's not capable of--

228
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,072
-It's OK, Dad.

229
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:19,005
-Stop this, Light.

230
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,272
Listen, something has
to be done about this.

231
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,105
As long as I'm
having these doubts,

232
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,505
I can't work with
you to catch Kira.

233
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:29,339
But Ryuzaki, promise me this.

234
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:32,872
Until you can say with absolute
certainty that I'm not Kira,

235
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:35,972
you cannot set me free, no
matter what I might say or what

236
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:38,439
condition I might be in.

237
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,772
-You have my word.

238
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,172
Mr. Yagami, can you
come up with some sort

239
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:46,139
of excuse for Light's absence,
something to tell your family?

240
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:47,672
And please do it now.

241
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:49,172
-But this is all so sudden.

242
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:50,405
What should I say?

243
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,939
And then I see no reason
why he should be in prison.

244
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:53,605
-Let it go, Dad.

245
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,939
-Huh?

246
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:57,405
-If I don't do this, I won't
be able to live with myself.

247
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:01,372
--[gasp] But son, do
you really mean that?

248
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:02,472
-Yeah.

249
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:05,039
I believe that by giving
up my very freedom,

250
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:09,739
I'll defeat this fear
that Kira lurks within me.

251
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:12,005
L: Aizawa, please take him away.

252
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,505
-Right.

253
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:18,939
-Hm.

254
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:45,756
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Next,
I just have to get rid

255
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,189
of the notebook.

256
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:49,456
-So, I guess apples are
out of the question?

257
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:03,289
-Ryuzaki, I'd like to
request that you take me

258
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,556
off this investigation.

259
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:05,056
-Chief, no!

260
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:05,889
-But why?

261
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:07,289
-I thought about
it, and the fact

262
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:10,556
is that we're holding my son,
Light, as a prime suspect.

263
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:13,489
Given that, it's not
appropriate for me to be here.

264
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:17,489
When we spoke earlier, my
feelings got in the way.

265
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:21,622
It's impossible for me to be
objective in this situation.

266
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:22,722
-I agree with you.

267
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:25,622
We can't let personal
feelings get in the way.

268
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:28,722
-And in truth, if--
if the task force

269
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:31,389
concludes that my
son is Kira, I don't

270
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:33,722
know what I'd be capable of.

271
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:35,189
L: Yes, I'll agree
with you there.

272
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,989
To be honest, I wondered
what you might do.

273
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:41,056
I believe you'd kill your
son and then yourself.

274
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:42,956
I'd also agree that
it's best that we

275
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:46,856
don't have you
working here for now.

276
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,289
-Ryuzaki, I will ask that
you confine me as well.

277
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:51,056
[gasping]

278
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,522
-At the moment, I'm calm.

279
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:55,056
But to be honest, I'm not
sure how much more of this I

280
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:55,889
can take.

281
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:56,856
I thought you might say that.

282
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,422
So I spoke with Watari.

283
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,056
He's made arrangements.

284
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,156
[gasping]

285
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:06,589
-Mm, but, your confinement
will be different.

286
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:08,656
You will keep your
cell phone turned on

287
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:12,289
and maintain regular contact
with family and friends.

288
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:13,889
You won't tell Light about this.

289
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:15,756
If he does call
you at some point,

290
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:20,422
he must be made to believe that
you're still at headquarters.

291
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:22,456
While you're in
confinement, we'll

292
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:24,856
be giving you continuous
updates on the investigation.

293
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:28,456
So you'll know what's happening.

294
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:30,622
So how does that sound to you?

295
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,156
-I'm grateful.

296
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:32,656
Thank you.

297
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,222
MISA (ON SPEAKER): Hey, Mister,
I really want to take a bath.

298
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,222
I'm pretty sure you already
know where I live, don't you?

299
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:50,589
Could you bring me
some clean clothes.

300
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,189
-I didn't think this could
get any more bizarre.

301
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:55,589
-I feel so sorry for
the chief right now.

302
00:13:58,522 --> 00:14:00,389
-Ryuzaki talk to me.

303
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,556
What's happening?

304
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:03,356
Have any new criminals
been identified,

305
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,922
anyone that Kira would
be likely to target?

306
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:09,689
If so, has he
killed any of them?

307
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:11,922
-In fact, quite a
few criminals' names

308
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:13,822
have been broadcast recently.

309
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:15,822
But since you've
been detained, we

310
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,556
haven't had one report of a
criminal being killed by Kira.

311
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:21,022
-Wait, no one's been killed?

312
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:22,322
Really?

313
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:23,156
L (ON SPEAKER): Yes.

314
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:24,589
-I see.

315
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:28,056
So it's only a matter of time
before I'm convicted as Kira.

316
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:31,389
-What I wouldn't
give for an apple.

317
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:33,256
L (VOICEOVER):
What's going on here?

318
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,056
I thought the murders
would continue

319
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:37,622
even after Light was confined.

320
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:41,489
Instead, they've
stopped completely.

321
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:44,556
Light asked to be confined
in the first place.

322
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:47,656
If this continues, it'll
only strengthen the argument

323
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:50,256
that he is Kira.

324
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,289
The question left
will be whether or not

325
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:55,756
he was conscious of being Kira.

326
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:58,089
Does he really think
that's gonna work,

327
00:14:58,122 --> 00:14:59,989
that he'll be let off
the hook if he can just

328
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:03,422
prove he wasn't
conscious of being Kira?

329
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:05,589
It's not like Light Yagami.

330
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:07,322
No, it's not like Kira.

331
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,156
-I can't take this anymore.

332
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:17,189
If I don't get an apple soon,
I don't know what-- [groans]

333
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:20,522
-In the end, I just have to get
through this, no matter what.

334
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:22,622
MISA: You know
what, Mr. Stalker?

335
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,556
Your video won't
sell if it's just me

336
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:25,989
sitting here the whole time.

337
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:31,256
L: Mr. Yagami looks pretty bad.

338
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,522
I think he's taking this
harder than Light or Misa.

339
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:34,922
MATSUDA: Well,
what do you expect?

340
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:37,889
It's been five days since
Light was put in prison.

341
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:41,156
And look, not a single criminal
who's name has been broadcast

342
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:42,389
was killed.

343
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:44,556
In these situations,
I think the parents

344
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,222
must suffer a lot
more than the accused.

345
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:47,556
AIZAWA: No kidding.

346
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:52,089
Especially now that we're
seeing proof that Light is Kira.

347
00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:53,622
-Mr. Yagami?

348
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:54,322
-What is it?

349
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:55,289
Is it good news?

350
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,222
Is it bad news?

351
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:01,356
-No, I wanted to tell
you not to worry so much.

352
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:02,856
It doesn't matter
how much time you

353
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:04,489
devote to worrying about this.

354
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:05,989
The outcome will be the same.

355
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:07,989
This could go on
for quite some time.

356
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:11,089
Perhaps you should rest in
a more comfortable place.

357
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:12,122
-Impossible!

358
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:13,756
What makes you think
I care where I am?

359
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,089
It won't change anything.

360
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:18,322
With the state I'm in now,
this is the best place for me.

361
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:21,189
And no matter what the
result, when I leave here,

362
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:24,689
it's going to be with my son.

363
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:25,556
-I understand.

364
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:41,156
L (ON SPEAKER): Light, you've
only been here for one week,

365
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:43,089
but I'm sure it can't be easy.

366
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:44,756
Are you feeling all right?

367
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:50,589
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Now
that I've come this far,

368
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:51,956
I think it's about time.

369
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:01,422
-Yeah, I know I must
look pretty bad in here.

370
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:04,122
But this useless
pride, I suppose

371
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:08,922
I'll have to get rid of it.

372
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:11,722
-Huh?

373
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:14,189
[grunting]

374
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,556
Got it.

375
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:31,289
Later.

376
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:40,322
-[gasps]

377
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,489
-Hm?

378
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:44,122
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Why am I doing this?

379
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:46,189
I don't belong here.

380
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:50,389
-Ryuzaki, I realize that I was
the one pushing for confinement

381
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:52,022
and that I asked you
to put me in here,

382
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:54,589
but I just realized
something important.

383
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,522
This whole thing is
completely pointless.

384
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:57,622
-[together] Huh?

385
00:17:57,656 --> 00:17:59,622
LIGHT (ON SPEAKER):
Because I'm not Kira!

386
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:02,389
You have to get me out of here.

387
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:03,356
-Hm.

388
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:04,489
I can't do that.

389
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:06,256
I promised you that no
matter what you said,

390
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,689
I wouldn't let you
out until I was

391
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:10,556
convinced that you are not Kira.

392
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,922
-Please, L. I wasn't
thinking clearly.

393
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:14,589
Do you really think
a serial killer

394
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,922
like Kira could
commit those crimes

395
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,789
without being aware of them?

396
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:22,789
If I have no memory of
his crimes, I'm not him.

397
00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:24,756
-I've never been able
to accept this idea

398
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:26,756
that Kira has been acting
without self awareness

399
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,089
all this time.

400
00:18:28,122 --> 00:18:30,789
But that doesn't change the
fact that all the evidence

401
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:32,889
point to you being Kira.

402
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:35,389
Since we imprisoned
you, Kira hasn't

403
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:38,189
committed a single murder.

404
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:40,356
-Listen, just hear me out.

405
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:42,056
I swear to you, I'm not lying.

406
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,489
You have to believe me.

407
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,156
I'm not Kira!

408
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:46,389
I must have been framed.

409
00:18:46,422 --> 00:18:48,356
That's the only
explanation for this.

410
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:50,622
L (VOICEOVER): What's wrong
with you, Light, Yagami.

411
00:18:50,656 --> 00:18:52,822
What you're saying
is completely absurd.

412
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:56,556
But for some reason, it
feels believable to me.

413
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:57,856
LIGHT: You have to let me out!

414
00:18:57,889 --> 00:18:59,422
We're wasting time!

415
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:02,922
L (ON SPEAKER): We
can't let you out yet.

416
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:03,622
-Damn.

417
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:04,989
Why is this happening?

418
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:07,189
-What the hell is going on?

419
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:08,756
This isn't like Light at all.

420
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,289
He's contradicting himself.

421
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:12,422
It doesn't make any sense to me.

422
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:15,656
-Well, we can't release him now
that the murders have stopped.

423
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,522
It doesn't matter what he says.

424
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,422
I mean, even I know that much.

425
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:22,356
-Anyway, I don't care
what anyone says.

426
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:25,189
As far as I'm concerned, we
have all the proof we need.

427
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:27,289
Light Yagami is Kira,
and that's the end of it.

428
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:34,189
-What's going on?

429
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:35,556
I just heard.

430
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:37,556
Two weeks' worth of criminals
were just murdered all at once.

431
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:38,456
It happened yesterday.

432
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:39,956
-Yeah.

433
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,756
Kira is back.

434
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,822
-So did you guys
already tell the chief?

435
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:46,722
-No, not yet.

436
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:47,489
-Guess what, Chief?

437
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:49,256
Kira started killing again!

438
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,289
-What?

439
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,856
-It looks like Kira
was only resting.

440
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,622
But now he's started
punishing criminals again.

441
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:57,422
CHIEF YAGAMI (ON SPEAKER):
Is that true, Matsuda?

442
00:19:57,456 --> 00:20:00,689
Then that means my son--
I shouldn't be happy

443
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:01,889
that people have been killed.

444
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:05,489
But at least Light's name
will finally be cleared.

445
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:09,822
Wait, knowing Ryuzaki, this
won't be enough to clear him.

446
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:10,322
-Hm?

447
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:12,522
-Huh?

448
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:14,656
-Well, he's in the grey.

449
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,622
-Did you hear what
he just said, Chief?

450
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:17,856
CHIEF YAGAMI (ON
SPEAKER): Yeah, it's

451
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:19,389
a hell of a lot better than
being completely guilty,

452
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:20,789
thank god.

453
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:23,556
-I'm sure as greys go, he's a
shade closer to being cleared.

454
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,256
Let's tell Light!

455
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,222
L: Matsuda!

456
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:28,222
I mean, please
don't, Mr. Matsuda.

457
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:29,389
-Matsuda?

458
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:32,189
-We shouldn't tell
him about this.

459
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:34,622
-But-- but why not?

460
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:35,589
-Hello, Light.

461
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:38,389
-What is it, Ryuzaki?

462
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:40,156
-You've been here
just over two weeks

463
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:42,956
and not a single new
criminal has been punished.

464
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,189
Now, why make this
harder than it has to be?

465
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:46,289
Are you ready to confess?

466
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,456
LIGHT (ON SPEAKER):
Don't be ridiculous.

467
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:50,256
I'm telling you, you're wrong.

468
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,156
I understand why
you feel that way.

469
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:54,822
But even if the evidence does
point to me, I swear to you,

470
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:55,756
this is a set up.

471
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,789
I am not Kira!

472
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,322
Zoom in on me, if you want.

473
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:00,989
Go ahead, look at my eyes.

474
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:04,456
You tell me, do these look
like the eyes of someone

475
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:05,422
who is lying?

476
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:06,889
-Hm.

477
00:21:06,922 --> 00:21:12,222
Amane, are you ready to
tell me who Kira is, or not?

478
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:12,756
-Huh?

479
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:14,189
That again?

480
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,156
I wish I knew, but I don't.

481
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:19,722
Because if I did, I'd
thank him for punishing

482
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:21,122
the burglar who
killed my parents.

483
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,022
To me, Kira is a hero.

484
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:31,322
L: I don't understand
what's going on here.

485
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:43,662
[theme music]

486
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,394
LIGHT: [laugh]
That-- that's crazy.

487
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:55,661
Wait, Dad.

488
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:58,161
If I die here, then the
truth will never be revealed!

489
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:00,994
Do you trust L more
than your own son?

490
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:02,527
Dad!
