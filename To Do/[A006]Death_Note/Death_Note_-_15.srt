[theme music]

2
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:39,884
-I feel you're the first
friend that I have ever had.

3
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:42,284
-Whoa.

4
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:44,218
-Hm.

5
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,184
-Misa?

6
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:46,118
-Yes?

7
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:49,251
-Then could you
ask Rem to kill L?

8
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:50,718
-Huh?

9
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,418
-Rem, I want Light to love me.

10
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,718
And I know we could
be happy together.

11
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:58,684
It's all I ever wanted.

12
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,984
-That's fine.

13
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:02,884
I'll kill L for you.

14
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:04,784
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): L will die.

15
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,484
That's all it took.

16
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:13,084
REM: So when should I kill him?

17
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:14,518
-[gasp]

18
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,884
-If you take them to where he
is, I can kill him immediately.

19
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:19,784
LIGHT: The sooner the better.

20
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:21,218
Maybe tomorrow.

21
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:22,251
Hm.

22
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:23,451
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I should think this

23
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:25,718
through before we do anything.

24
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,884
-I need tonight to decide
how we're going to kill L.

25
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:29,684
And I'll give you
my answer tomorrow.

26
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:31,384
REM: Very well.

27
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,151
LIGHT: Also, no matter
what, you can't kill him

28
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:36,251
until I give the order.

29
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:36,951
No matter what.

30
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,251
Understood?

31
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,551
REM: All right.

32
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:43,618
I'll promise you that, at
least where L is concerned.

33
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,751
-Misa, I need you to give
me your cell phone number.

34
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:47,651
-About time.

35
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:48,784
What took you so long?

36
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:50,151
Give me yours too, OK?

37
00:02:50,184 --> 00:02:51,218
-No, Misa.

38
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:52,651
I'm afraid I can't do that.

39
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:53,618
-Why not?

40
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:54,584
I'm your girlfriend.

41
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:56,551
I should have your number.

42
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:59,984
-I already told you, I'm under
surveillance by the police.

43
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,984
Keep in mind, it's
not difficult for them

44
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:04,084
to bug even
cellphones these days.

45
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,918
MISA: Oh, OK.

46
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,384
Then what about this?

47
00:03:07,418 --> 00:03:08,884
I'll just give you
one of my phones.

48
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:11,118
I ended up with
three of them, 'cause

49
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:14,084
I use them for different things.

50
00:03:14,118 --> 00:03:15,351
-Yeah, good idea.

51
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:17,518
If we use yours, I
think we'll be safe.

52
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:18,851
MISA: That's great!

53
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:21,851
I can hear your voice
everyday, and text you, too.

54
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:23,784
-No, I'll keep this
one turned off.

55
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:25,518
I'll be the only one
making the calls,

56
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:28,551
and only when it's
absolutely necessary.

57
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,351
-What?

58
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:30,951
No way.

59
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:33,218
Then when are you gonna call me?

60
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,618
-Probably tomorrow.

61
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:35,751
-Oh.

62
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:37,751
-That will most likely
be the day we execute L,

63
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,484
but I'll call you either way.

64
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:39,984
-What?

65
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,084
Tomorrow?

66
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:42,818
It doesn't sound like
a very romantic call,

67
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,384
but I suppose we can always
talk about us afterwards.

68
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:48,051
-Well, I think you should
probably go home now, Misa.

69
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,018
MISA: Huh?

70
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:49,984
But why?

71
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,184
It's only 7 o'clock.

72
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:53,151
The time for lovers is
just beginning, you know?

73
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:55,584
We can go for a romantic
dinner, then maybe a moonlight

74
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,018
stroll in the park.

75
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:58,884
And after that, the
main event! [giggle]

76
00:03:58,918 --> 00:03:59,384
LIGHT: Misa.

77
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:00,351
-Huh?

78
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,618
[gasp]

79
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:02,384
RYUK: [laugh] Wow.

80
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:14,551
-Listen, you have
to go home now.

81
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:15,751
-OK.

82
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:16,718
Also,

83
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,784
- when you're talking
to Rem outside,

84
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:21,084
be careful that no
one's around to listen.

85
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:22,518
Just whisper.

86
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:25,184
That's what I
always do with Ryuk.

87
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:25,751
MISA: OK.

88
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:26,351
Bye-bye.

89
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:28,051
Have a good night.

90
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:29,051
-Bye-bye, Misa!

91
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:30,984
Come again real soon!

92
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:37,184
RYUK: [laugh] That kiss
came out of nowhere.

93
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:38,518
LIGHT: Sure.

94
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:41,251
It's very important that Misa
stays infatuated with me.

95
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:42,418
-Oh.

96
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:43,951
-More importantly,
I need to decide

97
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,218
if L should die tomorrow.

98
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:49,084
Since he hasn't gone
public yet, if Ryuga dies,

99
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:52,084
the other task force members
will be suspicious of me.

100
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:54,218
So I have to make
sure I'm prepared.

101
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,684
-I see.

102
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:58,284
I thought perhaps
you were hesitating

103
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:00,718
because he said he thinks
of you as a friend.

104
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:02,284
-[laugh] A friend?

105
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:04,118
I just gave him what he wanted.

106
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,551
From the start, I've said if
it's my friendship he wants,

107
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:09,151
I'd give it to him as
a way to win his trust.

108
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,551
Ryuga and Light Yagami
appear to be friends.

109
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:14,551
But L is Kira's enemy.

110
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:24,484
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): That's right.

111
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:29,684
Ryuga revealed that he is
L. Therefore, he must die.

112
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:32,618
If I have him die
in an accident,

113
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:35,651
chances are that less people
will suspect I'm Kira.

114
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:39,118
And even if they do,
there'd be no proof.

115
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:42,484
I can only speculate what
will happen after he dies.

116
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,318
Tomorrow will be
L's, or at least

117
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:48,584
Ryuga and Ryuzaki's,
last day alive.

118
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,818
-Hair.

119
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:03,784
Hm.

120
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,718
Snack crumbs.

121
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:08,051
Hm.

122
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:10,751
Hair.

123
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:11,351
Mr. Yagami?

124
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:13,418
Huh?

125
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:17,451
L: If I die within the next
few days, your son is Kira.

126
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:19,818
Hm, another hair.

127
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:23,284
--[gasp] What did you
just say, Ryuzaki?

128
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:24,251
-Exactly.

129
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,784
What are you talking
about, anyway?

130
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,518
-If anything happens
to me, I've asked

131
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:29,218
Watari to make himself
available to you.

132
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:31,051
So I'm counting on the team.

133
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:34,818
-Ryuzaki, you said he was
almost cleared, and now this?

134
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:37,618
Honestly, how much do
you suspect my son?

135
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:38,784
L: Hm.

136
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:42,251
The truth is, I don't even
what to think anymore.

137
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,684
I've never been in a
situation like this.

138
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:47,851
If Kira and the second Kira
are working together right now,

139
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:50,051
things are not
looking good for me.

140
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:52,784
Given that, I may
not be thinking

141
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:56,018
as clearly as I normally
do, so I could be wrong.

142
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,851
Maybe I still
consider him a suspect

143
00:07:00,884 --> 00:07:04,018
only because we don't
have anyone else.

144
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:07,951
But still, if I do
happen to be killed soon,

145
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:10,284
please assume that
your son is Kira.

146
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:12,918
[gasping]

147
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:16,884
L (VOICEOVER): I have no choice
but to make a sneak attack.

148
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:19,684
This is all a wager now.

149
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,451
LIGHT: [laugh] I
wouldn't say that.

150
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:37,425
I just know how to get
by, that's all. [gasp]

151
00:07:40,018 --> 00:07:41,584
-Hey, what's wrong?

152
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,651
-Ah.

153
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,018
Hey, Light!

154
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:50,718
How's it going?

155
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:55,818
-Kiyomi, can we
continue this later?

156
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,018
I need a moment alone with him.

157
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:58,718
-Uh, OK.

158
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:05,818
-I hope she's not upset.

159
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:06,584
-Never mind that.

160
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:07,951
Is it OK to be here?

161
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:10,651
Didn't you say you were
afraid to appear in public?

162
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:11,884
-Yeah, I did.

163
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,018
But then I realized that
as long as you're not Kira,

164
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,384
I should be safe.

165
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:18,018
The fact is, you're the only
one on the outside who knows me

166
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:22,018
as L. In the unlikely event
that I die in the next few days,

167
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,551
I've instructed your father
and everyone at headquarters

168
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,784
to assume that you are Kira?

169
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:28,951
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Damn him.

170
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:34,484
-Besides, you told me yourself
that you missed having me

171
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,884
around at school, so
I figured, why not

172
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:38,884
come back for a
little change of pace?

173
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,551
As long as it doesn't kill
me, college is a lot of fun.

174
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:44,351
LIGHT: I have to admit,
without you around,

175
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,818
intelligent conversation
is hard to come by.

176
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:47,884
L: [laugh] I see.

177
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,951
Luckily, Kyomi's there
to fill the void.

178
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:51,818
LIGHT: Well,
something like that.

179
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,051
-[laughs]

180
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,718
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Oh, now I don't know.

181
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,918
Is it still OK to
kill him today?

182
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:59,851
No, as soon as I make
the decision to kill him,

183
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:03,384
he suddenly appears, almost as
if to distract me from my goal.

184
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,751
I guess he's trying to
guarantee his safety.

185
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:10,951
And the way things are, I'm
playing right into his hands.

186
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,784
-Hey, do you want to have some
cake with me in the cafeteria?

187
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:14,518
-Sure.

188
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,151
I have a break now anyway.

189
00:09:16,184 --> 00:09:16,718
-Mm.

190
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:17,784
That's perfect.

191
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:21,684
I'm kind of craving
shortcake right now.

192
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:24,218
-Well, let's hope they have it.

193
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:28,018
MISA: Light, there you are!
[giggle] I had a photo shoot

194
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,084
nearby, so I thought
I'd come by to see you.

195
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:32,418
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Misa, you idiot.

196
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:34,251
-Oh, this must be
a friend of yours.

197
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:36,718
He looks so different, unique.

198
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,918
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Wait, I've won.

199
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:42,918
Misa will be able to
see Ryuga's real name.

200
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:43,918
MISA: Hi, there.

201
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,384
I'm Light's
girlfriend, Misa Amane.

202
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,818
Nice to meet you.

203
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:48,718
-I'm Hideki Ryuga.

204
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,251
-Huh?

205
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,118
Hideki Ryuga--

206
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:53,684
-Yeah, he has the exact
same first and last name

207
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,918
as the famous idol.

208
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:56,151
Pretty bizarre, huh?

209
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:58,251
MISA (VOICEOVER): But it's
different than the name

210
00:09:58,284 --> 00:10:00,584
I'm seeing.

211
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:02,318
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Ryuga, deciding

212
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,951
to come here today
was a mistake.

213
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:06,384
-[gasp]

214
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,718
-[laughs]

215
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:11,184
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Why
the hell is he laughing?

216
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:13,784
Could it mean he
knows something?

217
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:14,984
It makes no sense.

218
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:17,451
If he somehow guessed that
she's the second Kira,

219
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:21,484
there's no way he'd
be laughing right now.

220
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:25,051
L: Light, you're a lucky guy?

221
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,484
-Huh?

222
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:28,051
L: I have been huge
fan of yours ever

223
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:29,651
since the August
issue of "Eighteen."

224
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:30,151
-What?

225
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:30,984
Really?

226
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,518
That's so sweet of you?

227
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:33,051
-Hey.

228
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:33,818
Oh, my god.

229
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:34,484
Isn't that girl Misa Misa?

230
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:35,084
-You're right.

231
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:36,718
It's her.

232
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:37,684
Oh, she's so cute.

233
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:38,984
-Oh, wow.

234
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,151
I should have guess I'd be
spotted with all these kids

235
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:41,984
around.

236
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:43,118
-I'm, like, your biggest fan.

237
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,118
-Keep up the good work.

238
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:45,084
-Oh, thank you.

239
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:47,051
Couldn't do it without you.

240
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:48,384
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): What is this?

241
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:49,284
-No way!

242
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:51,418
Somebody just touched my butt.

243
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,251
-Uh.

244
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:54,651
This is an outrage!

245
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:57,351
Taking advantage of this
situation is unforgivable.

246
00:10:57,384 --> 00:10:59,918
I will find whoever is
responsible for this.

247
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,551
-[giggle] Oh, Ryuga.

248
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:02,718
You're so funny.

249
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:03,951
[laughter]

250
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:05,351
MAN: I want to touch her, too.

251
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:07,784
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I want to
ask Misa what L's real name is

252
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:12,218
as soon as possible, but all
these people are in the way.

253
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:14,451
-Misa, it's time.

254
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:16,718
Or were you planning
to be late again?

255
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:18,818
-No, I'm-- I'm sorry, Yoshi.

256
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:19,751
YOSHI: Let's go.

257
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:21,584
MISA: O-- OK.

258
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:22,684
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Perfect.

259
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:24,584
Now that Misa's
away from the crowd,

260
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,851
I just have to give her a call
and ask for L's real name.

261
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:28,818
-Bye, Light.

262
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:30,251
I'll see you after
I'm done work.

263
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:32,484
Miss you already. [giggle]

264
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:37,951
-Now, then.

265
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:39,718
Perhaps we should get going.

266
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,118
-Yeah.

267
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,618
Actually, could you go on ahead?

268
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:44,384
I need to go use the restroom.

269
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:45,684
-Oh, OK, then.

270
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:46,651
I'll see you there.

271
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:02,884
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): It's over.

272
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:08,051
It's been fun, L. I'm
grateful that I was the one

273
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:11,184
to discover your name, so
I could kill you myself.

274
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:32,405
L, it's been fun.

275
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:35,338
I'm grateful that I was the
one to discover your name,

276
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:37,005
so I could kill you myself.

277
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:47,772
[phone ringing]

278
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:53,705
[ringtone]

279
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:07,072
-Yes?

280
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:08,572
Hello?

281
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:10,238
-What do you mean, hello?

282
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:11,938
-Oh, is that you, Light.

283
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:14,805
I guess must have dropped this
phone in all of the commotion

284
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:15,872
earlier on.

285
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:17,172
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): He took it.

286
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:17,672
Bastard.

287
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:24,038
-Uh, hello?

288
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:27,272
LIGHT (ON PHONE): Yeah, that's--
that's Misa's cell phone you

289
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:28,038
have.

290
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,038
I can give it back to her.

291
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:29,872
-Oh, I see.

292
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:30,838
Sure, that makes sense.

293
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:38,272
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Ryuga, he probably thinks

294
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:39,972
he's pretty clever right now.

295
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,772
But Misa has another phone
he doesn't know about.

296
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,938
I'll just call that one instead.

297
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:45,905
[phone ringing]

298
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:47,272
L: Oh.

299
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:50,738
Oh, this time's it's actually
my cell phone. [clears throat]

300
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:51,672
Yes?

301
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,405
Yes, I see.

302
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:56,238
So it's done then?

303
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:56,772
I understand.

304
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,072
I'm not exactly sure
how you'll take this,

305
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:03,638
but regarding Misa
Amane, there's

306
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:05,338
something you should know.

307
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:07,572
We've taken her into
custody under suspicion

308
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:10,038
of being the second Kira.

309
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:11,405
RYUK: [laughs]

310
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:14,105
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): How long
has he known about Misa?

311
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:17,338
I never thought he'd
find her this quickly.

312
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:19,772
-We gathered physical
evidence from the envelopes

313
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,805
that were sent by
the second Kira.

314
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:24,338
In particular, we
recovered hairs and fibers

315
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:26,472
from the masking tape
used to seal them.

316
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:29,005
They matched what we
found in Misa's room.

317
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:30,872
There would be a public
uproar if it gets out

318
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:33,372
that she's been apprehended
as the second Kira.

319
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,572
So officially, we've charged her
manager with drug possession,

320
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:38,605
and she's a voluntary witness.

321
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:40,138
But I doubt any of
this will get out.

322
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:44,738
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I was careless.

323
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:47,605
The videos-- I should have
destroyed all the evidence

324
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,572
before the police had a
chance to go through it.

325
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:53,805
In the end, Ryuga knew
that his best defense

326
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:56,605
was to stay close to me,
rather than trying to hide.

327
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:59,038
He confronted things head on.

328
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:02,372
This wager was my--

329
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:04,038
L (VOICEOVER): Was my--

330
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:07,238
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Was my-- [gasp]

331
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:09,638
-Hm?

332
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:11,005
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Not yet.

333
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:13,636
The real battle is
just beginning, L.

334
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:25,938
-Watari, has she
said anything yet?

335
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,338
WATARI (ON SPEAKER): No,
she hasn't spoken a word.

336
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,338
L: Get me a visual
of her, will you?

337
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:31,738
WATARI (ON SPEAKER):
Are you sure?

338
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:32,272
L: Yes.

339
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:34,638
And quickly.

340
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,505
[gasping]

341
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:41,338
[crying]

342
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:44,805
MAN: Ryuzaki, what's
the meaning of this?

343
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:46,505
L: I've Apprehended
her on suspicion

344
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:47,972
of being the second Kira.

345
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,272
I'm afraid thinks is necessary.

346
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:52,538
-Chances are, Amane is guilty.

347
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:54,538
There seems to be enough
evidence to convict her.

348
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:56,638
But all the same.

349
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,905
-Yes, there can be no mistake.

350
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,238
Now we need a
confession out of her.

351
00:16:01,272 --> 00:16:04,105
We need to know how she
kills, whether she knows Kira,

352
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:06,505
and if so, who he really is.

353
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:08,938
Watari, take the
necessary precautions.

354
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:12,438
But beyond that, you're free to
do whatever has to be done, OK?

355
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,272
Just make her speak.

356
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,572
WATARI (ON SPEAKER): Very well.

357
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:15,505
L: Oh, and Mr. Yagami?

358
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:16,538
-Huh?

359
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:18,738
L: Light has now become
our prime suspect.

360
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:21,072
And I'm probably going to
bring him in for interrogation

361
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,205
as well.

362
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:23,672
Please be prepared for that.

363
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:46,138
WATARI (ON SPEAKER):
Ryuzaki, Amane is talking.

364
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,405
-Huh?

365
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:50,238
Quickly, get me a
visual and audio.

366
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:51,572
[grunt]

367
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:54,272
MAN: Finally, after
three days of this, huh?

368
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:59,126
[crying] I-- I can't
take it anymore.

369
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:02,172
Kill me.

370
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,105
-Huh?

371
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:04,238
-Kill me.

372
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:06,705
Please just kill me.

373
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:08,005
-I don't know.

374
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:10,538
Maybe this was all too much
for a young girl to take.

375
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,305
-He's right.

376
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:13,872
We've pushed her too far.

377
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:16,905
ROBOT: Misa Amane,
can you hear me?

378
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:18,038
-I hear you.

379
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:21,372
Please, just kill me now.

380
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,538
-Does this mean you admit
to being the second Kira?

381
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:25,638
Is this the reason
you wish to die.

382
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:26,772
-No.

383
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:29,738
I don't know anything
about the second Kira.

384
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:31,972
I really can't
take this anymore.

385
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:34,272
I'd rather be dead.

386
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:36,872
Now hurry up and kill me!

387
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:42,438
If you wanted to, you could
kill me right now, couldn't you?

388
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:44,638
-Misa, do you mean--

389
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:45,538
-Yes.

390
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:46,538
Kill me.

391
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:49,572
-Do you really mean that, Misa?

392
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:53,072
-Yes, I do.

393
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,605
[sigh] I can't take it anymore.

394
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:57,572
Kill me.

395
00:17:57,605 --> 00:18:00,705
-If I do this, then
Light Yagami dies, too.

396
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,305
This is all his fault.

397
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:03,338
-You can't.

398
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:04,472
No, you can't.

399
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:06,072
Please, just kill me.

400
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:07,672
-Why, Misa?

401
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:11,405
Why do you want to die for him?

402
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:12,305
MISA: Fine!

403
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:14,638
If you won't kill me--

404
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:15,638
-Stop her!

405
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:16,805
Watari, don't let
her bite her tongue.

406
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:19,438
[muffled yelling]

407
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:25,472
-Is it possible
that this behavior

408
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,138
could be attributed
to Kira controlling

409
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,405
her actions before death?

410
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:32,938
-Oh, what's the matter, Rem?

411
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:39,705
-Light Yagami, Misa
has refused my offer

412
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:42,872
to help her escape, no
doubt because she knows

413
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:45,605
it would cause you trouble,
since the police would then

414
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:48,272
have proof of her powers.

415
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:51,672
When her suffering became
more than she could bear,

416
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:55,938
she started begging
me to kill her.

417
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:59,205
All of this because she
wants you to love her.

418
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:05,472
I could not possibly
let it go on like that.

419
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:07,972
I couldn't bring
myself to do it.

420
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:12,505
There was only one way to
save her from her suffering.

421
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:15,372
-Forfeiting ownership
of the Death Note.

422
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,505
-Yes.

423
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:19,838
If Misa forfeits ownership
of the Death Note,

424
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:22,705
all her memories related
to it would disappear.

425
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:26,272
All the murders she
committed with it, the fact

426
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:30,138
that you are Kira-- all
those memories would be gone.

427
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,805
Your secret would be safe.

428
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:38,572
Also, Misa would no longer be
able to Ryuk or me, either.

429
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:45,138
Misa, when this is done,
you'll forget everything

430
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:47,805
about Shinigami
and the Death Note.

431
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:50,172
-[whimpering]

432
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,505
-It's OK.

433
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:55,605
The human being who you
love is Light Yagami.

434
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:57,605
I promise those
feelings will remain.

435
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:05,205
So Misa, forfeit ownership
of the Death Note,

436
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:09,538
and leave everything
to Light Yagami.

437
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:10,038
-Mhm.

438
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:31,172
-Huh?

439
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:31,672
Hm.

440
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,005
-And so Misa is no longer
the owner of a Death Note.

441
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:45,805
-You did the right thing, Rem.

442
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,372
I was beginning
to think that was

443
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:49,905
the only way out
of this situation.

444
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,838
If her memories
of the Death Note

445
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:53,305
are gone, than
chances are, they'll

446
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:56,005
have to release her eventually.

447
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,738
-Light Yagami, I
proposed this to Misa,

448
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:00,872
knowing it was exactly
what you wanted

449
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:02,905
and that it would
serve your purposes.

450
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,472
But I did so on one condition.

451
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:09,938
And that is, if you don't
save Misa, I will kill you.

452
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:20,572
-I understand.

453
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:24,138
And I have a pretty good
idea what L will do next.

454
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:25,438
I have a plan.

455
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:31,538
This is goodbye, Ryuk.

456
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:32,038
Huh?

457
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:42,468
[theme music]

458
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:54,401
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Yeah, I know
I must look pretty bad in here.

459
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:57,334
But this useless
pride, I suppose

460
00:22:57,368 --> 00:23:02,201
I'll have to get rid of it.
