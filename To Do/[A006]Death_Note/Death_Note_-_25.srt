00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:47,155
[crying]

00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,022
[bell chiming]

4
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:53,996
-Ryuzaki.

5
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:55,496
Is something the matter?

6
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:55,996
What is it?

7
00:02:58,996 --> 00:02:59,463
Hm?

8
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:04,696
What's wrong?

9
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:15,596
-Hm.

10
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,963
Interesting.

11
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,729
The corner of the page of this
notebook has been torn off.

12
00:03:19,763 --> 00:03:23,263
Can you kill someone just by
writing their name on a piece?

13
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:24,396
-Can't say.

14
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:26,029
I've never tried
using it like that,

15
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:28,696
and I don't know
of anyone who has.

16
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:29,729
-Then let me ask you.

17
00:03:29,763 --> 00:03:32,129
Do gods of death love apples?

18
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:33,763
-Not necessarily.

19
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,729
You see, our internal organs
have already degraded.

20
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:41,929
We've evolved to a point where
we do not require sustenance.

21
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:42,696
-Say, Light.

22
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:47,563
You're finally free to leave
headquarters on your own,

23
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:50,629
but it seems like
you never go out.

24
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,396
Even when Misa comes
to visit, you only

25
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:54,829
chat with her for a
few minutes outside.

26
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:57,629
You do realize you're free to
have a relationship with her

27
00:03:57,663 --> 00:03:58,929
now?

28
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:01,863
-That can wait until we've
managed to solve this case.

29
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:04,763
I'm not in the mood for love
or anything else right now.

30
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:07,463
Anyway, are you
suggesting that I'll

31
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,596
be a nuisance for staying here?

32
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:10,096
-No.

33
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:36,696
LIGHT: Right now,
I'm in no position

34
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,996
to continue punishing criminals.

35
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,596
That's why I need you
to punish them for me.

36
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:47,696
Misa.

37
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,429
Let's create a new
world together.

38
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:18,296
-(SINGING) Careful what you
do, 'cause God is watching

39
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,629
your every move.

40
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:24,363
Hold my hand in the dark street.

41
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:29,896
For if you do, I know
that I'll be safe.

42
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,029
Even if I'm far
away and alone, I

43
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:38,063
can be sure that
you'll find me there.

44
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,229
This I know.

45
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:43,429
You draw me close for a while.

46
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:44,463
So quiet.

47
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:45,863
You tell me everything.

48
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:53,029
If I forget what you say,
then you'd come to me

49
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:57,396
and tell me again.

50
00:05:57,429 --> 00:06:00,696
Yes, you'd tell me once again.

51
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:12,396
But what happens
when I know it all?

52
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:16,063
Then what should
I do after that?

53
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:17,063
What then?

54
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,729
-What's going on?

55
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,296
I heard criminals are
being killed again.

56
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,329
-There were 16 deaths
just yesterday.

57
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:36,163
All of them were broadcast
after Higuchi's death.

58
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,896
-Immediately after, huh?

59
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:40,696
-Do you think this could mean
that Higuchi wasn't necessarily

60
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:41,863
Kira after all?

61
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,096
-No.

62
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:44,863
It's safe to say that
Higuchi was the one killing

63
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,663
criminals until we
apprehended him.

64
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:50,196
-Then this means we're
dealing with yet another Kira.

65
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,929
-Aw, man!

66
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,396
Not again!

67
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:54,229
-Damn.

68
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:55,596
Damn you, Kira.

69
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,229
L (VOICEOVER): Another
Kira's appeared?

70
00:06:57,263 --> 00:07:00,363
What's going on here?

71
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:02,396
REM (VOICEOVER): I
can't believe this.

72
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:05,129
It has to be Misa.

73
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,896
-These killings began as soon
as Misa was free, didn't they?

74
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:10,563
-Ryuzaki, are you still
going on about that?

75
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,429
She has nothing to do with this.

76
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:13,629
Think about it.

77
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,329
This started as soon
as Higuchi died.

78
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:18,996
-I suppose you're right.

79
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:20,296
Oh, well.

80
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,396
If there is another notebook
floating around out there

81
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:25,863
and someone is now using
it to kill criminals,

82
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:28,429
I'll just have to bring
that person to justice.

83
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:38,296
The Shinigami insisted
that it didn't know,

84
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,396
but if someone were
able to kill simply

85
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:44,529
by writing a name on a torn
piece of the notebook--

86
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:48,029
It's not impossible,
but there's that rule.

87
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:49,596
Whoever writes a
name in this notebook

88
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,063
has to write another
name within 13 days.

89
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,429
Otherwise, they die.

90
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:58,696
Light Yagami and Misa
Amane are both still alive.

91
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,463
13 days.

92
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:02,929
That's the only problem.

93
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:07,796
-Ryuzaki, I've
been thinking, even

94
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:10,263
if we do manage to catch the
person who's been writing names

95
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:12,096
in the notebook,
will we really be

96
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,963
able to legally convict and
punish them for mass homicide?

97
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,463
-What?

98
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,796
Of course we can convict them.

99
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,229
This guy's intentionally
writing names in the notebook,

100
00:08:20,263 --> 00:08:22,096
knowing that these
people are going to die.

101
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:24,063
Even if we don't plan on
publicly acknowledging

102
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:27,196
the notebook, the least we
can do is execute the killer.

103
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,663
CHIEF YAGAMI: It's not a
very humane way to do things,

104
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:31,063
but the higher
ups would probably

105
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,829
want to take measures like that.

106
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:34,663
-If they admit to killing
with the notebook,

107
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:37,096
they'd receive the death
penalty, or life in prison,

108
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:39,996
at least.

109
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:42,229
That's the best that
they could hope for.

110
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:43,829
REM (VOICEOVER): What
are you thinking,

111
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:45,963
Light Yagami, making
Misa kill again?

112
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:47,729
She'll be caught, and
once that happens,

113
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:52,729
you'll also be-- So
that's what your plan is.

114
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:53,963
You're truly disgusting.

115
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:59,596
Light Yagami is certain
that I will do anything

116
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,096
to help Misa and save her life.

117
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:04,963
And at this point, the only
way for me to save Misa

118
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:09,896
is to write Ryuzaki's
real name in my notebook.

119
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:15,863
And if I kill Ryuzaki, it
would mean that I deliberately

120
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:20,096
lengthened Misa's life,
and I will die as well.

121
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,829
Light Yagami has
planned everything

122
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:26,296
so that it will work
out in his favor.

123
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:28,596
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): What
are you gonna do, Rem?

124
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,463
You may be a Shinigami,
but you can't hide the fact

125
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,396
that you care for Misa.

126
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:35,063
There's no way you
would turn your back

127
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:38,796
on her now, after she's already
halved her lifespan twice.

128
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:39,829
Come on.

129
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:41,163
Think about Misa's happiness.

130
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:49,317
What are you doing, standing
out there by yourself?

131
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,050
(LOUDER) What are you doing
standing out there by yourself?

132
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:12,675
What are you doing, Ryuzaki?

133
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:15,109
-Oh, I'm not doing
anything in particular.

134
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,009
It's just, I hear the bell.

135
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:20,975
-The bell?

136
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:22,442
-Yes.

137
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:28,209
The sound of the bell is
being unusually loud today.

138
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:29,242
-Hm?

139
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:32,409
I don't hear anything.

140
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,275
-Really?

141
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,375
You can't hear it?

142
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,309
It's been ringing
nonstop all day.

143
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:39,342
I find it very distracting.

144
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,775
I wonder if it's a church?

145
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:44,375
Maybe a wedding, or perhaps a--

146
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,642
-What are you
getting at, Ryuzaki?

147
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:47,475
Come on, cut it out.

148
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:50,575
Let's get back inside.

149
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,542
-I'm sorry.

150
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:55,575
Nothing I say makes
any sense, anyway.

151
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,175
If I were you, I wouldn't
believe any of it.

152
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,842
-You know, you're totally right.

153
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,609
Honestly, most of the
things you say sound

154
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:12,242
like complete nonsense.

155
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,509
There'd be no end to my
troubles if I actually

156
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:16,442
took you seriously all the time.

157
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:19,375
I probably know that
better than anyone.

158
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,109
-Yes.

159
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:23,842
I would say that's
a fair assessment.

160
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,675
But I could say
the same about you.

161
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:28,575
-Hm?

162
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:32,442
What's that supposed to mean?

163
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:34,642
-Tell me, Light, from
the moment you were born,

164
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,042
has there ever
been a point where

165
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:37,309
you've actually told the truth?

166
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:46,442
-Where's this coming
from, Ryuzaki?

167
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,809
I do admit, I stretch
the truth here and there.

168
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:52,575
However, find me one
person in this world who's

169
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:53,809
never had to tell a lie.

170
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:56,175
It wouldn't be easy.

171
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,475
Human beings just aren't
made to be perfect like that.

172
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:02,175
Everybody lies
from time to time.

173
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,709
Even so, I've always
made a conscious effort

174
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,742
to be careful not to tell a
lie that could hurt others.

175
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:08,975
That's my answer.

176
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,442
-I had a feeling you'd
say something like that.

177
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:20,975
Let's go back inside.

178
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,842
We're both drenched.

179
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,342
LIGHT: Yeah.

180
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:38,175
-Well, that was certainly
an unpleasant outing.

181
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,142
-It's your own fault.

182
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:42,342
I mean, what did you expect?

183
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,642
L: You're right.

184
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:44,142
Sorry.

185
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:54,709
-What are you doing?

186
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:56,675
-I thought I might help you out.

187
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:59,242
You were busy wiping
yourself off, anyway.

188
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,275
-Look, it's fine.

189
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:01,542
You don't have to do that.

190
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,575
-I can give you a
massage, as well.

191
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,509
It's the least I can do
to atone for my sins.

192
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:09,609
I'm actually pretty
good at this.

193
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:10,242
-Fine.

194
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:11,475
Do what you want.

195
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:12,109
-All right.

196
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,842
-Hey.

197
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,342
-You'll get used to it.

198
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:33,242
-Here.

199
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:34,075
You're still soaked.

200
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:37,875
-I'm sorry.

201
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:03,109
It'll be lonely, won't it?

202
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:03,609
-Hm?

203
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,209
-You and I will be
parting ways soon.

204
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:16,842
[phone ringing]

205
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,342
-Yes?

206
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,342
I understand.

207
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,675
I'm on my way.

208
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:23,175
-Huh?

209
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:27,609
-Come on.

210
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:29,275
Let's go, Light.

211
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:30,975
It seems like it's
all worked out.

212
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:34,809
-Hm?

213
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:42,575
-Ryuzaki.

214
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,742
What's the meaning of all this?

215
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,842
You've somehow gotten
approval from another country

216
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,109
to use the notebook
for an execution?

217
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:50,209
-Watari.

218
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,109
Excellent work.

219
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:51,775
Thank you.

220
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:53,075
WATARI: Not at all.

221
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:54,275
-First things first.

222
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,242
Please make arrangements
to transport the notebook

223
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:56,775
immediately.

224
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,075
WATARI: Right.

225
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:00,975
-Ryuzaki, what are
you trying to do?

226
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,409
L: I'm going to try out
the notebook for real.

227
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,242
-We can't do that!

228
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:08,709
And there's no point
in testing it now

229
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:11,209
when we already know the
notebook's power is real.

230
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:13,575
-And besides, who's
gonna write the name?

231
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,309
If someone starts
writing in the notebook,

232
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,175
they'll have to obey
the 13 day rule,

233
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,742
and keep writing names forever.

234
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:20,975
L: It's already been worked out.

235
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,875
The person who will write in
the book is a criminal scheduled

236
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:26,542
to be executed is
just over 13 days.

237
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:29,342
If he's still alive 13 days
after writing the name,

238
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,309
he'll be pardoned
from execution.

239
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:33,675
-But still, to
sacrifice a life--

240
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,642
L: We're very close.

241
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:38,709
If we work this out, the
entire case will be solved.

242
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:44,642
[alarm]

243
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:45,642
-What is this?

244
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:47,609
A-- a blackout?

245
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:51,075
[gasping]

246
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,009
-Watari?

247
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:01,475
Watari!

248
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:06,742
-Data deletion?

249
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,509
What the hell's going on?

250
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:12,675
-I told Watari to make sure that
he should erase all information

251
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:15,642
in the event that something
were to happen to him.

252
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,642
-If something were to happen?

253
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:19,475
-Could it be--

254
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:20,575
-Where is the Shinigami?

255
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,575
-Good question.

256
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,375
I don't see it.

257
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,409
-It disappeared?

258
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:28,075
-What's going on?

259
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,675
-Everyone, the Shiniga--

260
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:30,642
[heartbeat]

261
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:01,109
-Ryuzaki!

262
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:02,109
What's wrong?

263
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:10,609
[bells ringing]

264
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,375
-Hey-- Ryuzaki.

265
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,675
Come on.

266
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:11,642
Snap out of it!

267
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:12,875
-What happened?

268
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:14,442
-What's going on?

269
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:17,175
[screaming]

270
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:19,109
-Calm down, Light.

271
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:20,375
-We're gonna die!

272
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,475
Watari, Ryuzaki.

273
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:22,909
It'll be us next!

274
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,509
Damn you!

275
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,875
Where are you, Shinigami?

276
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,442
Come out!

277
00:19:41,475 --> 00:19:42,542
-Wait, Light.

278
00:19:42,575 --> 00:19:45,109
-You know something
about this, don't you?

279
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,875
Come on out!

280
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:49,142
-We'd better go and look, too.

281
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:49,642
-Right.

282
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:50,275
-Mogi.

283
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:51,409
Take over for me.

284
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:51,909
-OK.

285
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:15,975
-There's something here!

286
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:17,475
-What the hell is this stuff?

287
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,642
-Sand?

288
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,209
-What does this mean?

289
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:25,142
-Whatever it might mean,
whatever happens next,

290
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:28,675
I swear I'll avenge
Ryuzaki's death.

291
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,575
We're going to solve
this case in honor

292
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:37,175
of him, and for Watari,
and all the other victims.

293
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:38,542
-Oh, Light.

294
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:39,475
-Let's do this.

295
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:41,775
For them.

296
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:45,109
-Yeah, but aren't we
all gonna get killed?

297
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:47,642
Isn't that what all
this really means?

298
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:48,975
-Matsuda.

299
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,709
If you're afraid of dying,
then leave the investigation.

300
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:55,209
We put our lives on the line
when we chose to be here.

301
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:55,742
-Yeah.

302
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:57,875
That's true.

303
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:00,575
But it-- it's weird
hearing you say that.

304
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:01,675
You sound like Ryuzaki.

305
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,775
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I've gotten
rid of everything in my way.

306
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:29,109
I am the god of the New World.

307
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:40,009
[theme music]

308
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,623
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Ryuzaki, Watari, Rem.

309
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,377
I've gotten rid of
everything in my way.

310
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,010
I am the god of the New World.
