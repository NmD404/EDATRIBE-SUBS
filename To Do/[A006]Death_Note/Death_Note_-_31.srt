00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,766
[theme music]

2
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,772
-The current Kira is
foolish and overconfident,

3
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,272
not to mention
unusually cooperative

4
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:41,072
with the task force.

5
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:43,805
In fact, I suspect he's
working hand in hand with them.

6
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,939
-You think so?

7
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,005
-That would make the
second L and Kira one

8
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,039
in the same person.

9
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:51,839
To the members of the
Japanese task force,

10
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,505
was there ever a point in the
investigation where the Second

11
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,839
L was suspected to be Kira,
even if the suspicions were

12
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:58,239
later dropped?

13
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,239
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Near.

14
00:01:59,272 --> 00:02:02,105
I have to kill him.

15
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:03,239
-This is really bad.

16
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:04,239
Turn on the TV.

17
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:05,372
It's Demegawa!

18
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:07,205
-This is Demegawa live!

19
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,405
My comrades and I have
finally pinpointed the hideout

20
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,505
of the evil organization
bent on trying

21
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,972
to catch our beloved god Kira.

22
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:15,939
We now have the building
completely surrounded!

23
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,505
Hello, Kira supporters.

24
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,472
I urge you, do not rush
the building all at once.

25
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,739
The traitors may attempt
to blend in with the crowd

26
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,705
to escape.

27
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,705
I am Kira's loyal
servant and spokesman.

28
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,305
You must listen to me!

29
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,672
Find them, pull them
from the building,

30
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,639
and bring them in
front of the cameras.

31
00:02:55,672 --> 00:02:57,105
They'll be a sacrifice for Kira!

32
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:06,005
-You can't hide from me.

33
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,105
I'll find you.

34
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:09,805
-Near.

35
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:10,739
You've got no choice.

36
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:12,405
You'd better evacuate.

37
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,805
-You've got some nerve
to say that, being Kira.

38
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:15,905
-What?

39
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:18,172
Are you still going on
about that nonsense?

40
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:19,239
-Think about it.

41
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:21,105
With all the anti-Kira
groups around,

42
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,305
why is it we're being
targeted, and right after I

43
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:24,772
start suspecting you?

44
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,705
Pretty convenient,
if you ask me.

45
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,739
-Near, with all due
respect, you're wrong.

46
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:32,139
You're jumping to conclusions.

47
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,805
-Members of the task
force, please listen to me.

48
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,339
Kira is likely amongst you.

49
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:38,672
Even as we speak,
he is in that room.

50
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:42,572
I'm simply asking you to
think about this carefully.

51
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,439
-(VOICEOVER) Light is Kira.

52
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:47,505
This is all sounding
way too familiar.

53
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:50,305
The original L also thought
that Light had to be Kira.

54
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,705
-The first wave of 20
people will break the door

55
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,139
and get inside.

56
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:05,205
Second wave, stand by!

57
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:05,905
-Wait!

58
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,139
We're the first wave!

59
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:07,639
-What?

60
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:08,272
Like hell.

61
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:09,105
We're going first!

62
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:15,305
-Near, we have to
evacuate immediately.

63
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,505
-Really, what pathetic people.

64
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,672
I'm not surprised that there
are ordinary people who

65
00:04:20,705 --> 00:04:22,839
support what Kira's
trying to do.

66
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,505
I'm talking about
honest citizens who

67
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,239
believe in their hearts
that, by punishing evildoers,

68
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:30,272
Kira will actually make this
world a better place to live.

69
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:32,305
But, as for this
crowd outside, they're

70
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,505
a completely different breed.

71
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,172
They are truly
despicable and stupid.

72
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,839
This is just a
diversion for them.

73
00:04:37,872 --> 00:04:40,772
They're all selfish.

74
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:43,239
-I-- I know that, but it still
leaves us with the immediate

75
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:44,605
problem.

76
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,072
We'll use L's legacy and the
anti-Kira protesters we hired.

77
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:51,005
-Yes, but we only have
one shot with that plan.

78
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,739
-I'm aware of that, but I can't
imagine a better time to do it.

79
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,139
Besides, it should
be interesting.

80
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:13,905
-What?

81
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,372
It's-- It's money!

82
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:26,805
-Money?

83
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,139
There's so much!

84
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:31,005
-What?

85
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,905
That's a lot.

86
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,305
Amazing!

87
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,672
Man, I wish I were
over there right now.

88
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:37,072
-Matsuda.

89
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:38,005
-Heh.

90
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,839
Humans are so interesting.

91
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,472
Of course, you can use
money to get apples,

92
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,405
so I can kind of understand.

93
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,372
-I got these first, you bastard!

94
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:47,239
-Out of the way!

95
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:48,639
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Dammit!

96
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:51,039
He's planning to use all this
chaos to escape into the crowd.

97
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:53,072
Even so, he can't escape
from Demegawa's cameras.

98
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,639
-Over there, pilot!

99
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:01,872
Go to the floor where all
the money's coming from!

100
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:02,739
-Geez!

101
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:04,372
What are you doing, Demegawa?

102
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,805
Don't you know that you can't
buy love and peace with money?

103
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,772
NEWSCASTER: A literal
downpour of money

104
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:13,405
is causing mayhem
in lower Manhattan.

105
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,705
NEWSCASTER: The
police have arrived.

106
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:16,672
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Police?

107
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:18,039
NEWSCASTER: They're
a welcome sight

108
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:19,105
in the midst of what can only
be called a full scale riot.

109
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,405
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): This is bad.

110
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,305
At this rate--

111
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,339
-Let's go.

112
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,905
This is our window
of opportunity.

113
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,605
We can leave via the front exit.

114
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,239
-It makes sense that
the police would

115
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,572
have to mobilize for
a riot like this.

116
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:35,605
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Damn!

117
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,172
Near was prepared
for this situation.

118
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,439
He's planning to come out
along with the rest of them,

119
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:40,772
and if I tell Aizawa
and the others

120
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:42,472
to keep an eye on the
police, it will only

121
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,205
make me look that
much more suspicious.

122
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,439
NEWSCASTER: The police are
coming out of the building.

123
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,005
They've secured the area.

124
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:52,039
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Where is he?

125
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:54,572
He's got to be in
there somewhere!

126
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:55,072
Where?

127
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:05,205
Dammit.

128
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,605
-How much money do
you think was there?

129
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,572
Bet it was a lot.

130
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:34,272
AIZAWA: Matsuda!

131
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:35,439
Knock it off.

132
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:37,605
-It bet it was around
$10 million or something.

133
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,305
-Ooh.

134
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,139
What's that in apples?

135
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:47,605
[beeping]

136
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,005
-Near.

137
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:49,505
Already?

138
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,005
NEAR (ON SPEAKERS):
This is Near.

139
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:58,939
We've reestablished
a secure connection,

140
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:01,372
so I thought I should give
you a call to let you know.

141
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:02,772
LIGHT (ON SPEAKERS):
You're safe.

142
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:04,105
That's a relief.

143
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,905
-To all of you on
the task force,

144
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,905
I'm sure that by now
some of you are starting

145
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,805
to suspect that Kira
may be one of you.

146
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,705
Given the timing of today's
attack on our headquarters,

147
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:16,405
I don't think anyone could
blame you for having doubts.

148
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,572
If you don't suspect the
second L of being Kira by now,

149
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:22,772
you're in the
wrong line of work.

150
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:25,505
The number I gave you the day
before has been reconnected.

151
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,172
Please feel free to
call any time you like.

152
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:31,272
Well then, I'll be
waiting for your call.

153
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:38,472
-Those were some strong words.

154
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:39,872
This guy's pretty
sure of himself.

155
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,805
-I've been thinking, and if you
want to cooperate with Near,

156
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,705
please go ahead.

157
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:51,172
I'm not particularly
satisfied with the way things

158
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:52,339
are going either.

159
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:55,039
Ideally, we should
cooperate with the SPK.

160
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:57,439
Maybe this will clear
the air a little.

161
00:08:57,472 --> 00:08:59,805
Still, it kinda feels like
Near's against us, doesn't it?

162
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,572
AIZAWA: When I think about
Deputy Director Yagami--

163
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:31,505
I don't want to suspect Light
even a little bit, but--

164
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,972
-Dad?

165
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,372
Welcome back.

166
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:36,739
I didn't know you were
gonna be home tonight.

167
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:37,605
-Oh, yeah.

168
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,139
What are you still doing awake?

169
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:41,339
-I've a couple of
exams coming up.

170
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,705
-I see.

171
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,839
Well, don't push
yourself too hard, OK?

172
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:45,472
-Kay.

173
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:46,039
You too, dad.

174
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,539
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I wouldn't be
surprised if one of the others

175
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:09,505
contacted Near.

176
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:10,972
It's inevitable.

177
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,672
The problem is what
comes after that.

178
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:15,672
If I'm too late
to act, something

179
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:17,839
might happen that I won't
be able to take back.

180
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:25,272
I've got no choice but to do it.

181
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:26,272
[beeping]

182
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:27,239
-Oh!

183
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:29,205
An emergency order from Light!

184
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:29,705
Yay!

185
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:33,372
Hm.

186
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:36,139
File number three.

187
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:36,639
Huh?

188
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:43,105
No way.

189
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,372
[phone ringing]

190
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:47,505
NEAR: Yes?

191
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:49,172
This is Near.

192
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:51,305
AIZAWA: I'm with the
Japanese task force.

193
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:52,039
My name is Aizawa.

194
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,710
MISA: So, the time
has finally come.

195
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,743
If I do this my
safety is guaranteed,

196
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:16,710
and I can finally just
to be a normal wife.

197
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,443
This is what Light wants for me.

198
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,243
He wants me to be happy,
just as a woman should be.

199
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:23,943
Thank you, Light.

200
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:28,377
-NEAR: I see.

201
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,510
That's very interesting.

202
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:31,377
You're saying there were
two suspects in the Kira

203
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,377
investigation that the
previous L detained

204
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,377
for more than 50
days, and they were

205
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,577
cleared based on
the 13 day rule.

206
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,777
Correct?

207
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,743
AIZAWA: Yes.

208
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:41,077
But of course,
that alone doesn't

209
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,410
come prove they were Kira.

210
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:44,610
NEAR: And L was willing to
release them because of that?

211
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:45,843
-No.

212
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:48,010
L had Deputy Director
Yagami, the chief detective

213
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:50,077
at the time, put on an act.

214
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,477
He was instructed to tell the
suspects that they had both

215
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,210
been found guilty of being
Kira and the second Kira,

216
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,810
and that they were
going to be executed.

217
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,377
Then on the way,
the deputy director

218
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,877
pulled over and pointed
a gun at the suspects.

219
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,243
He said that he would first
kill Kira, then himself.

220
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:09,443
The idea was that
if he were Kira,

221
00:12:09,477 --> 00:12:14,243
the suspect would have killed
the chief right then and there.

222
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:16,043
-(VOICEOVER) Kira
is quite impressive.

223
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:20,010
He must have used his detainment
to demonstrate his innocence.

224
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,743
Well done.

225
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:23,677
Out of curiosity,
did the suspect

226
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,810
volunteer to be detained as
part of the investigation?

227
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:28,177
-Hm.

228
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,177
Come to think of it, Light did
volunteer to be imprisoned.

229
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:36,243
NEAR: If he did, then I'd
say that settles the matter.

230
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,710
Wouldn't you?

231
00:12:37,743 --> 00:12:39,243
So, who was it?

232
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:41,777
Who were those two suspects?

233
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,410
-I can't tell you that much.

234
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:45,043
I'm willing to
cooperate, but I'm still

235
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:49,043
a member of the Japanese
task force working under L.

236
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:50,610
NEAR: I understand.

237
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,477
Thank you very much.
you information's

238
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,610
been quite valuable, especially
the part about Shinigami's eyes

239
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:58,010
that enable you to see
other peoples' names.

240
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,443
It was very helpful.

241
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:01,877
Goodbye.

242
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,377
-Hm.

243
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,243
RESTER: Will that
be enough, Near?

244
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:11,610
Shouldn't you have pressed
for a little more information?

245
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:13,077
-I think that all
things considered,

246
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,143
his level of cooperation
is fine for now.

247
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:20,377
And besides, I discovered
something very important.

248
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,243
The person suspected
of being Kira

249
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:25,610
is Deputy Director Yagami's son.

250
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,677
It's the only
possible explanation.

251
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,210
Why else would the
deputy director

252
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:33,110
say he would kill
Kira, and then himself?

253
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:35,410
Therefore, tha
tmeans the second L,

254
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:39,843
and hte person I think is
Kira, can only be one man.

255
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:40,377
Light Yagami.

256
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,443
AIZAWA: Light.

257
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:53,510
-Yes?

258
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:55,243
-There's something
you should know.

259
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:57,277
I phoned Near and talked to him.

260
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:03,977
-Don't worry about it.

261
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,543
After all, I was the
one who recommended it.

262
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:10,210
So, what did the two of
you end up discussing?

263
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,277
No, on second thought, I
probably shouldn't ask.

264
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,843
I guess it's not
appropriate for me

265
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:16,477
to ask those kinds of
questions if I'm a suspect.

266
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,577
-Hm.

267
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,643
Don't get me wrong.

268
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:21,643
I want to believe
that you aren't Kira,

269
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:22,777
but I've got to be certain.

270
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,410
I'm sorry to have
to do this again,

271
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,077
but I want to put you
under surveillance

272
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,843
until we catch Kira.

273
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:30,710
I'm afraid that goes
for Misa Amane as well.

274
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:32,910
I'm going to search
your place right now.

275
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:35,977
There's a possibility that
Amane might have a notebook.

276
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,910
-Hang on a second, Aizawa!

277
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:38,643
-No.

278
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,377
Go right ahead.

279
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,410
Look at this way.

280
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:41,877
At least you can
prove to everyone

281
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,610
that I'm not sneaking around
and contacting Misa in private,

282
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:45,110
right?

283
00:14:57,943 --> 00:14:59,710
-Huh?

284
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:00,910
Mogi?

285
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:01,777
-I'm coming with you.

286
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,143
I want to make sure, too.

287
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,610
-It would be best for
everyone if Light wasn't Kira.

288
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,777
But if Amane has any
evidence on her that

289
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,643
connects her with Kira, then--

290
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:27,343
[doorbell]

291
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,743
-Huh?

292
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,243
-Motchi, Monchichi, long
time no see, you two!

293
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:51,643
Light hasn't been
home at all lately,

294
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:53,577
so I've been super bored.

295
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,810
-Uh--

296
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:56,943
-Well, there's no way she's
got the notebook hidden

297
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:58,343
under a dress like that.

298
00:15:58,377 --> 00:15:59,877
-We were just
investigating a tip

299
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,910
that there were explosives
planted in L's house.

300
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:04,410
We think it's a prank, but we'd
like to check the rooms, just

301
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:05,477
in case.

302
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,043
-What?

303
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:06,643
How about Light?

304
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:07,443
Is he OK?

305
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:08,377
I have to call him.

306
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,277
-No.

307
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,443
You can't call him right now.

308
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:11,543
-How come?

309
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:12,677
-Don't worry.

310
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,310
Light's safe, but he's
really busy right now.

311
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:15,910
He has some other
things he has to do,

312
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:19,077
so he's handed the investigation
over to us for the time being.

313
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,510
-Oh, I get it.

314
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:22,243
Light loves me like
crazy, so he doesn't

315
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:23,910
want me to call him,
'cause that'll only

316
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,277
make him worry about me.

317
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,077
-(VOICEOVER) Search as
much as you like, Aizawa.

318
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,443
You won't find the notebook.

319
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,843
[yawn]

320
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:43,577
-I wouldn't like
all the suspicion

321
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,543
to ruin the atmosphere
around here.

322
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:47,510
-This isn't a social club.

323
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:49,910
I think Aizawa and Mogi
should do as they see fit.

324
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,377
-It's time for Kira's Kingdom.

325
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:05,110
-Greetings to all my
fellow Kira worshippers.

326
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:08,810
I am Demegawa, the
voice of our god, Kira.

327
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:09,810
Behold!

328
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:11,843
This is the new
Kira's Kingdom, which

329
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:14,043
shares its name
with this program.

330
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:15,977
Its construction
is going smoothly,

331
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,343
but will depend on the generous
support of our loyal viewers.

332
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:24,243
Once it has been completed,
let us welcome our god here!

333
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:24,943
-Whoa.

334
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,043
Talk about bad taste.

335
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:34,577
-Hey, so is everything OK?

336
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,410
-Oh, yeah.

337
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:36,943
Seems like it was just a prank.

338
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:38,210
-Oh.

339
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:39,743
-But just in case, one of
us is going to stay and keep

340
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:41,477
watch over you for
the next few days.

341
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,177
-Really?

342
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,477
Oh, that would be great.

343
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,243
Mogi, why don't you go
back to headquarters?

344
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:47,610
I'll say on guard here.

345
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:48,610
-Huh?

346
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:51,010
I'm with Monchichi
instead of Motchi?

347
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:51,677
-What's wrong?

348
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,843
Don't you trust me?

349
00:17:52,877 --> 00:17:54,110
-No.

350
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,177
You're just not Monchichi
without your old haircut.

351
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,810
You're not cute anymore.

352
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,310
[laughter]

353
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:00,043
-Mogi!

354
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:01,410
-Yes, sir. my apologies.

355
00:18:01,443 --> 00:18:02,010
-All right.

356
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:04,443
You stay.

357
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:07,810
-We are now accepting donations,
starting at the million yen

358
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:10,477
mark towards the completion
of Kira's Kingdom.

359
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,043
So, if you truly--

360
00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:13,043
-This sounds like a con.

361
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:13,877
-Yep.

362
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,843
Just another scam at this point.

363
00:18:16,877 --> 00:18:19,910
-It doesn't even seem
like Kira's style.

364
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:21,177
-(VOICEOVER) Demegawa.

365
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,177
He's just acting on his own now.

366
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,677
If he keeps doing
this, he'll end up

367
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,577
pushing people away from Kira.

368
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,077
I don't need him anymore.

369
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,043
But I can't do
much at the moment.

370
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:36,910
-Hey.

371
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:37,577
Welcome back, Aizawa.

372
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,577
-We didn't find a notebook
in Light's or Misa's room.

373
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,510
But still--

374
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:45,843
-I understand.

375
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:48,310
You're more than welcome to
keep watch over Misa and I

376
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:50,543
until you're satisfied.

377
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:52,943
-Next on the program,
it's time for me

378
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:55,977
to introduce the new leaders I
have chosen for Kira's Kingdom.

379
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,077
The first gentleman is--

380
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,577
-Delete.

381
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:07,977
[gasping]

382
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:14,177
-We will unite with
Kira, and work with him.

383
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:14,677
-Delete!

384
00:19:19,143 --> 00:19:22,077
Delete!

385
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,577
Delete!

386
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,477
-Save me.

387
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:45,310
-And delete.

388
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,643
[groan]

389
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,077
-Wha-- What the hell is this?

390
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,843
Why would Kira kill
his own supporters?

391
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:03,910
-Do you think it's because
they're going overboard

392
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:05,477
with this?

393
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,577
-That might be a possibility.

394
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,777
But this is horrible.

395
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,943
-(VOICEOVER) What's going on?

396
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,443
There was no chance for
either Misa Amane or Light

397
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:17,277
to use the notebook
to kill Demegawa.

398
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,710
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Mikami.

399
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:21,277
I can definitely use him.

400
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,610
It seems I was right
to choose him for this.

401
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:26,777
He understands Kira's
beliefs and ideals perfectly,

402
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,477
and he knows what Kira
wants and doesn't want.

403
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,410
Thanks to that, he takes action
without needing my orders.

404
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:36,243
I had Misa relinquish
ownership of the Death Note.

405
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,677
Before she lost all her
memories of the notebook,

406
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,543
she sent it to
someone else, along

407
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:42,843
with some special instructions.

408
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:45,843
Now she won't be able to
answer any questions about it.

409
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,677
She's just an ordinary woman.

410
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,977
The main problem was
selecting the next owner.

411
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,243
I saw him trying to speak to
Kira through the television

412
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:55,710
broadcasts.

413
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:58,877
It was clear he worshiped Kira
from the bottom of this heart.

414
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,143
He would understand that
he was chosen simply

415
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,943
by receiving and
accepting the notebook.

416
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:10,843
There was no mistake
in my selection.

417
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:13,210
Teru Mikami.

418
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:17,710
He's more than worthy of
becoming the hand of Kira.

419
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,577
-Shinigami.

420
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,610
Thank you for coming to me.

421
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:22,943
Now I'll be able to punish
evildoers with death.

422
00:21:27,843 --> 00:21:30,777
[laughter] God.

423
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:42,688
[theme music]

424
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:53,354
LIGHT: You're a woman who the
entire world pays attention to.

425
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:56,288
It must be fate for us to
cross paths again like this.

426
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,554
Please, just listen to what I
have to say first, all right?

427
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:00,421
Let's meet somewhere.

428
00:23:00,454 --> 00:23:01,954
Alone.
