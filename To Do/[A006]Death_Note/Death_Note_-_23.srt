00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:13,800
[theme music]

2
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:37,141
-So you're saying one of
those people is Kira, right?

3
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:38,275
-(MODIFIED VOICE) Yes.

4
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,975
I've got a lot of
evidence to prove it, too.

5
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:42,041
The man who died was Mr. H

6
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:43,308
-Kira--

7
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,941
L: If Higuchi can kill by
looking at someone's face

8
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:48,775
like the second Kira was
able to, Matsuda will die.

9
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:55,141
-It's-- It's him!

10
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,008
Don't screw with me!

11
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,708
Why the hell can't
you remember the names

12
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,875
of the people you hire?

13
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:02,175
That means I have two hours.

14
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:16,541
-I see Higuchi.

15
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:18,375
He's only carrying a single bag.

16
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:19,875
I'm in pursuit.

17
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:20,841
-I'll kill him.

18
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,341
I'll kill him no matter what.

19
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,975
I'm not giving up until
I have everything.

20
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,541
TV ANNOUNCER: Cosme Misa.

21
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:33,741
A devlish charm,
an angel's glitter.

22
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:36,441
Misa's new line of
lipstick just for you.

23
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:41,508
-Ryuzaki, the
commercial's almost over.

24
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,675
-Is that so?

25
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,275
-(MODIFIED VOICE)
Next thing you know,

26
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:47,308
I'm in a hotel room drinking
with all eight of them.

27
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,675
-Well, that's rather amusing.

28
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,541
-(MODIFIED VOICE) But if I
give you any more details,

29
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:52,841
I'm afraid the people who were
there that night would realize

30
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,208
which one of them is Kira, so
I think I'd better leave it

31
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,041
at that for now.

32
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:58,441
-Of course.

33
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:00,575
Please take your time to tell us
all the details of your ordeal

34
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,108
to find Kira.

35
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,308
-Light.

36
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,141
Please put Higuchi's car
on audio channel one,

37
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:06,841
and Sakura TV on channel two.

38
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,341
-As expected, Higuchi's
watching every minute of this

39
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,775
from his car.

40
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:12,089
INTERVIEWER: And so
according to you,

41
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:14,089
it was actually at that
party that you met Kira.

42
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:15,356
MATSUDA: (MODIFIED VOICE) Yes.

43
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,989
But of course, at
the time I had no way

44
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,956
of knowing he was actually Kira.

45
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,889
-So that means he saw your face?

46
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:21,989
This is incredible.

47
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:23,656
I think it's amazingly
courageous of you

48
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,589
to step forward and
appear on this program.

49
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,222
Are you sure you're OK with it?

50
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,122
-(MODIFIED VOICE) Yes.

51
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:29,756
After I started
investigating him,

52
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,356
I found out there are two
things Kira has to have in order

53
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,756
to kill someone.

54
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:36,789
There are rumors on TV and the
internet as to what those two

55
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:39,022
things might be, but
I know the truth.

56
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:41,289
HIGUCHI (VOICEOVER):
A name and a face.

57
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,822
-(MODIFIED VOICE) But Kira only
knows one of those two things

58
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,756
about me, so that
means I should be safe.

59
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:46,722
HIGUCHI (VOICEOVER):
So, he's saying

60
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:48,056
he feels safe enough
to step forward

61
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,089
just because I don't
know his real name.

62
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:51,389
Wait a minute.

63
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:53,156
Does that mean there's
nothing left that

64
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,789
can connect me to his name?

65
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:56,822
Maybe he's already destroyed
his file at Yoshida.

66
00:03:56,856 --> 00:04:00,422
Am I wasting my time?

67
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:01,356
Rem.

68
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,889
What do you think?

69
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:04,289
-What do I think?

70
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:05,789
About what, may I ask?

71
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:06,789
-Rem?

72
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:07,822
Who's that?

73
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,622
There's no one else
in that car, right?

74
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:13,356
It's impossible for someone to
be hiding without us knowing.

75
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,289
He isn't using his cell phone.

76
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,356
Could it be a hidden radio?

77
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:18,422
-No.

78
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:20,656
There aren't any radios
or other devices.

79
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:22,556
Only the bugs,
cameras, and tracking

80
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,189
beacons that Wedy placed.

81
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,489
I have no doubt that
she did a thorough job.

82
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:28,922
-Do you think I'll get
to Yoshida Productions

83
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:31,122
only to find his
file isn't there?

84
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:33,556
-Is he talking to himself?

85
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,056
-Why ask my opinion?

86
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,889
I don't see how I'm supposed
to know something like that.

87
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:40,289
-If this guy was smart, he
would destroy everything

88
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,322
that connects him with his real
name before he appeared on TV.

89
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:45,256
And don't you think it's
a little too reckless

90
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,889
for Yoshida Productions
to just let me

91
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,922
into their offices unsupervised?

92
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,022
Maybe not.

93
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,789
If there was a robbery,
they'd figure out

94
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:54,989
right away who did it, since
I know where the key is.

95
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,922
-This is sounding very good.

96
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:58,289
-He'll still go there.

97
00:04:58,322 --> 00:04:59,389
Don't you worry.

98
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:02,089
-Even if he does have
a file at Yoshida,

99
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:03,656
it could be just another alias.

100
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,456
Damn it!

101
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:08,022
I wouldn't put it past this
guy to do something like that.

102
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:09,989
No wonder he's confident.

103
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:12,056
REM (VOICEOVER): It must
be Light and Misa's plan

104
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:15,356
to have Higuchi go to
Yoshida Productions.

105
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,189
If that's the case--
That may be true,

106
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:20,289
but if he knows
that you are Kira,

107
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:22,556
he's going to announce
your name in public.

108
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,356
That's an inescapable fact.

109
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,656
INTERVIEWER: All right.

110
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,322
There's only one hour left
until the big announcement.

111
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:30,489
-Your only option is to go.

112
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:34,256
If the name on his file is
false, that'll be unfortunate.

113
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,456
But if it isn't, you
can kill him discretely

114
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,089
with the notebook.

115
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,189
-Yeah.

116
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,089
I already know that
much myself, but just

117
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:42,656
to be on the safe
side, I should also

118
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,122
kill the people I contacted
at Yoshida Productions.

119
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:48,589
That includes the president,
Misa, and that manager of hers.

120
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:49,089
-What?

121
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:49,756
No way.

122
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:50,722
He's gonna kill me?

123
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:51,389
-It's all right.

124
00:05:51,422 --> 00:05:52,722
Don't worry.

125
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:54,922
He's talking about doing that
after he's killed Matsuda.

126
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,822
There'd be no point in
killing the rest of you

127
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,189
until he's gotten rid
of the main threat.

128
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:00,556
-That's true, but still.

129
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,156
-Don't be wreckless.

130
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:04,889
He's the only one
you have to kill.

131
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,222
If the people you
called end up dying too,

132
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:11,089
the phone records will
implicate you in their deaths.

133
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,122
-Oh yeah.

134
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:14,022
Rem, I didn't think
you were so smart.

135
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,089
Then I'll make them all
erase their call histories

136
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:18,156
before they die.

137
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,989
-But the telephone
company will still

138
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:21,822
have a record of the calls.

139
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:24,089
-There's no way he can
just be talking to himself.

140
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:25,489
But who's Rem?

141
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:27,289
Who is he talking to?

142
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:29,289
-If he's talking to
someone right now,

143
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:33,243
it could be a Shinigami.

144
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:37,956
Perhaps.

145
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:40,089
REM (VOICEOVER): I should
just go ahead and ask him.

146
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:42,322
How about giving up
ownership of the notebook

147
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:44,456
and returning it to me.

148
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,489
-No.

149
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:46,956
I'd end up being
ruined if I did that.

150
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,922
Even if I forgot the
notebook, this guy

151
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:51,022
says he has concrete
evidence to back him up.

152
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:54,122
If he points out Yotsuba's
recent growth on the air,

153
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:55,822
no one would ever
doubt his claims.

154
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,256
They'd believe whatever he said.

155
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,789
That means whoever he says is
Kira will be marked as Kira.

156
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,689
Even if he didn't have proof
and I got rid of the evidence

157
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:07,156
by returning the notebook,
my life would be over.

158
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,289
I wouldn't get promoted.

159
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,822
I wouldn't even be able
to stay with Yotsuba.

160
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:12,956
-Of course, Sakura
TV has broadcast

161
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:15,489
this show under the premise
that right now, as we speak,

162
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,656
Kira is watching this program.

163
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,422
-In that case, I'll take this
chance to call out to him.

164
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:21,356
Kira!

165
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,256
Please, turn yourself in!

166
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,389
-This guy's acting
like a complete idiot.

167
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,489
Still, he was smart enough
to fake his own death

168
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,089
to avoid being killed.

169
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:33,056
I have to kill him
as soon as possible.

170
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,356
-He's arrived at
Yoshida Productions.

171
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:39,689
-The show is about to begin.

172
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,189
HIGUCHI (VOICEOVER): To
the left as I come in.

173
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:04,589
In the desk at the very back.

174
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:06,189
Very bottom drawer.

175
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,256
-Now, Kira.

176
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,422
How do you kill?

177
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:31,122
Show me.

178
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:34,022
-We're in position and
ready to take him down.

179
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,222
We'll move on your command.

180
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:36,056
L (ON RADIO): Right.

181
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:47,222
-He's not doing it!

182
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:49,122
He just made a note of
his name before leaving.

183
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:51,189
So he's not gonna kill him here?

184
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:53,322
-Ryuzaki, do you want
us to apprehend him?

185
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,256
-Negative.

186
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:55,789
We still don't
know how he kills.

187
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:57,589
Perhaps he's planning
to do something

188
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,389
once he's back in the car.

189
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:00,589
Let's see camera one again.

190
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,522
-It's weird.

191
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,656
You'd think you'd be desperate
to kill Matsuda this very

192
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,222
second, but he's calm.

193
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:13,022
-It is strange.

194
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:14,689
If all he needed was
the name, then he

195
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,756
should've simply taken the
personnel file with him,

196
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,356
but he just put it back in his
drawer after taking a note.

197
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:25,789
HIGUCHI (VOICEOVER): 36,
37, 38, 39, 40 seconds.

198
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:29,022
MATSUDA: Kira is a
cold-blooded murderer.

199
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:31,156
I can't forgive him
for what he's done.

200
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:31,822
-Damn!

201
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,422
He didn't die!

202
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,756
-Wh-- What's he talking about?

203
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:36,689
He said he didn't die.

204
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,722
L: Did he already
try and kill Matsuda?

205
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:42,322
Was writing his name down
all he had to do, or was it--

206
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:43,522
-What do we do now?

207
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,989
Should we just continue
watching what he's doing?

208
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:49,189
What if he can cause a
death by just imagining it?

209
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,256
L (VOICEOVER): I don't
understand what's going on.

210
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,356
I still can't figure
out how he kills people.

211
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:57,522
But even if we restrain him now
and try to get him to confess.

212
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,789
INTERVIEWER: Only 50 minutes
to go until the big Kira

213
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:00,356
announcement--

214
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:01,056
-Damn!

215
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:02,756
I don't have any time!

216
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,489
-He's making a phone call.

217
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,789
It's probably Misa again.

218
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:06,689
[phone ringing]

219
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:07,189
-Yeah!

220
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:10,989
-Argh!

221
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:15,856
All right.

222
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:16,722
Calm down.

223
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:18,089
I already know his face.

224
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,722
If I go back to
company HQ, there

225
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:22,589
should be surveillance
videos from when he snuck in.

226
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,089
If I had the Shinigami eyes--
half my remaining lifespan,

227
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:26,922
huh?

228
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:27,856
That's a lot.

229
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,189
But if he makes
that announcement,

230
00:10:29,222 --> 00:10:32,022
my life's as good
as over anyway.

231
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:33,889
Better to have a life
that's short and sweet.

232
00:10:37,422 --> 00:10:38,189
Rem.

233
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,589
Let's make the deal.

234
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:41,856
-The deal?

235
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,989
Who is this Rem person
he keeps talking to?

236
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:45,789
Could it really be
that Kira's power

237
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:48,222
comes from another
world or some being?

238
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,989
-I really don't want to
think that's the case.

239
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:53,356
-Then what is this Rem?

240
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:55,022
-A Shinigami?

241
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:57,722
Whatever it is, we need
to keep watching him.

242
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,722
We'll learn nothing
if we take him now.

243
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:02,456
We may still be able to
find out how he kills.

244
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:08,156
HIGUCHI (VOICEOVER): With
these yes, I'm invincible.

245
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,622
I have more than
enough options now.

246
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:15,756
-We're heading after him.

247
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,756
[siren]

248
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,589
OFFICER: You in the red car!

249
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:25,322
Pull over to the
side of the road.

250
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:25,822
Now!

251
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:31,689
-This is bad.

252
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:33,889
Higuchi's been pulled
over by a traffic cop.

253
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:35,389
I'm gonna have to
pass him and leave

254
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:37,256
the pursuit to Aiber's team.

255
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:38,856
-You were speeding.

256
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,356
-License, please?

257
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,889
-Yeah.

258
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:42,189
No problem.

259
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:44,489
-Switch all screens
to Higuchi's car.

260
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:46,289
-Now, let's see.

261
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:47,389
Where did I put it?

262
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,856
This'll take care of him.

263
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,489
-Hey!

264
00:11:57,522 --> 00:11:59,022
-Higuchi ditched the cop.

265
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,289
He's driving away!

266
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,722
-What a bastard.

267
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,622
This is Traffic Control Squad--

268
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:15,356
-That motorcycle cop just
rear ended that truck!

269
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:16,356
He's dead!

270
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,889
-He's dead?

271
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:18,189
By accident?

272
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:20,356
-This is very bad.

273
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,489
(VOICEOVER) All he did was
put his hand in his bag.

274
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,856
Could he have done
something at that moment?

275
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:27,189
More importantly, how
was he able to obtain

276
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:29,422
the name of the cop
who stopped him?

277
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:34,022
Does he only need a face,
like the second Kira?

278
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:34,789
-Rem.

279
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,156
A deal.

280
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,522
-No.

281
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,222
If he had the power to kill just
by looking at someone's face,

282
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:41,656
he would have already
killed Matsuda by now.

283
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,122
What's going on?

284
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:47,056
Unless-- Everyone!

285
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,922
It's too dangerous to allow
further action by Higuchi.

286
00:12:49,956 --> 00:12:51,756
Let's bring him in.

287
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:53,956
I believe he has the same
powers as the second Kira.

288
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,989
He is able to kill just by
looking at someone's face.

289
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:59,422
Please keep this in mind when
you move in to arrest him.

290
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,556
[laughter]

291
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:23,757
-Watari, connect me to
the director of the NPA.

292
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,923
WATARI: Yes.

293
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:27,890
L: (MODIFIED VOICE) This
is L. We are now aware

294
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,823
of Kira's true identity.

295
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:31,690
He is currently
heading from Hibiya

296
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:35,657
to Shibuya along Highway
Route 1 in a red sports car.

297
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,690
Our group will be
handling the arrest.

298
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:40,190
In the meantime, please
instruct all officers

299
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,190
to refrain from
approaching his car.

300
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,423
-All right.

301
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,723
Dad, during the next
commercial, take measure seven.

302
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:47,990
-Understood.

303
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:49,790
Demegawa, during the
next commercial break,

304
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:51,923
swap Matsuda and the
MC with mannequins.

305
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,123
We'll make it seem as if
the broadcast is continuing

306
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,257
as normal using the voices
we've already prepared.

307
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,923
We'll leave the cameras
running and have

308
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:59,823
everyone evacuate the building.

309
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:03,223
-So then, Light, what say we
go and join the fun as well?

310
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:05,190
-Yeah.

311
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:06,157
-Hm?

312
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,823
-I'm sorry to do
this, Misa, but I'm

313
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:11,290
going to have to make sure
you're restrained for a while.

314
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:12,123
-What?

315
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:14,890
But that's-- stop joking around!

316
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,023
LIGHT: I didn't realize you
could pilot a helicopter.

317
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:25,157
That's incredible.

318
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,090
L: Well, you can figure
it out with intuition.

319
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:30,457
-Hm?

320
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,823
Higuchi isn't
going to Sakura TV.

321
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:34,257
He's headed the wrong way.

322
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,090
L: Based on his
route, I'd guess he's

323
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:38,090
going to the
Yotsuba main office.

324
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:39,990
INTERVIEWER: You've been
outstandingly brave.

325
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:40,957
-(MODIFIED VOICE) No.

326
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,190
I'm just doing what
anyone would do.

327
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:46,090
-(VOICEOVER) If I go to the main
office and find a surveillance

328
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:48,023
video with him on
it, I can kill him.

329
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:49,423
-Come in, Wedy.

330
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:51,857
Have you removed absolutely
everything relating to Matsuda

331
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,223
at the Yotsuba headquarters.

332
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:53,723
WEDY: Yeah.

333
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:54,423
Why?

334
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:56,190
Is he headed there now?

335
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:57,390
Isn't that convenient?

336
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:59,423
That should give me
mroe than enough time

337
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:02,057
to go ahead and meet up with
Mr. Yagami to set up the ambush.

338
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:07,923
HIGUCHI: What the hell?

339
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:09,490
I can't find him!

340
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:11,190
This is the right tape.

341
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:12,757
Someone must have erased it.

342
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,057
Did he come back and erase
them himself somehow?

343
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,823
Or has someone from
the group betrayed me

344
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:18,357
and started working with him?

345
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,590
No.

346
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:21,357
Doing that wouldn't absolve
them of their crimes.

347
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,323
Who cares?

348
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,090
I'm out of time.

349
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:29,590
I've got to hurry!

350
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:32,023
-We're quickly approaching
the time for the announcement.

351
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,090
How are you feeling?

352
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:34,623
-(MODIFIED VOICE) I
feel ready for this.

353
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:37,323
I really want to reveal it now.

354
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:39,223
INTERVIEWER: Yes, I understand.

355
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:41,923
But let's cut to a quick
commercial break first.

356
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,190
-(VOICEOVER) Damit!

357
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:45,657
I'll just have to go to
Sakura TV and kill him there.

358
00:15:49,457 --> 00:15:51,357
LIGHT: Dad, Higuchi's
left Yotsuba.

359
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,123
He's on his way to Sakura TV.

360
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:54,790
He'll be there in
less than 15 minutes.

361
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,090
Are you ready?

362
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,023
CHIEF YAGAMI: I don't need
my son asking if I'm ready.

363
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,623
Of course I am.

364
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:03,123
INTERVIEWER: Is
there anything you'd

365
00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:05,090
like to add before
the announcement?

366
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:06,890
MATSUDA: Well, I want
everyone to think hard

367
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:08,523
about Kira after he's caught.

368
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:10,290
People have to
realize that Kira is--

369
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:11,290
-You ready, Mr. Yagami?

370
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:12,890
It's almost time.

371
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:14,023
-I know.

372
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:14,790
-Here.

373
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:15,723
-Hm?

374
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:16,990
-Aiber hates using guns.

375
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:18,857
Right now I'm the
only one armed.

376
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,057
Take it.

377
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,057
-I can't take this.

378
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,957
I'm no longer a police officer.

379
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,357
Japanese law forbids
civilians from having guns.

380
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,357
That means you shouldn't
be using one, either.

381
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,223
-I guess you're as
stubborn as always, huh?

382
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,490
-I made it in time.

383
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,957
(VOICEOVER) Why
isn't anybody here?

384
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,457
is it just in case
the announcement

385
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,290
is true, and Kira
decides to retaliate?

386
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:52,090
Hm.

387
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:56,223
At least it makes my job easier.

388
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:58,357
MOGI: We've arrived
at Sakura TV.

389
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,390
We're moving into position.

390
00:17:00,423 --> 00:17:01,857
Let's go, Aiber!

391
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,723
-OK, Mogi.

392
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,190
INTERVIEWER: Right now we're
being flooded with phone calls

393
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:09,223
and faxes showing support for
your courage and strength,

394
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:10,823
and demanding that
Kira's identity

395
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:13,223
be revealed right away.

396
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:14,023
-Huh?

397
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:17,023
Even the studio is deserted.

398
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:20,090
Still, I gotta be careful
of where the cameras are.

399
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,457
Can't let myself be seen.

400
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,690
INTERVIEWER: Due
to circumstances

401
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:23,690
beyond our control, we will
now end this broadcast.

402
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:24,423
-Huh?

403
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:25,757
What?

404
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,990
Dummies?

405
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:27,823
This can't be!

406
00:17:27,857 --> 00:17:28,757
CHIEF YAGAMI: Higuchi.

407
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,490
Hold it right there.

408
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:31,157
-Don't move.

409
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:37,057
-Huh?

410
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,123
-I'd give up if I were you.

411
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:42,090
-You-- you must be making
some kind of mistake.

412
00:17:42,123 --> 00:17:43,723
I'm only here to meet
with Mr. Demegawa

413
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:45,190
and discuss something with him.

414
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:46,957
(VOICEOVER) They're
wearing tinted helmets.

415
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,323
They must be taking
precautions against Kira.

416
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:52,490
In that case-- (OUT LOUD)
I'm with the Yotsuba Group,

417
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:54,290
from the Development Department.

418
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,990
Let me show you
my business card.

419
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:01,923
-No!

420
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:04,390
Chief!

421
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,857
-Aiber!

422
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,957
-Dammit.

423
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,223
I didn't want to have
to use one of these.

424
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:09,723
But--

425
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:17,157
-L, Higuchi has a gun on him.

426
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,957
The chief's been shot.

427
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,123
Higuchi's escaping!

428
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:20,857
-I'm all right.

429
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,323
Sorry, Ryuzaki.

430
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:25,457
If we pursue him right now,
we can still catch him.

431
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,390
Hurry!

432
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:27,323
-This is bad.

433
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,857
He's escaped from Sakura TV.

434
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:39,957
-This leaves us no choice.

435
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,457
We'll have to move
in and apprehend him.

436
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,857
Watari, are you ready?

437
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,223
-Yes.

438
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:49,790
-Light, I think you should hold
onto this for self defense.

439
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:52,423
This is Kira we're after.

440
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:53,390
-No thanks.

441
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,290
Firearms aren't
allowed in Japan.

442
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:58,323
-You know, I'm sure your father
would say the exact same thing.

443
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:08,923
[car horn]

444
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:11,357
-He's driving like a maniac.

445
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,623
-Don't lose sight of him.

446
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:14,200
-Yes, sir.

447
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:26,490
-What the hell was
all that about?

448
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:28,323
Had to be a trap.

449
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:30,390
WOMAN (ON TV): We now
end our current broadcast

450
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:32,623
and return you to
regular programming.

451
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:34,123
The evening news is next.

452
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:35,790
HIGUCHI (VOICEOVER):
The program's over?

453
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:38,623
It didn't end just
because I showed up?

454
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:41,057
What the hell is going on?

455
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,023
Ah!

456
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:42,990
What the--

457
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:49,257
[sirens wailing]

458
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,957
HIGUCHI (VOICEOVER):
Just like I thought.

459
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,957
It was a trap.

460
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,390
All these cars with
tinted windows.

461
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:55,723
So, all that stuff about the
cops not going after Kira

462
00:19:55,757 --> 00:19:56,590
was a lie!

463
00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:59,157
They've been preparing for this.

464
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,223
WATARI: What's happening?

465
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:02,357
I thought we told
the police not to get

466
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,590
involved with the arrest.

467
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:05,490
-The only one who
would do this is--

468
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:06,123
-Yes.

469
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:07,257
You must be right.

470
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,598
-Damn it!

471
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,598
That way.

472
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:38,598
-Stop right there.

473
00:20:58,898 --> 00:20:59,798
-Stay back!

474
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:00,964
Stay back or I'll
shoot, I swear!

475
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:17,031
-It's over.

476
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:17,764
-Yes.

477
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:18,398
It's over.

478
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:42,499
[theme music]

479
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,726
LIGHT: A human whose name
is written in this notebook

480
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,960
shall die.

481
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:55,593
This note will not take
effect unless the writer has

482
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:58,660
the person's face in their mind
when writing his or her name.

483
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:01,760
Therefore, people sharing the
same name will not be affected.
