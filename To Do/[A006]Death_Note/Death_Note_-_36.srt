00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,266
[theme music]

2
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:37,667
-L. I want to meet you.

3
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,501
Daikoku Wharf, an
abandoned warehouse

4
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:40,867
known as the Yellow Box.

5
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:44,567
How about three days from
now, on the 28th at 1:00 PM?

6
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:46,001
-That's fine by me.

7
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:47,734
MIKAMI: Take off
everything you're wearing

8
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,867
and put it all in that box.

9
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,801
You can use this blanket.

10
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,401
MAN: Ms. Takada,
are you all right?

11
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:54,434
-Light.

12
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,334
I did exactly what
you told me to.

13
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:01,501
I made survival my first
priority and-- and I did it.

14
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:02,701
Come quickly.

15
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:03,801
Save me.

16
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,167
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Kiyomi Takada.

17
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,601
Suicide.

18
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:09,134
January 26th, 2013.

19
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,801
2:32 PM.

20
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:14,501
Burns to death by setting
fire to everything around her,

21
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,801
including everything
she wrote on.

22
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,367
-It is with great sorrow
that I must announce

23
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,901
the passing of one of
our very own colleagues.

24
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,701
The police have identified
one of the bodies found

25
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:30,167
at the scene as NHN's
Ms. Kiyomi Takada.

26
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:32,467
A two ton truck and a
motorcycle were also

27
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:34,967
found in the ruins of
the burned out church.

28
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:38,167
Investigators suspect gasoline
was used to start the fire.

29
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,701
-What I really want
to know is who's

30
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,634
going to be Kira's
next spokesperson.

31
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,501
Kira's message still
needs to be spread,

32
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,767
and someone's gotta do it.

33
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,067
-The death of newscaster
Takada was a horrible tragedy,

34
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:58,334
but I can't help but think
that if she was that careless,

35
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,967
she couldn't have taken her
position as Kira's spokesperson

36
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:01,901
that seriously.

37
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:02,967
-It needs to be said.

38
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:04,634
This is not a woman's job.

39
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:05,701
Kira.

40
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,701
Please make me your
new representative.

41
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:08,734
-No!

42
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,567
Give the honor to
Sakura TV again!

43
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,967
-Disgusting.

44
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:13,467
-Yeah, I know.

45
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:15,067
I mean, they just
announced her death,

46
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,601
and already it's started.

47
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:18,501
Every TV station
airing its own segment

48
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:20,267
on who should replace her.

49
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,501
It's like she never existed.

50
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,201
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Last night's judgments

51
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:26,101
unfolded just as planned.

52
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:27,801
That means Takada
and Mikumi have

53
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,567
had no problems
contacting each other.

54
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,567
There's nothing to worry about.

55
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,767
[beeping]

56
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:37,701
-It's near.

57
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,001
-Hello L.

58
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:40,301
-Yes?

59
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:41,867
NEAR (ON COMPUTER): I don't
mean to keep bothering you,

60
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:48,367
but with regards
to our meeting, I

61
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,901
wanted to confirm
that we are still

62
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:53,101
set for the 28th at
1:00 PM, all right?

63
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:54,601
-Yes.

64
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,467
It's just as I predicted.

65
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,467
He's sticking with
the original time.

66
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:01,034
There's no doubt about it.

67
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:01,867
-Very well.

68
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:02,867
The 28th.

69
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:05,667
The day after tomorrow.

70
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:06,167
-Right.

71
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:13,934
-So, the day of tomorrow, huh?

72
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:14,701
Finally.

73
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,301
Isn't it getting exciting?

74
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,567
-Y-- Yeah.

75
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,734
I can't help but wonder
what Near wants to show us.

76
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,867
-(VOICEOVER) Matsuda Ide.

77
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:24,601
When the day comes,
there's a good chance

78
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,001
we might all be killed.

79
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:30,701
Don't you understand that?

80
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:31,501
NEAR: Giovanni.

81
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:32,601
-Yes?

82
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:33,867
NEAR: Will you be able
to make it in time?

83
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:34,567
GIOVANNI: Yes.

84
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,801
I'll be there for sure.

85
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:43,367
-Commander Rester,
Lidner, Giovanni.

86
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:45,401
Let's put our best
into this, shall we?

87
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:16,501
NEAR (ON COMPUTER):
Good morning, everyone.

88
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:19,701
-Uh, good morning.

89
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:22,101
-First of all, in
regards to Misa Amane,

90
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:23,901
we've already set her free.

91
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:25,801
You may call her to confirm it.

92
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:30,534
MISA: I don't know
what's going on,

93
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,301
but this must be some sort
of compensation or something!

94
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,201
They totally put me up
in the penthouse suite

95
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,534
of the Teido Hotel.

96
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:37,501
Can you believe it?

97
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:39,534
Now, this is more like it!

98
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:40,701
-I understand.

99
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:42,101
All right, Misa.

100
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:45,901
Please stay there for a little
while longer until I call you.

101
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:48,667
MISA (ON PHONE): OK!

102
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,667
-All right, Near.

103
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:51,101
I need you to
connect me with Mogi.

104
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,734
We have the notebook
locked away here,

105
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,501
and in order to open
the safe it's kept in,

106
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,934
we'll need the pin number
from each member of the team.

107
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,201
NEAR (ON SPEAKER): Understood.

108
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,701
I'll connect you
to him immediately.

109
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:03,834
-This is Mogi.

110
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:07,771
Number is 62-324.

111
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:12,567
-(VOICEOVER) All that's
left is my number.

112
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:22,967
The killer notebook.

113
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,167
How to use it.

114
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:31,101
The human whose name is written
in this notebook shall die.

115
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,734
This note will not take
effect unless the writer has

116
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:36,967
the person's face in their mind
when writing his or her name.

117
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:40,767
Therefore, people sharing the
same name will not be affected.

118
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,601
If the cause of death is written
within 40 seconds of writing

119
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:45,701
the person's name,
it will happen.

120
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:47,334
If the cause of death
is not specified,

121
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:50,101
the person will simply
die of a heart attack.

122
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:52,701
After writing the cause of
death, details of the death

123
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:55,067
should be written in the next
six minutes and 40 seconds.

124
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,267
Near, it's me.

125
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,634
We've discussed
it, and it's been

126
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,001
decided that I'll be the
one to carry the notebook.

127
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,667
-L, are you sure it's
all right with you

128
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,134
if Mr. Aizawa carries it?

129
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,567
Be honest.

130
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:11,801
-Of course.

131
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,767
I chose Aizawa for
the job because we

132
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,201
knew you'd prefer that.

133
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,134
I have no problems with it.

134
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,601
NEAR (ON SPEAKER):
I appreciate it.

135
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:19,501
Thank you.

136
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:21,101
Well then, we'll
see you shortly.

137
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,534
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Looks
like this is the end.

138
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:41,401
No.

139
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:44,134
More like the beginning.

140
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:46,034
The perfect world of Kira.

141
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,801
And those who know of the
notebook's existence, all

142
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:55,767
of them will die.

143
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:06,834
-There's no mistake,
Near's inside.

144
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:09,067
I checked it out.

145
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:09,667
All right.

146
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:10,301
Let's do this.

147
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:07,676
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Near.

148
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,976
You're far inferior
to L. You have

149
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:14,743
no right to be
wearing a mask of L.

150
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:15,409
-It's them.

151
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:17,676
Those four are the SPK.

152
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,943
And the one wearing
a mask is Near.

153
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:22,109
-Hang on.

154
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:23,276
Am I the only one who
sees something wrong?

155
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:25,809
He can go around accusing
people of being Kira,

156
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,509
but the fact that
he's wearing a mask

157
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,243
says he's only trying
to protect himself.

158
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,976
Not anyone else.

159
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,643
-It's just a precaution.

160
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,643
There's a good possibility
that Kira has already

161
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,576
seen the faces of everyone
in this warehouse,

162
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:39,676
except for mine.

163
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,376
In fact, he may be writing
down your names as we speak.

164
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,676
So I'd like to wait for one
hour-- No, make it 30 minutes.

165
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,376
That should give us
more than enough time

166
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:51,276
to see if anyone is being
controlled before they die.

167
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:52,109
-Huh?

168
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:53,109
What?

169
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:55,276
You're gonna wait
and see if we die?

170
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:56,409
-No.

171
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:58,843
It's not impossible that
Light really is Kira,

172
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:01,443
especially since the rest of us
are of no use to him anymore.

173
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:41,909
-(VOICEOVER) This is all just
a front to buy some time,

174
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,676
isn't it?

175
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:46,143
I never thought it would
be this hard to keep myself

176
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,376
from laughing out loud.

177
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:50,443
Near must be waiting
for him to come.

178
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,276
It's all just as I predicted.

179
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,043
MATSUDA: Near!

180
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:00,476
It's already been
over 30 minutes.

181
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:02,009
Nothing's happened yet.

182
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:03,076
-Of course not.

183
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:07,076
That's because Kira's
not here with us.

184
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:08,343
-Very well.

185
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:10,176
Everyone seems to be safe.

186
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,009
I'll remove my mask now.

187
00:12:34,043 --> 00:12:34,876
-You're quiet, Near.

188
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,743
What's wrong?

189
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:40,443
Are you still waiting
for something?

190
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:41,643
-Waiting.

191
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:44,009
That's an excellent
choice of words.

192
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,743
Yes, I am waiting,
for the arrival

193
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:49,176
of the one who will solve
everything once and for all.

194
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,809
-Someone else is supposed
to clear this up?

195
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,276
NEAR: He'll be here soon.

196
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,176
It's only a matter of time.

197
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,443
There's only one entrance
to this building,

198
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,276
and the only way to look
inside is by opening that door.

199
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,743
That means he'll either
walk through that door,

200
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:06,776
or at the very least,
open it and peek through.

201
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:09,109
-And just who is
this person, anyway?

202
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:11,543
-X Kira, the one who is
currently using the notebook

203
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:13,709
and killing people
on Kira's behalf.

204
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:16,409
He's bound to come here and
bring the notebook with them.

205
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:20,009
And then he'll see me, and
write down my real name.

206
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:22,909
Or rather, he'll write down the
names of everyone here knows

207
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:25,443
about the notebook,
and kill them.

208
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,276
-Huh?

209
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:28,176
-What?

210
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:30,209
What are you saying?

211
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,509
This doesn't make any sense.

212
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:33,043
What are you trying
to tell us, Near?

213
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:35,409
That some other guy's going
to drop by with the notebook,

214
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:37,209
poke his head in,
and kill us all?

215
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,909
-And you want us to sit
back and let it happen?

216
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:40,476
-NEAR: Yes.

217
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:41,643
That's correct.

218
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:42,943
Now, listen carefully.

219
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:45,276
If someone comes into the
warehouse through that door,

220
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:47,576
just let him in
without resisting.

221
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,709
If a door opens
slightly, simply act

222
00:13:49,743 --> 00:13:52,209
as if you don't
notice anyone there.

223
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:55,976
-But-- but that's just crazy!

224
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:56,976
NEAR: He's already here.

225
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:16,043
-God!

226
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:27,876
Delete!

227
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,876
Delete.

228
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,443
Delete.

229
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:30,409
Delete.

230
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:30,876
Delete.

231
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:31,876
Delete.

232
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:32,409
Delete.

233
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:32,876
Delete.

234
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:33,876
Delete.

235
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:34,876
Delete.

236
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:35,409
Delete.

237
00:14:35,443 --> 00:14:36,376
Delete.

238
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,376
Delete!

239
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,376
Delete.

240
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:40,376
Delete.

241
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:41,343
Delete.

242
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:42,343
Delete!

243
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:42,976
-Hold it!

244
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:43,709
Don't do anything.

245
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:44,709
-Everything is fine.

246
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:46,176
You won't die.

247
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,876
IDE: How can you
be so sure, Near?

248
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:50,776
-Because I modified
the notebook.

249
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:51,943
-Huh?

250
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:53,243
NEAR: We took brief
possession of the notebook

251
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:54,643
and replaced the pages.

252
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:56,143
The person behind
the door has been

253
00:14:56,176 --> 00:14:57,743
doing the killings for Kira.

254
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:00,809
He has also been using
exactly one page every day.

255
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:03,209
Based on that, I was
able to replace the page

256
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:06,009
he would use today, as well
as all subsequent pages,

257
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:08,243
so that no one else would die.

258
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:08,743
-Delete.

259
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:09,709
Delete.

260
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,209
Delete.

261
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:10,709
Delete.

262
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,676
Delete.

263
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:12,176
Delete.

264
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:13,143
Delete.

265
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:13,643
Delete!

266
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,743
[laughter]

267
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:40,043
NEAR: On the other side
of that door is X Kira.

268
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:42,409
My guess is in
roughly 40 seconds,

269
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:45,009
he'll look inside to
see if we're dead.

270
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:48,176
That's when we'll restrain
him and seize the notebook.

271
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:53,643
Whoever's name is not
written down must be Kira.

272
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:54,976
-It's true.

273
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,776
Kira would be the only one
that guy wouldn't try to kill.

274
00:15:58,809 --> 00:15:59,476
But still--

275
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,209
-(VOICEOVER) I knew it.

276
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:14,709
I knew it.

277
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:15,443
I knew it!

278
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:25,676
I knew all along you had
tampered with the notebook.

279
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:29,943
Near, you've been
completely defeated.

280
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:32,309
The notebook you
altered was nothing more

281
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:34,943
than a forgery I
had Mikami prepare.

282
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,943
On the other hand, the one
Mikami is writing their names

283
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:42,309
in is the real notebook, which
had been kept hidden until now.

284
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:53,043
[laughter] I had Mikami create
a fake notebook for himself.

285
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:56,143
He also sent Takada several
pages from the real one,

286
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:58,843
so in fact, it was
Takada, not Mikami,

287
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:00,843
who was doing the killings.

288
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,343
As for Mikami, I
had him write names

289
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:06,176
in public several times
using the fake notebook.

290
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:09,576
That way he'd be noticed by
anyone who was following him.

291
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,909
But Takada was the
one behind the deaths.

292
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:15,243
Mikami simply sent the names
and faces by cellphone.

293
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:16,743
This little
performance was how I

294
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:19,276
made the SPK believe that
the notebook Mikami used

295
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,876
was the real one.

296
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:23,243
Mikami's daily behavior
is so methodical,

297
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,076
it's almost obsessive.

298
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:28,843
He always fills exactly one
page with names, every day.

299
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:31,043
And Near, you noticed
this little habit

300
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,776
and though you could use it
to tamper with the notebook.

301
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,443
All you had to do was
count ahead to the page

302
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:38,209
he'd use on the day
of this meeting.

303
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:41,409
Then you replaced all the
pages from that day onwards.

304
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:45,176
You were confident you could
prevent anyone from dying.

305
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:47,143
That was your big plan.

306
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:48,876
That's why you couldn't
change the date

307
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:50,643
and time of our meeting.

308
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:53,243
But I was one step
ahead of you, Near.

309
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:56,643
I always knew you were going to
try and alter the Death Note.

310
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,776
That's why I had Mikami
check the notebook every day

311
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:00,776
for signs of tampering.

312
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:05,409
-I've confirmed it.

313
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:12,943
LIGHT: (VOICEOVER)
I knew I'd won

314
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:15,876
this game as soon as
I got that message.

315
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:19,376
Mikami brought a different
notebook today, the real one,

316
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:21,476
which had been kept
hidden up until now.

317
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:29,043
But you know, Near, you
did have a chance to win,

318
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,676
if only you'd taken it.

319
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,143
You were just too naive.

320
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:36,809
You're nothing compared to
L. L would have considered

321
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:38,676
the possibility
of a fake notebook

322
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:41,843
from the very beginning,
and he would have tested it.

323
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:45,043
You had the chance,
but you squandered it.

324
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:49,109
I've gotta say, I'm so
disappointed in you.

325
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:50,709
This victory was no fun.

326
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:54,109
You tried too hard to
win in a noble way.

327
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:55,243
Well, that's fine.

328
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:57,976
Everyone here dies
today, thanks to you.

329
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:02,943
And as for me, I, Kira, will
have my perfect victory.

330
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:20,743
-You there, outside.

331
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:22,043
-Huh?

332
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:26,176
-Have you finished writing
down the names in the notebook?

333
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:28,009
-God.

334
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:28,643
Yes.

335
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:29,509
I've written them.

336
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,576
[stifled laughter]

337
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,243
-(VOICEOVER) No.

338
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,676
I can't laugh yet.

339
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,976
I've got to hold it in.

340
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,643
They're all gonna die.

341
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:44,509
40 seconds after he
wrote down their names.

342
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:45,843
35 seconds.

343
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:48,443
I'll claim my victory then.

344
00:19:48,476 --> 00:19:50,343
-Don't you think
it's rather odd?

345
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:51,543
-Hm?

346
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:53,976
-Why would he answer
you so quickly, calmly,

347
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:56,343
and honestly when you asked
him if he had written down

348
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:57,643
our names yet?

349
00:19:57,676 --> 00:19:58,343
-Who knows?

350
00:19:58,376 --> 00:19:59,643
Maybe he's just honest.

351
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,076
Or confident that he'll succeed.

352
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:04,109
Or perhaps he's seen
through your brilliant plan.

353
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:05,076
-Huh?

354
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:07,809
In that case, we're
in big trouble.

355
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:10,309
-Teru Mikami.

356
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,076
If it's not too much trouble for
you, won't you please come in

357
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:15,876
and join us?

358
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:17,543
I already know that
you're the one who's

359
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:20,143
been judging and
executing people for Kira.

360
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:21,843
If you've already
written down our names,

361
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:23,943
then there shouldn't be
anything to be afraid of.

362
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:25,176
You can come right on in.

363
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:29,776
-Teru Mikami, is it?

364
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:30,776
He's correct.

365
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,409
There's no reason
to hide from us.

366
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:33,876
You can come in.

367
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:34,343
-God.

368
00:20:56,743 --> 00:21:00,043
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
You've done well, Mikami.

369
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:02,243
How many seconds has it
been since you wrote down

370
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:02,976
the first name?

371
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:14,776
-30 seconds.

372
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:27,443
31, 32, 33, 34,
35, 36, 37, 38, 39!

373
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:28,743
-Well Near.

374
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:30,443
Looks like I win.

375
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:30,943
-40!

376
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:42,544
[theme music]

377
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:55,311
[maniacal laughter]

378
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,140
-That's right.

379
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:02,606
I am Kira.
