00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:39,662
MELLO: What was that?

3
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:40,528
Roger?

4
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:41,828
What did you just say?

5
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,795
-I'm afraid L is dead.

6
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:48,762
-He's dead?

7
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:50,162
But-- But how?

8
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:53,528
Was it Kira?

9
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:54,995
Did Kira kill him?

10
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:55,762
Come on, Roger.

11
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:57,428
You've got to tell me!

12
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:58,628
-ROGER: Probably.

13
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:00,762
-But he promised me he'd
find Kira and execute him,

14
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:04,528
and now you're telling
me that he's been killed.

15
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:05,028
-Mello!

16
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:20,528
NEAR: If you can't win the game,
if you can't solve the puzzle,

17
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:21,628
then you're just a loser.

18
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:27,628
-So, which of us did L pick?

19
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:28,362
Me or Near?

20
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:33,995
-He hadn't chosen yet.

21
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,528
And now that he's gone, I'm
afraid he won't be able to.

22
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:41,162
Mello.

23
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,295
Listen.

24
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,395
You two Near.

25
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:45,962
Can't the two of
you work together?

26
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:46,762
-All right.

27
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:47,262
Sounds good.

28
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:53,862
MELLO: It'll never work, Roger.

29
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:55,662
We can't do this together.

30
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,962
You know I don't get
along with the Near.

31
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,895
We've always competed
against each other.

32
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:01,395
Always.

33
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,462
You know what?

34
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,695
It's fine.

35
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:21,895
Near should be the one to
succeed L. He's not like me.

36
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:23,062
He never gets emotional.

37
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:25,862
He just uses his head, like
it's a game or a puzzle.

38
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:33,328
And as for me, I'm
leaving this institution.

39
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:34,228

00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:36,162

00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:38,362
I'm almost 15 years old.

42
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:40,362
It's time I started
living my own life.

43
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,462
NEAR: A police
officer who happened

44
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,028
to be nearby during
Higuchi's arrest overhead

45
00:03:52,062 --> 00:03:54,095
him talking about a notebook.

46
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:56,928
If you write a person's name
in it with their face in mind,

47
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:58,295
that person will die.

48
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:00,562
-So that's what you're
saying this notebook of death

49
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:01,728
actually is.

50
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:02,828
-That's right.

51
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:04,528
At this point, the
Japanese police

52
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:05,995
should have it in
their possession.

53
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:19,362
Mr. President, the
current L is a fake.

54
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:21,062
He was created by
the Japanese police

55
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,262
to avoid confusion and
panic amongst the various

56
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:24,995
international police agencies.

57
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:27,095
The reak L is dead.

58
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:28,762
-Uh, Director Mason.

59
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:31,695
This boy, who is he?

60
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:32,795
-Sir.

61
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:35,562
Near is-- Well, in a
sense you could call him

62
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:37,396
the true successor to L.

63
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:02,128
MAN: But still, it's
impossible for us

64
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:04,362
to censor everything
on the internet.

65
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:07,595
And we haven't had any
new leads in a while.

66
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,328
-But posting names
and faces online?

67
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,828
I'm sorry, but if
you ask me, it's

68
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:14,195
the people doing that
who deserve to die.

69
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:16,795
But I guess that's
never gonna happen.

70
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:18,995
Kira gets a lot of his
information from the internet,

71
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,728
so he's not gonna
kill those people.

72
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:22,495
-Matsu, you silly.

73
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:24,128
You've got it all backwards.

74
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:25,195
-Still.

75
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:27,495
I can imagine how
some people must feel.

76
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,428
To them, the world's
become a good place

77
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,062
for people who don't
commit any crimes,

78
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,495
or rather, it's a good
place for innocent people

79
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:36,362
who lead good lives.

80
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:37,395
-Look who's talking.

00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:38,895

It's more than that.

82
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:41,828
Soon, everyone in the
world will think that way.

83
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:44,828
-Are you all still talking
about that Kira business?

84
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:47,828
Please, give it a rest
for one afternoon, dear.

85
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:48,828
Light, you too.

86
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:51,062
SAYU: I'm home.

87
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:52,895
-Hey, how's it going?

88
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,528
-We were just having tea.

89
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,495
-Oh Light, Misa.

90
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:58,895
Seems like it's been
forever, you two.

91
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:00,495
Missed you guys.

92
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,395
-Aw, we missed you too!

93
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,628
-And you must be
Mr. Matsuda, right?

94
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:06,862
-That's me.

95
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,528
-Wow, it's been a long time.

96
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:11,095
Thank you for always taking
such good care of my father.

97
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:13,095
-Gee, Sayu.

98
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:15,128
You're all grown up.

99
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:16,395
And pretty.

100
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,962
Last time I saw you,
you were this big.

101
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:19,795
-Matsu!

102
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:20,928
Your face is going bright red!

103
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:21,862
-It is?

104
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,395
I mean, no way!

105
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:24,428
-Well, you can forget it.

106
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:26,628
I'll never let Sayu marry a cop.

107
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:27,095
-Huh?

108
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:27,695
-Yes.

109
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:28,595
That's right.

110
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:29,928
I'd never want that
for my daughter.

111
00:06:29,962 --> 00:06:31,062
-Really?

112
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:32,162
Aw man.

113
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:33,795
I never got the chance
to propose or even

114
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,328
tell her I like her.

115
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,628
You're too cruel
to me, mom and dad.

116
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:38,962
-Mom?

117
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:40,062
-Anyway.

118
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,762
I think you'd be a good
catch, Mr. Matsuda.

119
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:43,228
-What?

120
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:45,462
Y-- You really think so, Sayu?

121
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:46,728
-Yep!

122
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:49,228
In fact, I was thinking if
you were a little younger,

123
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:53,128
I might've considered going
out with you some time.

124
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,995
-Guess my little sister's
all grown up, isn't she?

125
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,062
MISA: No kidding.

126
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,128
She's already way more
mature than Matsu.

127
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,195
But of course, Light
hasn't changed one bit.

128
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:03,828
You're just as wonderful
and handsome as when I first

129
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:04,962
met you!

130
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,795
-You've already got a
career and everything.

131
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:07,895
Make it official.

132
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,628
You should stop living
together secretly

133
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,395
and just get married already.

134
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:14,595

Yes?

Yes.

Right.

143
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:33,628
OK.

144
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:37,628
We have to go.

Matsuda, Light.

146
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:39,195
Come with me.

Involving who?

149
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:50,495
-They got Director
Takimura of the NPA.

150
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:52,895
I'm not sure who's behind it.

151
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:53,962
-Ah, damn it.

enough on our plate

you sure about this?

-Unfortunately, yeah.

156
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:06,928
We got the call at 6:12.

157
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:08,895
That was about 45 minutes ago.

158
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:10,562
In the meantime, we
were able to confirm

159
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:13,462
that the call originated from
the director's cell phone.

160
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:16,995
-Did the kidnappers make any
demands in terms of ransom?

161
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:17,795
-They did.

162
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,662
They want a trade.

163
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:23,995

And for what reason?

166
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:30,895
-Do you think it's Kira?

00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,095
-Maybe not.

00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:34,728

-But hang on.

172
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,928
Dad, did you say anything to
the director about the notebook?

173
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:42,095
We all agreed to keep the
information between the six

174
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:42,928
of us.

175
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:44,328
So, he didn't know it, did he?

176
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:45,695
-I never told the
director, so he

177
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:48,495
couldn't tell the
kidnappers anything.

And beyond that, they know that

00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:01,462
but only about the
kidnapping itself.

183
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:02,428
-Got it.

184
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:17,395
[beeping]

185
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:19,295
-Has there been a call
from the suspects?

186
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,695
MAN (ON PHONE): No.

187
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:23,162
There's a visitor here who wants
to meet with Director Takimura.

188
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,062
-What?

189
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:26,695
-My name is John McEnroe.

190
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:29,028
I'm an agent with the FBI.

191
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:31,462
Of course, this
is just an alias.

192
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:35,162
As my assignment involves Kira,
it's a necessary precaution.

193
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:37,262
-Kira?

194
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:40,595
Due to unforseen circumstances,
the director is unavailable.

195
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:44,795
If it's acceptable, you
could speak with me instead.

196
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:45,328
-Very well.

197
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:46,495
That's fine.

198
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,228
Pardon me, I'll get
straight to the point.

199
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:52,662
The Japanese police have proven
themselves to be unreliable.

200
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,828
So in order to
solve the Kira case,

201
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:58,062
we want you to hand
over the notebook to us.

202
00:09:58,095 --> 00:10:00,262
-So the FBI was behind it!

203
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:02,695
Where did you take the director?

204
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,062
-What are you talking about?

205
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,362
-Don't act like you don't know.

206
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:06,928
This is a serious
criminal offense.

207
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:08,728
MAN: What would the
FBI gain by capturing

208
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:10,862
the director of
the Japanese NPA?

209
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:11,695
CHIEF YAGAMI (ON
RADIO): Then how

210
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:12,595
do you know about the notebook?

211
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,028
-What the hell is going on?

212
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:15,162
-By the sound of
things, it seems

213
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:16,995
that the director of the
Japanese police force

214
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:19,462
has been kidnapped by someone.

215
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,562
Specifically, someone
who wants the notebook.

216
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:26,628
All right, Commander Rester.

217
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:28,328
Pass on this message
through our agent.

218
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,795
Suggest to the
Japanese police that

219
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,895
would like to assist them
in rescuing the director,

220
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:33,695
and apprehending the culprits.

221
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:36,095
We'll take the notebook once
we have the opportunity.

222
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:37,728
-Roger that.

223
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,628
Attention.

224
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:40,028
This is headquarters.

225
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:41,395
We have new orders for you.

226
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:53,662
[groan]

227
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,628
-Has he decided to
say anything yet?

228
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:08,862
-He told us the Japanese police
have begun to wimp out on Kira.

229
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:10,462
Looks like right
now, the only ones

230
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:13,662
who are officially working
for L are Suichiro Yagami,

231
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:16,128
Konzo Mogi, and Tota Matsuda.

232
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:18,395
Isn't that right?

233
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,495
-Yeah.

234
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:22,662
There was also Kida, but
he was killed by Kira.

235
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:23,595
-Right.

236
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:25,162
And as top cop,
somehow you didn't

237
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:28,862
know that this notebook even
existed, or that you had it.

238
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,828
[laughter]

239
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:33,362
-Japanese cops must be a joke.

240
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:35,428
-Of all the investigators
on the task force,

241
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,695
Deputy Director Yagami would
be the highest ranking, right?

242
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:39,195
-Yeah.

243
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:47,595
-My theory is that there
are two notebooks out there.

244
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:49,528
One of them is in
Kira's possession,

245
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:50,995
the other is with the NPA.

246
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:55,828
We're going to
take both of them.

247
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:56,695
-Huh?

248
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:58,062
-Don't worry.

249
00:11:58,095 --> 00:11:59,895
As long as we do what Mello
says, there'll be no mistakes.

250
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,495
It's been a year and a
half since he joined us,

251
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,028
and in that entire
time, he's never

252
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:05,895
been wrong about everything.

253
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:07,295
-Yeah, but that's
what's so weird.

254
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,462
If he was able to bring us
the head of a mafia boss

255
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,895
that even Kira himself
couldn't kill, why the hell

256
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:14,562
would he even need the
notebook to begin with?

257
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:16,862
-It's not just the
nobebook I'm after.

258
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:20,495
I want to eliminate
my competition.

259
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:23,262
I will be the best.

260
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:24,995
I don't care what it takes.

261
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:27,128
I'll beat Near by
any means necessary.

262
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:08,551
-Boss!

263
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:09,351
-Shut up.

264
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:10,985
Can't you see that I'm busy?

265
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:12,051
-I'm sorry.

266
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:13,751
But Eddie and I were
talking for a minute,

267
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:18,451
and it looks like Takimura hung
himself with his tie somehow.

268
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:19,785
-What's wrong with you?

269
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:20,918
Just great.

270
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,918
What are we supposed to
do with a dead hostage?

271
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:23,618
-No.

272
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:24,885
This will be just fine.

273
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:26,151
-Huh?

274
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:28,218
-(VOICEOVER) If Kira is
responsible for this,

275
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:30,785
we know he can't touch us
since he doesn't know our names

276
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:31,851
or faces.

277
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,585
That's why he went
after Takimura instead.

278
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:37,985
That means Kira is someone who
knows about the kidnapping.

279
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,118
That should make things
rather interesting.

280
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,351
-So what are we gonna do, Mello?

281
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,985
-I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

282
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:50,585
We're going to kidnap Soichiro
Yagami's daughter, Sayu Yagami.

283
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:57,985
-We still haven't been
able to find any leads

284
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:00,285
on either Director
Takimura or the kidnappers.

285
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:01,818
-Things are getting
pretty weird.

286
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,651
I mean, they should
have contacted us by now

287
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:05,751
with further demands,
but still nothing.

288
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:07,218
-We know one thing.

289
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:10,818
I found out the real name of
the FBI agent, John McEnroe.

290
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,585
According to his
personnel file, he's

291
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,351
actually called Larry Connors.

292
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,018
-Well, that's good to know.

293
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:17,385
-He's also a genuine agent.

294
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:19,618
His background and
credentials check out.

295
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,385
On top of that, the
director of the FBI

296
00:14:21,418 --> 00:14:24,118
has offered to help us
rescue Director Takimura.

297
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:26,351
I'm pretty sure we'll
be able to trust them.

298
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:28,451
LIGHT: (VOICEOVER) But the
director should already

299
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:29,618
be dead by now.

300
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,085
Why haven't the
kidnappers said anything?

301
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:33,518
Are they gonna
give up on the deal

302
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:35,818
just because they lost
their bargaining chip?

303
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:39,618
I didn't think our opponents
would be such pushovers.

304
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:41,418
Remember, Dad, and
the rest of you, too.

305
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:43,918
We're going to have to
be extremely careful.

306
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,651
The director might not have
known about the notebook,

307
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,251
but he does know
who was originally

308
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:51,418
working with L. It's
possible the kidnappers might

309
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:52,285
come after us.

310
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:52,785
-Hey, Light?

311
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:54,118
-Huh?

312
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:58,151
-I'll be a good girl and
go to bed by myself, OK?

313
00:14:58,185 --> 00:14:59,085
-Uh--

314
00:14:59,118 --> 00:14:59,585
LIGHT: Yeah.

315
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:01,051
Goodnight.

316
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:02,985
-Goodnight, everyone.

317
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:05,618
-Guess I'll hang
out around here.

318
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:08,285
-It just occurred to me, we're
not the only ones in danger

319
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:09,018
here.

320
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:09,818
Our families are at risk.

321
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:11,185
[phone ringing]

322
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:12,885
-A call from the
Director's cellphone.

323
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,585
It must be the kidnappers.

324
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:15,685
Quick, Aizawa.

325
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:16,318
Got it.

326
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:17,285
Tracing.

327
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:21,385
[phone ringing]

328
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:22,085
-This is Yagami.

329
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:23,418
MELLO (ON PHONE): Look.

330
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,718
About trading the director
in exchange for the notebook?

331
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,651
The deal's been canceled.

332
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:30,151
Takimura is dead.

333
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:31,251
CHIEF YAGAMI: You bastards!

334
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:32,351
What did you do?

335
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:33,118
MELLO (ON PHONE): It's
only canceled, though,

336
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:34,418
regarding the director.

337
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:35,885
The new deal is this.

338
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,285
The notebook for Sayu Yagami.

339
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:38,785
-Huh?

340
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:42,885
MELLO (ON PHONE):
Seeing as you're

341
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:44,818
the Deputy Director of
the Japanese police,

342
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:47,585
it would be stupid to ask
you not to call the cops.

343
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:50,551
But you had better handle this
on your own, without backup.

344
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:53,151
If I see the police
making any big movements

345
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,751
in the next little
while, I'll kill

346
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:56,718
your daughter That's right.

347
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:59,151
Just as easily as we
killed the director.

348
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:01,018
I'll send you a photo
of Takimura's corpse,

349
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:02,418
to prove I mean business.

350
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,451
Take a good look.

351
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:05,851
I'll contact you tomorrow.

352
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:06,351
-Huh?

353
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:08,485
Wait!

354
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:09,785
-(VOICEOVER) Damn, they got me.

355
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,751
They used the director's
death as an opportunity

356
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:13,451
to get to Sayu.

357
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,785
[laughter]

358
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:18,351
-Looks like things are
getting interesting again.

359
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:22,351
-Sir, I-- I can't believe
they'd go this far.

360
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:22,918
-Damn them.

361
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,218
[phone ringing]

362
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,118
MRS. YAGAMI: Yes, yes.

363
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,051
Coming.

364
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:28,185
Darling?

365
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:29,385
You usually never call
from your work phone.

366
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:31,551
Is something the matter?

367
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:32,718
Huh?

368
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:33,918
Sayu?

369
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,218
I don't know.

370
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:38,818
Now that you mention it,
she is late coming home.

371
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:40,285
-Sayu.

372
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:42,251
[buzzing]

373
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:49,585
-Dad-- are you OK?

374
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:51,885
I've just realized something.

375
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:53,718
I think it was Kira who
killed the director.

376
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:54,918
Not the kidnappers.

377
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,251
-Huh?

378
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:58,318
-He probably did it because
he doesn't want the notebook

379
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,818
to fall into the wrong hands.

380
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:02,418
Kira claims to be justice.

381
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:05,485
He wouldn't want the notebook
used by someone evil.

382
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:07,085
If he killed the
director, then it's

383
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:09,851
reasonable to assume he has
ways of obtaining information

384
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:11,718
from within the police force.

385
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,985
That means we should be the
ones who investigate this.

386
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:17,318
We leave the police
out of it Otherwise--

387
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:20,351
-Kira will find out about it,
and probably kill the hostage.

388
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:21,185
-Right.

389
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:22,518
And we can't take that chance.

390
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:23,951
[laughter]

391
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:30,785
-Near.

392
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,718
We've just received a
report that the director

393
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,551
of the Japanese Police
Agency has been killed.

394
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:37,585
-I see By whom?

395
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:38,618
-By whom?

396
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:40,151
-Uh, the kidnappers, of course.

397
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,285
Who else?

398
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:42,918
-It'd be interesting if
it turned out to be Kira.

399
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:43,751
-Hm?

400
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:45,318
NEAR: That's a very good point.

401
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,085
The police won't be
trading their notebook

402
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:49,685
if the hostage is dead, so
it protect Kira's interests.

403
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:52,218
And if it is in fact
Kira, that can narrow down

404
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:54,385
our list of suspects
significantly

405
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:56,751
-Hm?

406
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,818
-By the way, Commander
Rester, have you

407
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:01,218
been able to determine
his whereabouts yet?

408
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:02,551
-Not yet.

409
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:04,951
We were able to confirm that
he left the institution four

410
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:08,518
years ago, but
nothing beyond that.

411
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:10,318
-Very well That clinches it

412
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,585
-What?

413
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:14,485
-Mello, you never change.

414
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:16,418
You always overlook the
most important things

415
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:19,151
because you let your emotions
get the better of you.

416
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:22,918
Or perhaps you're not even
involved in this case.

417
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:26,985
How could you leave your
photo behind at the orphanage?

418
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,718
[phone ringing]

419
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,118
CHIEF YAGAMI: This is Yagami.

420
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,818
MELLO (ON PHONE): Your
daughter has finally arrived.

421
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:33,685
It's about time.

422
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:35,018
-What do you mean?

423
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:36,951
MELLO (ON PHONE): You already
have a pretty good idea

424
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,151
of where we are, don't you?

425
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,018
-Hm.

426
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,885
-We'll make the exchange here.

427
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:43,385
Come to LA, by
yourself, in two days.

428
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:46,185
And of course, bring
the notebook with you.

429
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:48,618
-I won't make the trade unless
I'm sure my daughter's safe.

430
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:50,385
I want to talk to her right now.

431
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:51,751
MELLO (ON PHONE):
How about this?

432
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:53,285
I'll send you another photo.

433
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:55,351
That should satisfy you.

434
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:58,751
[beeping]

435
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:00,951
[phone ringing]

436
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:01,451
-Sayu.

437
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:09,618
-Hey Chief, we've narrowed the
call down to 5th Street in LA.

438
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,051
-I just checked
out the show that

439
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,051
was playing in the
background, and it's

440
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,018
being broadcast right now
on a local LA station.

441
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:20,551
They must have shown us that
so we know the photo's recent.

442
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:22,051
-Thank goodness.

443
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:23,618
At least we know
she's still alive.

444
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:24,385
That's reassuring.

445
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:30,751
-I'm taking the
notebook to Los Angeles.

446
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:33,751
It's my decision, both as Deputy
Director of the Japanese Police

447
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:35,885
Force, and as Sayu
Yagami's father.

448
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:38,218
I'll take full responsibility
for the consequences.

449
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:39,385
That's my final word.

450
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:40,685
-Wait, Dad.

451
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:42,351
Before we do anything, we
have to come up with a plan.

452
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:43,485
-He's right, Chief.

453
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:44,485
We can't rush in.

454
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,918
-But I have to be
in LA in two days.

455
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:47,718
We don't have time.

456
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:56,118
-So what you're telling me is
that Kira killed Takimura, not

457
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,385
the kidnappers?

458
00:19:57,418 --> 00:19:59,985
-I'm simply putting it
forward as a possibility.

459
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:01,585
If it does turn out
to be true, then it

460
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,418
means Kira must be
getting his information

461
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:04,818
from the Japanese police.

462
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:07,485
-Hm.

463
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:08,885
[phone ringing]

464
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:11,218
-Hm?

465
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,185
Yes?

466
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:13,251
LIGHT (VOICE
SCRAMBLED): This is L.

467
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:13,918
-Hm?

468
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,251
I don't believe it.

469
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:16,618
It's L.

470
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:19,285
-I've already heard what
investigator John McEnroe,

471
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,118
or rather, Larry Connors has
had to say to Deputy Director

472
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:24,918
Yagami in regards to the
notebook and the Kira case.

473
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:26,518
Will you help us with
the investigation

474
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:30,051
into NPA Director
Takimura's murder?

475
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:30,785
-I see.

476
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:31,751
Well--

477
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:34,818
-Pass me the phone.

478
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:35,318
-Huh?

479
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:40,685
-I'm pleased to meet you
at last, L number two.

480
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:47,951
-Number two?

481
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:50,251
What do you mean by that?

482
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:51,385
Who is this?

483
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,251
-There's really no point
in trying to hide it.

484
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,851
We are a new organization
known as the SPK,

485
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:57,551
or Special Provision for Kira.

486
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,685
It was established to
find and capture Kira

487
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,985
without the help of L.
(MODIFIED VOICE) Furthermore,

488
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:05,818
seven of our top members
already know of L's death.

489
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:06,951
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): They do?

490
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:08,118
Where'd they hear that?

491
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,018
Who the hell told them?

492
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:14,151
-As for myself, I am at
the center of the SPK.

493
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:18,051
You can address me as N.

494
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:18,951
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): N?

495
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:20,518
Who is this guy?

496
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,985
Is he joking?

497
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:27,918
But, this strange feeling.

498
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,418
What is it?

499
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:42,445
[theme music]

500
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:51,248
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Damn.

501
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:52,414
What's going on?

502
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:54,481
I've already checked
today's flight crews.

503
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:56,314
No one on board was suspicious.

504
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:58,048
I can still make it.

505
00:22:58,081 --> 00:23:02,781
But at this rate, is my
only option to kill Sayu?
