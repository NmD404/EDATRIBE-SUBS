[theme music]

2
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:44,423
-I think we should
do this every day.

3
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:46,289
The sun will do you good.

4
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:59,089
-What in the world am
I supposed to do now?

5
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:16,556
-Ah.

6
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:17,056
Mm.

7
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,556
Mm-hm.

8
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:23,389
-Hi, Ryuk.

9
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:29,189
-Sidoh?

10
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:30,923
Wh- What are you doing here?

11
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,656
Hey.

12
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,556
Quit following me.

13
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,223
-I want my notebook.

14
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:42,189
RYUK (VOICEOVER): Damn.

15
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:44,356
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

16
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:45,489
Too bad.

17
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:48,389
Things got a little
complicated recently.

18
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:50,623
I have no idea where it is.

19
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:51,856
-Why am I not surprised?

20
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:56,756
-Look!

21
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:57,423
I told you.

22
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:58,889
Stop following me!

23
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:00,389
-Then give me back my notebook.

24
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:01,789
-I don't know where it is.

25
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:05,823
If you want it
back, you're gonna

26
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,623
have to look for it yourself.

27
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:08,189
-Moron.

28
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:14,823
-Wammy's House isn't
exactly a normal orphanage.

29
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:16,789
It's like a school
for gifted children.

30
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,556
But here's the crazy part.

31
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:21,556
Its real purpose is to groom
these kids so that one of them

32
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,356
could become the next L.

33
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,589
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
L's successor?

34
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,923
-Apparently, the one
most likely to succeed

35
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,423
L is this kid named Near.

36
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:30,423
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Near.

37
00:03:30,456 --> 00:03:32,123
Is that N?

38
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:35,723
-Also, we found some leads on
Mello, the one N mentioned.

39
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:39,056
He's smart too, but he
always came second to Near.

40
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,389
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): So Near
was meant to be L's successor.

41
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:42,556
There's no mistake.

42
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,156
He has to be N. He's the
one commanding the SPK.

43
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,656
As for Mello, he would've
wanted to become L's successor,

44
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,956
but he probably
lost out to Near.

45
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,523
That gives him a
motive for wanting

46
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:56,423
to get his hands on
the notebook first.

47
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,589
It all adds up perfectly.

48
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:02,589
This guy is definitely the same
Mello that N told us about.

49
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:04,889
-These are sketches
of both of them.

50
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:08,589
We couldn't find any photographs

51
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,056
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
L's successors.

52
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:14,023
It looks like I'm still
fighting L after all this time.

53
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:18,723
First thing's first.

54
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:21,023
I have to find out where
Mello and his mafia associates

55
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:22,423
are hiding themselves.

56
00:04:22,456 --> 00:04:25,523
I already had Misa check a list
of known mafia syndicates using

57
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,056
her Shinigami eyes.

58
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:28,589
-Look!

59
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:29,356
I found him!

60
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,623
I can't see his lifespan.

61
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:32,589
He's number 105.

62
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:35,056
They have him listed
as Jack Neylon,

63
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,723
but his real name is Kal Snydar.

64
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:37,656
He's got the notebook.

65
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,023
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
After that, it

66
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:40,823
was a simple matter of
using the Death Note

67
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:42,589
to make Snyder
send a letter to me

68
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,889
with the location of
the gang's hideout.

69
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:48,156
It should be arriving soon.

70
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,123
-Hi Light!

71
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:50,756
Great news.

72
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,256
The letter arrived.

73
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:54,889
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): He's in LA.

74
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:56,023
I did it.

75
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:58,456
I outmaneuvered
both Near and Mello.

76
00:04:58,489 --> 00:04:59,989
Guess it's no surprise.

77
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:02,723
As long as I have the
notebook and Misa's eyes,

78
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:03,356
I'm unstoppable.

79
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,389
-So, Light.

80
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:12,623
I guess this means I was helpful
to you again, doesn't it?

81
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:14,056
-Yeah.

82
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,589
I love you, Misa.

83
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,956
-Los Ang-- Ah huh.

84
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:42,389
MELLO: The next step
is for me to figure out

85
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:45,289
just how much I can control
people with this thing.

86
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:46,323
-Aw.

87
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:47,823
They're gonna have
to be able to see me

88
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:49,956
before I can even talk to them.

89
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:52,523
What a drag.

90
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:55,556
Looks like Snyder's
the owner right now.

91
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,456
Guess I'll have to make him
touch the notebook first.

92
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:00,389
Oh well.

93
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:06,089
Tag, you're it.

94
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:09,656
-The, uh-- The
notebook just flew.

95
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:10,589
-Ha.

96
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,556
It's a notebook
that kills people.

97
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,689
Hell, nothing
surprises me anymore.

98
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:15,989
[scream]

99
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:16,856
-Boss!

100
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:17,689
Who is this?

101
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:18,989
The guy in the freaky costume?

102
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:19,889
Who the hell is he?

103
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:21,689
Who brought him here?

104
00:06:21,723 --> 00:06:22,989
-I came here on my own.

105
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:24,989
I'm actually a Shinigami.

106
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,023
-A Shinigami?

107
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:28,189
[scared laughter]

108
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,923
-If you don't want everyone
to think you're crazy,

109
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:36,189
pass the notebook around,
so they can see me too.

110
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:38,823
-He says you can see him
if you touch the notebook!

111
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,456
Please.

112
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:40,823
Everyone touch it.

113
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:44,723
I swear I'm not crazy!

114
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:46,556
-Fine, whatever.

115
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:47,856
Come on, guys.

116
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,323
Touch the notebook.

117
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:51,723
[shouting]

118
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,823
-He wasn't there the
last time I touched him!

119
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:54,623
-Should I kill him?

120
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:01,023
-Nice try.

121
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:04,989
You humans can't
kill a Shinigami.

122
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,123
-Jack's right.

123
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:07,656
That ain't no costume.

124
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,656
That's a real, live Shinigami.

125
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,956
So now what do we do?

126
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,789
LIGHT: Ryuk.

127
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:17,489
As of now, I'm going to forfeit
ownership of this notebook.

128
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:19,789
All I ask is that
you agree to follow

129
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,923
whichever person I give it to.

130
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:22,789
-What?

131
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:23,956
You're giving up
ownership again?

132
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:25,089
-But wait.

133
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:27,756
Won't you lose all your
memories if you do that?

134
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,723
-Misa, lend me your notebook.

135
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:32,656
-I'll keep it on me like this.

136
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,023
That way, even if I forfeit
ownership of my notebook,

137
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,723
I won't lose my memory.

138
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,689
I'll give you as many
pages as you need.

139
00:07:38,723 --> 00:07:41,189
From this moment on,
you're going to be Kira.

140
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:42,456
Can you do that?

141
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:43,523
-Of course.

142
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:47,189
But I don't get why
you're doing this.

143
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:49,856
-I'll explain everything
to you right now.

144
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:51,089
I won't forgive any mistakes.

145
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:58,156
-Chocolate is so good.

146
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,089
-Hey.

147
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,156
What about that
stuff you told us?

148
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,489
Is it true?

149
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,956
If the person using the note
fails to consecutively write

150
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:06,623
names of people to be killed
within 13 days of each other,

151
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:08,289
then the user will die.

152
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:11,289
If you make this note unusable
by tearing it up or burning it,

153
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:14,423
all the human who have touched
the note until then will die.

154
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:18,223
Are you saying those
two rules are made up?

155
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:20,789
-Oh yeah, those rules
are definitely fake.

156
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:23,556
My guess is, some Shinigami
wrote those down as a joke

157
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:26,756
before giving the
notebook to a human.

158
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,556
MELLO (VOICEOVER): As
for the 13 day rule,

159
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,823
we can test that out by
using one of our people.

160
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:33,423
But the real
question is, was this

161
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:35,856
the notebook that
was used by Kira?

162
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,056
And if so, was he aware that
these two rules were false?

163
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:43,989
If he did know, he could've used
these rules to his advantage.

164
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,423
In particular, the
13 day rule would've

165
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:51,889
allowed him to prove his
innocence in only 13 days.

166
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:55,356
Sidoh, go keep watch outside.

167
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:57,756
It'll be very convenient
for us that you

168
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:59,389
can't be seen be humans.

169
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:01,056
Go outside and keep watch.

170
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,689
Got it?

171
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,156
-What's with this guy?

172
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:07,589
He's human, but he's scary.

173
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:10,456
[phone ringing]

174
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:15,523
-Yagami speaking.

175
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,689
MODIFIED VOICE: This is Kira.

176
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,656
LIGHT: What did he say?

177
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:19,989
Kira?

178
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:21,923
MODIFIED VOICE: I
understand the notebook that

179
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:24,789
was in your possession has
fallen into criminal hands.

180
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:27,156
CHIEF YAGAMI:
Can-- Can you prove

181
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:28,423
that you are the real Kira?

182
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:29,656
MODIFIED VOICE: Prove it?

183
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:31,523
Now that there are others
using the notebook,

184
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:33,023
there's no point
predicting killings

185
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:34,789
in order to identify myself.

186
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:37,656
They could just as easily
kill the same targets.

187
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:38,823
But don't worry.

188
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:40,556
I've already taken
this into account.

189
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,256
I've sent you something
that will clearly

190
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,223
prove to you that I am Kira.

191
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:46,056
It's my own notebook.

192
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:47,956
-Wha-- What do you mean?

193
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,289
MODIFIED VOICE:
The notebook I've

194
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,823
sent you gives me the power to
know a person's name by seeing

195
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:54,823
only their face, and you will
be able to gain that same power.

196
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:56,323
Do you understand?

197
00:09:56,356 --> 00:10:00,889
MISA: Please stay calm
and listen carefully.

198
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,623
(MODIFIED VOICE) I've
gathered information

199
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:05,023
from the FBI and other sources.

200
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:08,956
On November 10 at
exactly 11:59 PM,

201
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:11,923
arrangements have been so
that all known associates

202
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,289
of the mafia will die.

203
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:17,789
It's already been
written in my notebook,

204
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:20,023
so it's impossible for
me to make any changes.

205
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:22,223
You will not be able to
prevent these deaths.

206
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,923
I already know their location.

207
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,289
I will hand over
that information

208
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:28,123
along with the
notebook, so remember.

209
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:30,523
November 10th, 11:59 PM.

210
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:32,556
That's when it all happens.

211
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:34,423
That moment is your
best and only chance

212
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:36,323
to get the notebook back.

213
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:37,023
It's up to you.

214
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,191
-What should we do?

215
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,191
If the mafia members
are going to die

216
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,058
on the day Kira
specified, it would

217
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:05,958
be a chance to get
the notebook back.

218
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:08,058
I don't like the idea of
following Kira's plan,

219
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:09,491
but it's our best option.

220
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:10,058
RYUK: Exactly.

221
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:19,158
-But still, knowing the
time of death for these guys

222
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:22,325
isn't going to be enough
for us to make our move.

223
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:25,058
-Ide, I think we both know
what needs to be done.

224
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,691
We get the Shinigami
to follow us in,

225
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:29,058
and then we do the deal
for the eyes, and make sure

226
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:29,758
they're all dead.

227
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,258
Right?

228
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:35,658
-I will make the
deal for the eyes.

229
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:36,725
-No way, Chief.

230
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,625
Let me be the one to do it.

231
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:40,591
-I was responsible
for handing over

232
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,325
the notebook in the first place.

233
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:44,758
Since that moment, I've
been unable to live

234
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,758
with what I've done.

235
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,491
I've even thought
of killing myself.

236
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:49,825
I'll use the notebook to
kill any criminals who

237
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:50,858
try to stop this.

238
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:56,125
And then, after 13
days, I'll die as well.

239
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:59,958
-(VOICEOVER) If Dad writes a
name in the notebook, then,

240
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:12,825
when the time comes-- Report.

241
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,691
Is everybody ready to move in?

242
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:16,491
MEN: Roger.

243
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:17,791
-All right.

244
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:21,925
Deputy director, make the
eye deal with the Shinigami.

245
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,125
-All right, Ryuk.

246
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:28,991
I'm ready.

247
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:29,825
-Sure thing, boss.

248
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:43,325
-Once you're
finished, I want you

249
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:44,691
to take a look at
the photographs

250
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:46,125
of the criminals I gave you.

251
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:48,558
Can you see their
names and lifespans?

252
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:49,625
-Yes.

253
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:51,025
I can.

254
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:52,758
-Their names should
disappear soon.

255
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,591
That's your cue.

256
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:17,058
[screaming]

257
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:18,525
-Everyone, move in!

258
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,091
-So, Kira is involved after all.

259
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,358
I didn't think he'd go this far.

260
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,691
My plan was supposed
to be perfect.

261
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:40,525
Damn!

262
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,658
What the hell is Sidoh doing?

263
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:43,725
-Relax, Sidoh.

264
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,691
Just shut up and
watch, all right?

265
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,558
All you have to do is
sit here and do nothing.

266
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:50,158
If you can do that, you'll
get your notebook back.

267
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:57,058
-Roy, Skiier, the
notebook's under Rod's body.

268
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,858
Bring it to the
surveillance room upstairs.

269
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:11,625
-Don't move!

270
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,258
-L, w apprehended
two of the criminals.

271
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,758
We've also been able
to secure the notebook.

272
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,058
MATSUDA: We'll begin
withdrawing now.

273
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:28,158
-Not yet.

274
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:29,158
Keep going.

275
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:29,958
-Huh?

276
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:30,925
-What?

277
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,325
LIGHT: We still
haven't found anyone

278
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,558
who resembles our
picture of Mello.

279
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:37,725
That means he must be hiding
somewhere in the building.

280
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:39,458
We've come this far.

281
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:40,425
Let's finish this.

282
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,458
Do a thorough search.

283
00:14:56,491 --> 00:14:57,525
-Ah!

284
00:14:57,558 --> 00:14:58,158
-What was that?

285
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,825
-An explosion.

286
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,125
MELLO: Don't move.

287
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:05,325
I've already blown up the
two entrances to this place.

288
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:07,125
This will be your only warning.

289
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:09,825
The next explosion will take out
the entire building, as well as

290
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:11,558
all your men inside.

291
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:14,725
So you'd better do as I say.

292
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:15,691
-It's Mello.

293
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,125
[laughter]

294
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:21,625
-Hm?

295
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:23,391
-Yagami again, huh?

296
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:25,925
Maybe I should have killed
you when I had the chance.

297
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,591
History repeats
itself, but I never

298
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,258
dreamed in a million years I'd
be bargaining for the notebook

299
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,291
with you again.

300
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:43,491
M-I-H-A-E-L K-E-E-H-L.
Your real name.

301
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,625
It's Mihael Keehl.

302
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,058
-(VOICEOVER) What the hell?

303
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:48,125
How did he--

304
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:49,558
-I did it.

305
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:50,591
-It's over, Mello.

306
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,191
It's time to turn yourself in.

307
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:54,125
If you give up,
I won't kill you.

308
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:56,258
You have my word on that.

309
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,591
-(VOICEOVER) What are you doing?

310
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,491
Don't be stupid.

311
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,858
Write his name
down and kill him!

312
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:02,091
Now!

313
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,525
-You know how this works.

314
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:06,125
I write your name,
and you will die.

315
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:08,591
Let go of that trigger and
put your hands in the air.

316
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:17,891
Yagami--

317
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:19,491
-Don't move!

318
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,591
I've written your first
name, and it will only

319
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,425
take me a second to
write your surname.

320
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,358
-(VOICEOVER) You idiot!

321
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:25,491
Just write it!

322
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:26,925
Kill him!

323
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,825
-I'm truly sorry.

324
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:30,525
For what it's worth,
I give you my word

325
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:33,858
that I never wanted to kill you.

326
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:34,358
-Hm?

327
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:42,191
-But tell me, Yagami, you've
never killed someone before,

328
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:42,858
have you?

329
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:49,658
-Gunfire?

330
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:59,591
-What was that?

331
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,158
-Jose!

332
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:01,458
The notebook!

333
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:03,058
-Damn!

334
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:05,991
-This guy he-- he won't
let go of the thing.

335
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,858
Son of a--

336
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:09,358
-Hm?

337
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:21,091
MATSUDA: Deputy Director!

338
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:25,458
-It's all over, Mello!

339
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,958
Put your hands up and surrender!

340
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:50,358
Matsuda!

341
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:51,625
Are you all right?

342
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:52,258
MATSUDA: No.

343
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,091
I don't think so.

344
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,158
AIZAWA: I'm sure you'll live.

345
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:57,258
L, I don't see
any sign of Mello.

346
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:01,991
-(VOICEOVER) Dammit.

347
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:03,991
After all that, he got away?

348
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,025
That's why you should
have just killed him.

349
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,325
[beeping]

350
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:18,625
-Come on!

351
00:18:18,658 --> 00:18:19,725
Please, Dad!

352
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:21,491
You can't die on me like this.

353
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:25,525
-Light.

354
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:26,458
-Yeah, Dad?

355
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:32,658
Thank goodness.

356
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:36,925
-You'll be fine.

357
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,958
It's OK.

358
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,858
-Light.

359
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:44,225
I still have them.

360
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:47,925
I still have the Shinigami eyes.

361
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,925
According to that
Shinigami, Ryuk,

362
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:55,325
I can't see the lifespan of
someone who owns a notebook.

363
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:59,858
But I can see the
numbers above your head.

364
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:05,291
Light-- you really aren't Kira.

365
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:09,825
I'm so glad, my son.

366
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,191
-Don't tell me you're still
worried about that, Chief.

367
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,191
Of course he's not Kira.

368
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:15,458
-Come on.

369
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:17,258
You shouldn't talk so much, Dad.

370
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,858
(VOICEOVER) That's
important, but I've

371
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,858
got bigger things to
deal with right now.

372
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:24,558
I've got to get him to write
Mello's name in the notebook.

373
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:31,258
-I-- I'm so sorry, but-- in
the end, I couldn't do it.

374
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,458
I couldn't bring
myself to kill him.

375
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,258
-(VOICEOVER) I can't just come
out and say, it's not too late.

376
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:37,958
No.

377
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:39,425
Wait, maybe I can.

378
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,258
It all depends on how I do it.

379
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:45,191
No one will think it's weird
if I get upset and panic.

380
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,425
Come on.

381
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,591
Dad, write his name.

382
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,358
You can't let him
beat you like this.

383
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:50,825
Write his name down!

384
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,425
With your last bit of strength.

385
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,058
Do you want to die in vain?

386
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,625
D-- Dad, no!

387
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,125
-Light--

388
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,991
[steady beep]

389
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,091
-I'm sorry for your loss.

390
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,591
-Dad.

391
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,358
Wake up!

392
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:22,591
Come on, damn it!

393
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,658
Don't you die on me, you idiot!

394
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,158
Dad!

395
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:55,258
-You are the Shinigami
who came here

396
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,391
to take back this
notebook, aren't you?

397
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,725
-Yes.

398
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,525
-The notebook might be helpful
to the Kira investigation,

399
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:05,625
but we really only
need one of them.

400
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:07,191
I'll give this one back to you.

401
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:17,558
RYUK (VOICEOVER): Humans
who use the notebook are

402
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:21,825
cursed with fear,
pain, and misery.

403
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:24,425
Of course, Soichiro
didn't use the notebook.

404
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,658
He got to die believing
that his son wasn't Kira.

405
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,491
I guess that means he was happy.

406
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:42,030
[theme music]

407
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:53,131
LIGHT: If Kira gets
caught, then he is evil.

408
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,397
If Kira rules the world,
then he is justice.

409
00:22:56,431 --> 00:23:00,464
From now on, the world will
start leaning in favor of Kira.

410
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:03,197
Kira will be justice.
