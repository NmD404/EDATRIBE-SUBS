1
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:15,666
[opening theme song]

2
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,842
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Regardless of
how she came to the conclusion,

3
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:49,709
the fact remains-- this
woman knows the truth.

4
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,109
If she gives this
information to the police,

5
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:53,842
it won't take them
very long to figure out

6
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:56,809
that Kira is actually me.

7
00:01:56,842 --> 00:01:59,642
I have no choice but
to eliminate her.

8
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:02,609
MAKI: Something wrong?

9
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:05,509
-Oh, eh, it's nothing.

10
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,742
But the more I think about
it, the more your theory

11
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:09,142
makes sense to me.

12
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:10,642
We can't waste any time.

13
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:12,842
We need to start
investigating it right away.

14
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:13,342
-What?

15
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,976
Really?

16
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:14,909
Do you mean that?

17
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:15,976
-Yes.

18
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,342
So have you told
anyone else about this?

19
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:21,076
-No you're the first
person I've told.

20
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:23,742
-[laughs] You're lucky.

21
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,376
But how will you get rid of her?

22
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,176
It's not like you
can do it here.

23
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,542
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Well, you have

24
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:32,009
a gift for stating
the obvious, Ryuk.

25
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:32,909
-Ah, hah.

26
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:34,409
Aren't you bold?

27
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:35,776
-Let's get started.

28
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,876
Could you please tell me the
date and time of the busjacking

29
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,242
incident?

30
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:43,676
-It was December 20th, in front
of Asagao Hill at 11:02 AM,

31
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,476
bound for Spaceland.

32
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:52,242
-December 20th, and they were
on their way to Spaceland.

33
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:52,742
MAKI: Yes.

34
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,042
RYUK: [long laugh]

35
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,076
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): This way
no one will find her body.

36
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:06,542
And even if they
do, they'll just

37
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:08,109
assume that the
death of her fiance

38
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:10,476
drove her to commit suicide.

39
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,342
RYUK: [laughs]

40
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:12,309
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Hmm?

41
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:13,576
What's so funny, Ryuk?

42
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:23,342
L: I apologize for questioning
all of you like that,

43
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,442
but I'm afraid I
had no other choice.

44
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:27,842
I've determined that
Kira is not among us.

45
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:30,042
[relieved sighs]

46
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:33,509
-Ryuzaki, how can you be
certain that we're all innocent?

47
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,442
-Well, to be honest,
from the beginning

48
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:38,176
I set a number of traps that
would reveal if any of you

49
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:39,576
was Kira.

50
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,609
But after speaking with you one
on one, I don't feel the need.

51
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:47,876
Excuse me.

52
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:52,276
MATSUDA (VOICEOVER):
Unbelievable.

53
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,642
He tells us to turn
off our cellphones.

54
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:55,642
-Understood.

55
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:57,642
I'm just about
finished here anyway.

56
00:03:57,676 --> 00:04:01,642
You've got the key,
so let yourself in.

57
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:02,842
Watari's on his way.

58
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,509
[gasps]

59
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,109
-So that's everything.

60
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:08,076
I'd like to report this
incident to my father--

61
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:10,709
if it's OK with you, that is.

62
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:13,242
-Well, if it's all the same,
I think I'd like to report it

63
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:14,276
myself.

64
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:15,742
And after talking
to you, I've decided

65
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,876
that it would be best to
do it as soon as possible.

66
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,042
-Uh, that makes sense.

67
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:28,676
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Just
10 seconds until 1:15.

68
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,309
I have to admit, I'd really
love to see how she dies.

69
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:36,542
But I can't be caught
following her around.

70
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,842
Go on.

71
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:39,476
Hurry to your death.

72
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:56,276
-Kira will definitely be
caught-- don't you think?

73
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:59,142
-Uh huh.

74
00:04:59,176 --> 00:04:59,676
Hm.

75
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:03,742
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
What's going on?

76
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:05,242
It should've happened already.

77
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,809
This doesn't make sense.

78
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:13,276
I don't understand
why she's not leaving.

79
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,676
I've had no problems making
people kill themselves

80
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:16,742
in the past.

81
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,042
All I had to do is
write the word suicide.

82
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:21,476
The criminals I tested
it on all hung themselves

83
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:23,676
exactly when I specified.

84
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:26,509
My experiments indicate that
in a situation like this,

85
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,909
I should be able to
control a person's actions.

86
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:29,909
So what's wrong?

87
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:35,642
RYUK: [laughs]

88
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:39,242
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Ryuk--
he laughed just like that

89
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:41,142
when I was writing
in the Death Note.

90
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:42,842
And that's not all.

91
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,309
I remember thinking
it was bizarre

92
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:46,009
how he laughed when
I asked for her name.

93
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:49,076
In fact, he's reacted
the same way every time

94
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:50,342
her name comes up.

95
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:51,309
An alias!

96
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,509
[gasps]

97
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:04,676
-Gentlemen, it's an
honor to meet all of you.

98
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,609
-This person is Watari?

99
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:09,476
-Um, what about
your usual outfit?

100
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,842
-If I dressed like that, I'd
be announcing to the world

101
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:13,242
that I am Watari.

102
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:15,109
That's all it takes to
give away the location

103
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,209
of our headquarters and Ryuzaki.

104
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:18,909
-Oh, I see.

105
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:21,842
-Ordinarily, I would never
show my face to any of you.

106
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:23,642
The fact that I'm here
is proof that you've

107
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,476
won Ryuzaki's trust.

108
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:27,676
-Now that you mention
it, I do feel honored.

109
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:31,576
-Well, then.

110
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,176
I brought those
items you requested.

111
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,409
It's all here.

112
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:36,642
-Could you please pass
them out to everyone?

113
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:37,142
-Yes.

114
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,909
Gentlemen, these are
your new police IDs.

115
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:44,909
-But-- what for?

116
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:50,076
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): She used
an alias, that has to be it.

117
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,509
Ryuk knew all along.

118
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,576
He could see her real
name with his eyes.

119
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:55,109
That's why he wouldn't
stop laughing.

120
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:56,409
I should've known.

121
00:06:56,442 --> 00:07:00,309
She's been overly cautious
from the beginning.

122
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:01,209
I see.

123
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,409
It makes a lot of sense.

124
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:04,009
She believes that
Raye died because he

125
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,509
showed his ID to Kira.

126
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:10,476
So of course she'd be careful
not to reveal her own identity.

127
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,109
Oh, this isn't good.

128
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:14,742
It's gonna be almost impossible
to ask for her real name

129
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:17,209
knowing she gave me an
alias the first time.

130
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:19,642
If I'm too persistent,
she'll get suspicious.

131
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:21,142
What am I saying?

132
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,509
It'll look suspicious
that I even

133
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,109
knew she was using an alias.

134
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:28,042
-I should probably
be getting back soon.

135
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:29,376
-Hmm?

136
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,709
-Someone from the task force
might be back there by now.

137
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,976
-Oh, yeah.

138
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,442
You could be right.

139
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:36,809
Let's cross our fingers
and hope someone's there.

140
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:37,309
-Yeah.

141
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:42,342
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

142
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:43,676
I'm running out of options here.

143
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:53,009
I have to stop this
before it's too late.

144
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:53,942
Oh, no.

145
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:55,742
What if my father
calls back now?

146
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,942
I already promised her that I'd
let her talk to him if he did.

147
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,709
This phone rings,
it's all over for me.

148
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:01,609
What am I gonna do?

149
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:09,309
This is crazy, all I have to
do is turn my cell phone off.

150
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:10,742
Problem solved.

151
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,109
Now, calm down.

152
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:15,276
You know what needs to be done,
just find out her real name.

153
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,442
Her purse, her
pockets-- she's got

154
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:19,142
to have a driver's
license or some kind

155
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:21,409
of personal identification
on her somewhere.

156
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:22,976
She's a woman, after all.

157
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,409
I suppose if I had
to, I could use force.

158
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:27,776
No.

159
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,342
No, the last thing I want to
do is make a scene in public.

160
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,042
I've got to get her
somewhere isolated.

161
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,442
But where?

162
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:35,676
And what explanation
could I give her?

163
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:38,309
Ah, it would never
work, she's too careful.

164
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:40,876
I need a better approach.

165
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,242
I can do this.

166
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:45,242
I'm going to convince her
to give me her real name.

167
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:48,276
RYUK: [laughs] Hey, Light.

168
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,376
You know, that deal I
mentioned is still open.

169
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,776
It's just like putting
on contact lenses.

170
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,709
Completely painless.

171
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:58,242
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Would I be
willing to give up half my life

172
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:01,476
just so I could learn
this woman's real name?

173
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,309
No, I wouldn't.

174
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,642
In fact, it's not even
worth considering.

175
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:06,842
Now quit wasting my time!

176
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:09,209
Just shut your mouth, shinigami.

177
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:10,409
-Excuse me.

178
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:11,776
-Yes?

179
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:14,176
-Uh, do you still have business
at the police station, then?

180
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:18,909
I'd like to go there by
myself, if you don't mind.

181
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:19,509
-Yeah.

182
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,176
No problem.

183
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,776
SOICHIRO: Our names
and ranks are false.

184
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:26,109
UKIDA: Why did you
give us fake IDs?

185
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:30,442
-As you know, Kira requires
a name and a face to kill.

186
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:33,009
We will confront him with
that premise in mind.

187
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,876
And I think it should
be obvious why.

188
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,376
-Yes, but, of all people, the
police shouldn't use fake IDs.

189
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:39,376
-Enough.

190
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,476
What choice do we
really have, given

191
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,176
the capabilities of our enemy?

192
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,776
As long as you're
working on this case,

193
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:46,709
I think we're going to need
all the protection one can get.

194
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:48,409
It would be foolish
not to use them.

195
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,076
-Yeah, you got a good point.

196
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:51,576
-Uh huh.

197
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:54,004
-Remember, any time you're
in a situation where

198
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,819
you have to give out
your name to a stranger,

199
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:57,919
make sure to use the
name from your fake ID.

200
00:09:57,952 --> 00:09:59,252
Understood?

201
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:01,219
Right, and be careful
not to take them

202
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:03,419
out while in the presence
of other police officers.

203
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,285
I'm sure I don't
need to tell you

204
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:07,785
that could cause
problems for us.

205
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,485
-I understand.

206
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,885
WATARI: Very well, then.

207
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,719
I'd like to request that
you wear these at all times.

208
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:17,019
-Uh, belts?

209
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:19,752
-Each one has a transmitter
hidden in the buckle.

210
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,019
This will allow Ryuzaki to
monitor your whereabouts.

211
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:26,985
And when you press the
buckle twice like this,

212
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,352
my cell phone will ring,
displaying your name.

213
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:31,885
And I'll call you
back immediately,

214
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,185
but you won't see
my number displayed.

215
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:35,752
In the morning,
all of you will go

216
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,785
to the police station as usual.

217
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:40,852
Then, later on in the
day, we'll use this method

218
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:44,319
to confirm the name of Ryuzaki's
hotel and his room number.

219
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,552
Please use this for
emergencies as well.

220
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,452
-No way, this is totally cool!

221
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:50,652
I feel like some kinda secret
agent going after Kira.

222
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:51,852
-Quiet, Matsuda!

223
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,919
This is not the time
to be fooling around.

224
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:55,519
Knock it off!

225
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:57,252
-Yes, sir.

226
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:59,852
-Thank you so much for
everything you've done, Light.

227
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:02,252
After talking to you, I
feel much more confident

228
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,952
about my theory.

229
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:04,819
-Not at all.

230
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:13,352
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Considering
that Ryuk mentioned

231
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:16,152
that eye deal again,
there's no doubt in my mind

232
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:18,019
that she used an alias.

233
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,252
At this rate, once she goes
to the police with her theory

234
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:23,285
about Kira being on
that bus, and they

235
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:25,919
look at all the people Raye
Pember was investigating,

236
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,285
it won't take them
long to zero in on me.

237
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:31,719
-[laughs] Hey, she's leaving.

238
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:33,552
So now what?

239
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:35,452
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): I've
got about five minutes

240
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,819
before that woman gets
to police headquarters.

241
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:38,652
Think.

242
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:39,619
I need her real name.

243
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:41,385
And I don't have
much time to spare.

244
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,844
If this woman makes it
to the police station

245
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:03,577
and someone from the task
force has returned by then,

246
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,577
it'll all be over for me.

247
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,610
I've gotta find
out her real name,

248
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,310
then eliminate her quickly.

249
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:11,577
Only three minutes left until
she reaches the station.

250
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:15,877
All right.

251
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,444
-Oh?

252
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:18,244
Whatcha doing?

253
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:19,077
-Excuse me?

254
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,544
-Yes?

255
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:23,744
-There's something that I
should probably tell you.

256
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,144
-OK.

257
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,110
-The thing is,
it'll be impossible

258
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:30,077
for you to contact anyone
from the task force directly.

259
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,444
-Huh?

260
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:33,944
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): That's right,
keep the conversation going.

261
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:36,144
I just need to find something
that she can latch onto

262
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:37,377
and I've got her.

263
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,577
When she's comfortable, then
I can get her real name.

264
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,544
I can do this.

265
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:42,344
-I can't contact anyone?

266
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,244
But why not?

267
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:44,377
-Didn't you find
it odd that there

268
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,177
was no one at task
force headquarters?

269
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,810
-Uh, yeah.

270
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:50,010
I did find it a bit
strange, but I didn't--

271
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:50,944
-Let me explain.

272
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:52,310
The task force
has been organized

273
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:54,010
so that its members
can't be identified

274
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:57,577
and nobody on the outside
knows who's in charge.

275
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,044
If The member's names
were ever made public

276
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,077
or the structure of the
task force was revealed,

277
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,510
we'd likely see another
tragedy along the lines

278
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:06,444
of the one that claimed
your fiance's life.

279
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:13,610
-I see.

280
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:15,077
-That's why you
were told earlier

281
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,144
that no one was at task
force headquarters.

282
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:19,810
What I'm trying to
say is, you'll never

283
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:22,277
be able to talk to someone
directly from the task force,

284
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,544
because the police
simply won't allow it.

285
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:28,877
-[laughs] That's pretty clever.

286
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,277
I'm impressed.

287
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,011
-If this is supposed
to be a secret,

288
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,711
then how do you know so much?

289
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:36,044
-Guess I spoke too soon.

290
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:36,711
She's sharp.

291
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:40,877
-Very well.

292
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:43,511
You leave me no choice.

293
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:46,211
It's because I'm actually
a member of the task force.

294
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:47,511
-Huh?

295
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:50,077
-I'm sorry, you're telling
me that you're an agent?

296
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:51,144
-Yes.

297
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:52,911
L is currently in
charge of the task force

298
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:54,844
and he's leading
our investigation.

299
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:55,844
-Yes.

300
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,077
To be honest, I
already suspected that.

301
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:01,844
-He was concerned that the task
force had become too small.

302
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:04,077
Many detectives had quit,
fearing for their lives,

303
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:07,577
and so, despite the fact that
I'm a high school student,

304
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:10,244
he brought me on board to help
out with the investigation.

305
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:12,944
After all, I've helped them
solve cases in the past.

306
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,277
-So L trusts you, then?

307
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,211
-I can go to task
force headquarters

308
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:19,244
whenever it suits
me, and I'm allowed

309
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:21,777
to investigate
freely as I see fit.

310
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,644
You see, these
days the task force

311
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:26,144
is made up of a chosen
few, an elite group

312
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:29,044
of people hand-picked
for the job by L. All

313
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,911
are highly skilled, well
respected, and, above all,

314
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:33,177
trustworthy.

315
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:35,911
-Oh.

316
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:38,911
-[laughs]

317
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:47,177
-Thanks for explaining,
but just to be safe,

318
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:49,844
I'd like to try and visit the
task force headquarters again.

319
00:14:49,877 --> 00:14:50,344
-Huh?

320
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:50,844
-Goodbye.

321
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:54,944
-Uh, please.

322
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,677
Wait a second.

323
00:14:56,711 --> 00:15:00,277
It's like I just told you, they
won't let you talk to anyone.

324
00:15:00,311 --> 00:15:02,777
-I know, but-- I was hoping I
could speak with L directly.

325
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,811
-Oh, and come to think of it--
who's at the police station

326
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:11,877
right now?

327
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,344
-Actually, no one's
there at the moment.

328
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:14,944
-That's not good news.

329
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:16,777
We need someone
there at all times.

330
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:18,444
Work in shifts if you have to.

331
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:19,444
-I understand.

332
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:20,511
Aizawa.

333
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,911
I'll put you in charge
of that for today.

334
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:22,877
-Yes sir.

335
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:23,744
I'm on my way.

336
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:25,177
Won't take me long.

337
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,444
-Ms. Maki, please--
wait a second.

338
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:30,411
It's literally impossible to
meet L. This is pointless.

339
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:37,377
-You may be right, but
I think that there's

340
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:39,177
a chance that
he'll meet with me.

341
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:40,311
-Huh?

342
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:41,811
-Although the only
contact I've had with him

343
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:44,077
was following orders
through a computer,

344
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,711
he might remember who I am.

345
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,077
You see, I worked under
him in a case in the US

346
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,444
about two years ago.

347
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:51,077
-Uh, are you serious?

348
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,811
You worked under L?

349
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:56,311
-Yes I didn't tell you this,
but up until three months ago,

350
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:59,011
I worked as an FBI agent.

351
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:00,344
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): This is it.

352
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,111
Finally, something I can use.

353
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:04,544
-Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

354
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:07,511
In fact, I noticed early on
that your investigative skills

355
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:09,511
were far beyond
those of an amateur.

356
00:16:09,544 --> 00:16:10,877
You're very cautious
and you seem

357
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,577
to have a gift for getting
to the heart of the matter.

358
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:15,611
If I could, I'd like
to learn from you.

359
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:18,844
-[laughs] One lie after another.

360
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,511
You make it look easy.

361
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:21,877
-From the beginning,
I knew I had

362
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:23,611
to do things outside
the regular channels

363
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:26,144
because, from my perspective,
both the police and the members

364
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:28,411
of the task force were suspects.

365
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:34,411
But I'm certain that I can
trust L. Maybe it's unrealistic,

366
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:36,377
but I think that if
I go to headquarters

367
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,744
and I give them my name,
there's a chance that they'll

368
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:40,744
let me speak with him directly.

369
00:16:40,777 --> 00:16:42,444
-I see.

370
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,644
But if the only person you
could trust with this info

371
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:47,544
was L, then-- why me?

372
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:50,411
-I suppose I was upset that they
wouldn't allow me to see anyone

373
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,644
from the task force,
and then you came along,

374
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,977
claiming to be the son of
the lead detective -- no,

375
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:56,911
that's not it.

376
00:16:56,944 --> 00:17:00,744
I-- I'll be honest with you.

377
00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:04,811
It's because you
remind me of L. There's

378
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:07,011
something about you
that's just like him.

379
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:18,077
-Will you investigate
this case with me?

380
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:19,677
-Huh?

381
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:22,244
-I want you to come work with
us as part of the task force.

382
00:17:22,277 --> 00:17:24,577
We could use your help.

383
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,144
As I'm sure you know, not
just anyone can do it.

384
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:29,411
Please, I know this is
sudden, but the team

385
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:30,677
needs people like you.

386
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,011
I'm serious.

387
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:34,177
You could be doing so much
more than gathering information

388
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:35,277
on your own.

389
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:37,377
You have all the
experience as an FBI agent.

390
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:39,444
You're more talented than
most of the detectives

391
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,711
currently on the task
force, and L obviously

392
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,277
trusted you in the past.

393
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:45,444
It wouldn't be that
difficult for you to join.

394
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:47,511
All you'd need is some
valid identification,

395
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,077
a recommendation from a
current task force member,

396
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,844
and of course you'd need
to get L's permission.

397
00:17:52,877 --> 00:17:55,077
-You want me to
join the task force?

398
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:57,211
-I can't help but think
that it must be fate

399
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,877
that I met you today.

400
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,744
I'd like to be the
one to recommend you.

401
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:07,144
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

402
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,111
I guess I got a little
bit too excited.

403
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,211
-It's OK.

404
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:12,311
-I mean, even if you
acted as a consultant

405
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:14,644
on this investigation,
it would be a great help.

406
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,177
I'm sure you have personal
obligations to attend to,

407
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:20,211
not to mention the fact that
you live in the United States.

408
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:21,977
-It's true, before
all this happened,

409
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:25,011
I thought I'd continue living
in America with my fiance.

410
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:27,944
We'd planned on getting
married in the spring.

411
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:30,611
But now he's gone, so I'm
not sure what to do anymore.

412
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:32,644
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): All
right, I've come this far.

413
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:35,144
All she needs is a
little encouragement.

414
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:37,044
-But you're young and
beautiful and you've

415
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,177
got your life ahead of you.

416
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:40,311
Why put it all in
danger for this?

417
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:41,644
-No!

418
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:43,611
Now that Raye's gone, I've
got nothing to lose any more.

419
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:44,544
I want to catch Kira.

420
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:46,277
I don't care about
anything else.

421
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:47,477
It's all I want to do.

422
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:50,044
Please, let me investigate
this case with you.

423
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:50,877
-Huh?

424
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:53,711
[unhinged laughing]

425
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,411
-Yes, of course.

426
00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:02,811
I just need to see some
form of identification

427
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,377
before we proceed.

428
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,211
-Oh!

429
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,444
Um--

430
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,477
-Yes?

431
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:08,977
-You see, the name
I gave you earlier,

432
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:12,377
well-- it wasn't
actually my real name.

433
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:15,444
I'm so sorry.

434
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:16,277
-Don't worry.

435
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:17,577
It's all right.

436
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:19,911
To be honest, I'm impressed
by how incredibly thorough

437
00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:21,144
you've been.

438
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:23,144
You've stayed one
step ahead of me.

439
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:24,844
But I suppose that's
just further proof

440
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:26,211
of your capabilities.

441
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:28,844
-So will a Japanese driver's
license do the trick, then?

442
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:29,344
-Sure.

443
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:50,144
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I made it in time.

444
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:09,144
-Uh, so, if you
don't mind my asking,

445
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:11,544
why do you keep
checking your watch?

446
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,711
-Oh.

447
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:20,811
Well, I guess it's
because-- because I'm Kira.

448
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,811
-[gasps]

449
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,511
-What's the matter?

450
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,944
-There's something I have to do.

451
00:20:56,977 --> 00:20:59,677
-Hmm.

452
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:02,777
My father's cellphone
might be available now.

453
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:05,777
Do you want to see if
you can talk to him?

454
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:06,811
-No, thank you.

455
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:09,777
I have nothing to say to him.

456
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,544
-Then goodbye, Naomi Misora.

457
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:40,144
[ending theme song]

458
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,975
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
With Ryuk's information

459
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:01,075
and my preparations, I can
continue to kill criminals

460
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:04,175
while masquerading as a typical
high school student studying

461
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,375
for his entrance exams.

462
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:07,842
Just watch me, L.
