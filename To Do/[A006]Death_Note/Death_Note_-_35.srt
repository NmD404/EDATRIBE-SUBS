[music playing]

3
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:44,321
MALE SPEAKER: Near,
it's all taken care of.

4
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:45,987
I did exactly as you asked.

5
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:47,762
NEAR: Good.

6
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:09,312
-T, that is all I have
to tell you today.

7
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:11,012
We'll talk soon.

8
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:12,746
-Very well, I understand.

9
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:15,246
I also have a message for you.

10
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,079
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes?

11
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,479
What is it?

12
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,946
-I've confirmed it.

13
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,179
[gasp]

14
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,579
[text alert]

15
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:29,146
-Hm?

16
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:31,912
-You got a text?

17
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:34,612
Oh, it says she
wants to see you.

18
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:36,346
Man, I'm so jealous.

19
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,679
Huh?

20
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,446
L (VOICEOVER) : I've done it.

21
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,912
That's the sign of
confirmation from Mikami.

22
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,312
Now all I have to do is
wait for Near to request

23
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:45,712
a meeting face to face.

24
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:47,412
Game over, Near.

25
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:48,746
I win.

26
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,879
I knew what your move would
be from the very beginning.

27
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:54,346
-(ON RADIO) Sir,
this is Giovanni.

28
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,746
I've been checking the Notebook
regularly as you ordered.

29
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:59,146
For the past three days,
he's continued filling out

30
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:02,412
one page every night, after
midnight, as he usually does.

31
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,012
The victims still
match up, and there's

32
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:07,246
been no change in Mikami's
behavior otherwise.

33
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,546
-I understand.

34
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,112
Well, then let's begin.

35
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:12,612
[clock ticking]

36
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:18,979
-Oh!

37
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:20,512
It's Near.

38
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:22,212
-She called.

39
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:23,112
NEAR (ON TELEPHONE): L?

40
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:25,612
-Yes, this is L.
What is it, Near?

41
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,512
NEAR (ON TELEPHONE):
I want to meet you.

42
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:28,879
-What?

43
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,479
NEAR (ON TELEPHONE):
There's something

44
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:33,046
I must show you pertaining
to the Kira case.

45
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,212
-But don't you suspect
me of being Kira?

46
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:38,912
Do you really think it's wise
to reveal your face to me?

47
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:40,246
NEAR (ON TELEPHONE):
That's true.

48
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,046
I cannot show you
unless I reveal my face.

49
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,079
Furthermore, the very
act of showing my face

50
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,979
will prove something.

51
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:49,346
And that will bring
this case to a close.

52
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:51,112
-All right, fine.

53
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:52,546
As far as I'm
concerned, the sooner

54
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,446
you realize you're wrong
about me, the better.

55
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,879
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): The time

56
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:59,479
has finally come for Near
to prove that Light is Kira.

57
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:01,046
But on the other
hand, if that's true,

58
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,412
this will be a chance
for Light to kill Near.

59
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,679
It all comes down to this.

60
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,346
NEAR (ON TELEPHONE):
I'd like to lay out

61
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,146
some ground rules
for the meeting.

62
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:12,079
-We're willing to go along
with whatever you want.

63
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:15,679
-First, I want to have all the
investigators from both teams

64
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:16,912
be present.

65
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:18,979
In other words, everyone
who is chasing after Kira

66
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,612
should be gathered together
to take part in the meeting.

67
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:22,846
L (ON TELEPHONE): I understand.

68
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,312
That's not a problem.

69
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:25,812
NEAR: As I mentioned
before, there

70
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:28,279
are a total of four
members in the SPK.

71
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:29,579
That's including myself.

72
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:31,279
All of us will be there.

73
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:32,779
Besides our team,
we'll also bring

74
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:36,379
along Mr. Mogi, who is
currently staying with us.

75
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:39,546
As for Misa Amane, she will be
released right before we meet.

76
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,779
She'll not be told
where we're going.

77
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,179
You can come and
meet us once you

78
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:45,746
confirm that she's
been safely released.

79
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,279
Is that acceptable?

80
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,012
-What do we do?

81
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:49,846
-Hmm.

82
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,479
-OK, Near.

83
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:51,479
I understand.

84
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,079
I have a team of
five investigators,

85
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,779
including myself.

86
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:56,546
Of course, Mogi's with
you at the moment.

87
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,079
So aside from me, they'll
there'll be only three people.

88
00:06:59,112 --> 00:07:00,879
-Very well, that's fine.

89
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:08,746
Now, as for our meeting
place-- Daikoku Wharf.

90
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,512
There's a warehouse on the
outskirts of the southeast side

91
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,679
that's been abandoned
for some time.

92
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:15,946
It's known as the Yellow Box.

93
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,479
I've already taken the
liberty of purchasing it.

94
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:21,879
If this arrangement is fine
with you, then we'll use it.

95
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:23,746
How about it, Light Yagami?

96
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,412
With a location
like this, you can

97
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,412
do what you're planning to do.

98
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:31,079
One more thing-- This meeting
cannot take place unless I have

99
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:33,346
your word that someone
will bring the Notebook.

100
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:34,212
-Wait.

101
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,646
Why the Notebook?

102
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,946
-It's quite simple.

103
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:39,679
If your entire team
leaves HQ to meet me,

104
00:07:39,712 --> 00:07:42,779
there will be no one left
behind to guard the Notebook.

105
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:46,579
I can promise you this-- I will
make no attempts to steal it.

106
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:48,979
In fact, I won't
even try to touch it.

107
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:51,046
As long as Mr.
Aizawa can confirm

108
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,612
that it's the
genuine Notebook, I'm

109
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,279
willing to place my faith
in you and accept his word.

110
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:56,112
-Huh?

111
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:57,112
All right.

112
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:58,379
NEAR (ON TELEPHONE):
However, I do

113
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,579
insist that someone other
than L hold onto it.

114
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:02,546
My reasons for
making that request

115
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:05,412
should be fairly obvious to you.

116
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:06,679
-Right, I understand.

117
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:08,846
But I'll be the one who
decides who will hold onto it.

118
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,912
Does that sound fair?

119
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:11,412
NEAR (ON TELEPHONE):
Yes, of course.

120
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:14,379
Then all that's left to
arrange is the time and date.

121
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:14,946
-Right.

122
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:15,946
The question is.

123
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,012
What time?

124
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:20,079
-Mikami makes his
judgments after midnight.

125
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,012
He most likely receives
a notice in the morning

126
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:23,912
of which people to kill next.

127
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:28,379
If we take his movements
into consideration,

128
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:33,346
say, three days from
now on the 28th at 1 PM.

129
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,512
L (VOICEOVER): o'clock, huh?

130
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,279
That's the exact time
I expected him to pick.

131
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:40,646
Near is obviously aware
of Mikami's movements.

132
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,646
That's fine by me.

133
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,546
The time doesn't
really concern us.

134
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,379
-Well then, 1 o'clock,
three days from now.

135
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,546
L (ON TELEPHONE): Sure.

136
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,146
Near.

137
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:53,879
NEAR (VOICEOVER): Light Yagami.

138
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,812
BOTH (VOICEOVER): I know
exactly what your plan is,

139
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,912
and I am going to win.

140
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:08,512
-Kiyomi, I'm sorry, but I'm a
little busier than usual today.

141
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:09,612
-Oh, really?

142
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:11,779
Does that mean you can't
stay until morning?

143
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:13,279
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

144
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:15,812
Police are going to have their
hands for the next two or three

145
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,979
days.

146
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:19,879
-That's a shame.

147
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:21,346
Hm?

148
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,012
L (VOICEOVER): I've
already given orders

149
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:26,046
to both Mikami and
Takada about what to do.

150
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:29,212
This will be the final
order to kill Near.

151
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:19,146
[tires squealing]

152
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:22,212
[shouting]

153
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,112
FEMALE SPEAKER: Quick.

154
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:23,912
This way.

155
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:25,379
Are you all right?

156
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:26,379
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.

157
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:27,812
MALE SPEAKER:
They're getting away.

158
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:28,812
After them.

159
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:31,679
-We need to get inside NHN now.

160
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,812
-Don't do it--
take a look around.

161
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:35,746
It's not safe for her here.

162
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,179
Not even inside.

163
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:38,912
-Well--

164
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:41,146
-It's best if you get her
away from here right now.

165
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:44,946
Miss Takada, get on.

166
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,046
Now.

167
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,512
-It's OK, you'll
be safe with him.

168
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:49,546
Please, you have to go.

169
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:50,046
-Right.

170
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:58,079
-Team A and Team B,
stay on that bike's tail

171
00:10:58,112 --> 00:10:59,446
and don't lose sight of them.

172
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:02,212
As for the rest of you, I need
you to find that assailant.

173
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,079
-All right, we've confirmed
Miss Takada's safety.

174
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:16,412
Let's get her into Car number 7.

175
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:25,546
-What the hell?

176
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,746
-No, he's taking her.

177
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,146
Damn it.

178
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:29,912
Stop, you idiot.

179
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:31,346
You can't do that.

180
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:35,046
What if it ends up hitting her?

181
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,012
-Wh-what are you doing?

182
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:02,007
-One of the attackers
was heavily armed.

183
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,540
As of this moment, both
Miss Takada's escort team

184
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:07,073
and the police are hot on
the tail of the suspects.

185
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:07,973
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, man.

186
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:09,340
This is really bad.

187
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:11,240
-Is it Near again?

188
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,373
L (VOICEOVER): Near.

189
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,040
You promised that we'd
meet in three days time.

190
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:16,107
What's the meaning of
making a move like this now?

191
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,073
It doesn't make sense.

192
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:19,207
No, this isn't Near's style.

193
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,040
It's more like--

194
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,040
MALE SPEAKER: It's Near.

195
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:29,007
[shouting]

196
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:45,307
-So those cars got
ahead of me, huh?

197
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,507
How many damn body guards
does one woman need, anyway?

198
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,973
Hey, come on, give me a break.

199
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,707
Since when were the
Japanese allowed

200
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,707
to carry around such big guns?

201
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,807
You got me.

202
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,907
I'm part of this whole
kidnapping incident.

203
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,473
That means you'll have a
lot of questions to ask.

204
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:05,740
You won't shoot.

205
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,140
-What an idiot.

206
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:22,840
He probably wouldn't have
told us anything, anyway.

207
00:13:22,873 --> 00:13:25,607
And death is the only way to
pay for crimes against Kira.

208
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,240
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): This man--

209
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,840
he's the person
that Light warned

210
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:40,907
me to be extra careful
of-- Mello Mihael Keehl.

211
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,173
[shivering]

212
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:12,540
-Take off everything
you're wearing

213
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:14,407
and put it all in that box.

214
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,140
Hurry up.

215
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:23,773
You can use this blanket.

216
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:33,107
NEAR (ON TELEPHONE): L, I am not
the one who kidnapped Takada.

217
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,673
-Is that so?

218
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,240
Then it has to be Mello.

219
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:38,473
-Yes, that's right.

220
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:40,840
And I have to be honest
with you on this--

221
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:43,107
we had one of our
members escorting Takada,

222
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,940
and they confirmed it-- Mello
was the one who abducted her.

223
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:50,140
I apologize for letting
this happen while one of us

224
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,473
was guarding her.

225
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:55,040
-Near, isn't there any way
for you to contact Mello?

226
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:56,707
NEAR (ON TELEPHONE):
No, I'm afraid that

227
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,007
would be impossible.

228
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,840
While I do have a method of
getting in touch with him,

229
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,273
there's no way he'd respond
in the current situation.

230
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:05,873
[sighs]

231
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:08,073
-B-before I take off
the rest, could I

232
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,207
please have the blanket so
I can wrap it around me?

233
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:14,640
-Whatever you want.

234
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,840
-Our latest report is
that the escort team

235
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,673
was forced to shoot one
of the perpetrators.

236
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,673
They are also still
making efforts

237
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:47,373
to track Miss
Takada's whereabouts.

238
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:49,873
-Were you able to
get a hold of her?

239
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,973
-Not yet.

240
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:52,440
Takada's phone has
been turned off.

241
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,707
Mello must have confiscated it.

242
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,640
Damn it.

243
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:57,507
I need to get in
touch with Takada.

244
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,073
With no way of getting a hold
of her, all I can do is wait.

245
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,107
-This is the only
thing that can be done.

246
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,740
If I don't do it--

247
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:37,240
MALE SPEAKER: As for the suspect
who was gunned down earlier,

248
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:39,140
we're still not able
to identify him.

249
00:16:39,173 --> 00:16:41,107
The police are tracking
the remaining suspects

250
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,240
and are currently--

251
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:43,073
MALE SPEAKER: Matt.

252
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:45,007
I never thought you'd be killed.

253
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,940
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,640
[shivering]

255
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:00,940
[heavy breathing]

256
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:02,907
[telephone ringing]

257
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,773
-Light's cell phone.

258
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:04,640
-Could it be her?

259
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:07,107
-Quiet, everyone.

260
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,707
Hello?

261
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,907
TAKADA (ON TELEPHONE): Light?

262
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,307
I--

263
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,373
-Miss Takada?

264
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,007
Listen to me.

265
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,507
Are you all right?

266
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,173
The only reason she'd
be able to call me

267
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:18,607
like this without
getting caught is

268
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,440
if she had an opportunity
to get away from Mello.

269
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,707
Or--

270
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,007
TAKADA (ON TELEPHONE):
Light, Light, please save me.

271
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
-It's all right.

272
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:29,240
Calm down and answer
my questions, OK?

273
00:17:29,273 --> 00:17:31,240
-Oh, OK.

274
00:17:31,273 --> 00:17:33,040
LIGHT (ON TELEPHONE):
First, your location.

275
00:17:33,073 --> 00:17:34,940
Do you know where you are?

276
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:36,107
TAKADA (ON TELEPHONE): N-no.

277
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,140
No, I don't know where I am.

278
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:42,440
I was put into a truck that
was locked from the outside.

279
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:44,073
But we were on
the freeway, and I

280
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:45,440
caught a glimpse
of the sign that

281
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:47,607
said we were heading to Nagano.

282
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,240
Right now, I think we're parked
inside of a building somewhere.

283
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:53,373
-Miss Takada, you are
Kira's spokesperson.

284
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,107
Do you remember
the conversation we

285
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,207
had when I told you that
there might be people who

286
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,340
would try to hurt
you because of that?

287
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:02,173
TAKADA (ON TELEPHONE):
Y-yes, I remember.

288
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,007
-We talked what you should
do if a situation like this

289
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,307
ever arose.

290
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,607
Do you remember that?

291
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,940
-Ah, I remember.

292
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,207
I did what you
told me to, Light.

293
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,840
I did it.

294
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,840
-Yes.

295
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:17,740
TAKADA (ON TELEPHONE):
I didn't struggle, even

296
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:19,140
when he stripped me naked.

297
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:22,107
I did exactly as you
said-- I made survival

298
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,907
my first priority,
and-- and, I did it.

299
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:31,807
Please, Light.

300
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,707
I did everything
that you told me to.

301
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,073
Come quickly.

302
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:37,440
Save me.

303
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:41,140
-Miss Takada, you remember what
I told you to do after that,

304
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:42,973
don't you?

305
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:46,873
-I have to do as many killings
as possible while I still can.

306
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:49,740
I-- I know, but-but Light--

307
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:51,140
-Can you do it?

308
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,040
[whimpering]

309
00:18:57,773 --> 00:18:58,907
-I can do it.

310
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,373
[telephone disconnect]

311
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,807
[weeping]

312
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,740
-Aizawa, Ide, let's get going.

313
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,173
Matsuda, you stay here and
take care of headquarters.

314
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,373
-You got it.

315
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:13,807
[weeping]

316
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,607
TAKADA (ON TELEPHONE): It's me.

317
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,740
Send me as many names of
people to punish as you can.

318
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:28,940
Here's my email address.

319
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:30,073
-Yes, right.

320
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:31,873
I understand.

321
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:33,573
If Takada is calling
me like this,

322
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,273
it must mean that
she's been able to kill

323
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,207
her kidnappers, in which
case, the only certainty

324
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,440
is that she's in a situation
where she can't move.

325
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:46,607
Nakajima, I'm going to the scene
of the crime for this case.

326
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,507
-OK.

327
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,307
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
I got the location

328
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,407
by tracing the call.

329
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,640
Head to Karuizawa by freeway.

330
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:54,940
MALE SPEAKER: Karuizawa, huh?

331
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:56,107
Damn.

332
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,240
It'll take at least 30
minutes to get there.

333
00:19:57,273 --> 00:19:58,373
MALE SPEAKER: Well, hurry.

334
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,940
This is Mello we're
talking about.

335
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:01,307
Who knows what he'll do?

336
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,781
-Got it.

337
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,148
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I don't believe

338
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:09,881
this-- Aizawa and Ide
are just too stupid.

339
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:11,814
They jumped the gun and
got in the front seats

340
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:12,748
without even thinking.

341
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:14,681
This is just too easy.

342
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:04,114
-Ah, no-- Mello.

343
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:05,448
-What the hell is this?

344
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:16,414

Looks like this

350
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,193
is the end-- no, more
like the beginning--

00:22:56,227 --> 00:22:58,360
the perfect world of Kira.

And those who know of the
Notebook's existence--

00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:04,093
all of them will die.
