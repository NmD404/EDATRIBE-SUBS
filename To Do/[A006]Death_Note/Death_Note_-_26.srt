1
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:13,833
[theme music]

2
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:38,800
-Huh?

3
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:40,300
-What is this?

4
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:44,300
[groaning]

5
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,645
-Everyone, the Shiniga--

6
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:18,512
L: Now, try to kill me.

7
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:20,712
Although this was announced
as a worldwide broadcast,

8
00:02:20,745 --> 00:02:23,178
the truth is we are
only broadcasting

9
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:25,945
in the Kanto region of Japan.

10
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:28,178
In actuality, the
fist of your victims

11
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:29,812
was a suspect in Shinjuku.

12
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:33,578
Furthermore, his crime was only
ever reported inside Japan.

13
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,212
I used that information
to deduce this much.

14
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:40,345
You are in Japan, and your
first victim was little more

15
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:42,378
than an experiment,
which means that you

16
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,312
haven't been killing
for very long.

17
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:49,845
Kira has found a way to obtain
information from the task force

18
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,912
headquarters.

19
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,645
There are 141 people
in the police force

20
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:55,378
who have acces to classified
information regarding

21
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:56,878
the investigation.

22
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:59,978
I am sure that somewhere in
this list of police officers,

23
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:03,678
and the people closest to
them, we will find our suspect.

24
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:14,712
On December 14th, 12 FBI
investigators entered Japan.

25
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:17,412
Here are are on December 19th.

26
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:20,445
Using prison inmates,
Kira conducts experiments

27
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:23,578
manipulating his victim's
actions before they die.

28
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:26,878
He needed to know how much
control he had over his victims

29
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:30,312
before he could use it
against the 12 agents.

30
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:33,678
I suspect Kira had to be one of
the people being investigated

31
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:38,112
by the FBI between the 14th
and the 19th of December.

32
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:39,978
In fact, I have no doubt.

33
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:48,912
Raye Penber's fiance?

34
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:51,345
Naomi Misora.

35
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:52,345
So it's her.

36
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:54,112
She was working under me.

37
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:57,412
I guess she must have come
to Japan with her fiance.

38
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,445
I heard she was
seen with Penber.

39
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:03,212
It's possible that she
may have found a lead.

40
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:06,478
If that's the case, did Kira
manage to get to her first?

41
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:18,645
Everyone, at this point I'd
like to focus our investigation

42
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:21,578
on only those people who
Raye Penber was tailing.

43
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,845
There are two groups.

44
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:26,112
Deputy Director
Kitamura, as well as

45
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:29,212
Detective Superintendent
Yagami and their families.

46
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:33,045
At this stage I'd like to
place wiretaps and surveillance

47
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:35,045
cameras in both households.

48
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:36,845
-That's my son
you're talking about.

49
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:39,478
-Are you honestly telling
me that you suspect him?

50
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,745
-I do suspect him.

51
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:53,945
I want to you, I'm
L. Relax, Light.

52
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:56,078
While it's try that
Kira hates losing,

53
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:59,312
it's also true that most people
would rather win than lose.

54
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:01,178
It's human nature.

55
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:02,645
Look at that.

56
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,545
He's going for the win.

57
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:08,212
I suspect that you, Light
Yagami, are in fact Kira.

58
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:13,678
-You think I'm Kira?

59
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:16,612
Ryuga, what would
it take to get you

60
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:18,412
to believe that I'm not Kira?

61
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,812
Please, isn't there something?

62
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:22,412
-If you are not Kira, that
truth will be revealed.

63
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:24,145
Just let things
run their course.

64
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:32,345
-Four days ago--

65
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:34,545
-Our audience rating
should go up 60%-- no,

66
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:36,378
more like 70%
percent after this.

67
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:38,478
NEWSCASTER: --contained a
prediction of two deaths,

68
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,078
proving that he is Kira.

69
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:42,278
We understand that the second
tape contains a message

70
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:44,045
to all people of the world.

71
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,212
DISTORTED VOICE: I am Kira.

72
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,145
The news anchor,
Mr. Kazuhiko Hibima,

73
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:50,512
will die of a heart
attack at exactly 6:00.

74
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:51,945
-Stop this broadcast!

75
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,412
We can't let him finish!

76
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:55,378
You idiots!

77
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:01,478
-You told us that Kira
couldn't kill without a name!

78
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:02,845
L: But from what
we've just seen,

79
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:04,612
I'd say it's not
entirely impossible

80
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:07,278
that Kira can kill
with only a face.

81
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:11,612
-This is the police.

82
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,745
Stop this broadcast now!

83
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:16,912
L: There's a strong possibility
that this Kira's a fake.

84
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:20,712
No, we should think of
him more as a second Kira.

85
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:23,478
Mr. Yagami, I'd
like your permission

86
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:27,212
to ask your son to cooperate
with us on this investigation.

87
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:29,778
-At the very least,
I'd say this isn't

88
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:31,778
the Kira we're familiar with.

89
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:35,145
-That's almost exactly how
L-- I mean, Ryuzaki said it.

90
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:36,545
DISTORTED VOICE:
When we meet, we

91
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:38,078
can confirm our
identities by showing

92
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:39,878
our Shinigami to each other.

93
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:42,945
[scream]

94
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:45,412
L: If there's a message
here written in some code

95
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:49,278
that only people who have this
Shinigami power can understand,

96
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:51,878
there'd no way for
me to decipher it.

97
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,445
Still, it would only
make sense for us

98
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:54,912
to look into all
of the places that

99
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:56,612
were mentioned in the journal.

100
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:58,178
When you two are
working together,

101
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,178
I want you to keep a close
eye on Light the entire time.

102
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,378
It's only a slim chance,
but if Light is Kira,

103
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:05,645
then there's still a
possibility that the second Kira

104
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,445
may try to contact him somehow.

105
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:11,045
Also, Mr Yagami, please ask Mr.
Mogi to start following Light,

106
00:07:11,078 --> 00:07:13,378
so he can keep tabs
on what he's doing.

107
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:18,512
-Light, there you are.

108
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:19,478
Hi there.

109
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,212
I'm Light's
girlfriend, Misa Amane.

110
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:22,412
Nice to meet you.

111
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:23,578
-I'm Hideki Ryuga.

112
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:24,178
-Huh?

113
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:25,712
Hideki Ryuga?

114
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,512
-I'm not exactly sure
how you'll take this,

115
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:29,012
but regarding Misa
Amane, there's

116
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:30,078
something you should know.

117
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,278
We've taken her into
custody under suspicion

118
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:34,112
of her being the second Kira.

119
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:36,345
We gathered physical evidence
from the envelope sent

120
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:39,278
by the second Kira, and
particular hairs and fibers

121
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:41,478
used in the masking
tape used to seal them.

122
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:43,312
They matched what we
found in Misa's room.

123
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:48,878
CHIEF YAGAMI: Ryuzaki,
what's the meaning of this?

124
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:51,078
-Now hurry up and kill me!

125
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:53,578
If you wanted to, you could
kill me right now, couldn't you?

126
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:55,778
L: Does this mean you admit
to being the second Kira?

127
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:57,478
Is this the reason
you wish to die?

128
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:58,612
-No.

129
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,412
I don't know anything
about the second Kira.

130
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:07,145
-Ryuzaki, like I said over
the phone, I could be Kira.

131
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:10,112
-Why come here to announce
that you could be Kira?

132
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:10,912
It's an act.

133
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,712
There's no could be about it.

134
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:14,845
You are Kira.

135
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:16,912
Light, are you feeling OK?

136
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:18,245
-Yeah.

137
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,178
I know I must look pretty
bad in here, but this useless

138
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:25,845
pride-- I suppose I'll
have to get rid of it.

139
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:28,612
Ryuzaki, I realize that
I was the one pushing

140
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:31,378
for confinement, and that
I asked you put me in here,

141
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,312
but this whole thing's
completely pointless.

142
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,612
I'm not Kira.

143
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:36,178
You have to get me out of here!

144
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,578
-I just heard.

145
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:39,878
Two weeks' worth of criminals
were just murdered all at once.

146
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:41,778
It happened yesterday.

147
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,178
-I don't understand
what's going on here.

148
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:49,378
-I'm not sure how much more
of this the three of them

149
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:50,778
can take.

150
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:53,145
-Ryuzaki, you have no reason to
keep Light locked up anymore.

151
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:54,645
It's already been 50 days.

152
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,578
-I'm going to kill you
here, and then kill myself.

153
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:01,412
-What?

154
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:02,478
What are you talking about, Dad?

155
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,678
You can't, that's crazy!

156
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:04,812
-How can you even say that?

157
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:05,478
-It's too late.

158
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,312
-Please, don't, Dad!

159
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,245
I'm not Kira!

160
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,745
-Light, my son-- from
one murderer to another--

161
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:12,445
-No, Dad!

162
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:14,745
-I'll see you in hell.

163
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:15,245
-No!

164
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,212
Stop it!

165
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:17,178
[gunshot]

166
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:24,678
L: It was a convincing
performance.

167
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:27,345
As we discussed, I will end
their confinement immediately.

168
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:30,978
As for your part in
this agreement, Light,

169
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:34,245
you and I will be
together 24/7, and that's

170
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:36,978
how it will remain until
we've brought Kira to justice.

171
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:45,645
LIGHT: Their deaths have all
worked in Yotsuba's favor.

172
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:48,312
Looking back, there have
been 13 similar deaths

173
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:49,512
in the past three months.

174
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,445
L: Is Kira someone from Yotsuba?

175
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:54,012
Or is Kira simply using Yotsuba?

176
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,845
I haven't figured that
out yet, but we'll

177
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:59,612
proceed under the assumption
that this is Kira's doing.

178
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,445
We will focus on Yotsuba.

179
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:03,212
Please be sure not
to act impulsively,

180
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:05,512
out of panic or haste.

181
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:07,312
And don't take matters
into your own hands.

182
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,278
-I'm an agent with
Yoshida Productions.

183
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:10,812
Would you be interested
in using Misa

184
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,978
Amane as your new spokesperson?

185
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,278
Ryuzaki, are you watching this?

186
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,312
The eight men who came
here were having a meeting

187
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:18,312
to decide who they get
Kira to kill for them.

188
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:19,878
L: If Matsuda dies,
our suspicions

189
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,945
about the Yotsuba group
would be confirmed

190
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:23,512
MATSUDA: Do you think
there's anything

191
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:24,578
I can do to save myself?

192
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:27,170
MAN: Matsuda, you idiot.

193
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,845
-Good luck, Misa Misa!

194
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:34,612
I'll be here ready to celebrate
when they decide to hire you!

195
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:37,245
-It's always been my dream
to become Kira's wife.

196
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,478
I know he'll need me by
his side And you know why?

197
00:10:41,512 --> 00:10:44,378
Because I'm the second Kira.

198
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:46,512
-Well, since I
happen to be Kira,

199
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,678
does that mean you'll
marry me, Misa?

200
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:52,678
-So, based on what he
said, Higuchi is Kira.

201
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:53,945
-So, what are you doing to do?

202
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,412
-I'm going to trick
Higuchi secret Sakura TV.

203
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:58,012
-Like a hidden camera show!

204
00:10:58,045 --> 00:10:59,345
-Higuchi, we've got a problem.

205
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:01,012
Turn on the television.

206
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:02,245
-Huh?

207
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:04,745
-So you're saying one of
those people is Kira, right?

208
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:05,878
-Yes.

209
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:09,178
I've got a lot of
evidence to prove it, too.

210
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:10,512
-It's-- it's him!

211
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,545
Why is he still alive?

212
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:16,812
-I see Higuchi.

213
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,578
I'm in pursuit.

214
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,712
-We're heading after him.

215
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:24,745
[siren]

216
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:25,978
POLICE OFFICER:
You in the red car!

217
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:27,678
Pull over to the
side of the road.

218
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:28,878
Now!

219
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:29,778
HIGUCHI: Rem.

220
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:31,112
Let's make the deal.

221
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:32,145
-A deal?

222
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:33,778
-You were speeding.

223
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:35,312
License, please?

224
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:35,878
-Yeah.

225
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:36,345
No problem.

226
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:40,245
-Hey!

227
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:41,712
-Higuchi ditched the cop.

228
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:42,645
He's driving away.

229
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:44,145
This is Traffic Control--

230
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:48,078
-Everyone!

231
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:50,812
It's too dangerous to allow
further action by Higuchi.

232
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:52,145
Let's bring him in.

233
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,112
I believe he has the same
powers as the second Kira.

234
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:58,045
He is able to kill just by
looking at someone's face.

235
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:00,978
Please keep this in mind when
you move in to arrest him.

236
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,678
-Stop right there.

237
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:09,778
-Stay back!

238
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,612
Stay back or I'll
shoot, I swear!

239
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:12,112
Ah!

240
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:17,912
L: Higuchi, how were
you able to kill people?

241
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,878
-You probably won't
believe me, but I've

242
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:21,245
got a special notebook.

243
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:23,678
If I write someone's name in it
while thinking of their face,

244
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,078
that person dies.

245
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,812
-It was in one of the
compartments of Higuchi's bag.

246
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:30,045
[scream]

247
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,112
L: What is it, Mr. Yagami?

248
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:33,445
-It's a monster!

249
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:40,545
-A Shinigami.

250
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:42,645
There have to be two notebooks.

251
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,945
Possibly more.

252
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:44,878
This isn't over yet.

253
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,412
-How to use it.

254
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:53,478
It says the human whose name
is written in this notebook

255
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,412
shall die.

256
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:58,745
And then there's this last rule.

257
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,478
According to this, if
the person using the note

258
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:03,912
fails to consecutively
write names

259
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:06,245
of people to be killed
within 13 dayf--

260
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:10,012
-Of each other, then
the user will die.

261
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:13,445
Light Yagami and Misa
Amane are both still alive.

262
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,912
13 days.

263
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:16,912
That's the only problem.

264
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:25,312
The following is
the record which

265
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:28,145
contains everything I have
investigated on the Kira

266
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:30,045
incident.

267
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,412
That fact that now you
are reading this message

268
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,812
means I am no longer
alive at this moment.

269
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:42,145
I hereby leave this record
as my firm achievement.

270
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:42,712
That is all.

271
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:51,612
[beep]

272
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:14,390
MATSUDA: It's been 10 days
since Ryuzaki's funeral.

273
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:17,656
Look like we're not
gonna die after all.

274
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,723
-We know Watari's
true identity now,

275
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:22,590
but we never found out anything
about who Ryuzaki really was.

276
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:23,723
-Yeah, that's true.

277
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,390
Who could have guessed
that Watari was actually

278
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:27,090
a famous inventor?

279
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:29,023
-The paper says he
founded orphanages

280
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:30,823
around the world
using the fortune he

281
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:32,523
inherited from his patents.

282
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:33,523
-He was a fine man.

283
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:34,890
A hero.

284
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:36,523
-But it doesn't help us now.

285
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,823
We can't continue
investigating using this place

286
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:41,156
as our base with
L and Watari gone.

287
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,023
This is tough.

288
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,390
CHIEF YAGAMI: Light,
how's it going?

289
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:47,423
-I should be able to
transfer the system and most

290
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:49,856
of the information out
of here by tonight.

291
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,990
It's weird, though.

292
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,390
I almost feel as
if I'm stealing.

293
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:55,723
I've created a voice filter
identical to the one reason

294
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,123
Ryuzaki used.

295
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,890
We can use it to make the
police think he's still alive,

296
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:00,990
and give them orders like
we've been doing so far.

297
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:04,190
But who is going to
take the place of L?

298
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:06,323
Where will he work
from, and what will we

299
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:07,590
do with the notebook?

300
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:08,556
-Come on.

301
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,790
What are you talking
about, Light?

302
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,590
You're the only one who
can take on the role of L.

303
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:15,323
-Huh?

304
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:16,590
I don't know.

305
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:19,590
Ryuzaki was killed by Kira
because he challenged him.

306
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:21,790
That's not something
I'm eager to do.

307
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:24,990
Besides, I would be fooling
the people of the world.

308
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:26,990
-I can understand how you
feel, but you're really

309
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:28,823
the only one of us
who can do this.

310
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:29,723
-That's right.

311
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:31,590
Even Ryuzaki said so himself.

312
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:36,256
You would be capable
of succeeding L.

313
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,790
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Just as I thought.

314
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:39,090
It's too simple.

315
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:42,590
It's no fun without
Ryuzaki here.

316
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:43,756
I understand.

317
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,623
All right, I'll do it.

318
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:49,356
But I won't be like Ryuzaki.

319
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,156
I won't take big risks like
challenging Kira directly

320
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,090
to gather clues.

321
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:54,456
it's just not me.

322
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,523
-Yeah.

323
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,856
It's probably better
if we play it safe.

324
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,490
Ryuzaki may have been a
little too confrontational.

325
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:03,790
-In that case, I'll be able to
do the same sort of work using

326
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:05,756
both this computer and my own.

327
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,423
In fact, it'll be
possible for me

328
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:10,290
to act as L in the
comfort of my own room.

329
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:12,690
I can be Watari, as well.

330
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:16,790
But it'll be difficult to pull
off with Mom and Sayu around.

331
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:18,156
Things would be
easier if I could

332
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,823
rent a one bedroom apartment.

333
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:21,956
-Well, considering
your age, it certainly

334
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,323
wouldn't look odd to anyone if
I let you move out on your own.

335
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:26,590
-Hey, yeah.

336
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,923
And then we'll be able to
use Light's new apartment

337
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:29,323
as our task force headquarters.

338
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,323
That's a great idea.

339
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,423
[sigh]

340
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:32,890
-All that's left
to figure out now

341
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:34,556
is what to do with the notebook.

342
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,923
LIGHT: It's really
not that difficult.

343
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,523
There's five of us here.

344
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:40,656
And we know none of us
will ever use the notebook.

345
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,956
We'll just have one of us
take it and hide it somewhere

346
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,356
where no one else
could ever get to it.

347
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,290
-Please, Chief.

348
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:48,856
It's got to be you.

349
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,890
-Uh, yeah, Chief.

350
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:51,223
We can count on you.

351
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:54,156
You're a pillar of
justice, after all.

352
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,290
-You want me to-- all right.

353
00:16:58,323 --> 00:17:01,223
-We'll avenge Ryuzaki together.

354
00:17:01,256 --> 00:17:02,123
-Yeah.

355
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,890
Kira is still out
there somewhere.

356
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:04,556
We'll catch him.

357
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,823
That's a promise.

358
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:08,656
-Well then, why don't
we have a little party

359
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,556
to celebrate Light
becoming L number two?

360
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,723
AIZAWA: Quit fooling around.

361
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:13,690
Now's not the time
for stuff like that.

362
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,123
CHIEF YAGAMI:
Let's take it easy.

363
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:23,390
-Light.

364
00:17:23,423 --> 00:17:25,790
This is our first
date in forever.

365
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:28,156
Can't you enjoy
yourself a little more?

366
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:35,556
-Misa, let's move in together.

367
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,756
[gasp]

368
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,990
-Do you mean it?

369
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:39,790
-Yeah.

370
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,790
I've already rented a place.

371
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:43,690
-Yay!

372
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:45,056
Victory is mine!

373
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,090
Misa wins!

374
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:48,023
-Victory?

375
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:49,823
Over Kiyomi, and Mari, and Yuri.

376
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:51,223
But it's all right now.

377
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:52,323
Don't worry.

378
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:53,823
I knew you were just
using those other girls

379
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,856
to trick L. You
don't have any reason

380
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,556
to see them anymore, right?

381
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,123
LIGHT: Right.

382
00:18:07,223 --> 00:18:08,123
-Hey.

383
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:09,556
Now that L's dead,
does that mean

384
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,323
you've finally settled
the score with him?

385
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:13,590
-Yeah.

386
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,223
-So in that case,
I guess things are

387
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:16,990
gonna get pretty
boring from now on.

388
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:21,823
-That's not true, Ryuk.

389
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:22,956
-Huh?

390
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,523
-From this moment
on, I'll show you

391
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:29,923
the creation of the new world.

392
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:30,423
-Ah!

393
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:30,323
[groan]

394
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:42,297
-Daddy!

395
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:47,764
Daddy?

396
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:57,697
-Hm?

397
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,664
-This will be the
rebirth of Yotsuba.

398
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:00,364
-Yeah.

399
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:01,731
It's a new start.

400
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:02,664
Huh?

401
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:04,764
Hey-- Namikawa!

402
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:07,331
What's wrong?

403
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:08,264
That's impossible--

404
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:18,031
MAN: In April 2012,
Light Yagami, age 23,

405
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:20,064
joined Japan's
National Police Agency.

406
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:23,331
In the summer of
2012, Kira's killings

407
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:25,397
increased at an
unprecedented rate.

408
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:28,431
Numerous people around the
world were terrified of Kira,

409
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:31,564
and yet, there were just
as many cheering him on.

410
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,564
Gradually their private
thoughts became public opinion,

411
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:39,031
and soon, certain nations began
to accept Kira's judgement.

412
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:41,497
The world was heading
into a dark age

413
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,997
in which Kira's will
was the only law.

414
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:54,431
[beeping]

415
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:23,664
MELLO: What is it, Roger?

416
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:30,631
-It's L. He's dead.

417
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:42,531
[theme music]

418
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,583
MELLO: L's death?

419
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:52,916
Where'd they hear it from?

420
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,850
Who told them?

421
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:55,850
Who is this guy?

422
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:58,116
Is he joking?

423
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,050
What's with this
strange feeling?
