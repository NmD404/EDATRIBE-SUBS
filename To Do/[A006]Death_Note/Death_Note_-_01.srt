00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:21,458

No hard feelings, right?

10
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,458
Hey there, Ryuk, would
it kill you to join us?

11
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:28,558
You should come play
with us for a change.

12
00:02:31,558 --> 00:02:33,258
-No, I'll pass.

anything wrong.

you still with us?

00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:49,358
Can you please translate
the following sentence

20
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:50,858
into English?

00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:05,825
FEMALE REPORTER (ON TV):
Today, at approximately 11:00

26
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:08,692
AM, a 32-year-old
man was found stabbed

to death in his apartment in

29
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:15,658
Kanagawa police are treating
this case as homicide.

MALE REPORTER (ON
TV): In other news.

31
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:19,592
Today, suspected
murderer, Naoki Tokuji

32
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,325
was arrested in the
district of Shibuya, Tokyo.

33
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:24,958
He is being held in custody,
facing murder charges

34
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:27,025
for the brutal slaying of
his common-law partner,

35
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:32,358
who was only 25 at
the time of her death.

Day in and day out,

37
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:39,458
the same news on
permanent repeat.

38
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:43,525
RYUK (VOICEOVER): This
is all so ridiculous.

39
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,092
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
This world is--

00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,658
LIGHT AND RYUK
(VOICEOVER): --rotten.

41
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:52,658
TEACHER: Another
noticeable consequence

42
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:55,625
is the extinction of many
species on the planet.

43
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:56,158
-No way.

44
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:57,392
You paged--

45
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,225
TEACHER: Species are now
becoming extinct at a faster

46
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:01,858
rate than has ever occurred
in our record history.

LIGHT (VOICEOVER): "Death Note"?

49
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:41,758
As in a notebook of death?

50
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:42,258
Hm.

51
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:46,592
"How to use it.

52
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:52,058
The human whose name is written
in this notebook shall die."

00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:52,558
Hm.

54
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:58,892
It's pretty lame, not
to mention twisted.

55
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,425
It's really not that different
from one of those chain letter

56
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,792
you get.

57
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:06,225
"The human whose name is written
in this notebook shall die"?

58
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:09,158
Come on.

[train whistle]

60
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:18,292
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): There must
be something wrong with me

61
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:19,158
to even consider it.

62
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,558
"This note will not take
effect unless the writer has

63
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,825
the person's face in their mind
when writing his or her name.

64
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:32,992
Therefore, people sharing the
same name will not be affected.

65
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:35,692
If the cause of death is written
within 40 seconds of writing

66
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:38,525
the person's name,
it will happen.

67
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,392
If the cause of death
is not specified,

68
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:43,292
the person will simply
die of a heart attack.

69
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:45,558
After writing the cause of
death, details of the death

70
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:49,858
should be written in the next
6 minutes and 40 seconds."

71
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:50,958
-Hm.

72
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:52,292
So depending on the
person you have in mind,

73
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:55,125
you can either kill them
easily or painfully, huh?

74
00:05:55,158 --> 00:06:00,125
This is pretty detailed for
a prank, I'll give them that.

75
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:01,558
[sighs]

76
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:09,125
So I write a name
and that person dies.

77
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:11,125
Like anyone would believe that.

78
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:30,292
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Wait, on the
off chance someone really dies,

79
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,792
would that make me a murderer?

80
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,392
Hm, yeah, right, it's
completely impossible.

81
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:38,092
MALE REPORTER (ON TV):
The same assailant

82
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,258
who attacked six people
at a busy shopping

83
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:42,358

yesterday has struck again,

84
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:45,158
taking eight people hostage
at this daycare center.

85
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,758
His captives include both
children and teachers.

identified the suspect

as 42-year-old Kurou Otoharada,
currently unemployed.

00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:55,358
We expect negotiations
to begin immediately.

heart attack in 40 seconds,

90
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:04,758
we'll see.

At the present time,

92
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,058
that's all the police
are telling us.

FEMALE REPORTER (ON

94
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:11,058
but feel concerned for the
safety of those hostages.

95
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:12,992
MALE REPORTER (ON TV):
You're absolutely right.

96

the situation from here.

00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:16,725

this, Mr. Hashimoto?

HASHIMOTO (ON TV):
Well, one can only

100
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:24,325
hope for a quick resolution
to this situation.

101
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:26,658
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Looks like
the notebook doesn't work.

102
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:29,692
Oh, well, I didn't
expect it to anyway.

103
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:32,158
FEMALE REPORTER (ON TV): Wait,
we're seeing something here.

104
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:34,025
Looks like movement
at the front entrance.

105
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:35,725
MALE REPORTER (ON TV): The
hostages are coming out.

106
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:37,192
And they all looked
to be unharmed.

107
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:39,025
The Special Forces
are taking action.

108
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,258
They're moving in.

109
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,425
We don't know if the
suspect's been arrested.

110
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:42,892
Huh?

111
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:43,758
Yes?

112
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,792
OK, we now have confirmation.

113
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,425
The suspect has been
found dead inside.

115
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:50,325
MALE REPORTER (ON TV): I
repeat, the suspect is now dead.

116
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:50,825
-Dead?

117
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,592
MALE REPORTER (ON TV):
The Special Forces

118
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,792
are denying allegations
that they shot the suspect.

119
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:58,358
FEMALE REPORTER (ON
TV): So it's quite

120
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:01,158
possible he was feeling cornered
and decided to commit suicide?

121
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:02,292
MALE REPORTER (ON
TV): Well, according

122
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:03,292
to statements from the
hostages, the suspect

123
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,392
has suddenly collapsed.

124
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:06,758
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
A heart attack?

125
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:11,292
No way.

126
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,858
It's coincidence.

127
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,025
This has to be a coincidence.

128
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:15,825
SACHIKO: Light!

129
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,192
-[gasps]

130
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,025
-It's already 6:30, you know?

131
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:21,492
Don't you have cram
school tonight?

132
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:24,792
-Yeah, I'll be
ready in just a sec.

133
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:27,025
Death Note.

134
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:30,192
It's unlikely, but if by
chance this thing is for real--

135
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:32,058
I have to test it one more time.

136
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:35,292
In which case, it should
probably be another criminal.

137
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:38,425
But if he's too well known,
that could be a problem.

138
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:41,414
If he dies, there's
a good possibility

139
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,947
that news of his death
will be covered up.

140
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,881
I need to see
results right away.

141
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:48,881
-Hey, Ryo, buddy.

142
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:50,147
-What is it, Sudo?

143
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,714
-Didn't you want to lend me $20?

144
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:53,814
-Hm, huh, again?

145
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:55,147
But I can't do that.

146
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:58,147
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Sudo, maybe
I should try killing him.

147
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:02,181
No, I should definitely
avoid killing people I know.

148
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:05,647
And again, does it
even really matter?

149
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,481
I mean, would anyone
really care if a guy

150
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,147
like him was to
disappear one day?

151
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:13,281
-Sweet!

152
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:15,147
Looks like we'll be hanging
at the arcade after school.

153
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,247
-[snickers]

154
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:17,647
-We're having a speed
dating party tomorrow,

155
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:18,614
you want to come?

156
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:19,647
-Yeah, of course.

157
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,181
-Oh, there's no way
I'm missing that.

158
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:21,981
-Damn it!

159
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:23,847
Why is my mother so useless?

160
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:26,714
She's never here to
pick me up on time!

161
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:29,614
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Once you
actually start looking around,

162
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:32,314
it makes you wonder if you'd
be doing society a favor

163
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:36,214
by getting rid of
all these people.

164
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,568
-Hey, baby, where are you going?

165
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,801
Come have a little fun with us!

166
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:42,901
-That's our Takuo for you.

167
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:45,101
This guy could spot
a hottie a mile away.

168
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,272
-What's up, little lady?

169
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:48,539
The name is Takuo Shibuimaru.

170
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:49,772
What do you say?

171
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:52,272
Come hang out with
us, pretty lady!

172
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:54,106
-Please, I don't
want any trouble.

173
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:54,972
-You hear that?

174
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,039
She doesn't want trouble.

175
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,906
THUG: Whoo, isn't that cute?

176
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:59,839
Ha-ha!

177
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:00,806
-Ungh.

178
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:01,772
Agh.

179
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:02,872
No!

180
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,606
-Let's go, boys, strip
her down right here.

181
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,439
-Wha-- are you sure?

182
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:05,939
-Ha-ha-ha!

183
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,906
-No, stop!

184
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:09,639
Please!

185
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:10,939
Help me!

186
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:19,372
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Now, what will happen?

187
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:19,872
-No!

188
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:21,339
No!

189
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,839
-Hey, wait up!

190
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,772
-Takuo, look out!

191
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:28,739
[crash]

192
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:30,239
[woman screams]

193
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:33,206
RYUK (VOICEOVER): That,
uh, that settles it.

194
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:36,772
The Death Note, it's for real.

195
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:38,106
THUG: Oh, man, Takuo!

196
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,006
MAN: Stupid kid.

197
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,872
He just came out of nowhere.

198
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:41,372
Aargh!

199
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,839
RYUK (VOICEOVER): Now
then, I better get going.

200
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,464
It's been five days.

201
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:09,697
Now then, I better get going.

202
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:10,597
-Ah?

203
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:12,997
You headed somewhere, Ryuk?

204
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:15,297
-Hate to tell you, but our
whole world looks like this.

205
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:17,497
[chuckles]

206
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:18,331
-That's true.

207
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:20,097
But I've dropped my Death Note.

208
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:21,697
[laughter]

209
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,964
-You really messed
things up, didn't you?

210
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:25,331
-Hold on a sec.

211
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:28,197
Didn't you already trick the
Old Man to get a second book?

212
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,297
Don't tell me you
dropped both of them?

213
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:33,231
-You must have some idea
where you dropped the thing?

214
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:35,531
RYUK: Yeah, the human world.

215
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:36,231
SHINIGAMIS: What?

216
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:57,197
[whooshing]

217
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,197
SACHIKO: What a nice surprise!

218
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:09,431
I wasn't expecting
you home so early.

219
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:11,197
-Yeah.

220
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,131
Hi, Mom.

221
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,897
It's because, uh, huh?

222
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:18,797
Oh, the results of
the nationwide exams.

223
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:21,331
-I've been waiting all day.

224
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,797
-Here.

225
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:23,497
-Goodness!

226
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:24,997
Number 1 again!

227
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,031
These are the highest
scores you've had.

228
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:27,964
LIGHT: Yeah, I guess.

229
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,197
I'm going to study in my room.

230
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:30,997
So please don't
interrupt me, OK?

231
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:32,631
-As you wish.

232
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:35,664
Oh, Light, do you want
anything at all, dear?

233
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:37,231
You can ask for
whatever you like.

234
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:38,631
-No, I'm fine, Mom.

235
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:39,231
Thanks, though.

236
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:43,864
I've already got what I want.

237
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:52,997
[chuckles softly]

238
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:03,864
[maniacal laughter]

239
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,997
SPEAKER: You've taken
quite a liking to it.

240
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:07,897
[thunderclap]

241
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,764
-Aah!

242
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:13,097
[gasping]

243
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:15,597
-No reason to act surprised.

244
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:17,664
I am the Shinigami Ryuk.

245
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,064
That used to be my notebook.

246
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:22,297
Judging by your
laughter, you've already

247
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,631
figured out that what you
have is no ordinary notebook.

248
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:36,964
-Shinigami, a god of death, huh?

249
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:38,564
Well, I'm not surprised.

250
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:45,497
In fact, Ryuk, I've
been waiting for you.

251
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:46,931
-Oh?

252
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:48,731
-I've already figured
out that this Death

253
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:50,364
Note I found is real.

254
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,931
It didn't take me long.

255
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,564
And now that I've witnessed
the proof of its power,

256
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:58,297
I only feel more confident
in what I'm going to do.

257
00:13:58,331 --> 00:13:59,864
-That's interesting.

258
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:02,531
I certainly wasn't
expecting this.

259
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:04,331
Several Death Notes
have made their way

260
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:06,131
into the human
world in the past,

261
00:14:06,164 --> 00:14:09,431
but you're the first to have
written this many names.

262
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:12,997
Look at how many people you've
killed in only five days.

263
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:16,131
Most are reluctant
to write this much.

264
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:18,364
-I've already
prepared myself, Ryuk.

265
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,697
I used the notebook
even though I

266
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:21,297
knew it belonged to a Shinigami.

267
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:23,997
And now, that
Shinigami has come.

268
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,797
So what will happen to me?

269
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,831
You're here to take
my soul, right?

270
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:28,497
-Hm?

271
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,131
What do you mean?

272
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:33,531
Is that some fantasy
you humans came up with?

273
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:36,164
I'm not going to
do anything to you.

274
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:37,364
-Huh?

275
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,697
RYUK: The notebook becomes
part of the human realm

276
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:42,164
from the very moment
it touches the earth.

277
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:45,964
In other words, the
notebook is now yours.

278
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:48,031
-This is mine?

279
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:50,631
-If you don't want it, just
give it to someone else.

280
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:52,197
But if you give
it away, I'd have

281
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:56,064
no choice but to erase your
memories of the notebook.

282
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:59,064
-So then, you're saying I can
use to Death Note all I want,

283
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:00,631
and I won't be punished?

284
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,731
-Let's just say this.

285
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,931
You will feel the fear
and pain known only

286
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:08,597
to humans who have
used the notebook.

287
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,797
And when it's your
time to die, it

288
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:15,697
will fall on me to write
your name in my Death Note.

289
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,864
Be warned, any human
who's used the Death Note

290
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:23,431
can neither go to heaven
nor hell for eternity.

291
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,731
That's all.

292
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:26,631
[laughs]

293
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:33,543
Now, you have something to
look forward to after you die.

294
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,386
-[gasps]

295
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,586
SACHIKO: Light?

296
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,986
-It'll be all right.

297
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,686
Answer it.

298
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:43,486
-What is it?

299
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,753
-I thought you'd
like some apples.

300
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:47,386
The neighbors brought
them over for us.

301
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,120
Why on earth is it
so dark in your room?

302
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:51,353
You'll ruin your eyesight.

303
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:53,053
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
What's going on?

304
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,120
Mom can't see him?

305
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,386
RYUK: That notebook you found
originally belonged to me.

306
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,286
And since you're
now using it, you

307
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,586
are the only one who
is able to see me.

308
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,153
And of course, my voice
can only be heard by you.

309
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:10,453
In other words, the
Death Note is the bond

310
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:14,786
between Light, the human,
and Ryuk, the Shinigami.

311
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,786
Mm, mm.

312
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,953
Yum.

313
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:21,486
-I just have one more
question I want to ask you.

314
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,620
Why was I chosen for this?

315
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:25,920
Hey, are you even listening?

316
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,020
-Apples in the human
world are worth the trip.

317
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:34,586
What's the best way
to describe these?

318
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,553
Juicy?

319
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:37,153
-Just answer my question.

320
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:39,553
-Hah, I didn't choose you.

321
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:42,220
Don't you see this is
all just an accident?

322
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:43,720
You actually thought
you were chosen

323
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,953
because you're so
smart or something?

324
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:47,620
Don't be so vain.

325
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:49,753
It just happened to
fall around here,

326
00:16:49,786 --> 00:16:51,620
and you just happened
to pick it up.

327
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,320
And that's all there is to it.

328
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:54,753
That's why I wrote
the instructions

329
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:57,820
in English, the most popular
language in the human world.

330
00:16:57,853 --> 00:16:59,853
-Then why did you drop
it in the first place?

331
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,120
You even wrote down
specific instructions!

332
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,653
So don't try to tell me
this was an accident.

333
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:07,353
-You're asking me why?

334
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:10,686
I did it because I was bored.

335
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,653
-You were bored?

336
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:15,653
RYUK: The truth is,
Shinigami haven't got much

337
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,053
to do these days.

338
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:20,320
Most of the time, we're either
taking naps or gambling.

339
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,620
If you take the time to write
names in your Death Note,

340
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:25,853
the others just laugh at
you for working so hard.

341
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:27,886
Even if you wrote the
name of another Shinigami,

342
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,553
it would be pointless
because they wouldn't I die.

343
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:32,686
Then since we live in
the Shinigami realm,

344
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,686
it brings us no amusement to
kill those in the human world

345
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,686
either.

346
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,586
So I figured I'd have more
fun if I get down here myself.

347
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:46,453
Anyway, I'm surprised at how
many names you've written.

348
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,920
But I want to know why you
only wrote the cause of death

349
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:51,153
for that guy who was
hit by the truck.

350
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:52,986
-If you don't write
down the cause of death,

351
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,653
the victim dies
of a heart attack.

352
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:57,520
And that's probably the best
thing about the Death Note,

353
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:58,186
Ryuk.

354
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,820
-Huh?

355
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:01,653
-You see, I've already
exhausted the list

356
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:02,986
of the world's major criminals.

357
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,220
And eventually, I'm going
to get rid of them all.

358
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,220
-What's the point of doing that?

359
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,386
-It's only a matter of time
before people figure out

360
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,553
that these criminals are
being eliminated by someone.

361
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:16,453
I want the world to
know of my existence,

362
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:19,420
that there's someone out there
passing righteous judgment

363
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:21,853
on the wicked.

364
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:23,320
-Why even bother?

365
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,653
What are you trying to achieve
by passing judgment on them?

366
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,753
I mean, why do you care?

367
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:31,820
-Because I've been bored, too.

368
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:38,553
I wasn't ready to believe it
at first, but it's obvious now.

369
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:40,420
There's something about
the Death Note itself

370
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,853
that makes humans want to
try it out at least once.

371
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:47,520
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
I killed them both.

372
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:50,620
I real-- I'd killed two men.

373
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:52,386
Those were human lives.

374
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,486
It won't be overlooked.

375
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,686
Besides, who am I to
pass judgment on others?

376
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Uhh, no, no, wait.

377
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:05,020
Maybe I'm wrong.

378
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:07,386
This is exactly what I've
been thinking about lately.

379
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,686
This world is rotting.

380
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,486
And those who are making
it rot deserve to die!

381
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,920
Someone has to do
it, so why not me?

382
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,520
Even if it means sacrificing
my own mind and soul,

383
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:23,620
it's worth it because the
world can't go on like this.

384
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:27,586
I wonder, what if someone else
had picked up this notebook?

385
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,320
Is there anyone out
there, other than me,

386
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:32,420
who'd be willing to eliminate
the vermin from the world?

387
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:35,086
If I don't do it, then who will?

388
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,720
That's just it.

389
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:36,820
There's no one.

390
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:38,820
I can do it.

391
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:42,220
In fact, I'm the
only one who can.

392
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:43,720
I'll do it.

393
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:46,686
Using the Death Note,
I'll change the world.

394
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:53,653
[groans]

395
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:56,086
-Ugh!

396
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,586
-Arrgh!

397
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,086
Ugh!

398
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,020
-Uhh.

399
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:03,520
-Ugh!

400
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,486
-Ugh! [groans]

401
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,920
-[gasping]

402
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:15,420
[yells]

403
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:15,920
-Arrgh!

404
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,720
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): At
first, I wrote the names

405
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:27,220
of the worst criminals
I could think

406
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:30,286
of, like I was cleaning up
the world, one name at a time

407
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,553
so that, eventually, no one will
ever do anything evil again.

408
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:36,586
And while the truly
guilty ones who

409
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,186
deserve to be punished for their
crimes die of heart attacks,

410
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,186
the people who are
less guilty but who

411
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,053
still make trouble
for others will slowly

412
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:45,953
be erased through disease
and accidental death.

413
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:48,220
Then and only then,
the world will

414
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,486
start moving in the
right direction.

415
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,720
It'll be a new world,
free of injustice

416
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,486
and populated by people who
I've judged to be honest,

417
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,320
kind, and hardworking.

418
00:20:57,353 --> 00:20:59,353
-But if you did that,
it would make you

419
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:01,120
the only bad person left.

420
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:02,220
-Huh?

421
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:05,020
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

422
00:21:05,053 --> 00:21:06,986
I'm a hardworking
honor student who's

423
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,453
considered to be one of
Japan's best and brightest.

424
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:16,920
And I-- I will become the
god of this new world.

425
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,120
-It's just as I thought.

426
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:25,771
Humans are so interesting.

427
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,316

428
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,997
-[snickers]

429
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,330
I'll show the world what happens
when you try to cross me.

430
00:22:57,364 --> 00:23:02,064
The entire world
is watching now, L.
