[theme music]

2
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:37,332
L: Greetings to all
of you at the ICPO.

3
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:41,232
I am L. Whether the guilty party
is an individual or a group,

4
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,366
there's a strong possibility
that they're Japanese.

5
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:44,932
LIND L. TAILOR (ON
TV): Kira, I've got

6
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,032
a pretty good idea what
your motivation might be,

7
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,232
and I can guess what
you hope to achieve.

8
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:53,766
However, what you're
doing right now is evil.

9
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,966
-You, you bastard.

10
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,366
L: Now, try to kill me.

11
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,499
-I am justice.

12
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:00,532
I protect the
innocent and those who

13
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:02,432
fear evil I'm the
one who will become

14
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:04,299
the god of a new world
that everyone desires.

15
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,399
L--

16
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:06,499
-Kira--

17
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:07,766
L AND LIGHT (IN UNISON):
I will hunt you down

18
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,232
wherever you're hiding,
and I will eliminate you.

19
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:10,732
-I am--

20
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:11,799
-I am--

21
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,166
L AND LIGHT (IN
UNISON): Justice.

22
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:20,966
-All right.

23
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,199
Let's start with the
tip line reports.

24
00:02:22,232 --> 00:02:23,499
-Yes, sir.

25
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:26,299
Up to this point, we've
received 3,029 responses

26
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:28,832
about the murders via
telephone and email.

27
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:31,332
Most of these have been curious
citizens and prank calls.

28
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,732
But there are 14 people who
claim to either know Kira,

29
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:37,332
or who have seen him.

30
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,766
All 14 accounts were followed
up on, and carefully documented.

31
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,099
However, nobody could
provide any information

32
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,799
that wasn't already
publicly available.

33
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,399
And lastly, this week, there
were an additional 21 people

34
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:51,432
who called in
claiming to be Kira.

35
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:57,832
We didn't want to
rule anything out,

36
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:59,699
so we followed
standard procedure,

37
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:02,832
and created files
for all 21 of them.

38
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:03,332
-Uh huh.

39
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:04,032
All right.

40
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,832
Onto the victim reports.

41
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,966
-Yes, sir.

42
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,366
Upon further
investigation, we have

43
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,166
confirmed that information
of the heart attack victims

44
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,632
was in fact publicly available
in Japan immediately prior

45
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,266
to their deaths.

46
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,766
Also, concerning L's
request that we investigate

47
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,666
the time of death
for each victim,

48
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,420
we found that all
of them occurred

49
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:29,620
between the hours of 4:00
PM and 2:00 AM on weekdays,

50
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:32,153
local time, with 68%
of them occurring

51
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:34,420
between 8:00 PM and 12:00 AM.

52
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:37,386
Weekends and holidays appear to
be the exception to this rule,

53
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,586
as the times of death vary much
more widely during the week.

54
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,720
L: That information is
extremely relevant for us.

55
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:46,620
It suggests that given
the times of death,

56
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:49,653
our suspect could very
well be a student.

57
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:51,120
-Hmm?

58
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:53,886
L: Based on the fact that Kira
is only killing criminals,

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,486
I think it's safe
to assume that he's

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,753
driven by very idealistic
notion of justice.

61
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:00,653
It's highly possible
he may even aspire

62
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:02,353
to be some sort of
god-like figure.

63
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:03,853
We're dealing with
an individual who

64
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:07,253
has a very childish
concept of right and wrong.

65
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:09,053
[whispering]

66
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:11,286
L: Of course, this is mere
speculation at this point.

67
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,820
But still, I recommend you
reexamine any assumptions

68
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,853
you've made as to whether or not
our suspect could be a student.

69
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:19,220
We must consider
every possibility.

70
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:22,020
I believe that is the shortest
route to defining and arresting

71
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,120
Kira.

72
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,753
Please, continue
with your report.

73
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:26,753
-Uh.

74
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:28,453
All right.

75
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:31,186
Does anyone else have
something they'd like to add?

76
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,686
-Uh, yes sir.

77
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,953
-What is it, Matsuda?

78
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:38,086
-Um, well I'm not saying
this to support Kira,

79
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,053
or to condone the murders,
but in the last few days

80
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:45,720
throughout the world, but
especially here in Japan,

81
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,253
we've observed a
dramatic decrease

82
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,486
in the number of violent
crimes committed.

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,320
Uh.

84
00:04:52,353 --> 00:04:54,720
-Well, I suppose it makes sense.

85
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,220
We've suspected something
like that would happen.

86
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,720
Anything else?

87
00:04:58,753 --> 00:04:59,220
-No.

88
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:04,553
-Well that about sums
up our report for today.

89
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:05,920
L?

90
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:07,053
L: Thank you, everyone.

91
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:09,486
I feel we're a one step
closer to finding Kira.

92
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Before I go, I'm afraid I have
one additional request to make.

93
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,320
This is directed to
the teams investigating

94
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:17,886
the victims, TV
news, and internet.

95
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,053
I would like you to go
back and take a closer

96
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,853
look at the exact way in which
the victims' identities were

97
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:23,786
made public.

98
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
Be as thorough as possible.

99
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:28,153
In particular, I want to
know if photos of the victims

100
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:30,820
were made available to
the public in Japan.

101
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:31,953
I'll leave it to you.

102
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:35,886
-Chief.

103
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,953
-Mm?

104
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,686
-You look like you
could use one of these.

105
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,420
Sleepy much?

106
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:40,620
-Ah, thank you.

107
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:41,986
That'll do the trick.

108
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,420
I feel all these late nights
are starting to take their toll.

109
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,620
-About what I said
earlier at our meeting--

110
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,453
well, now that I think
about it, um, I'm

111
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,320
sure everyone already knew that.

112
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,720
I wanted to apologize.

113
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,720
-What on earth are
you talking about?

114
00:05:57,753 --> 00:05:59,786
Nobody said it would be
easy to speak the truth,

115
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,902
but it has to be
done, especially when

116
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:04,369
it's something that
isn't easy to say.

117
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,911
-Huh?

118
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,711
-Having said that,
if you'd gone on

119
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:09,245
to say that we
should commend Kira

120
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:12,278
for doing such a great job
of reducing violent crime,

121
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:15,045
then yes, I might have had
a little problem with that.

122
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:15,711
-Oh no.

123
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:16,411
Uh, no, I wouldn't.

124
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:17,411
That would never happen.

125
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,711
-[laughing], I'm just kidding.

126
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:22,978
-I knew I could
count on you, Light.

127
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,378
-Hey.

128
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,378
So, do you think you're ready
to try a few on your own now?

129
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:27,545
-Huh?

130
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:28,178
Yeah.

131
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:29,211
I guess so.

132
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:30,911
[doorbell rings]

133
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:33,745
-Oh, sounds like Dad's home.

134
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:35,445
MOTHER: Welcome home, dear.

135
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,945
FATHER: Thank you.

136
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:38,278
-He's home really early today.

137
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,611
-Hey!

138
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,878
Why don't you at least try
the last problem by yourself?

139
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:44,678
-I will, but maybe after dinner.

140
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:45,472
-Yeah, right.

141
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:48,960
-Helping your sister
with her homework.

142
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,560
You sure are relaxed.

143
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:51,626
-Of course.

144
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,160
If the police try
to come after me,

145
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:54,693
I'm pretty confident
I've got something

146
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:55,893
that'll give me the advantage.

147
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:00,493
Hey, glad you could
join us for dinner.

148
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:01,560
You hungry, Dad?

149
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:02,593
-Yeah.

150
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:03,793
It's been a long day.

151
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:12,760
So, Light.

152
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:14,793
Tell me, how are
your studies going?

153
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:15,993
-Hmm?

154
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:17,226
Everything's OK, I guess.

155
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,060
-Whatever.

156
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:19,493
He's at the top of his class.

157
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,260
My big brother's a genius.

158
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:22,426
-That's my son.

159
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,793
We're all proud of you, Light.

160
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:25,260
-Is everything OK, Dad?

161
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:26,193
You look tired.

162
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,626
-Yeah.

163
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,926
I'm not able to say
too much about it,

164
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,760
but this case I'm working
now is really tough.

165
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:36,426
-I see.

166
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Well, well.

167
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:39,726
Daddy's a police man.

168
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,526
And that must be the reason
why you're so confident?

169
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,026
-That's right.

170
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,893
It's easy for me to hack
into Dad's computer.

171
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:47,426
We're on a home
network, so I can

172
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,260
copy the files I need
without leaving a trace.

173
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:53,893
This way, I can keep track
of their investigation.

174
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:54,893
There we go.

175
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,826
Hmm.

176
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,460
Well, isn't that interesting?

177
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:11,860
Looks like the
police are already

178
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:13,893
beginning to suspect a student.

179
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,793
--[laughing] I guess that
means you're in trouble.

180
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:18,293
-Hmm.

181
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,660
If the cause of death is written
within 40 seconds of writing

182
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:29,360
the person's name,
it will happen.

183
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,993
If the cause of death
is not specified,

184
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:34,693
the person will simply
die of a heart attack.

185
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,893
After writing the cause of
death, details of the death

186
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:39,626
should be written in the next
six minutes and 40 seconds.

187
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,926
That sound right to you, Ryuk?

188
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,560
-So what's your point?

189
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,260
-In other words, if
I write heart attack

190
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:47,326
as the cause of
death, then I should

191
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,560
be able to write down all
the details, including time

192
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:52,226
of death afterward, shouldn't I?

193
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,826
Looks like I'll be
able to provide you

194
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,326
with more entertainment now.

195
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,460
[groaning]

196
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:24,460
-Huh?

197
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:26,293
Inmate 148, what's wrong?

198
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:27,560
Snap out of it.

199
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:45,160
-What?

200
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:47,626
I-- I don't believe this.

201
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,293
Another 23 victims yesterday?

202
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:50,460
Are these confirmed?

203
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:51,826
-Yes.

204
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,093
-The day before, there
were another 23 victims.

205
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,160
He's killing one off
every hour, on the hour.

206
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:00,260
-Considering that this
new pattern has been going

207
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:01,393
on for two weekdays--

208
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,393
-It does punch some
holes in the theory

209
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:05,260
that our suspect is a student.

210
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:06,226
-Maybe not.

211
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,460
Anybody can skip
two days of school.

212
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:08,993
L: You're missing the point.

213
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,760
[gasping]

214
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,826
L: It does appear less likely
now that Kira's a student.

215
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,260
But that's not the message
he's sending by doing this.

216
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,160
Ask yourselves, why every hour?

217
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:21,526
And why are all these
victims in prisons

218
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,526
where they are sure to be
discovered immediately?

219
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,593
Why not other
criminals like before?

220
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,760
I believe Kira is telling
us that not only can he

221
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:30,826
kill from a distance,
but he can also

222
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,593
determine the time of death.

223
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:35,560
[whispering]

224
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,226
L: But, something's not right.

225
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,260
As soon as we began to suspect
that Kira might be a student,

226
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:44,326
the pacing of the
killings changed,

227
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,893
as if to contradict that theory.

228
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:47,793
Coincidence?

229
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:48,726
No.

230
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,626
Too convenient.

231
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,026
This can only mean that Kira has
access to police information.

232
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,493
It's obvious now.

233
00:10:56,526 --> 00:11:00,960
This is a direct
challenge to me.

234
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,560
-I'd say L is probably starting
to sweat a little by now.

235
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:06,293
What'll really make
his job difficult

236
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:08,360
is that I've deliberately
left about 50 criminals

237
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:09,860
alive for times like this.

238
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:10,793
-Oh?

239
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:12,893
-If L's as good as
they say, by now

240
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:14,893
he should be starting
to suspect someone

241
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:17,693
with connections to the police.

242
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:21,564
L (VOICEOVER): So Kira has found
a way to obtain information

243
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,456
from the task
force headquarters.

244
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,556
This is one fact that
cannot be ignored.

245
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,023
But what does he
get out of all this?

246
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,990
What is he hoping to
achieve in the end?

247
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,390
-There's one thing I don't get.

248
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:38,490
Showing them you have
connections to the police

249
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,223
makes it easier for
them to find you

250
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:42,556
than when they just
suspected you were a student.

251
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,723
-Well, my real agenda
is to get close to L,

252
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,090
so I can eliminate him.

253
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,390
-How are you going to do that?

254
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,290
-You still don't
understand human beings.

255
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:53,890
In this world, there
are very few people

256
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:56,056
who actually trust each other.

257
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,090
And it's no different
for the police, you know.

258
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:02,323
What's especially important is
that L and the investigators

259
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,023
don't trust each other at all.

260
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,123
Think about it.

261
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:06,490
Could you trust someone
whose name and face

262
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:07,590
you don't even know?

263
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,356
When L discovers
that I'm somehow

264
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,956
getting confidential
information,

265
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,990
he'll be obligated to start
investigating the police

266
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:16,090
to find the source of the leak.

267
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:18,490
When that happens, it'll
only be a matter of time

268
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:22,556
before the police start
resenting L. On the surface,

269
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,723
it will appear that L and
the investigation team

270
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:27,474
are working together
to try to catch me.

271
00:12:27,508 --> 00:12:31,408
But in reality, L will
investigate the police,

272
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:34,208
and they will be
investigating L.

273
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,641
I'm not the one
who's going to find

274
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:39,541
L. I can let the
police do that for me.

275
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:41,641
And when they do, that's
when I'll eliminate him.

276
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:58,019
CHIEF: What's this about?

277
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:04,276
-With all due respect,
Chief, we're resigning.

278
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,809
We demand that you assign
us to a different case.

279
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:09,042
Otherwise, you can have our
badges right here and now.

280
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:10,109
-Why?

281
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:11,209
You're good cops.

282
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:12,542
-Isn't it clear?

283
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:14,776
It's because we
value our lives, sir.

284
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,009
-If what L says is true,
Kira has some ESP like power

285
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,709
that somehow allows him
to kill people indirectly,

286
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:21,809
from anywhere.

287
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,509
-Well, if I were Kira,
sir, I'd probably

288
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,209
want to try and get
rid of the people who

289
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:26,442
were trying to catch me.

290
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:27,676
-Let's face it.

291
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,409
He knows he'll be sentenced
to death if he's caught.

292
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,976
-We all sat here
and watched when

293
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,009
L decided to pull
that media stunt

294
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,642
and challenge Kira to kill him.

295
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:36,809
Well, it was all very
impressive at the time.

296
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:38,842
But then again, L never
had to show his face,

297
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:40,876
or reveal his name,
for that matter.

298
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:43,209
I'm sure you recall
L's last request.

299
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:44,709
He asked that we
take a closer look

300
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,242
at how these victims'
identities were

301
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,809
made public, and specifically
to determine whether photos

302
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:50,609
of the victims were
available to the public

303
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:52,776
prior to their deaths.

304
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,942
Well, it turns out he was right.

305
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:57,076
Every single one of those
victims' names and photos

306
00:13:57,109 --> 00:14:00,209
were broadcast to the Japanese
public, and then they died.

307
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:02,042
Unlike someone we
know, we're out there

308
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:04,276
investigating this
case wearing police IDs

309
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:06,009
with our names and
photos on them.

310
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,509
Anybody with a computer
can find out who we are.

311
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:09,676
We don't hide our faces.

312
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,042
We're out in the open.

313
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:15,409
-Sir, the truth is, we could
be killed by Kira at any time.

314
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:18,476
-For these reasons, we refuse
to continue working this case.

315
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,542
Excuse us, Chief.

316
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,309
-Hey, stop.

317
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:24,242
All of you, hold it right there.

318
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:31,009
-Huh?

319
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,009
-In order to solve
this problem, we

320
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:36,309
must establish the
concept that x squared

321
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,376
equals large N.
Now pay attention,

322
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:39,676
because this is important.

323
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,342
Before we tackle more
complex quadratic equations,

324
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,776
we have to start thinking
of large x's value

325
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:47,942
as simply the multiple
of two integers.

326
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:50,509
Now, let's apply this
concept to our first problem.

327
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:57,576
-We brought the FBI to
Japan four days ago.

328
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:58,909
They're fully operational.

329
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:01,742
As requested, they're now
gathering intel on the police.

330
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,309
-And this is the complete list?

331
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:05,676
-Yes.

332
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,776
-There are 141 people
in the police force

333
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,876
who have access to classified
information regarding

334
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,376
the investigation.

335
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:15,176
I am sure that somewhere in
this list of police officers

336
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:20,509
and the people closest to
them, we will find our suspect.

337
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:27,976
-Light, you got a second?

338
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:30,976
-I already told you Ryuk, you
can't talk to me in public.

339
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:33,142
How many times do
I have to tell you?

340
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:34,542
-In that case, I'll talk.

341
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:35,476
You just listen.

342
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:36,842
If you don't want
to hear me, you

343
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:39,376
can plug your ears or something.

344
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:42,009
First of all, I don't
have anything against you.

345
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,609
I actually think the
notebook couldn't

346
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,942
have been picked up
by a better person.

347
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:47,909
I'm here 'cause I have
to stick around 'til

348
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:50,409
the death note is
finished, or I see you die,

349
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:52,009
whichever comes first.

350
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:57,476
But make no mistake, Light, I'm
not on your side or L's side.

351
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:00,342
-Yeah, well I knew
that much already.

352
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,142
-You'll never hear
me say anything about

353
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:04,309
whether what you're
doing is right or wrong.

354
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,942
I'm not here to support
you, or give you my opinion.

355
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,642
I'm just a spectator.

356
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,974
But as your roommate,
I might have

357
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,940
a few things to
say now and then.

358
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:14,474
-What's this about, Ryuk?

359
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,640
Why are you telling me all
this stuff now, anyway?

360
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:18,840
It's really not like you.

361
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:21,074
-It's just that I'm
no ally of yours,

362
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,640
or Kira's, if you prefer.

363
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,374
The only reason I'm
going to tell you this

364
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:26,874
is because personally, it's
starting to creep me out.

365
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:29,340
-Get to the point, already.

366
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:33,574
--[laughing] You're being
followed by another human.

367
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:34,840
He's watching you right now.

368
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:53,840
It's really starting
to get on my nerves.

369
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:56,840
I realize there's no
way he can see me.

370
00:16:56,874 --> 00:17:00,374
But because I'm always following
behind you wherever you go,

371
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:03,574
I feel like I'm
constantly being watched.

372
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,174
-That's a problem.

373
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,307
I'll have to get rid of
him as soon as possible.

374
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:13,940
Who would be following me?

375
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:16,540
Does this mean L is already
starting to suspect the police?

376
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:21,374
If he's going to
investigate the police,

377
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,440
he'll need a lot of
resources and manpower.

378
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:27,107
Even if he has as many
as 50 people on the case,

379
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,174
I don't see how they could
ever figure out that I'm Kira.

380
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:31,674
I shouldn't look
like anything other

381
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,140
than your average
high school senior.

382
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:37,274
But the longer I let this
person keep following me,

383
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,640
the greater the
chance is they'll

384
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:41,307
figure out who I really am.

385
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,340
Above all, I need
my stalker's name.

386
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:48,274
Once I figure that out, I
can get rid of him for good.

387
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:49,040
-Light.

388
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:50,374
-Hmm?

389
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,440
-I'm going to let you
in on a little secret.

390
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,674
What makes a
shinigami and a human

391
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,507
who has a death note different?

392
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,507
Well, there are two things.

393
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
And why do shinigami
have to write

394
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,592
the names of humans
in their death notes?

395
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:05,159
You got any ideas?

396
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:05,992
-Of course not.

397
00:18:06,026 --> 00:18:07,492
Why would I know that?

398
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:11,159
You know, you sure
are talkative today.

399
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:12,659
-It's because we
are able to take

400
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,792
human lifespans for ourselves.

401
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:15,526
-Huh?

402
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,392
Wait, what do you mean by that?

403
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,292
-Let's say you
have a human who is

404
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:22,226
due to live until the age
of 60, and a god of death

405
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,326
wrote that this person
would die at 40.

406
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,026
60 minus 40 equals 20.

407
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,126
Now, those 20 years taken from
someone in the human world

408
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,759
are added to that
god of death's life.

409
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:34,959
-Huh.

410
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:37,659
-So it means that as long
as we don't slack off,

411
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:40,226
even if someone was to
shoot us in the head,

412
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:42,026
or stab us in the
heart with a knife,

413
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,426
a god of death cannot die.

414
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:46,792
On the other hand, no
matter how many names

415
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,292
you write in your death
note, your lifespan

416
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:50,692
will not increase.

417
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:52,659
That is the first
difference between gods

418
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:55,092
of death and humans who
possess a death note.

419
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:56,492
-Huh.

420
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:59,959
That's something about shinigami
that I haven't heard before.

421
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:01,859
Pretty interesting stuff.

422
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,526
-The second
difference between us

423
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,659
will probably be of even
greater interest to you.

424
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,092
Though this has less to
do with lengthening life,

425
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:10,992
and more to do with
cutting it short.

426
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,559
-What do you mean
cutting it short?

427
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:15,692
-Shinigami can tell
what a person's name

428
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,359
is by just looking
at their face.

429
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:18,926
We know instantly.

430
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,859
And do you have any idea why?

431
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:23,492
Because through a
shinigami's eyes,

432
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:26,459
a human's name can be
seen about their head.

433
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:29,859
Not only that, we see
their lifespan as well.

434
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:33,326
-Their name and lifespan?

435
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,526
-That's right.

436
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,492
I'm able to see your name
and lifespan right now.

437
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:40,826
If I converted
that to human time,

438
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:43,226
I could tell you how many
years you've got left.

439
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,959
But there's no way I'd
ever tell you that.

440
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:49,459
I may have a big mouth, but
even I wouldn't go that far.

441
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:53,659
[laughing] Shinigami
never have to worry

442
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,292
that they won't be
able to a person

443
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,626
just because they
don't know their name.

444
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,426
And every time we
do take a life,

445
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:03,292
we always know exactly how many
years we're going to receive.

446
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:05,959
Our eyes just aren't
the same, and that

447
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:09,326
is the difference
between you and I.

448
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,159
However, if a shinigami
drops his death note,

449
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:16,292
and human picks it up, he
can grant that humanity

450
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:18,626
the eyes of a shinigami.

451
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:21,359
But only if a deal
is made, one that's

452
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:23,159
been with us since
ancient times.

453
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:25,659
-And what's the deal?

454
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:30,259
-The price for having
a shinigami's eyes

455
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:33,492
is half of that person's
remaining lifespan.

456
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:35,392
That's all it is.

457
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:38,359
-Half of my remaining lifespan.

458
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:39,892
-Yeah.

459
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:41,592
In other words, if
you were supposed

460
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:44,592
to live another 50
years, it'll be 25.

461
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:47,426
If it was one more
year, then six months.

462
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:48,792
-I see.

463
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:51,392
And since you've made it clear
you're not on anyone's side,

464
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:53,192
and won't help me
out, you wouldn't just

465
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:55,626
give me the names of
people I wanted to kill.

466
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:57,926
Basically, you're saying
that I can't simply

467
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:00,059
borrow your powers.

468
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,526
I'd have to pay for them.

469
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,892
-That's right.

470
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:06,692
It's a key part of the code
that all shinigami are bound by.

471
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:08,892
I'll say this once more.

472
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:10,792
Give me half your
remaining lifespan,

473
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:13,626
and I'll give you
the shinigami eyes.

474
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:17,659
-If I agree, I'll be able
to know everyone's name just

475
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:19,392
by looking at them.

476
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:21,326
If I had that power,
the death note

477
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,926
would only be easier to use.

478
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:26,159
-So, what'll it be, Light?

479
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:27,159
Is it a deal?

480
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,892
[theme music]

481
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:52,042
-Everything has
turned out exactly

482
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:55,042
as I wrote it in the death
note, to the last detail.

483
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:57,742
11:45, on the dot.

484
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,842
Everything is going
just as I planned.

485
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:02,609
The death note never fails.
