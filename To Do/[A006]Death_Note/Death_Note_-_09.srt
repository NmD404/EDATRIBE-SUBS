00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:39,135
SOICHIRO YAGAMI: I
can't believe my son is

3
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:40,602
looking at those magazines.

4
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:42,068
-Hey, Light!

5
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,568
Come on!

6
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:45,535
Dinner's ready.

7
00:01:45,568 --> 00:01:51,468
[laughing]

8
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:53,402
LIGHT YAGAMI (VOICEOVER):
I'll solve equations

9
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:57,302
with my right hand and
write names with my left.

10
00:01:57,335 --> 00:02:02,135
I'll take a potato
chip-- and eat it!

11
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:06,068
And the witness to my
alibi is L himself.

12
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:12,768
Are you sure about this?

13
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:13,835
Ryuk.

14
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:17,868
-Yeah, I'm sure nobody's
following you, OK?

15
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:19,802
Now hurry up already, will you?

16
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,468
The symptoms are getting worse.

17
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:23,068
LIGHT YAGAMI: I
really hope you're not

18
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,135
saying what you think
I'd want to hear just

19
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:26,068
to get some apples.

20
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:26,735
RYUK: Whoa!

21
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,102
Hold it right there.

22
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:29,868
I just flew out and checked a
100-meter radius around you,

23
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:31,768
and there was no one
there. (TESTILY) So yeah,

24
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:33,135
for the last time, I'm sure.

25
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:33,802
OK?

26
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:35,002
-All right.

27
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,335
But on the news, they
said they were dispatching

28
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,435
1,500 investigators to Japan.

29
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:39,968
-They're bluffing.

30
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:40,902
You said so yourself.

31
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:42,402
If it were really
happening, they

32
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:43,735
wouldn't announce their arrival.

33
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:46,635
Instead, they'd come and
investigate secretly.

34
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,268
-I suppose you're right.

35
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:50,668
Well, then, I'll
buy you some apples.

36
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:51,668
-Nice.

37
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:53,035
[laugh]

38
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:53,968
-Here you are.

39
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:55,235
Please come again.

40
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:56,602
-Light, come on.

41
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,268
Hurry up.

42
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:05,835
You know, you really haven't
been that nice to me.

43
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:12,635
You have me looking
all over for cameras,

44
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:15,602
telling me that I can't even
eat apples in the house anymore.

45
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:17,268
It's not right.

46
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:18,468
[bones popping]

47
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:20,602
-Make sure you eat
the core as well.

48

[chomping]

49
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:26,135
-You know, I might actually
write your name in my Death

50
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:28,435
Note and kill you,
just like that.

51
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:29,435
LIGHT YAGAMI: [laughing]

52
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:31,068
RYUK: I wouldn't
laugh if I were you.

53
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:32,435
LIGHT YAGAMI: Right.

54
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:35,568
That reminds me, I've got one
finishing touch left to add.

55
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:37,302
-Hmm.

56
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:39,202
Hey, Ryuzaki.

57
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,268
RYUZAKI: Yes?

58
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:41,568
-I've been thinking
about the purse snatcher

59
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:43,902
and the embezzler's heart
attacks two days ago.

60
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:46,635
It seems my family couldn't
have had any knowledge of them

61
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:47,835
before they died.

62
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:50,068
Shouldn't that resolve
any doubts you have?

63
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:51,902
-You may be right.

64
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:54,602
Even though Kira can
control the time of death,

65
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,768
I don't think there's any
way he could have arranged

66
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:59,302
their debts without having
seen the broadcast first.

67
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:01,135
Hmm?

68
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:03,268
Your son has come home.

69
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:03,768
-Huh.

70
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:09,068
-Heh.

71
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:10,735
So you're going to
keep quiet and pretend

72
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:13,368
to study again, huh?

73
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:15,202
LIGHT YAGAMI (VOICEOVER):
I have a good grasp

74
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:16,935
of where all the
cameras are placed,

75
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:19,935
but I only managed to kill a
purse snatcher and an embezzler

76
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,902
using that trick with
the potato chips.

77
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:25,135
Both of them were guilty
of much lesser crimes

78
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:26,702
than my previous victims.

79
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:28,402
NEWS ANCHOR (TV):
Next, in local news--

80
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,068
-Huh?

81
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,402
You're watching TV?

82
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,002
LIGHT YAGAMI (VOICEOVER): I
made sure to kill criminals

83
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:34,435
whose names and faces were
broadcast when I didn't have

84
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,635
access to TV or the internet.

85
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:39,102
But there's a chance I'll look
even more suspicious if only

86
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:41,135
these lesser
criminals end up dying

87
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:42,968
while I'm not
receiving information.

88
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:46,068
In other words, if I kill other
petty criminals whose names

89
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,268
and faces are broadcast
as I watch TV,

90
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:51,835
I won't draw unnecessary
attention to myself.

91
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:54,102
For this to work, all
I really have to do

92
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:55,968
is remember the identities
of the criminals

93
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:58,568
I either see on TV
or while I'm online,

94
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:01,268
regardless of the
severity of their crimes.

95
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,768
That way, whenever I go out, I
can use that piece of the Death

96
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:08,502
Note I keep in my wallet to
kill them at random times.

97
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:09,968
Just like that.

98
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:12,602
It's the perfect way to deal
with these hidden cameras.

99
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:19,102
L: In the past few
days, I've listened

100
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:21,435
to all of our audio
recordings and reviewed

101
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,068
the video footage we captured.

102
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:25,568
I've gone over them many times.

103
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:27,068
And I've come to a conclusion.

104
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:29,868
Our surveillance of the
Kitamura and Yagami households

105
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:30,468
has revealed--

106
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:33,102
[gasp]

107
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:34,668
--nothing.

108
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,568
[sigh]

109
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,268
(WHILE EATING) We will remove
the cameras and wiretaps.

110
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:43,435
--[sigh] All that, and we
still don't have any suspects.

111
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,702
-It's OK, Matsuda.

112
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:47,035
We'll have to pursue other
leads, but we'll get him.

113
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,502
L: Please don't
get the wrong idea.

114
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:50,368
-Huh?

115
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:53,635
-I only said that we were unable
to reveal anything suspicious

116
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:54,868
based on our surveillance.

117
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:56,402
-What?

118
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:58,735
L: Even if Kira
was among them, I'm

119
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:00,302
sure he wouldn't
make it obvious.

120
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,235
No, in fact, it
could mean he was

121
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:05,335
able to continue killing
without doing anything outwardly

122
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:07,535
suspicious.

123
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,835
-Well, then you
believe that Kira

124
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:12,535
is among one of those families.

125
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:15,735
-As I've said,
there's a 5% chance.

126
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,835
(VOICEOVER) Kira never
stopped killing people,

127
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:25,868
even while the surveillance
cameras were in place.

128
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:27,802
I still have no
idea how he's been

129
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,902
able to commit these
murders, but let's say

130
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:34,235
he could kill someone simply
by wishing death upon them.

131
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,802
You'd think that any
human being would

132
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:37,735
have shown at least
some emotion, some sign

133
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:41,102
that they were knowingly
committing an act of murder.

134
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:43,568
So the obvious
conclusion is that Kira

135
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:45,102
couldn't be one of them.

136
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:48,302
However, what if he
is one of these people

137
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:49,835
we've been watching?

138
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,935
If he is, we have to assume
that his psyche has reached

139
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:56,368
godlike proportions, punishing
evildoers without the slightest

140
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:57,635
change of expression.

141
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,602
It almost makes me want to
believe that Kira doesn't

142
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:03,802
exist, that this is just
the wrath of a vengeful god.

143
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:05,968
But that idea is
completely absurd,

144
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:08,568
to think that God would need
a person's face and name

145
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,502
to kill them.

146
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:14,035
No, these aren't acts
of God, but someone

147
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:17,635
very childish and immature who
wants to pretend they're God.

148
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:20,035
That's what's going on here.

149
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:23,768
A mass murderer who calls
himself Kira exists somewhere,

150
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:24,468
I'm sure of it.

151
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:25,702
And I will catch him.

152
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:28,968
But I can't count on
Kira making any mistakes.

153
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:30,902
It doesn't matter how
long we watch him.

154
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:33,835
He's not going to
expose himself to us.

155
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:36,535
So what should I do?

156
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:38,835
Ideally, I ought
to get to know him

157
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,935
well enough that he'd admit
to me that he was Kira

158
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:43,668
and show me how he kills.

159
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:44,835
Would that even be possible?

160
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:53,268
-[grunting] Hey, Light.

161
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:56,335
I just checked, and all the
cameras have been removed.

162
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:59,435
All of them, every single one.

163
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:00,635
Hello?

164
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:01,702
Are you listening to me?

165
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:07,068
Hey, Light.

166
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:08,735
Oh, good point.

167
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:11,035
We still don't know if they've
removed all the wiretaps

168
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:12,002
from the house.

169
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:13,202
LIGHT YAGAMI
(VOICEOVER): I suppose

170
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:15,935
this means I'm no
longer a suspect.

171
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:18,102
Everything's going as planned.

172
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:20,668
But I'm sure L won't
give up that easily.

173
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:23,835
If he's still working
with the Japanese police,

174
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:28,368
chances are my father is working
with him, or under him, anyway.

175
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:31,968
If that's the case, I'll have
to use my father to find out

176
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,402
L's true identity, and
I"ll eliminate him.

177
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:43,468
Once I get rid of L,
Kira w be one step closer

178
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:45,468
to becoming the god
of the new world.

179
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:49,868
SACHIKO YAGAMI: Light, hurry up.

180
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:51,768
You don't want to be late.

181
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:52,835
Do your best.

182
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:54,402
-I know you don't need
it, but good luck.

183
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:55,368
[laugh]

184
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,335
-I really don't
see why you two are

185
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,835
making such a big
deal out of this.

186
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:03,602
-I'm relieved.

187
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:06,602
We don't have to deal with
wiretaps in the house anymore.

188
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:07,635
LIGHT YAGAMI
(VOICEOVER): Well, it's

189
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:08,568
nice to know that
one cause of stress

190
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:10,002
was resolved before my exam.

191
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:12,068
And once I get into
university, I'll

192
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:14,402
have a lot more
room to act as Kira.

193
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:17,935
Then I can focus on finding
out who L really is.

194
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:19,002
-You there.

195
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,735
The exam will be
starting in 10 minutes,

196
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,935
so you better hurry up.

197
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:24,202
-It's fine.

198
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:25,968
I planned to get here three
minutes before the test.

199
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:27,135
I hate waiting.

200
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,368
I'm here too early.

201
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,035
-Well, well.

202
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,535
Confident.

203
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:35,902
[bell ringing]

204
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:36,868
-And begin.

205
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:45,202
-Hmm?

206
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:58,068
You there, student number 162.

207
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:00,635
Sit properly in your chair.

208
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:01,135
-Hmm?

209
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:50,024
[groan]

210
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:52,124
-It seems like a
lot of Shinigami

211
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:54,490
are observing the
human world lately.

212
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:56,190
Uh, what's with that, anyway?

213
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:59,157
-It turns out that Ryuk
is being kept by a human.

214
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,757
-Ha, what's he thinking?

215
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,890
Seriously.

216
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:06,190
-He's a disgrace to the
pride of the Shigiami.

217
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:10,457
-No, I'm talking about the
human who's keeping Ryuk.

218
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,290
-Huh?

219
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:12,990
-Who would want him as a pet?

220
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:14,324
Aren't pets supposed to be cute?

221
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,490
[laughter]

222
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:18,190
-When you're right,
you're right.

223
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:20,557
-So what's the story
on this human, anyway?

224
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,690
Is it a male or a female?

225
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,024
-Who knows?

226
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:27,190
-In that case, I think I'd
better go take a closer look.

227
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:28,190
-Oh boy.

228
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,590
[crowd noise]

229
00:11:57,757 --> 00:11:59,157
-You're a college student now.

230
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,557
That's kind of exciting.

231
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,157
I'm filled with joy.

232
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:10,690
-Now for the freshman
address, freshman

233
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:14,190
representative Light Yagami.

234
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:15,457
-Yes.

235
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:15,957
-Ooh.

236
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,524
Wow.

237
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:20,757
-And freshman
representative Hideki Ryuga.

238
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,857
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, uh, here.

239
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,457
--[gasp] Is that Hideki
Ryuga, the pop idol?

240
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,624
-That guy?

241
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:27,057
There's no way
he's got the brains

242
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,257
to get into a school like To-Oh.

243
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,490
-Yeah, you're right.

244
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:32,657
He doesn't look anything
like the real Hideki Ryuga.

245
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:37,290
LIGHT YAGAMI
(VOICEOVER): I knew I'd

246
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,490
be giving the address
with one other student.

247
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:42,490
But I never expected this.

248
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:44,924
I remember him from
the exam center.

249
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:47,957
He got into trouble for
sitting oddly on his desk.

250
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,357
It seemed like he was
off in his own world.

251
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,890
As all of us embark on this
new chapter of our lives--

252
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:00,090
STUDENT 1: The student who
scores highest on the test

253
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:01,724
is supposed to give
the speech, right?

254
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:03,257
STUDENT 2: I guess
both of them must

255
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,390
have had the high
score this year.

256
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:06,324
STUDENT 3: I heard they
both had perfect scores

257
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:07,557
for all subjects.

258
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,757
STUDENT 1: Seriously?

259
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,690
STUDENT 2: It's hard to
believe there are actually

260
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:11,790
people like that.

261
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,057
-I think I like the
little one on the right.

262
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,757
-What?

263
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,824
You're so weird, Kyoko.

264
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:18,190
Look at how he's dressed.

265
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:18,690
KYOKO: Mmm.

266
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,090
-Man, these two are
total opposites.

267
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:27,657
-Yeah.

268
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,724
STUDENT 1: This one looks
like a sheltered genius

269
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:31,957
who's been groomed for
success his whole life.

270
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,290
But the other one--

271
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:35,757
-(MONOTONE) As we embark on
this new chapter in our lives--

272
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,790
STUDENT 1: There's something
not right about him.

273
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:39,090
He's just freaking weird.

274
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:42,190
STUDENT 2: This guy must be
what they call a mad genius.

275
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:44,090
STUDENT 1: Coming to
the To-Oh entrance

276
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,257
ceremony dressed like that?

277
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,490
Unbelievable.

278
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:49,790
Either he's crazy, or
he's just toying with us.

279
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,924
---your freshman
representative, Hideki Ryuga.

280
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:04,524
L: Light.

281
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:05,990
Light Yagami?

282
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:09,490
Your father is Cheif
Soichori Yagami of the NPA.

283
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:11,324
Your respect for your
father is matched only

284
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:12,924
by your strong sense of justice.

285
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:15,490
LIGHT YAGAMI (VOICEOVER):
Who the hell is this guy?

286
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:16,990
-You're planning
to join the police

287
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,324
agency when you graduate.

288
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,957
And you've already
got experience,

289
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,057
seeing as you've
helped the police solve

290
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,724
a number of cases in the past.

291
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:27,190
Now you're showing an
interest in the Kira case.

292
00:14:27,224 --> 00:14:30,324
I'm impressed by your abilities
and your sense of justice.

293
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:32,490
If you promise not to
tell anyone about this,

294
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:35,157
I have important information
concerning the Kira

295
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,824
investigation that I'd
like to share with you.

296
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,957
LIGHT YAGAMI (VOICEOVER):
Where's this coming from?

297
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,390
And who is he?

298
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:43,824
Is it safe to just ignore him?

299
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:47,724
But I wonder what this
information actually is.

300
00:14:47,757 --> 00:14:49,424
I won't tell anyone.

301
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:50,257
What is it?

302
00:14:54,657 --> 00:15:01,157
-I want to tell you
(WHISPERING) I'm L. And

303
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,490
LIGHT YAGAMI (VOICEOVER): What?

304
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:04,624
There's no way!

305
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:06,490
What's he talking about?

306
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,990
If he really was L,
he'd never admit to it.

307
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,224
I thought this guy
was a bit strange,

308
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:14,190
but this is pretty extreme.

309
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,224
Nn-- stop.

310
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:17,657
This isn't good.

311
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,590
Don't act surprised.

312
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:22,024
On the off chance
that he really is L,

313
00:15:22,057 --> 00:15:25,190
I have to act how Soichiro
Yagami's son, Light Yagami,

314
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,790
would act in this situation.

315
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:29,890
There'd be no reason
for him to be afraid.

316
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:32,090
If you are who you
say you are, then you

317
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:34,890
have nothing but my
respect and admiration.

318
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:36,090
-Thank you.

319
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:38,257
The reason I chose to
reveal my identity to you

320
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,424
is because I think you
could be of some help to us

321
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:42,990
on the Kira investigation.

322
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,590
(VOICEOVER) Light Yagami.

323
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:48,390
The likelihood that you
are Kira is just under 5%.

324
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:51,924
Even so, something tells me
I'm not wrong to suspect you.

325
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:53,790
But you're just too perfect.

326
00:15:53,824 --> 00:15:55,890
If you are Kira, I
can't think of anything

327
00:15:55,924 --> 00:15:58,490
that would put more pressure on
you than this little scenario.

328
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,457
--[laughing] If this guy
is really L like he says,

329
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,357
then consider be impressed.

330
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,724
LIGHT YAGAMI
(VOICEOVER): Indeed.

331
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:10,824
If this guy really is L--
no, even if he's not L-- I--

332
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,690
I can't do anything to him.

333
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:15,924
Huh.

334
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:21,157
If what he's saying
is true, i-it probably

335
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,524
means he's already shown
his face to my father.

336
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:25,557
What now?

337
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,990
If he were to die right
after telling me who he was,

338
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:31,024
it would only confirm
their suspicions.

339
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,557
Although it's obvious
Hideki Ryuga is nothing

340
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,324
more than an absurd alias,
it still complicates things.

341
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:39,757
Even if I get lucky
and it isn't an alias,

342
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,457
if I try to kill him by simply
writing his name in the Death

343
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,524
Note, I might
accidentally picture

344
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:49,790
the face of Ryuga the pop star
and end up killing him instead.

345
00:16:49,824 --> 00:16:52,557
And if this guy doesn't
die, he'll know for a fact

346
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,057
that I'm Kira.

347
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,124
Is he really L?

348
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:59,424
Does he already
suspect that I'm Kira?

349
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,190
It's hard to say
how much he knows,

350
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:04,890
but I must be under suspicion.

351
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,824
What other reason could he have
for telling Soichiro Yagami's

352
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:09,324
son that he's L?

353
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:11,590
Does this mean that he's
still suspicious of the people

354
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:15,257
that Raye Penber was
investigating before he died?

355
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,924
Even so, I still don't see
why he would reveal himself

356
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:20,490
to me directly.

357
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:23,224
I can't let him see
any signs of distress.

358
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:25,724
It's better if I
just clear my mind.

359
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,424
[crowd murmuring]

360
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,057
-Ha, I didn't think the ceremony
would be so interesting.

361
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,590
L: Hey, Light.

362
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:52,124
-You hear that?

363
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:54,524
I think it's your new friend.

364
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:55,757
-Uh, nice meeting you.

365
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,690
-No, the pleasure was mine.

366
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,990
-What an amazing car.

367
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:04,224
-A limousine?

368
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,590
-Well, I'm sure I'll
see you on campus.

369
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:07,824
LIGHT YAGAMI: Yeah, take care.

370
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:13,190
STUDENT 4: That kid must
come from some serious money.

371
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,024
STUDENT 5: Plus he's at
the top of the class?

372
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:15,857
Where's the justice?

373
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,257
[tv blaring]

374
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,224
-Huh?

375
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:37,924
Hey, welcome home, Mr. To-Oh!

376
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:47,657
RYUK: Hmm?

377
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:51,624
-Damn it!

378
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:53,290
He got me!

379
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:54,624
-Uh, what do you mean?

380
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:55,224
I

381
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:56,557
-Damn L!

382
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,124
I've never been so
humiliated in my life.

383
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:03,424
-Uh-- hey, why don't you just
do the Shinigami eye deal thing?

384
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,690
You should have no problem
killing him, right?

385
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:07,390
-And what good
will Shinigami eyes

386
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:09,057
do me if this is just a trap?

387
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,124
If I kill him, and it turns
out he's not really L,

388
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:14,357
that would be like announcing
to the real L that I am Kira.

389
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,890
-Uh, sorry.

390
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:20,024
-Don't think that Shinigami
killing people and humans

391
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:23,357
killing people are the same
thing, because they're not.

392
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,524
I want nothing more
than to kill him.

393
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:28,490
But if I do, it's like
asking to get caught.

394
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:30,390
Unfortunately, the
Death Note can only

395
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:32,690
kill the person whose
name is written in it,

396
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:35,657
so it's not like I can arrange
for someone else to kill him.

397
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,090
It's inconvenient.

398
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:38,857
That's the flaw
with the Death Note.

399
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,657
RYUK (VOICEOVER): Light
is usually so calm,

400
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,424
but he's snapped.

401
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:43,890
This must be getting to him.

402
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:45,957
-At first, I thought once
I found out his name,

403
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,757
I'd have him die in an
accident or kill himself.

404
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,990
However, none of that
will do me any good

405
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,957
unless I know with
100% certainty

406
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,290
that this guy is L. No, it's
already too late to do anything

407
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:59,390
about it since he's approached
me and introduced himself as L.

408
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:01,357
It doesn't matter how sure I am.

409
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,590
Regardless of the cause
of death, if L dies now,

410
00:20:03,624 --> 00:20:05,657
the police are
going to suspect me.

411
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,657
I underestimated him.

412
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,490
I'd never even considered
the possibility

413
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:12,890
that he would reveal his
identity to me on purpose.

414
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,124
He could be telling all the
suspects the same thing.

415
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:20,524
In fact, it doesn't
even have to be him.

416
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:22,657
He could have sent
a double instead.

417
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,590
For L, this strategy
acts as a solid defense,

418
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,190
and it allows him to
confront Kira directly.

419
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:29,857
He can defend and attack.

420
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,324
He got me.

421
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:33,224
It was a good move.

422
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:36,157
I'm sure I haven't
seen the last of Ryuga.

423
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,057
He'll keep trying
to move in on me,

424
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,124
playing the
absent-minded genius,

425
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:44,924
and we'll pretend like
nothing's going on.

426
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:50,890
[laughing]

427
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:51,390
-Huh?

428
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,857
-This is perfect.

429
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,224
There's no reason
for me to be worried.

430
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,757
After all, this is proof that
they don't have anything on me

431
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,690
yet.

432
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:03,757
So this whole thing
is nothing more

433
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,790
than a contest between L and me.

434
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:08,057
A match of wits.

435
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,790
On the surface, we'll be
two friendly classmates.

436
00:21:10,824 --> 00:21:14,924
But in reality, we'll actually
be investigating each other.

437
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,690
This is interesting, Ryuga.

438
00:21:16,724 --> 00:21:19,890
If it's my friendship you
want, I'll gladly accept it.

439
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:22,290
In time, I'll earn your trust.

440
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,890
And once you've told
me what I want to know,

441
00:21:24,924 --> 00:21:27,624
there'll be no point
keeping you alive.

442
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:31,924
Then I'll kill you, with
my hands if I have to.

443
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,424
Hmm.

444
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:42,070
[theme music]

445
00:22:51,106 --> 00:22:52,972
LIGHT YAGAMI (VOICEOVER):
I don't see any way

446
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,705
that Ryuga, or L, can profile
me based on a tennis match.

447
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:58,639
So I have to assume he has
some other goal in mind.

448
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:02,272
Either way, I'm not
going to let him win.
