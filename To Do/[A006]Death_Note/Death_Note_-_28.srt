00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:14,300
[theme music]

2
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,091
-Wow, it's been a long time.

3
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:42,858
Thank you for always taking
such good care of my father.

4
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:44,324
-Gee, Sayu.

5
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:46,291
You're all grown up.

6
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:47,091
-This is Yagami.

7
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:48,424
MELLO (ON PHONE): Look.

8
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,924
About trading the director
in exchange for the notebook.

9
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,824
It's been cancelled.

10
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:53,891
The new deal is this.

11
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:56,858
The notebook for Sayu Yagami.

12
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:59,424
Come to LA, by
yourself, in two days,

13
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,424
and bring the notebook with you.

14
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:06,124
-I'm pleased to meet you
at last, L number two.

15
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:09,491
I am at the center of the SPK.

16
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:12,824
You can address me as N.

17
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:13,758
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): N?

18
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,091
Who is this guys?

19
00:02:15,124 --> 00:02:16,991
Is he joking?

20
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:19,291
But this strange feeling.

21
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:20,524
What is it?

22
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:30,291
N. Why do I feel like
I'm talking to L?

23
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,791
NEAR (MODIFIED VOICE): I told
you that we wouldn't rely on L,

24
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:34,324
but that's a bit of
an understatement.

25
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:36,991
The FBI and the
CIA have explicitly

26
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,691
asked that I head up
their investigation.

27
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:39,891
Not you.

28
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,891
Having said that,
we are outraged

29
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:43,958
by the recent murder of
the direct of the NPA

30
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:46,158
and feel something must be done.

31
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:47,724
After revealing
the information, I

32
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:49,958
believe there's a possibility
that solving this case

33
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,758
could lead to the
arrest of Kira.

34
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,324
As such, I'm willing to
lend you my full support.

35
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,258
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Lead
to the arrest of Kira?

36
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,891
Who is he anyway?

37
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,491
This confidence

38
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:02,391
NEAR (MODIFIED VOICE):
Is there a problem, L?

39
00:03:02,424 --> 00:03:03,558
-N-- No.

40
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,824
It's just that, following
the death of Takimura,

41
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:08,091
Deputy Director Yagami's
daughter was kidnapped,

42
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,324
and we believe the same
person is behind it.

43
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,291
He's arranged for a
trade in Los Angeles.

44
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:13,591
NEAR (MODIFIED VOICE): A trade?

45
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:16,958
The girl in exchange for
the notebook, I assume.

46
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,291
-Yes.

47
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,458
-Understood.

48
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,958
I'll have a team
on standby in LA,

49
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:23,958
but for now, they'll be working
on a need to know basis.

50
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:27,124
Also, I can monitor
the city via satellite.

51
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:30,724
Or-- (MODIFIED VOICE)
On second thought,

52
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:36,458
I'll let you have full
authority on this, L.

53
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,424
-That's good.

54
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,958
It means we're taking the lead.

55
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:40,591
-But what's all this
about the Americans

56
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:41,691
not trusting L anymore?

57
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:42,991
I don't like the sound of that.

58
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:47,391
-Near, is it really
safe to leave this case

59
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:48,591
in the hands of a fake L?

60
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,924
He hasn't had any success
in catching Kira so far.

61
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:52,891
-I'm aware of that.

62
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:54,291
That's why it's a good idea.

63
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:55,724
It means there'll
be an opportunity

64
00:03:55,758 --> 00:03:57,624
to take advantage of him.

65
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:00,458
Of course, saving people's
lives is important.

66
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:03,424
But, as the SPK, our
primary goal is very clear.

67
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,024
We'll work to get the
notebook and capture Kira

68
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:09,291
once and for all.

69
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:10,291
CHIEF YAGAMI: Light.

70
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:11,924
-Hm?

71
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,958
-At this point, I don't
care if it costs me my life.

72
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:17,324
Please, just save Sayu.

73
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,724
Promise me.

74
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,524
-Stop talking like that, dad.

75
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:24,958
You might have made your
peace with the idea of dying,

76
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:26,758
but have you ever
thought about how painful

77
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,091
it would be for everyone
else you leave behind?

78
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:31,191
I'd never be able to
forgive you if you ended up

79
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:33,324
dying in front of Sayu.

80
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:34,458
Look.

81
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:35,958
It's true that you might
lose contact with us.

82
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:38,624
But if that happens and you have
to make a split second decision

83
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:41,058
by yourself, then I want
you to do whatever's

84
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:44,258
necessary to make sure both you
and Sayu get out of this alive.

85
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,091
Promise me, dad.

86
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:50,191
-All right.

87
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:50,658
MISA: What?

88
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,591
No way!

89
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:56,324
You really want me to go
to Los Angeles with you?

90
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:57,691
-Yeah.

91
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,291
There's a chance I might need
to use your eyes this time,

92
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:02,091
so I want to have you close by.

93
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:03,491
-Oh, Light!

94
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:05,291
You're the best!

95
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:06,291
Oh, my gosh.

96
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:08,258
I better start
packing right away.

97
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:17,591
Let's see.

98
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:19,558
Which one should I bring?

99
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:20,958
I can't decide.

100
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:21,591
Light!

101
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:23,424
Which do you like?

102
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,191
Huh?

103
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:26,691
Hm.

104
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:41,324
-If things go badly, I
may have to kill Sayu.

105
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,158
Dad.

106
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:54,191
I'll fly to LA ahead
of you and make

107
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:55,924
preparations for the hand over.

108
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,891
Ide and the others should
arrive shortly after.

109
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,824
But to be safe, we should
arrive on separate flights.

110
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:03,758
Aizawa, I want you to tail
my father closely and get

111
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,158
on the same plane as him, just
in case something goes wrong.

112
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,358
AIZAWA: Got it.

113
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,024
I'm gonna get a haircut so
they won't recognize me.

114
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,091
LIGHT: OK, everyone.

115
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,591
I'm counting on you.

116
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:38,924
-Mr. Yagami.

117
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:39,824
-Who are you?

118
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,524
One of the kidnappers?

119
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:44,324
-You're going to
board flight SE333.

120
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:45,758
I have your tickets with me.

121
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,724
It leaves from Gate 18.

122
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:48,291
-Right.

123
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,024
I understand.

124
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:51,924
-Someone has intercepted
him at [inaudible].

125
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:52,758
Should I arrest him?

126
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,824
LIGHT: Calm down, Aizawa.

127
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,358
Don't make any sudden.

128
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:57,758
I can understand your
concern, but arresting him now

129
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,458
will accomplish nothing.

130
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:02,258
Keep your distance, and
don't lose sight of them.

131
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,224
-Damn it, They're boarding
a difference flight

132
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,224
than originally planned.

133
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:09,824
I'll tell them at the gate I'm
a police officer, and they'll--

134
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:11,391
LIGHT: Get a hold of yourself!

135
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:13,958
You'd just blow your cover
the operation would be ruined.

136
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:15,791
Can you find out where
the flight is headed?

137
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:16,991
-Let's see.

138
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:18,358
Huh?

139
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:19,524
This one's going to LA too.

140
00:07:19,558 --> 00:07:21,658
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Could
they have somehow arranged

141
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,491
for another plane.

142
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:24,091
Oh, this is bad.

143
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:38,091
MAN: Flight SE33, Flight
SE333, do you copy?

144
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,124
Do you copy?

145
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,391
You have strayed from
your flight path.

146
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:43,791
PILOT: This is Flight SE333.

147
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:45,891
I read you loud and clear.

148
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,191
I assure you, everything's OK.

149
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:49,791
This is a detour.

150
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:51,058
-What the-- What is this?

151
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:53,991
You need to tell me,
what's going on up there?

152
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:55,958
-This is not a hijacking.

153
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:58,691
We're simply making a
detour, and a quick stop

154
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:00,024
to drop off a passenger.

155
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:01,558
You can track us by radar.

156
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,058
However, if you attempt to call
the authorities to interfere

157
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:07,624
with our course, I will not
hesitate to crash the plane

158
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:09,524
and take all the
passengers with me.

159
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,624
-This is bad, Light.

160
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:18,058
I mean L. The deputy
director's flight has just

161
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,358
changed direction.

162
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:21,824
A passenger's gonna be
dropped off somewhere.

163
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,024
It can only be him.

164
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:24,158
LIGHT (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

165
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:25,658
What the hell is going on?

166
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:28,758
I already checked today's flight
crews and passenger lists ahead

167
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,858
of time.

168
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:32,358
No one on board was suspicious.

169
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:34,191
The pilot's a veteran
of over 15 years.

170
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:37,458
The co-pilot checks
out clean, too.

171
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,224
Then the kidnappers
are powerful enough

172
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:42,658
to influence these people.

173
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:43,858
Looks like I have no choice.

174
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:50,291
Director, this is L. Get me N.

175
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:51,391
-Right.

176
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:52,758
LIGHT (ON PHONE): N.
I'm sure you're aware

177
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,258
of our current situation.

178
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,724
I need you to do me a favor.

179
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:57,958
Can you notify the airline's
police and military

180
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:59,991
on your end not to
take any action yet?

181
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:01,058
-What's he thinking?

182
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:04,524
I never realized he
was this unreliable.

183
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:06,591
-All right, L. Agreed.

184
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:08,891
We'll locate the landing
site and keep surveillance

185
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:12,424
over the area using our
satellite video feed.

186
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,224
If there's anything
else we can do,

187
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:15,424
don't hesitate to let us know.

188
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,024
-I have a message for you.

189
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:22,191
Put this in your ear.

190
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:29,324
MELLO (ON EARPIECE): Yagami.

191
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:31,824
Right now, you're the only
one who can hear my voice.

192
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,491
Listen very carefully.

193
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:36,658
I'm the one who
kidnapped your daughter.

194
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:39,891
But don't get the wrong idea.

195
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:41,924
I have no interest in
your daughter's life one

196
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,424
way or the other, or
yours, for that matter.

197
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,658
There's only one thing I want,
and you know what that is.

198
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,558
The notebook.

199
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,158
Now, all you have to do
is follow my instructions.

200
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:56,624
If you do that,
no one has to die.

201
00:09:56,658 --> 00:09:59,191
As for the trade, I've prepared
things so that both of us

202
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,391
can walk away satisfied.

203
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:03,658
Play along, and
there'll be no problems.

204
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,091
CHIEF YAGAMI
(VOICEOVER): I'm going

205
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:08,491
to give the notebook to
some criminal in exchange

206
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,991
for my daughter's life.

207
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:15,524
When the time comes, what's
the right thing to do?

208
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:20,858
As a police officer, as a
human being, and as a parent?

209
00:10:59,290 --> 00:10:59,757
[ringing]

210
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:05,990
-L, we've been able to
use our satellite cameras

211
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:08,090
to pinpoint where
the plane has landed.

212
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:09,590
I'll send you a
direct video feed

213
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:11,990
of what we're
currently seeing here.

214
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:13,457
-Dad.

215
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,923
-Heh, heh, heh.

216
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,590
So what's going to happen?

217
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,790
How will he make the exchange
in a place like that?

218
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,157
MELLO: You see the
entrance, don't you, Yagami?

219
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,423
Go inside.

220
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:41,757
-They're underground?

221
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,457
-Well, well.

222
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,223
Isn't that interesting?

223
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,257
-Dammit.

224
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,523
An underground facility?

225
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:50,923
The kidnapper must
have predicted

226
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,557
that we'd be watching
him by satellite.

227
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,623
That means there's no way
to keep an eye on Dad.

228
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:12,357
[gunshots]

229
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:20,390
-The glass is bulletproof.

230
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:22,923
Understand?

231
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:25,157
This place used to belong
to a crime syndicate.

232
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,723
They used to make
trades just like this.

233
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:31,123
We've made a few
modifications, as well.

234
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:32,723
Slide the notebook through here.

235
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:34,923
Once that's done,
I'll release the lock.

236
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:37,823
We'll both step back
and spin the glass door.

237
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:42,057
The notebook will end up on my
side, and the girl on yours.

238
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,823
However, if you don't
agree to this trade,

239
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,757
I'll shoot your daughter
through this opening.

240
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,590
NEAR (MODIFIED VOICE):
L, do you have a plan?

241
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:00,290
You can't seriously think
that handing the notebook over

242
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:03,857
to someone you don't know
is it good idea, can you?

243
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,823
-All right, Y462.

244
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:07,557
Proceed.

245
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,090
-First, open the notebook
and insert it halfway

246
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,423
into the slot in the
glass door on your left.

247
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:19,557
-(VOICEOVER) Dammit,
dammit, dammit.

248
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,490
It's setback after setback.

249
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:23,457
And I've only just
arrived in the US,

250
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,523
so I'm not in any position
to start giving orders

251
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:28,157
to the American police.

252
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,957
At this rate, the
notebook's gonna be--

253
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,790
-Light, is everything OK?

254
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:34,223
Is something wrong?

255
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:35,523
You look kind of--

256
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:39,223
-Misa, just shut up and do
what I told you, all right?

257
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:41,823
Look, I need you to keep
killing Japanese criminals,

258
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:42,890
so just do that.

259
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,523
This guy's obviously
investigating Kira,

260
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,923
and he won't give up.

261
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,823
If the killings are
delayed, we're in trouble.

262
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:49,423
Don't you understand?

263
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:50,857
-Uh-- OK.

264
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,123
But who is this guy?

265
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:54,590
-Just get on with
it, all right!?

266
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:58,390
-Taking out your
anger on her, huh?

267
00:13:58,423 --> 00:13:58,923
-Hm?

268
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,423
-(VOICEOVER) I
can still make it.

269
00:14:05,457 --> 00:14:11,357
But at this rate, is my
only option to kill Sayu?

270
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,657
-Now, then, I'll
test the notebook.

271
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,490
-Test it?

272
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:15,457
You're going to kill someone?

273
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,957
No, I can't allow that.

274
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,723
-We can't make the
trade without making

275
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,290
sure it's the real thing.

276
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:23,723
Do you really want to
see your daughter die?

277
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,323
-(VOICEOVER) I can't do it.

278
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,690
No one but the police
knows about this case.

279
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:43,057
If Sayu dies, I can't
blame her death on Kira.

280
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:48,890
-What's wrong?

281
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,790
You OK, Miller?

282
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:51,890
-Look.

283
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,090
That's what you get
when you steal from me

284
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:55,390
and sell goods behind my back.

285
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:56,723
He was a worthlss idiot.

286
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:59,323
This is the first
time he's been useful.

287
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,890
-Y462, the target is dead.

288
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:06,690
-It seems the notebook
is genuine after all.

289
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:07,757
Now let it go.

290
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,523
We'll make the exchange
for your daughter.

291
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:19,823
-Dad.

292
00:15:19,857 --> 00:15:20,623
Sayu.

293
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:22,723
-Hey, they actually made it.

294
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:24,923
-The suspect is headed
for a helicopter.

295
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,957
Based on our intel, that's his
only method of transportation.

296
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,890
-So this means we can
be absolutely certain

297
00:15:30,923 --> 00:15:32,457
that the notebook
has been exchanged.

298
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:36,223
-Be careful.

299
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:37,790
We still don't know
what they're planning

300
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:39,523
to do beyond this point.

301
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:41,990
N, I need you to maintain
surveillance of that helicopter

302
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,757
until it lands.

303
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,790
Don't lose sight of
it, no matter what.

304
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:49,990
-You seem to think that's
quite an easy task.

305
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:51,523
Nevertheless, we'll
do what we can.

306
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:54,823
(MODIFIED VOICE) I'm sorry.

307
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:57,123
I'm afraid we've been tricked.

308
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:57,623
-Huh?

309
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,190
A missile?

310
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,657
-Whoa.

311
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,957
-We won't be able to
track that with radar.

312
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,790
-Is the notebook on that thing?

313
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,823
-The missile's been launched.

314
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,857
-The missile or the helicopter?

315
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,557
Which one?

316
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,757
-Boss, I'm sure
you were watching.

317
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,457
I did everyting you asked
me to, just let we planned.

318
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,290
-Yeah, I saw that.

319
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:42,523
Good job.

320
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:44,657
-Then this is going to wipe
out all those past screw

321
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,657
ups of mine, right?

322
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,823
-Oh, yeah.

323
00:16:46,857 --> 00:16:49,357
Wiped out for sure.

324
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:49,957
Do it.

325
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,290
-Near, the helicopter.

326
00:16:57,323 --> 00:16:58,690
-I thought so.

327
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:01,023
-In that case, it means
the notebook is definitely

328
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:02,057
on the missile.

329
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,957
-Damn!

330
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,057
We can't track it.

331
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:04,957
We've lost the signal.

332
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,523
It could be anywhere now.

333
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:02,190
-It won't be difficult
to retrieve the missile

334
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:04,390
once it lands in
a deserted area.

335
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:08,123
He would have already laid out
the flight plan accordingly.

336
00:18:08,157 --> 00:18:10,623
Should be getting his hands on
the notebook any moment now.

337
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:14,623
And when he does, I have a good
idea of what he'll do next.

338
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:33,590
[groan]

339
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,557
[groan]

340
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:56,490
[gunshot]

341
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,457
[beeping]

342
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,290
NEAR: (MODIFIED VOICE) L.

343
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:26,690
-Yes?

344
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:28,257
NEAR: (MODIFIED
VOICE) He got us.

345
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,790
-Got you?

346
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:30,923
NEAR: (MODIFIED VOICE) Yes.

347
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,657
The majority of
the SPK's members

348
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,257
have just been killed
by the notebook.

349
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,757
L, you were the one who
handed over the notebook

350
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,857
without a fight.

351
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,223
You and your people
were totally helpless.

352
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:47,590
-N-- are you saying if
you were in command,

353
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:50,057
you wouldn't have
handed it over?

354
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,023
-No.

355
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,190
Considering their
preparations, it

356
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:55,890
would have been
impossible to avoid this.

357
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:58,357
There's really no
point in us quarreling.

358
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,457
I propose we work
together and share

359
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,757
the information we know so far.

360
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,557
For starters, I
should admit that I

361
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,457
have a very good idea of who the
culprit behind this might be.

362
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,023
I suspect the
person who arranged

363
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,623
the kidnapping and
the trade is someone

364
00:20:12,657 --> 00:20:15,057
who goes by the name Mello.

365
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,923
-Mello?

366
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:17,590
Who's he?

367
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:20,623
-I don't have his photograph,
and I don't know his real name.

368
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:23,357
All I know about him is
that four years ago, he

369
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,290
was living at an orphanage
located in Winchester, England,

370
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:28,957
known as Wammy's House.

371
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,923
LIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Wammy's House?

372
00:20:30,957 --> 00:20:33,857
That's the place
Watari established.

373
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,923
-I believe Mello is
playing a game with me.

374
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:39,523
He wants to see which of us will
be the first to take down Kira.

375
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:40,590
The final challenge.

376
00:20:52,623 --> 00:20:56,257
-Uh, "Armo Justin?"

377
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,523
-It's Armonia Justin.

378
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,423
-M'kay.

379
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,523
Um, I've got a little problem.

380
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:04,390
I went to the king to report
that I lost my notebook,

381
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:06,590
but after I described
it to him, the old man

382
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:09,790
said that Ryuk said it was
his, and that he had dropped it

383
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:12,290
and took it.

384
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:14,723
So, what do you think I
should do to get it back?

385
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:19,157
-Guess you have no choice but to
find Ryuk and ask him yourself.

386
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,857
-Yeah, that's what I thought.

387
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,123
So, I guess I have to
go to the human world.

388
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:26,690
-Yep.

389
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:28,023
That's right.

390
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:30,090
Have fun.

391
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,619
-Well, that sucks.

392
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:42,125
[theme music]

393
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:52,046
LIGHT: Calm down and listen.

394
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,213
On November 10, 11:59 PM, all
the mafia members will die.

395
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:59,346
That moment will be
your only opportunity

396
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,413
to get the notebook back.
