00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:19,977
<i>Since I was little,</i>
<i>I've had a question in my mind.</i>

3
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:23,811
<i>Why am I only myself</i>
<i>and not someone else?</i>

4
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,677
<i>I'm aware that</i>

5
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:27,211
<i>"I think, therefore I am"</i>

6
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,177
<i>are the words</i>
<i>of a great ancient philosopher,</i>

7
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:33,177
<i>but when I thought,</i>
<i>I thought about someone else,</i>

8
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:37,111
<i>that perhaps the other person</i>
<i>was myself, too.</i>

[birds singing]

10
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:00,897
<i>Think about others.</i>

11
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:02,131
<i>When I did that,</i>

12
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:03,997
<i>I turned into someone else...</i>

13
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,364
[groaning]

14
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:08,464
<i>...but for no more than</i>
<i>five seconds.</i>

15
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:09,831
<i>Furthermore, for the duration,</i>

16
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,331
<i>my body completely lost</i>
<i>consciousness</i>

17
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,631
<i>and just collapsed</i>
<i>wherever I stood.</i>

18
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:17,864
<i>I often found myself injured</i>
<i>in some way.</i>

19
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:21,431
<i>And I could only possess</i>
<i>someone that was within</i>
<i>my line of sight,</i>

20
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:24,231
<i>so I couldn't use it</i>
<i>for lewd things.</i>

21
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:26,431
<i>I mostly possessed people</i>
<i>who pissed me off,</i>

22
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:29,364
<i>picked a fight with a stranger,</i>
<i>and returned to myself.</i>

23
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:32,497
<i>That kind of retaliation</i>
<i>was all I could use this for.</i>

‐[laughing]
‐[man] Oh, that's funny!

25
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,731
Huh?

26
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:44,231
[man] You bastard!
What the hell are you doing?

[invisible punches landing]

28
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,731
<i>But finally, I came up</i>
<i>with a brilliant idea</i>

29
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:51,497
<i>that could take full advantage</i>
<i>of my special ability.</i>

30
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:54,864
Hmm.
You have five minutes left.

31
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:04,264
<i>I could possess</i>
<i>one smart person in class</i>
<i>after another,</i>

[snickers]

36
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:24,664
<i>Of course, I was planning</i>
<i>on attending a very</i>
<i>prestigious high school.</i>

37
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:26,897
<i>However,</i>
<i>unlike the normal test,</i>

38
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,197
<i>I didn't know who was</i>
<i>intelligent during</i>
<i>an entrance exam.</i>

39
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:33,431
<i>And so I snuck into</i>
<i>top‐rated cram schools,</i>

40
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:37,897
<i>one after another, pretending</i>
<i>to be one of the students</i>
<i>attending there.</i>

41
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:41,497
<i>Which students applied</i>
<i>to which schools</i>

42
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:43,531
<i>and which subjects</i>
<i>were they best at?</i>

43
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:46,631
<i>I researched</i>
<i>all of that thoroughly.</i>

44
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:49,231
<i>I found one student</i>
<i>after another</i>

45
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:51,164
<i>vying to enter</i>
<i>the same school I was</i>

46
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:52,897
<i>that I could possess</i>
<i>and take answers from.</i>

47
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:56,731
<i>And I was admitted</i>
<i>to an elite high school.</i>

48
00:02:56,731 --> 00:03:00,197
[man] Now a word from the
representative for new students.

49
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:03,397
‐Yu Otosaka, please come up.
‐Yes.

50
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:07,764
‐[boy] So that means he's
the very top of the class.
‐And he's good‐looking, too.

51
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:12,731
[clears throat, snickers]

[clears throat]

53
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:19,897
Today, for us new students,
you have organized a grand
ceremony to welcome us here,

54
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:21,964
and we are deeply grateful.

55
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:25,097
Wrapped in the warm rays
of the spring sunshine...

56
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:26,731
[girl] Hey, hey!

57
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:29,997
‐Huh?
‐He's really good‐looking,
isn't he?

58
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:32,197
Yeah. He might even be
your type.

59
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:33,731
My type, huh?

60
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:37,364
Well, I think you think he might
be your type, too!

61
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:39,031
‐Humph!
‐[titters]

62
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:43,631
On behalf of all of us,
thank you for the opportunity.

63

[applause]

64
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:48,897
[students murmuring]

65
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:51,397
Hmm.

66
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:03,464
[Yu] <i>This again.</i>

67
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:05,331
<i>This is happening</i>
<i>more and more often.</i>

68
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:08,464
<i>Not only am I at the top</i>
<i>of the class academically,</i>

69
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:10,164
<i>I'm one of the more attractive.</i>

70
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,331
<i>It's impossible</i>
<i>to not be popular.</i>

71
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:15,797
<i>Sheesh! I'll just</i>
<i>hurry them all on home.</i>

72
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,897
[Sugimoto] I'm sorry
for calling you
all the way out here.

73
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:22,164
Don't worry about it.
So, what did you want from me?

74
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:25,964
I, um... I'm fine starting
as just friends.

75
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:28,797
But can you maybe think
about dating me, please?!

76
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:31,731
The thing is,

77
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,464
in order to keep my grades up
at where they are now,

78
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:37,097
I have to shave time from sleep
to keep studying.

79
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:40,097
I don't have the luxury
of relationships.

80
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:42,664
So... I'm sorry.

81
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:44,964
<i>Of course</i>
<i>that's a pack of lies.</i>

82
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:47,264
<i>I don't study at all, ever.</i>

83
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:50,331
[Sugimoto] Oh, I see.
I understand.

84
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,731
I'm sorry for calling you out
like this so suddenly.

85
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,264
[Yu sighs]

86
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:57,097
[Yu] <i>There's no way</i>
<i>I would ever choose</i>

87
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,697
<i>a plain, normal girl like you.</i>

88
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:01,197
<i>The one I'm after...</i>

89
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:05,897
‐You mean you didn't watch
that TV special last night?
‐Huh‐uh.

90
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:08,731
<i>...is the madonna</i>
<i>of this school, of course.</i>

91

<i>Yumi Shirayanagi.</i>

93
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:16,064
<i>I will make... you mine!</i>

94
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:18,864
<i>I know I'll definitely get</i>
<i>a chance.</i>

95
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:21,464
<i>It all lies in how I use</i>
<i>the five seconds,</i>

96
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:24,431
<i>which are the limits</i>
<i>of my ability.</i>

97
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:28,197
‐[yawns]
‐[Yu] <i>That's it!</i>

98
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:31,264
‐So then I...
‐Huh?

99
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,431
[Yumi] Mitchon,
what's the matter?

100
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:53,231
‐[horn blaring]
‐[man] Did you see that?
She almost got run over.

101
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,364
[Yumi] Huh?

102
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:57,164
[man] It looks like
the airbag saved him.

103
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:58,664
[Yumi] I'm so glad.

104
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:00,031
[Yu sighs]

105
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:02,664
[Yu] <i>That was close,</i>
<i>but it went according to plan.</i>

106
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,664
Oh, Yumi!

107
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,131
‐[Mitchon] Are you all right?
‐Yeah, that was really
a close one.

108
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:11,564
Yumi, you were about to be
run over by a truck.

109
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:14,331
Otosaka from class one
ran out and saved you.

110
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,064
Really? Is that true?

111
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:18,764
Yeah. Are you hurt at all?

112
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:20,464
Ow!

113
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,064
Let's go to the nurse.
Can you walk?

114
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:26,297
Uh... yes.

115
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:31,364
[Yu] Well, guess I'll go home.

116
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:33,597
Please, wait a minute!

117
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:37,664
Um, you see, the two of us,
we're just about to walk over

118
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:41,097
to our favorite restaurant
to eat our favorite pancakes
together.

119
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:43,897
Would you like to come with us?

120
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:45,731
Sorry, I think I'm gonna pass.

121
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:47,664
It's better to keep this
among friends.

122
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:51,631
But you just put yourself
in danger in order
to save my life.

123
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:54,364
I'd like to properly repay that

124
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:57,597
and I'd like to talk with you
a little while longer.

125
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,097
Whoa, I have a phone call.
Who is it?

126
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:04,164
Huh? Then I'll go home
right away.

127
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:06,397
Mitchon, what's the matter?

128
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:08,864
My big brother suddenly
came back from Kyoto

129
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:11,597
and he apparently
ordered top‐end sushi
for the whole family.

130
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,331
So I'm leaving the rest
to you two. Bye!

131
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,564
[Yu] <i>That was an obvious farce,</i>

132
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:19,797
<i>but a nice assist nonetheless,</i>
<i>Mitchon.</i>

133
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:25,164
[waiter] Enjoy your meal.

134
00:07:25,164 --> 00:07:28,531
[pop music in background]

135
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,264
Wait a sec, there's
a special way to eat this.

136
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,097
‐Uh...
‐Just copy me.

137
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:37,731
[Yumi] If you do this,
the syrup gets across
the entire thing.

138
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:41,464
Then stack them up,
cut them up,
and try a bite of it.

139
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,697
[gulp]

140
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:49,097
Mmm!

141
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:51,731
Amazing. Just by changing
how you eat it,

142
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:54,631
it gets this delicious?
I never realized.

143
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:59,997
It's delicious
every single time.

144
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:03,131
Uh... um...

145
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:06,331
The song they're playing
right now is "How‐Low‐Hello,"
isn't it?

146
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:07,797
[Yu] Huh? Hallow‐hello?

147
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:10,364
[Yumi] You look like you've
never heard of them.

148
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,097
I thought every boy our age
knew them really well.

149
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:15,764
So that's what's popular
nowadays?

150
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:19,831
[Yumi] Otosaka, can we walk
home together after school

151
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,264
or go out to eat like this
again sometime?

152
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:26,097
Hmm... Sure, I guess. Why not?

153
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:27,897
I'm so glad!

154
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:29,664

I'm making someone wait, so I'm

00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:11,731
This is an exact copy
of your answer sheet

169
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,131
to the aptitude test
you took the other day.

170
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:15,731
You managed a perfect score.

171
00:09:15,731 --> 00:09:18,431
The same test has been placed
right there.

172
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:21,731
Right here and now, try to get
a perfect score again.

173
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:24,497
Huh? Why do I
have to take it again?

174
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,697
You've been accused of possibly
cheating on the exam.

175
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:30,897
If you score 90% or above,
you're innocent.

176
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:32,264
It not, you're guilty.

177
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:34,697
[Yu] This is ridiculous.
I'm leaving now.

178
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:36,397
Regarding this,
we have the support

179
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:39,231
of both the principal
and the vice‐principal.

180
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:43,097
If you leave now, you will be
expelled from school.

181
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,464
Expelled?!

182
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:46,564
[Omura] Now, please begin.

183
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:55,464
[Yu] <i>All of the answers</i>
<i>are right there.</i>

184
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,964
<i>I'll just possess him</i>
<i>and find out what they are.</i>

185
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,731
<i>It's the only way.</i>

186
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:06,864
<i>He's making a fool of me!</i>

187
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:11,131
Huh?
What in the world just happened?

188
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,464
[Yu] I don't know.
It seemed like you were

189
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:15,231
just tearing
whatever that was up.

190
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:16,664
We got enough.

191
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:19,031
[Yu screams]

192
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:22,297
I'm Tomori,
student council president.

193
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:24,164
Of another school, though.

194
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,764
So, I've been recording you
since you got here.

195
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:29,131
Please take a look at
the video I just recorded.

196
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:31,064
and take a note of the time.

197
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:35,031
You were not looking at Omura
the moment he ripped up
the answer sheet.

198
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:37,031
Yet you said he ripped it up.

199
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:38,864
Isn't that a bit strange?

200
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:41,464
I'll show you others.

201
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:45,664
You have a special ability
to possess other people.

202
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:49,664
Using that,
you cheat on every exam.

203
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,664
Isn't that right?

204
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:54,464
Th‐That's not true.
It's a sleeping disease.

205
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:56,131
I suddenly
get tremendously sleepy

206
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:58,431
and can't fight the urge
to nod off.

207
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,431
You really are troublesome.

208
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:02,564
I'll show you this, then.
Look.

209
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:04,831
A copy of a recent
medical exam.

210
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,097
[sighs] According to this,
you have no disease.

211
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:11,931
Now, please solve
the problems on the test.

212
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:13,497
[groans]

213
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:16,764
I can't deal with this!
Leave me alone!

214
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,464
There he goes.

215
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:25,864
She even foresaw that things
would end up this way.

216
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:30,664
Huh? Well then.
Everything from here on
is my job.

217
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:32,264
[gasping]

218
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:37,164
Start running! Right now!

219
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,631
[shrieks]

220
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,664
Damn it!

221
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:44,331
Are you injured?

222
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,964
No, I'm fine,
but what's wrong with him?

223
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:49,497
[scoffs]

224
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:56,297
[gasping]

225
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:00,364
Huh?

226
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,597
[boom!]

227
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:10,831
Huh?

228
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,131
[muted shouting, alarm sounds]

229
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,364
[gasps, snarls]

230
00:12:21,064 --> 00:12:22,531
[boom!]

231
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:29,831
What?! What the hell
is going on here?!

232
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:39,097
[panting]

233
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,764
[gasp]

234
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:01,664
[shrieks]

235
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:24,297
Uggh! [coughs]

236
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:27,297
What the hell?
What did you just do?

237
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:30,431
‐That was teleportation.
‐Teleportation?

238
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,531
Yes. Just like it sounds.

239
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:35,064
I instantly move
to another location.

240
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,231
Only I can't stop
where I want.

241
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:39,264
Thanks to my special ability,

242
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:42,131
I don't know how many times
I've been hospitalized.

243
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,331
[Yu thinking]
<i>What a half‐assed ability.</i>

244
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:47,497
So, anyway, what are you
planning on doing with me now?

245
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:50,497
[Tomori] We are having you
transferred over to our school.

246
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,797
Transfer?

247
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:58,897
[Tomori] In this world,
there are many people
who possess special powers.

248
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:00,797
‐You're not the only one.
‐What?

249
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:04,397
But those powers are somewhat
like an illness caught
during adolescence

250
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:05,864
and will disappear
in due time.

251
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:09,031
Until it goes away,
you will attend classes

252
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,464
at the Hoshinoumi Academy
with us.

253
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,331
I already have permission

254
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:15,597
from those that have
parental authority over you.

255
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:18,331
‐You mean all this is...?
‐Is real.

256
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:22,231
I gotta say, you seem
like you'd be popular
from just your good looks.

257
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:26,364
Did you really need to play
the genius by cheating
as much as possible?

258
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:28,431
That's the real question here,
isn't it?

259
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,631
But, thanks to that,
you were able to get close

260
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:33,097
to that female student
you were targeting.

261
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:35,497
[growls] Damn you!

262
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,831
[punches landing]

263
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:49,464
What the...? She disappeared?

264
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:53,364
‐That is her special ability.
‐[Yu] It can't be.

265
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:56,164
[Yu] How can you just become
invisible?

266
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:58,397
Actually, to me it looks like

267
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,831
you simply stood there
and let her punch you
in the face.

268
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:04,297
No way. I was the only one
that couldn't see her?

269
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:05,997
[Takajo] Right.

270
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:09,464
Her ability is to hide
from visual recognition
from one target.

271
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:12,597
Every other human
can see her as normal.

272
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:15,164
[Yu]
<i>Another half‐assed ability.</i>

273
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,464
By the way, you will be
expected to serve on
our student council as well.

274
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:21,364
‐[Yu] Huh?
‐Your ability is useful,

275
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,831
so I'd like for you
to cooperate with us.

276
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:25,464
To do what?

277
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:28,697
To threaten those that abuse
their powers for no good,

278
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:30,197
just like you have.

279
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:34,397
Because that is
the kind of existence we are.

280
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:38,097
[Yu, weakly] I'm home.

281
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:41,064
Oh, hi!
Welcome back home, Big Brother.

282
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:43,597
Wow! What's wrong
with your face?

283
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:47,331
Oh, well, I, um,
had an accident in gym class?

284
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:51,164
Oh, right, we got an amazing
phone call from our uncle
while you were gone.

285
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:54,031
He said that you and I
were immediately going
to be transferred

286
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:58,364
over to Hoshinoumi Academy's
middle school and high school
as scholarship students.

287
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:00,831
Is that really true,
Big Brother?

288
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,431
[Yu]
<i>Are you serious?</i>

289
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:04,331
[Yu] Yes, it's true.

290
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,664
Yay! This will be great
for the house budget!

291
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:10,897
And uncle is sending us
lots of tasty food
so that we can celebrate.

292
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:13,597
But this means that you
have to transfer schools.

293
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,897
You're gonna have to say
goodbye to all your friends.

294
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:17,964
Yeah, but we can use
smart phones

295
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:19,697
to video‐chat with one another,

296
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:22,197
so it's not going to be
all that big a deal.

297
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,464
[Yu drily] I see.

298
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:28,764
Tonight's dinner
is gonna be... ta‐da!

299
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:32,064
Omelet rice: your favorite dish,
Big Brother Yu.

300
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:33,731
[Yu] <i>This again?</i>

301
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:37,464
<i>I've told her a million times,</i>
<i>it was only when I was little.</i>

302
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,831
[Ayumi] Congratulations to us.
All right now, let's eat.

303
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,164
[giggles]

304
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:43,964
[Yu] <i>So sweet!</i>

305
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:46,897
<i>Using this pizza sauce</i>
<i>as the secret ingredient</i>

306
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:50,431
<i>must have been fitting</i>
<i>for my tongue when I was</i>
<i>just a little child.</i>

307
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,431
‐How is it? Is it tasty?
‐Yeah, it's tasty.

308
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:56,731
Wow, really?
It's the first time I've wanted

309
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:59,564
to eat Mom's omelet rice
in a while.

310
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:00,731
Our mom, huh?

311
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:03,864
Why would I even care
about someone like that?

312
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,431
Are you still upset?

313
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:07,397
Yeah, of course I am.

314
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:10,031
She selfishly divorced
and shoved custody
over to our uncle.

315
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:15,331
I don't understand much of it,
but I really wish you could be
more forgiving.

316
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:17,464
[Yu] We don't have parents
anymore.

317
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:20,431
Our only family is you and me.

318
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:21,864
I see.

319
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:25,364
But do you want to know
what I sometimes think?

320
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:28,764
That there is one more family
member out there somewhere.

321
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:31,197
You and I are the only siblings
we have.

322
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:33,197
Are you seeing someone
in your dreams?

323
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:34,997
Hmm, you're right.

324
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:37,231
But... it's a really
weird feeling,

325
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:39,164
as if it was actually true.

326
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:42,731
[Yu]
<i>It's totally a dream.</i>

327
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:48,064
Hey, we've got to be up
really early to move.

328
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:49,531
You should go get some sleep.

329
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:52,531
Oh, can't I have just a bit
more time, please?

330
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,997
Ayu, you really love stars,
don't you?

331
00:17:55,997 --> 00:18:00,664
[Ayumi] You can see way off
into the distance, where people
will never reach, you know.

332
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,997
I just think that, well,
that it's an amazing thing.

333
00:18:03,997 --> 00:18:07,231
[Yu] You know, if you
keep talking only about
the stars at school,

334
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,797
you'll end up isolated.

335
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,197
Really? Why is that?

336
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:12,597
In my experience,
a better strategy

337
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:14,797
is to try and liven up
the conversation,

338
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:18,131
by talking about movies and
TV shows instead of the stars.

339
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,597
Experience? Strategy?

340
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:23,797
It's OK if you don't get it.
Go to sleep soon.

341
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:25,797
[Ayumi] Roger that.

342
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:35,596
[guards snarl]

343
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:37,863
[Ayumi panting]

344
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:39,696
[giggles]

345
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:43,696
Whoa!

346
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,429
Wow!

347
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:50,396
This is an amazingly huge room!

348
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:54,596
Will you and I really be able
to use all this space alone,
Big Brother?

349
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:58,063
‐Uh, yeah.
‐[Ayumi] Thank you
for your hard work.

350
00:18:58,063 --> 00:19:00,896
I may not be much,
but please allow me to help.

351
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:03,563
Hey, just let the moving company
guys do it, OK?

352
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:06,929
I thought that I could at least
be a little bit of help.

353
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,029
But I shouldn't?

354
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:09,929
[Yu] Don't take their jobs
away from them.

355
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,429
Oh, what an amazing way
to look at this.

356
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:15,063
I never would have thought
of that.

357
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:18,396
[Yumi] So, what was going on
with you the other day?

358
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:20,429
That's something I can't say.

359
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:25,196
Anyway, I'm going
to have to transfer over to
Hoshinoumi Academy immediately.

360
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,396
‐Huh?
‐I can't tell you why.

361
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:30,596
It's kind of complicated.
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:33,029
[Yu]
<i>Until this ability goes away,</i>

363
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:36,963
<i>I can't be authorized to travel</i>
<i>to an area unsupervised.</i>

364
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:40,829
If you could come out there
to see me once in a while,
that would be great.

365
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,163
Yeah, but that's just
so far away.

366
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:46,396
Maybe you can come here
every so often
and see me instead?

367
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,829
'Fraid not. I'm really sorry,

368
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,129
but I can't come
on my own anymore.

369
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:52,363
But why?

370
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:54,296
I'm not allowed
to tell you that.

371
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:58,896
I'm forced to not mention
anything about any of this
to others.

372
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:02,263
There's absolutely nothing
I can do about it.

373
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:04,896
I'm very grateful
for what you've done.

374
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:06,796
That feeling
will never leave me.

375
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:09,796
However, the fact is that you
and I aren't dating yet,

376
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:13,329
so for me to chase you
in a one‐sided way like that

377
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,296
would make me feel
like some kind of stalker.

378
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,596
I really do feel bad about that.

379
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:21,896
But I can't come see you
on my own.

380
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,363
[Yumi] I understand.

381
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:25,996
From now on, let us walk
our own separate ways.

382
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:27,463
What? But that means...?

383
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:30,296
I will never forget the feeling
I have towards you.

384
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:34,196
You saved my life that day,
and I will forever be grateful.

385
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:35,563
And that is all.

386
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:37,529
This can't...

387
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,329
Thank you very much
for saving me like you did.

388
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:42,596
I really do appreciate it.

389
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:45,263
But this is where I bid you
a fond farewell.

390
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:46,929
Best of luck to you.

391
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:52,129
[Yu] <i>I got dumped!?</i>

392
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:53,696
<i>Me?</i>

393
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:56,496
[doorbells jangle,
door closes]

394
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:58,329
[girl] Hello?

395
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:02,363
‐Excuse me, I let myself in.
‐[Yu screams]

396
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:04,263
Why are you suddenly here?

397
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,063
It's tough
with just two of you.

398
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:07,363
We came here to help out.

399
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:09,129
[Ayumi] Oh, hi.

400
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:12,163
Are all of you from
the same high school
as my big brother?

401
00:21:12,163 --> 00:21:14,263
Yes. We're in
the student council.

402
00:21:14,263 --> 00:21:17,496
My name is Takajo
and this is Tomori.

403
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:21,563
Since it's after school now,
we thought we should stop by
and see if we could help.

404
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:22,929
You shouldn't have bothered.

405
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:24,929
[Tomori] Can we help you out,
please?

406
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,129
Of course,
we'd love to have your help.

407
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:28,429
Hmm.

408
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:31,229
[Yu]
<i>Yeah, petty cunning.</i>

409
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:33,729
So let's split up
and get things done.

410
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:35,463
Right!

411
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,196
Thank you so much.

412
00:21:40,496 --> 00:21:43,096
[Yu] <i>Huh? This must be</i>
<i>that tasty food</i>

413
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:46,963
<i>our uncle sent</i>
<i>to congratulate us</i>
<i>that Ayumi was talking about.</i>

414
00:21:49,296 --> 00:21:51,063
Whaaa...?

415
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:55,196
It's all instant ramen?!

416
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:57,596
I'll pretend I never saw this.

417
00:21:57,596 --> 00:22:00,596
Ayumi, can I show you
a magic trick?

418
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:03,563
[Ayumi] Oh. Yeah, Tomori.
I'd love to see one.

419
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:06,963
Now, stay right there.
I'll be back in just a second.

420
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:08,229
OK. What?

421
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:10,829
[nervous breathing]

422
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,063
Huh?

423
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,996
[shrieks]

424
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:15,529
That was amazing!

425
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,396
Even more amazing than
the people who are on TV.

426
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,729
Did you enjoy that?

427
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,796
[Yu]
<i>Don't use her ability</i>
<i>to mess around.</i>

428
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:24,796
<i>You wowed her</i>
<i>out of her senses.</i>

429
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:27,296
[Yu] If you're going to play,
you have to go home.

430
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:30,129
All right, fine.
Your big brother is scary.

431
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:34,496
Well, at least I appreciate
you helping us.

432
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,396
I guess it's time for us
to excuse ourselves.

433
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:39,596
You're going home?
But I'm going to make dinner

434
00:22:39,596 --> 00:22:41,663
and I'd love it
if you two would stay.

435
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:43,429
We don't have enough dishes.

436
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:46,563
‐Right, if he says so.
‐Oh!

437
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:48,363
[Tomori] It's all right,

438
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:51,063
'cause we'll meet again.

439
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:52,363
[Ayumi] Hmm.

440
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:55,763
[Ayumi giggles]

441
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:58,263
[woman singing in background]

442
00:22:58,263 --> 00:22:59,663
[Ayumi] Oh! "How‐Low‐Hello."

443
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:02,363
So it is a fad after all.

444
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:06,196
Ah, that's right!
Yusa Nishimori, Yusarin.

445
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:08,963
‐I think she's so cute.
‐[Yu sighs]

446
00:23:08,963 --> 00:23:13,129
[Yu] <i>That something</i>
<i>like this sells is a sign</i>
<i>of the apocalypse.</i>

447
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:16,563
You know what, Big Brother?

448
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,296
My new school is literally
right next to yours,

449
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,996
so I think that we
should walk together.

450
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:23,463
People might think I have
a thing for my sister.

451
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:25,329
[Ayumi] A thing for me?
You brought me a present?

452
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:26,696
What? No.

453
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,129
Hoshinoumi, sea of stars.

454
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:31,929
What an absolutely wonderful
name for a school.

455
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:38,696
Yeah. It's a name that sounds
like it was created
with only you in mind. Hmm?

456
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:42,996
[bells chiming, Ayumi gasping]

457
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:44,696
[Yu] Hey.

458
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:50,229
[Yu] <i>That night,</i>
<i>I had a dream.</i>

459
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:54,563
<i>I'm sure it was because</i>
<i>of Ayumi's far‐fetched</i>
<i>announcement.</i>

460
00:23:58,129 --> 00:24:01,863
<i>But... who was that?</i>

461
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:08,963
[theme song plays]

462
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:24,463
