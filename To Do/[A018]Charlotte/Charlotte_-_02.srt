1
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:11,690
Hyaa!

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,852
‐I'm gonna go.
‐[Ayumi] Wait a minute!

3
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,921
You're forgetting something!

4
00:00:16,988 --> 00:00:20,457
‐Your lunch!
‐What's the menu today?

5
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,594
It's omelet rice, your favorite.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,596
[Yu thinking] <i>That again?!</i>

7
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:27,231
[Yu] Th‐Thanks.
Now don't you be late, OK?

8
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:28,700
[Ayumi] I won't.

9
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:31,168
[Yu sighs]

10
00:00:32,504 --> 00:00:34,972
[theme song plays]

11
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:41,212
[woman singing in Japanese]

12
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,298
Please excuse me.

13
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:09,333
[Tomori] Welcome
to our academy.

14
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:14,271
[snickers]

15
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:16,473
[Yu groans]

16
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:21,345
[Yu] So every single student
here has some special ability?

17
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:24,782
[Takajo] No. Some have
the possibility of having one,

18
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,251
and some show signs
of developing one.

19
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:29,521
[Yu] You transfer them here
just for that?

20
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:32,824
[Tomori] A long time ago,
people who had special
abilities like we have

21
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,362
could end up as guinea pigs
for misguided and sometimes
cruel neuroscientists.

22
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,898
If you got caught,
your life was basically over.

23
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:43,901
Hah! You're exaggerating.

24
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:46,337
[Tomori] I'm actually talking
about my big brother.

25
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:50,107
To protect those with abilities,

26
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:53,044
a certain individual created
the current system,

27
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,212
though not in time
to save my big brother.

28
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:57,882
So why did you get me
into this student council

29
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,684
and tell me I should
use my powers?

30
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:03,354
The student council here
is entrusted with
a special mission,

31
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,857
and that is to seek out those
with special abilities

32
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:07,625
who are on the loose,
like you were,

33
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:11,295
and either protect them
or threaten them
to never use their powers.

34
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:13,230
Why would I do
something like that?

35
00:03:13,297 --> 00:03:16,467
[Tomori] In return,
you will be paid appropriately.

36
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:20,037
Isn't Ayumi having
to do her best to make
decent meals every day

37
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:23,040
because you can't even afford
to buy proper food?

38
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:28,245
My name is Yu Otosaka.

39
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:31,048
I came here
from Hinomori High School.

40
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:33,951
Nice to meet you all.

41
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:35,953
[girl, gasping] So cute!

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,388
[Yu snickers]

43
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:39,657
[gasp]

44
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:44,361
[Takajo chuckles]

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,134
[music on earphones]

46
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:54,305
Hey. She's a first‐year, but
she's student council president?

47
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:56,774
Right. In this academy,
the student council president

48
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,743
is not determined by grade.

49
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,813
It goes to someone who's active
and has a sense of duty

50
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,548
as someone
with a special ability.

51
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,583
[Yu] I see.

52
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,489
This is exactly the same thing
as last night's dinner.

53
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:15,727
Say, Otosaka, what are you going
to do about lunch today?

54
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:17,461
Well, I don't have anything.

55
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,964
[Takajo] Then let's go
to the cafeteria together.

56
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:21,533
I'll show you where it is.

57
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,535
That would be a big help.

58
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:26,604
You're not going
to invite her?

59
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:29,574
[Takajo] I can ask her
to come along if you like.

60
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:32,443
Nah. No thanks.

61
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:37,081
Doesn't seem to be
any open seats.

62
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:38,916
Then how about we buy
some sandwiches

63
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:40,918
and go back to the classroom
to eat?

64
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:43,888
[Yu] Well, it's pretty crowded
over there, too.

65
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:45,923
Just leave that part to me.

66
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,092
Here's where I can show off
my ability.

67
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,295
‐Is it OK for you to do that?
‐Don't worry, it's fine.

68
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:53,364
I'll go in from the blind spot
on the camera.

69
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,000
Though, since I'll be
going by too quickly,

70
00:04:56,067 --> 00:05:00,004
what kind of breads I grab
will all depend on luck.

71
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,406
[Yu] Huh? [voice slows] Hey.

72
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,481
[drawn‐out shout]

73
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:21,693
[shout ends, students scream]

74
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,064
[sighs]

75
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:29,133
‐[boy] What was that?
‐[girl] An explosion?

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,068
[Takajo] Sorry to make you wait.

77
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:35,640
Oh, I got a rather great
result this time.

78
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:37,374
‐A cutlet sandwich.
‐What?

79
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:40,845
You call that a great result
with all those wounds on you?

80
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:42,947
I do wear armor
under my uniform

81
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:45,116
so the wounds are never
very deep, you know.

82
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:48,052
[Yu] <i>But you're</i>
<i>bleeding from your head!</i>

83
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:52,590
You know, you're
a pretty dangerous guy,
despite how you look.

84
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,425
What do you mean by that?

85
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:57,161
[Yu] Wait, you have nothing
but cutlet sandwiches here.

86
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,863
[Takajo, mouth full]
It's teleportation, you know.

87
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,498
You think I had time to pick
and choose what I wanted?

88
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:04,035
And every single one
of them is smushed.

89
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,738
That's teleportation.

90
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,874
You think I can fine‐tune
how forcefully I grab
merchandise

91
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,242
when I'm moving that fast?

92
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:15,012
[Yu] <i>His ability</i>
<i>really is half‐assed.</i>

93
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,682
She doesn't have
any female friends,

94
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:20,017
even though she's
the student council president?

95
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:22,019
Her special ability is to become

96
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:24,656
completely invisible
to one person she chooses.

97
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:28,860
Which means that everyone
other than that person
can see her.

98
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:32,363
That imperfection is
what caused the situation
she's in right now.

99
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:35,567
Even if she had a valid reason,

100
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:37,434
what would people
around her think

101
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:41,272
after seeing her use her ability
to take violent actions?

102
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,942
On top of that,
the surveillance cameras

103
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,878
show nothing
but an ordinary fight.

104
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:48,646
As she kept doing things
like that,

105
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:51,616
obviously people eventually
came to hate her.

106
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:55,352
But apparently her personality
wasn't like that

107
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,154
until she got
into middle school.

108
00:06:57,221 --> 00:07:00,424
‐[footsteps]
‐Huh?
‐Oh. She's walking over here.

109
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:03,728
A helper will soon be
showing up.

110
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:06,864
‐What the hell?
‐That means, everyone gather
at the student council room.

111
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:10,401
Huh? How did you figure that?

112
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:31,188
[Yu] <i>What in the world is about</i>
<i>to begin here?</i>

113
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:40,297
[gasp] Who is this guy?

114
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:52,977
Thoughtography... right here.

115
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,812
[Yu] <i>Huh?</i>

116
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,515
Who was that?

117
00:07:57,582 --> 00:07:59,784
A comrade who tells us
the location and power

118
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:02,286
of someone who possesses
a special ability.

119
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:05,923
Nanba High School,
We'll go stake it out.

120
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,225
‐Come on, we're leaving early.
‐[Yu] To do what?

121
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,394
Some investigation, of course.

122
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:12,329
Even though we're not
with the police?

123
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:15,366
If the police you mention
find this person before we do,

124
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:17,869
that person's life
is all but over.

125
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:20,705
[Yu] <i>Seriously?</i>

126
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:24,141
‐[Tomori] Start asking around.
‐[Takajo] Right!

127
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,511
Come on, now.
Let's get started.

128
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:28,513
What is it I should be doing?

129
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,550
Basically, ask whether
anything strange has been
going on lately.

130
00:08:32,617 --> 00:08:36,220
Also, since the ability has been
determined to be thoughtography,

131
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:39,657
it might be good to ask about
any rumors that involve
photographs.

132
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:40,925
[Tomori] Very funny.

133
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:42,259
Good luck.

134
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:43,995
What am I doing?

135
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:47,765
Those two are nothing more
than a couple of lunatics.

136
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:52,036
[Tomori panting]

137
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:53,971
There was someone acting
suspicious.

138
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:57,408
I want you to take over
his body and look through
all of his belongings.

139
00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:58,776
For what purpose?

140
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:01,646
To protect the one
with special abilities.

141
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:03,114
[Yu snarls]

142
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,617
[Tomori snarls]

143
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,352
Oh, fine. Which guy is it?

144
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,855
Damn it, you took so long,
I've lost him.

145
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:12,489
Follow me!

146
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:18,630
‐[Tomori] That's the guy.
‐[suspect whimpering]

147
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:24,769
‐Hurry!
‐[Yu] <i>Damn it. Why do I have</i>
<i>to do something like this?</i>

148
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:26,904
[groans]

149
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:36,213
Huh? Hey.

150
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,550
Whaaaa!

151
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:41,519
‐[suspect groans]
‐What's this? Whoa!

152
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:43,555
Hey, what are you
doing with that?

153
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,890
[Tomori] Pictures
of a female student.

154
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:47,525
She's rather pretty.

155
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:51,395
Next up, well, a girl
in her lingerie.

156
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:53,164
This is thoughtography?

157
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,333
You sure use it
for something stupid.

158
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,402
Did you take
either of these pictures?

159
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:00,237
No, no. I bought them.

160
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:02,373
Then who did you buy them from?

161
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:07,311
Look, I don't intend on leaking
any of what you tell me
to a third party, OK?

162
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:09,981
Please just tell me
the truth.

163
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,050
If you don't tell us now,
I'll tell the girl
in this photograph

164
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:15,920
that this was in your possession
and that you took it.

165
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:20,191
Udoh... in class 2‐E.

166
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:23,127
Thank you very much.
OK, we're going in.

167
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:25,730
We're gonna go capture Udoh
from 2‐E.

168
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:26,931
[Takajo] Right!

169
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:28,733
Huh?

170
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,936
Can you tell me if Udoh
has gone home yet?

171
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:35,439
[girl] Huh? No, Udoh is...

172
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:37,842
Captain, if I may excuse myself.

173
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:39,844
Yeah. Good work today.

174
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,015
[sighs]

175
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:47,184
‐Wow, this is a surprise.
‐[gasp]

176
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:50,555
‐Who are you?
Where did you come from?
‐[Tomori laughs]

177
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:53,124
[Tomori] Who would have thought
that the culprit

178
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,328
who takes lewd, perverted
photographs like this with
his thoughtography ability

179
00:10:57,394 --> 00:10:59,496
and sells them off
to his classmates

180
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:03,100
is also the school's
archery team captain?

181
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:07,071
Photograph?
Thoughtography?

182
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,439
I don't know what you mean.

183
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:10,975
Forget it. One of your customers
gave you up.

184
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:14,445
Oh, yeah, we took a really good
look inside your locker, too.

185
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:17,448
A ton of photos came falling out
so I recorded them all

186
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:20,785
on this video camera
as evidence.

187
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:25,456
I can easily open something like
a locker inside a clubhouse.

188
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:29,160
Why would you do such a thing?

189
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:31,929
[Udoh] Because I can make money
with it, of course.

190
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:34,265
[Tomori] This involves
your family's finances?

191
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:38,435
Your parents wouldn't be happy
with you making money
like this, you know.

192
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:40,938
They're sick, OK?
There's nothing else I can do!

193
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,443
I projected you
in your underwear here.

194
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:48,045
It includes your face.

195
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:50,214
If you don't want this photo
distributed everywhere,

196
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,549
you'll forget this
ever happened.

197
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:54,118
[gasp]
That's all thoughtography takes?

198
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:55,452
I'm impressed.

199
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,722
But, um, no one
would ever need that.

200
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,958
[Udoh] No matter who looks
at you, you're attractive.

201
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:03,995
[gasp] Seriously?
I got a compliment!

202
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,530
All right!

203
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:08,399
Yeah, so hurry up
and get outta here.

204
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,437
Nice work.

205
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,741
The photo is... gone?

206
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:18,209
[Tomori] It's right here.

207
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:21,378
But wait, how did you...?

208
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:22,614
Oh, man!

209
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,181
That's checkmate.

210
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:28,586
Just give up, OK?

211
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:31,022
Pretend like none of this
ever happened.

212
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:35,693
You're the worst kind of person,
you know that?

213
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,030
So how much martial arts spirit
you possess means nothing!

214
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:47,872
[Takajo cries in slow motion]

215
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:53,477
[screams]

216
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:56,313
[gasps]

217
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,049
Just so you know,
we really don't plan

218
00:12:58,115 --> 00:13:00,952
on handing you over
to the police
or anything like that.

219
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:03,487
However, if you keep
using those powers,

220
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,557
your life will be
completely ruined.

221
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:09,727
Do you want to become
an experimental subject
dissected by scientists?

222
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:12,429
‐Dissected?
‐So this is a warning.

223
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:16,868
Those powers will disappear
once your body is finished
with adolescence.

224
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:21,606
As for money, earn some
by working legitimate
part‐time jobs.

225
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,187
[Tomori] We took care of that
successfully.

226
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:37,755
[Takajo] Indeed, we did.

227
00:13:37,822 --> 00:13:40,291
Tell me, you guys always
do things like this?

228
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:45,462
Yes. So that no one
with special abilities
ends up like my big brother.

229
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:49,500
I see. So what is it, exactly,
that actually happened
to your big brother

230
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,936
after he got
caught by the scientists?

231
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:55,239
[Tomori] It's not like
I'm hiding him or anything.

232
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:57,241
How about we visit tomorrow?

233
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:59,343
Huh? Visit where?

234
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,879
Where my big brother is now.

235
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:05,683
OK, are you ready to go?

236
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,352
Yeah. What about you?

237
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,855
I'm going to take a pass
this time.

238
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,857
Take care.

239
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:14,759
You haven't eaten lunch yet,
have you?

240
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,060
No.

241
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:19,130
Then let's buy station‐specific
lunches at the kiosk!

242
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:20,732
I want this one!

243
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:22,667
A beef‐tongue bento box lunch

244
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:24,736
that warms up
when you pull a string!

245
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:28,540
‐This is totally amazing!
‐Yeah, I know all about them.

246
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:35,980
[Yu] <i>I can't believe it,</i>
<i>this is so embarrassing.</i>

247
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:40,618
<i>How can she eat like that</i>
<i>in a situation like this?</i>

248
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:43,087
<i>It's bad manners, no matter</i>
<i>how you look at it.</i>

249
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:46,924
What's wrong?
Aren't you gonna eat
the sandwich you bought?

250
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:49,160
Ahhhhh...

251
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:58,002
[Tomori] My big brother
was the first to have
a special ability.

252
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,538
I'd just passed
the middle school entrance exams

253
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:03,007
for a national university
magnet school.

254
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:04,441
[footsteps]

255
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:05,677
[young Tomori] I did it, Mom!

256
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:07,745
I did it!
I got accepted!

257
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:10,381
You really did do
your best now.

258
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:13,685
That means you could
end up being a doctor,
or even a minister.

259
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:15,219
[Tomori] Yup!

260
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:18,956
Big Brother, look at this.
I got accepted.

261
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:22,827
Seriously? Unlike me,
you're completely amazing,
you know?

262
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:25,663
No, you're much more amazing
than me, Big Brother.

263
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,965
I heard that some of
the record companies

264
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:30,234
are starting to notice
what a great band you have.

265
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,637
Since we're poor, I want
to hurry up and land myself

266
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,206
a major record deal
so I can live on my own.

267
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:38,075
Hey, did you ever listen
to that CD I lent you?

268
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:41,245
It would get in the way
of my studies, so no, I haven't.

269
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:44,248
Your entrance exams
are over now so listen to it.

270
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:47,251
I want to create sounds
just like it and soar
to the top.

271
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:50,087
[Tomori]
I'm not really interested
in rock music and stuff.

272
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:53,490
[brother] It's different.
Zhiend is not rock music,
it's post‐rock.

273
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:55,326
[Tomori] You said that
before, too.

274
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:58,395
Like, I don't understand
what you mean at all.

275
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:02,099
As it turned out, I wasn't
able to enter that school.

276
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,770
I have something important
to say.

277
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:08,640
I've decided to enter you both
in a boarding school

278
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:12,744
so that each of you has
the chance to develop
your special talents.

279
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,178
‐Huh?
‐What do you mean?

280
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:16,881
I was just about to sign
to a record label.

281
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:19,617
I'm sorry,
but can't you put that off

282
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:21,252
for just a little while?

283
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:23,187
I don't get any of this!

284
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:26,858
If I can support myself,
that will take the pressure
off our money situation!

285
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:28,459
[mother] It's actually
the reverse.

286
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:31,529
We'll be better off financially
if you guys go to this school...

287
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:32,864
What do you mean, the reverse?

288
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,566
In the first place,
Nao is good at studying,

289
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:37,969
but I'm just an idiot who only
knows how to play the guitar!

290
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:40,572
[mother] I think that's exactly
what they acknowledged you for.

291
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:43,074
[brother] Then is that place
a specialized school for music?

292
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,309
What's up with us both
going together?

293
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:47,244
[slams table]

294
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:49,446
[Tomori] <i>That day,</i>
<i>we saw my mother</i>

295
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:52,850
<i>grovel on the ground and beg</i>
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in our lives.</i>

296
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:56,453
<i>My mother, who raised us</i>
<i>for the longest time,</i>

297
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:57,855
<i>all by herself.</i>

298
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:00,792
<i>It looked like</i>
<i>a fairly normal school,</i>

299
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:02,226
<i>and I immediately made</i>
<i>a few friends.</i>

300
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:05,930
<i>However, every day</i>
<i>after classes were over,</i>

301
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:09,033
<i>I was forced to take something</i>
<i>like a physical exam.</i>

302
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,603
<i>We were supposedly</i>
<i>in the same school,</i>

303
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:13,871
<i>but I couldn't see</i>
<i>my brother at all.</i>

304
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:16,473
<i>Every time I tried to go</i>
<i>and look for him,</i>

305
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,611
<i>my friends would always</i>
<i>stop me from doing so.</i>

306
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:21,913
<i>What I didn't know was</i>
<i>that my brother</i>

307
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,915
<i>had been turned</i>
<i>into an experimental subject.</i>

308
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:30,087
<i>My brother's special ability</i>
<i>was to make air vibrate</i>
<i>to his will.</i>

309
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:32,524
<i>He used that ability</i>
<i>during a live performance</i>

310
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,392
<i>to change the sound</i>
<i>of his guitar in unusual ways.</i>

311
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:36,961
<i>That's how they found him.</i>

312
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:39,931
<i>Scientists believed</i>
<i>that my brother's ability</i>

313
00:17:39,997 --> 00:17:42,934
<i>could be harnessed</i>
<i>to disrupt communications</i>

314
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,469
<i>or even jack the airwaves</i>
<i>if focused correctly.</i>

315
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:49,306
<i>A year later, I was finally</i>
<i>allowed to see my brother,</i>

316
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:53,110
<i>but he was no longer</i>
<i>the big brother I remembered.</i>

317
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:56,581
<i>He couldn't even recognize</i>
<i>that I was his little sister.</i>

318
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:58,382
<i>His memories were gone.</i>

319
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:02,386
<i>The classmates that had been</i>
<i>keeping me away from my brother</i>

320
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,522
<i>were placed around me</i>
<i>by the scientists</i>

321
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,390
<i>to pretend to be my friends.</i>

322
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,926
<i>The reason they were</i>
<i>examining me every day</i>

323
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:11,395
<i>was because, if one sibling</i>
<i>has an ability,</i>

324
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:14,065
<i>chances are that</i>
<i>the other one will, too.</i>

325
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:17,368
<i>And that was the only reason.</i>

326
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:21,639
<i>I swore that I wouldn't trust</i>
<i>anyone ever again.</i>

327
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:24,842
<i>I snuck out of that school.</i>

328
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:29,647
What happened
after you left there?

329
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:32,750
I met the one person
I could truly trust,

330
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:34,285
and that's how I'm here now.

331
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:37,789
‐[Yu] That person is...?
‐Oh. We're getting off here.

332
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:47,732
I'm Nao Tomori.
I'm here to see my brother.

333
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,967
[Yu] <i>So her first name is "Nao."</i>

334
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:52,303
[receptionist] He's in room 12.
Go ahead.

335
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:54,672
Think it would be OK
if I took him outside?

336
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:57,875
[receptionist] As long as you
keep to our grounds, no problem.

337
00:18:57,942 --> 00:19:00,878
[Tomori] Thank you so much.

338
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:03,247
This way.

339
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,450
He's here.

340
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,254
Hmm?

341
00:19:12,824 --> 00:19:13,958
[gasp]

342
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:16,093
[brother screaming]

343
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:22,600
Guess the painkillers
have worn off again.

344
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:23,935
Your brother.

345
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,137
What in the world
is he doing?

346
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:27,972
[Tomori] He's composing.

347
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,843
My brother thinks that he's
actually playing a guitar.

348
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,945
All of those grunts
and groans you hear

349
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:35,947
is him singing the main melody.

350
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:37,515
[brother groaning]

351
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:39,216
[nurse] Oh!

352
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:44,488
[Tomori thinking] <i>Oh, man.</i>
<i>He ruined another comforter.</i>

353
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,423
Would you like to go outside?

354
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,127
It's the time of day when you
see the best scenery.

355
00:19:57,735 --> 00:19:59,303
It's amazing.

356
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:03,274
[Tomori] Isn't it, though?

357
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,212
Yeah.
But an environment this special,

358
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,247
how in the world did you
pull it off?

359
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:13,250
It's all thanks
to the one person I can trust.

360
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:16,353
He transferred my brother
to the hospital

361
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,256
in this beautiful place
free of charge.

362
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:23,294
[Yu] There's actually someone
out there that generous?

363
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:26,163
[sighs]

364
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,799
He shows no interest at all.

365
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:30,668
But maybe someday someone will
come up with a miracle drug

366
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,269
that can cure this.

367
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:35,439
Nobody is doing research on how
to save patients like this.

368
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:36,741
Well, why not?

369
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:38,610
For the scientists,

370
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:41,879
people that have abilities
are just like batteries.

371
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:43,748
If one runs out of power,

372
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,617
they can just experiment
with another.

373
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:48,485
There's no incentive for them
to help the test subjects

374
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:49,921
that end up like this.

375
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,288
I'm stunned.

376
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,324
We don't know whether or not

377
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,092
something will happen to us
tomorrow, either.

378
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:56,694
Now you're just talking crazy.

379
00:20:56,761 --> 00:21:00,397
[Tomori] How about you choose
your words carefully?

380
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:05,169
‐[Yu] Sorry.
‐[Tomori] Well then,
let's go back.

381
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:09,340
You're really having a hard time
with all this, aren't you?

382
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:11,175
[Tomori]
You're sympathizing?

383
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:14,779
Well, stop that.
You're nothing but
a dishonest cheater.

384
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:16,981
[Yu] <i>She's right.</i>

385
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:19,751
<i>This is unlike me.</i>

386
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:22,854
‐I'm home.
‐[Ayumi groans]

387
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,024
I didn't think the student
council would be something
that keeps me this busy.

388
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:28,660
‐Nothing I can do about it.
‐Huh?

389
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:31,663
Big Brother, you're
part of the student council?

390
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:34,899
‐You mean I didn't tell you?
‐This is the first
I'm hearing it!

391
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:38,736
In that case, you need
to eat some of my special
rolling vegetable curry

392
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:41,072
to renew your energy.

393
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:44,576
[Yu] <i>If I have</i>
<i>a special ability,</i>

394
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:48,145
<i>there is the possibility</i>
<i>that Ayumi will have one, too.</i>

395
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:50,247
<i>If I were to be captured,</i>

396
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:53,117
<i>Ayumi could end up</i>
<i>just like Tomori.</i>

397
00:21:53,184 --> 00:21:55,520
[Ayumi] It's done!

398
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:58,489
‐It looks great.
‐I hope you really like it.

399
00:21:58,556 --> 00:22:00,191
So sweet!

400
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:04,428
Uh, well, um, can it be
that the secret ingredient
of this curry is...

401
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:08,132
Pizza sauce: the secret
ingredient of our household!

402
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,870
[Yu] <i>Oh, man, this tastes</i>
<i>no different</i>

403
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:15,640
<i>from all the omelet rice</i>
<i>she's made.</i>

404
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:18,242
[Ayumi gasping] Wow!

405
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:21,445
I guess it's your daily routine,
but hurry up and go to sleep.

406
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:24,281
I was able to see a comet today,
so I'm deeply moved

407
00:22:24,348 --> 00:22:26,050
and can go to sleep
totally excited!

408
00:22:26,117 --> 00:22:28,152
That's pretty skillful of you.

409
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:31,623
[Ayumi] But the comet
that I really want to see
is a completely different one.

410
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:35,026
‐Oh?
‐A comet with
a really long orbit!

411
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:38,262
‐[Yu] What is that?
‐It's a comet that swings
by us only once

412
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:40,031
every few centuries!

413
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:44,235
They have comets like that, huh?

414
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:46,538
[theme song plays]

415
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,378
[woman singing in Japanese]
