00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:26,685
[gasp] Ayumi. My little sister!

7
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:31,189
[doctor] I'm terribly sorry.
She didn't make it.

I'm terribly sorry

I'd like to work with you

11
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:45,370
so we can figure out what really
happened at the school.

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,339
I heard that you
were at the scene...

13

[woman] Are you all right?

14
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:55,446
I'm sure this has been
rough for you.

15
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:59,718
But for her sake,
you have to keep moving forward
with your life, you understand?

16
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:03,321
There are many things
in this world that time solves.

17
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:06,758

even one thing for her?

21
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,952
Was I able... to repay her?

22
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:40,291
[gasp] No. I didn't repay her
at all.

23
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,227
[sobbing] Nothing.

24
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:48,266
I never thought she could
be gone this quickly.

25
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,569
It just didn't seem possible.

26
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,140
Even if I wanted to repay,
I couldn't.

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,375

Otosaka, if you haven't
eaten yet, would you like
to have dinner with us?

46
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:50,381
I brought some.
It's my special homemade
cream stew.

[Takajo] Come on, you can't
turn down something like that.

[Yusa] Well, what should we do?

50
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,493
[Takajo] Let's look again.

[Misa] You creeper! Look,
I'll have Yusa make you
as much as you want.

58
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:22,180
All you have to do is break
the door with your ability.

59
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,751
I can break fortified glass,
sure, but this door
is too thick.

60
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:29,921
Due to security reasons,
it's made a lot sturdier
than normal condos.

61
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:33,091

I don't know what to do
in this situation.

I get what he must be
feeling now.

Hell, I know it a lot better
than most people.

[Yusa] Huh? What?

68
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:52,243
OK, so what happened here,
exactly?

69
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:55,714
It seems that he needs
a bit more time to heal.

to school ever since...

I'm terribly sorry.

that I need any help?

I'm totally fine.

00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,532
There's no way that's true.

100
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:23,635
I mean, you've been eating
nothing but instant noodles.

101
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:25,537
[Yu] I like them,
so it's OK.

102
00:07:25,537 --> 00:07:29,575
[Shirayanagi] Well, then...
how about those pancakes
we had together?

103
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,743
We could get them again.

Oh. Instant noodles
or pancakes.

107
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:42,220
Aren't they about
the same nutrition‐wise?

108
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,757
[Shirayanagi] Yeah,
I suppose you're right.

109
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,660

No, I don't mean it
like that at all.

for you right now.

‐[Yu] So you won't do it?
‐No, I won't!

Look, Otosaka, it's important
that you get outside a bit.

‐Yes.

If you were, you wouldn't be
living like this.

Your left!
‐[boy 2] I got it!

00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,754
[boy 1] Kick ass!

173
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:43,989
[Yu] Huh.

174
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:46,224

00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:24,462
I'll kill every single one
of you who gets in my way!

188

Get outta the way!

189
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:59,631
The hell. What'd you say?
Trying to pick a fight?

190
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,432
What's up?

191
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:04,435
This punk hit me with trash
and told me to move.

192
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:06,738
[boy 2] Who do you think
you are, kid?

193
00:14:06,738 --> 00:14:09,407
[Yu] Just a normal,
law‐abiding citizen.

194
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,111
A law‐abiding citizen that
assaults people with trash?

195
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:15,914
‐Yeah, it looked good on you.
‐Don’t mock us!

196
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:18,483

00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:25,390
Just remember,
you asked for this.

199

Ready for some pain,

200
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:31,863
Huh? You think you can beat me?
[chuckles] Bring it.

201
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:34,499
I'll make sure you can't play
games for a while.

202
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,571
Hmm.

203
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,609
You bastard!
What do you think you're doing?

204
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:46,044
Huh? What the hell,
I thought I punched this guy!

205
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:50,315
What's wrong?
You guys have a falling out?
Kiss and make up.

206
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:54,385
‐Hyah!
‐Uggh!

207
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:12,704
What is this?
What the hell is going on?

208
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,806
Ugggh!

[screams]

210
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:21,547
I still have one more left.

211
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:30,756
No, stop, stop!

[screams]

213
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:35,160
[Yu] Now you know
how strong I am.

214
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,031
Next time you go against me,
I won't hesitate to kill you.

215
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,234
Got it? [chuckles]

216
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,946
Yo. How's it going?

217
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:57,616
You're the punk that beat
Gondo's gang all by himself?

218
00:15:57,616 --> 00:16:02,120
Maybe. It's not like I stopped
to ask their names, you know.

219
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,490
Well, I'm Hosoyamada.
Remember that.

220
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,327
[Yu] I give it five seconds
before I forget all about you.

221
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:11,062
[Hosoyamada] You've got
some balls, kid.

222
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:12,898
You should really learn
some respect.

223
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:15,200
Give him his first lesson, boys.

224
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,139
What the hell are you doing?
Ugggh!

225
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,479
It wasn't me!

226
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,787
You don't need this eye, right?

227
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,657
If I take it, you can call
yourself something cool

228
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:41,259
like "One‐Eyed‐Hoso‐whatever."

229
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,294
You don't seem excited.

230
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,931
What's wrong,
don't like the name?

231
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:49,200
[singsong] Better choose!

232
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,638
Fine! I give! Mercy!

233
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,341
[bystander] The Hosoyamada lost?

234
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:58,276
[bystander 2] Impossible.

Hmm?

[straining]

242
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:36,982
What is this thing?

243
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:39,184
Something important to you?

244
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:42,854
So that's how it is.

245
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:01,873
[whoosh!]

246
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:14,052
Hey wait...
When did... when did you...?

247
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,286
[Tomori] The whole time.

248
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:17,422
[Yu] The whole time?

249
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:25,897
It can't be.

250
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,999
If you keep following
this path,

251
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,136
you'll lose your humanity
and never get it back again.

252
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:33,404
That's why I stopped you.

253
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,674
Did somebody send you?

254
00:18:35,674 --> 00:18:38,409
No. I'm on a leave of absence
for now.

255
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,612
‐This is personal.
‐How so?

256
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:43,615
I feel responsible for this
as well.

257
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,418
When you get down to it,

258
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,556
I might have made a bad call
concerning Ayumi.

259
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:52,991
Maybe I should have
quarantined her immediately.

260
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:56,327
At least then
she would have been safe.

261
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:03,068
That's why I've decided
to stick with you
until this is through

262
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:04,736
and you're back to normal.

263
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:07,706
This is none of your business!
You owe me for that stuff!

264
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:10,441
Do you want to be done
with your life?

265
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,410
Do you want to stop
being human?

266
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,114
Then...

267
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,249
what am I supposed to do?

268
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:19,985
Hmm.

269
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:22,888
A fresh change of clothes
would be a nice start.

270
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:26,925
‐But let's get some food
for now.
‐Huh?

271
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:30,696
A good meal is the foundation
of a healthy mood and lifestyle.

272
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:33,431
There's nothing wrong
with what I've been eating.

273
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:37,869
Right, a diet of pizza
and sweat soy sauce mochi
is so healthy.

274
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,805
It'll calm you down,
at least.

275
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,707
What are you saying
I should eat?

276
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:43,474
[Tomori] You just leave it
to me.

277
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,443
I'll get it for you right away.

278
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:48,446
Hey, it's me. Yes.

279
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:49,948
Thank you very much.

280
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:52,618
I didn't say for you to set
something up for me!

281
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:55,020
Just take one bite.

282
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,489
After that, I swear
we will have nothing to do
with each other again.

283
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,892
Just one bite, huh?

284
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:04,095
Then you'll leave me alone
forever?

285
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:05,897
[Tomori] Yes, I promise.

286
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:07,699
[Yu] Fine.

287
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,568
[Tomori] Good, then let's go.

288
00:20:09,568 --> 00:20:13,404
‐[Yu] That promise is absolute?
‐[Tomori] Right.

289
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,843
‐Takajo?
‐[Tomori] Yes. His family home.

290
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:20,045
[Yu] Is this
an ambush or something?

291
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:23,849
[Tomori] Nobody is here
so you can relax.

292
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,851
Watch some TV or something.

293
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,653
[Yu] What are you making me eat?

294
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:30,856
[Tomori] That's a surprise
for you to see
when it's finished.

300

Here you go.

301
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:04,022
It's the same taste.

302
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:07,659
‐Glad I did it justice.
‐[Yu] How?

303
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:10,862
Your mother left behind
a big notebook full of recipes.

304
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:13,565
I took the liberty
of borrowing it.

305
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,967
The page with the omelet rice
was the only one

306
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,236
with a big, flowery circle
on it.

307
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:23,208
I have a feeling
it was your favorite food
when you were a kid.

308
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,844
After your mother
was no longer around,

309
00:21:25,844 --> 00:21:29,180
I think Ayumi saw that
and tried to recreate the taste

310
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,749
to make you happy.

311
00:21:36,522 --> 00:21:38,389
[Yu] So that was...

312
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:40,959
the last omelet rice.

313
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,797
Damn it.

314
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:48,133
It's sweet
and it tastes so horrible.

315
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:49,701
Why am I eating it?

316
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:53,572
It's not healthy for you
to scarf it down like that.

317
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:55,473
Just eat slowly and savor it.

318
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:56,975
[Yu] OK.

319
00:21:58,476 --> 00:22:01,112
[Tomori] Here. Have some tea.

320
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,014
And take this, too.

‐Hey, Tomori.
‐[Tomori] Yes?

322

to do with myself now?

Well, you could always return
to the student council

[Yu] But that's not possible.

326
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:20,298
We promised we would never have
anything to do with each other.

327

Huh? What the heck
are you talking about?

328
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:25,804
[Yu] You said that's what would
happen after I ate this.

329
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:30,275
Yeah, if you ate one bite,
but you scarfed it down
like a hungry stray.

wanna stay with me!" [laughs]
