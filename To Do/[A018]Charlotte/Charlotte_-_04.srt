00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:05,975
[alarm beeping]
[sighs]

2
00:00:09,936 --> 00:00:12,105
Good morning. Huh?

3
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:15,208
[laughs] Good morning,
sleepy head!

4
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:18,645
Here, I made
some French toast for you.

5
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:20,280
[Yu thinking] <i>It's red!</i>

6
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:22,783
Since you won't be needing
lunches for school anymore,

7
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:25,451
I decided to put more effort
into your breakfast.

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,087
[Yu]
<i>Put more effort, huh?</i>

9
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:30,356
<i>Looks like that's nothing more</i>
<i>than adding pizza sauce.</i>

10
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:32,092
[Ayumi] Time to eat!

11
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,195
[Yu] <i>The sugar</i>
<i>from the pizza sauce</i>

12
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:37,230
<i>mixed with the sugar</i>
<i>in the French toast!</i>

13
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:39,600
Huh? What's wrong?
Does it taste weird?

14
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,835
Oh, no, it's fine.

15
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:43,436
Seems like I'm not feeling
too well.

16
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:45,371
Aww, did you catch a cold?

17
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:47,574
Maybe you should stay home
from school today.

18
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:51,344
It's not that bad.
I'm sorry that I'm
making you worry.

19
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,446
Are you sure
you're gonna be all right?

20
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:54,981
[Yu] I'm totally fine!

21
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:00,887
Thank you for the meal.

22
00:01:00,954 --> 00:01:02,956
You really do look pale.

23
00:01:03,023 --> 00:01:04,925
You should be taking
the day off today.

24
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:08,294
No, no, there's nothing wrong,
I promise.

25
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:12,498
[Yu] <i>I need to find a place</i>
<i>to bury that pizza sauce.</i>

26
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:14,868
[theme song plays]

27
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:21,207
[woman singing in Japanese]

28
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:48,163
I got some amazing news.

29
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:50,932
Yusa Nishimori is transferring
into our school!

30
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,001
You mean the Yusarin?
No way.

31
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,936
This isn't a big art school
or anything.

32
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:57,205
If she's the real thing,
I'll be so happy.

33
00:02:57,273 --> 00:03:00,309
As expected,
everyone is getting pumped.

34
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:03,245
There's going to be a riot
when she actually shows up.

35
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:06,482
Just thinking about it's
really got me on edge.

36
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:08,550
‐[door opens]
‐Quiet.

37
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:11,152
‐You there, sit down.
‐[boy] Seriously?

38
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:12,654
[teacher] Over here.

39
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:14,623
[Yusa giggles]

40
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,727
[teacher] Now, this transfer
student will be your classmate
starting today.

41
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:19,995
Introduce yourself.

42
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:22,864
I'm Yusa Kurobane,
known as Yusarin.

43
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,767
‐[cheering]
‐[teacher] Quiet!
I said be quiet!

44
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:28,404
You there, sit down.
And you there, stop dancing!

45
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,773
[Yu]
<i>Even in a place like this,</i>
<i>she calls herself Yusarin?</i>

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,010
So her real name is Kurobane?

47
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:37,313
How could you not even
know that much?

48
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,547
[inhales sharply]

49
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:41,283
Shhh!

50
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,619
I may not be able
to attend every day

51
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:45,521
because work can keep me
pretty busy,

52
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:46,955
but when I'm here,
I look forward

53
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:49,558
to enjoying high school life
with all of you.

54
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,159
It's a pleasure
to meet you all.

55
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:54,896
Yusarin! Yusarin!

56
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:56,732
Yusarin!
Yusarin!

57
00:03:56,798 --> 00:03:58,500
[all chanting "Yusarin!"]

58
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:01,337
‐[teacher] Sit down and shut up!
‐[Yu] <i>Oh, brother.</i>

59
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:04,873
Kurobane, you sit there.
That's your seat now.

60
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:10,779
It's nice to see you again.

61
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:12,914
Same. I'm sure
I'll trouble you a lot,

62
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:14,850
but I'll try to be
a good neighbor.

63
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,385
It's very nice
to see you, too.

64
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:18,854
‐[boy 1] What's with her?
‐[boy 2] She's so rude.

65
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,522
[girl] So not friendly.

66
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,358
[boy] Why did you
transfer here?

67
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:24,393
[girl] Oh, I preordered
your new single.

68
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,662
[girl 2] Me too.
It's such a great song.

69
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:30,098
‐[boy 1] I always watch
Movement Morning!
‐[boy 2] Me too, me too.

70
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:32,401
Will you please be my friend?
What's your email?

71
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:35,571
You bastard, what do you think
you're doing?
Don't try to cut us out.

72
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:37,138
[boy] I'm not doing
any such thing.

73
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:39,941
[Yusa] Now, now, both of you,
be nice to each other.

74
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:42,678
Ahh! Is she gonna do
what I think she is?

75
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:44,112
Huh? Do what?

76
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:45,714
[girl] Huh?

77
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:49,217
I cast a spell on you,
I cast a spell on you.

78
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:53,322
Now we can all make up
and be friends too!
[giggles]

79
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,756
There it is!

80
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:56,992
Yusarin's Magic Spell,
series number 13,

81
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:59,094
the spell for making up!

82
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,598
There,
now don't you two feel better?

83
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:04,466
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

84
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,302
All good, I was wrong.

85
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:09,971
‐[bell clangs]
‐[Yu] What is that so‐called
Magic Spell series?

86
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,940
Yusa was once
a regular cast member

87
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:15,411
of the hit morning information
show Movement Morning!,
or "Move‐Mo."

88
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:18,113
After the day's fortunes,
she'd send out various spells,

89
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:20,982
particularly towards the viewers
who had bad luck that day.

90
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:23,719
And just how many episodes
of this are there?

91
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,220
There are 64.

92
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,823
But two of them actually
overlap, so there are really‐‐

93
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,391
[Tomori] Big turnoff.

94
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:34,330
Hello. Will he be appearing
before us again?

95
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:35,664
Yes.

96
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:38,767
‐[giggles] Oh, thank you.
‐[boy] Oh, hey, watch it!

97
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:42,771
Kurobane, I'd like you
to come with us to
the student council room.

98
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:44,340
[students sigh]

99
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:47,376
[boy] Hey, Student Council
President, that's not cool.

100
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:49,044
Let's get going.

101
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,613
‐Right.
‐[Yu sighs]

102
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,184
Yusa, that Magic Spell
you did earlier,
series number 13,

103
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:58,920
the spell for making up,
it was fantastic!

104
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:02,258
Wow! I can't believe you know
so much about it.

105
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:06,962
Yes! I checked out the show
religiously for the entire time
you were a part of it.

106
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:09,331
Wow! Thank you very much.

107
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:13,068
[Yu]
<i>You're such a fan boy.</i>
<i>Get over it, already.</i>

108
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:14,903
I have a question.

109
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,639
What are we going
to do in here, exactly?

110
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:19,408
A comrade will arrive soon.

111
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:22,711
However, we should
probably get you
mentally prepared for him.

112
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,980
His unusual appearance
might shock you.

113
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,148
‐Huh?
‐[door crashes open]

114
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:28,417
Huh?!

115
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:30,118
[shoes sloshing]

116
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,158
‐[Yusa shivering]
‐Now, don't be afraid.

117
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,928
He's one of us.
He will never do harm to you.

118
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:50,372
The ability is telekinesis.

119
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:54,710
Um, can someone tell me
what just happened?

120
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:58,414
[Yu] Someone with
a special ability
is in this general area,

121
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,583
and the power he has
is telekinesis.

122
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,653
That guy found you
in exactly the same manner.

123
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,888
What? That's amazing!

124
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,190
I'm going to do my best.
All right!

125
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:13,929
[Yu] <i>You know, you can get</i>
<i>possessed by spirits</i>
<i>and have pyrokinesis.</i>

126
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:15,497
<i>You're even more amazing.</i>

127
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:20,336
Looks like another school.
I think it's Kannai Academy.

128
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:22,971
‐Yeah, bingo!
‐[Yu] Uh, what is?

129
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,141
This is the sports paper
from last week.

130
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,910
I've had my eye on this guy
for a while.

131
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:31,480
Wow! He pitched three perfect
games in a row.

132
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:35,016
"With sharp knuckleballs,
no doubt this super
high school level pitcher

133
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,685
will join the pro league."

134
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:39,955
[Tomori] The next day,
I went and watched them
practice.

135
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:42,090
Everyone should look at this.

136
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,927
Here we go.

137
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:48,029
Huh?

138
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,401
‐[umpire] Strike!
‐[Yu] Whoa.

139
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,270
That's one heck of a curveball.

140
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:56,638
He's like major league caliber.

141
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:58,006
It gets even better.

142
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:00,075
Watch some footage
where we get a closeup

143
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,644
of the pitcher's
throwing hand.

144
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:04,580
There. Take a look.

145
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:06,548
‐See something strange?
‐[Yu] Like what?

146
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:09,551
[Tomori] He's gripping it
like a fastball,
one that goes straight.

147
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:12,421
Knuckleballs are supposed
to move irregularly

148
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:14,690
by stopping the ball rotation
as much as possible.

149
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:18,960
The basic knuckleball is thrown
by putting your index
and middle fingers

150
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:20,496
against the ball like this.

151
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:22,531
How you grip a fastball
makes it spin

152
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:25,867
and it doesn't allow it
to wobble around like
a knuckleball does.

153
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:28,169
‐You sure know a lot.
‐I get it now.

154
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:32,508
He's using telekinesis
to move the ball around
after he's thrown it, isn't he?

155
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,175
‐Yes.
‐Wow!

156
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:35,844
That's amazing, right?

157
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:37,613
[Yu]
<i>Does she get any of this?</i>

158
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,981
It will be bad if we can't
get ahold of him

159
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:41,817
before the national
championship.

160
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:43,685
Let's head there right now.

161
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,254
[Yusa] Well, what about class?

162
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:47,256
[Tomori] It's all right.
No matter how we act,

163
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:49,325
as long as we're a part
of the student council,

164
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:52,494
there can be no demerits
towards our grades
or our school reports.

165
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,696
‐[coach] Left, right, left!
‐[Yusa] Is that so?

166
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:57,533
We're from the Hoshinoumi
Academy Student Council.

167
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,502
We're practicing right now.
What is it you guys want?

168
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:03,138
‐I'm sorry.
‐[boy] Yusa Nishimori?!

169
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:06,908
Could you just ignore her
for the moment and listen
to what I have to say, please?

170
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,143
[boy] What is it?

171
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:10,145
I'm not beating
around the bush here.

172
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:14,716
Do you use telekinesis
to control your knuckleballs
after you throw them?

173
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:18,287
Telekinesis?
As in supernatural abilities?

174
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:20,121
Are you insane?
Of course I don't.

175
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:23,425
Are you from some occult
research club instead of
the student council?

176
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:25,894
All right, wise guy,
listen closely.

177
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,729
That power of yours
is like a disease

178
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:30,131
that's only around
during your adolescence.

179
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:32,200
Even if you were aiming
to be a pro,

180
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:34,670
by the time you reach it,
it will be long gone.

181
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:38,674
Not only that, but if someone
notices you have powers,

182
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,108
you'll be captured.

183
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:42,644
Then you can kiss baseball
goodbye for good.

184
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:46,515
So from here on, don't use
that special ability of yours,
understand?

185
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:48,550
And who would capture me,
exactly?

186
00:09:48,617 --> 00:09:52,621
Scientists who are experimenting
on people with abilities
just like you.

187
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:55,457
You expect me to believe
something that crazy?

188
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:57,626
‐[Yusa] Huh?
‐All right, fine.

189
00:09:57,693 --> 00:10:00,128
Do me a big favor
and don't look away.

190
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:02,298
[Arifumi] What? Yaaa!

191
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:04,800
So, do you believe me now?

192
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:08,970
[Misa] You really are
a sore loser, aren't you?

193
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:11,907
I say that we roast
this chump.

194
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:13,275
[Yu] Hey!

195
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,511
‐What?
‐Oh, uh, my bad.

196
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:17,846
This isn't
the time to be showing off.

197
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:19,648
Huh! Ptooey!

198
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:23,685
Ohh! Yusarin's spit.
No, this is Misa's saliva.

199
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:26,688
‐I don't know how
I should react.
‐Turnoff!

200
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:28,657
Back to business.

201
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:30,992
So, how are we gonna
resolve this?

202
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:32,561
Hmm.

203
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:36,998
Hmm. I know.
How about a game of baseball?

204
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:40,869
‐Huh?
‐It'll be our baseball team
versus your baseball team.

205
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:43,905
And if we win, you have to do
whatever we say.

206
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:47,042
All right, then.

207
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:49,645
And if we win,
I don't see you ever again.

208
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:54,683
Deal. But still,
you'll never become
a professional baseball player.

209
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,886
I don't understand
what drives you to play.
What is it?

210
00:10:57,953 --> 00:11:01,257
[Arifumi] I want to go to
the national championship,
that's all.

211
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:03,459
[Tomori, sighing] Understood.

212
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,795
Next Sunday at 3 p. m.
at our school courtyard.
How about it?

213
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:09,765
[Arifumi] I don't have
any problems with that.

214
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:15,337
What's wrong, Arifumi?

215
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:21,710
[Yu] So someone that can hit
that knuckleball exists
on our baseball team?

216
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:24,713
[Tomori] We'll be using
our abilities,
so it will be just fine.

217
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,383
And what kind of powers
does the team have?

218
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:30,218
They don't. They have several
people with potential

219
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:32,554
but no one's developed
a special ability yet.

220
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,856
Then how do we pull this off?

221
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:37,192
We'll be there to support them.

222
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,395
[Yu screams]

223
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:41,897
You mean we're all
a part of this?

224
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:43,832
We won't win otherwise.

225
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,403
Besides, if it's on
our school courtyard,
it won't turn into a riot.

226
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:50,005
That was the appropriate move.

227
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm getting fired up now.

228
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:54,376
[Yu]
<i>Don't you burn anything.</i>

229
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:06,522
‐[Yusa giggles]
‐[umpire] Bow.

230
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:08,590
[all] Have a good game.

231
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:12,193
[Takato] Our opposing team
has girls in it, huh?

232
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:15,096
No way they can hit
your pitches.

233
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:17,299
What's the point
of this game, anyway?

234
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:20,769
It's all about the future,
Takato.

235
00:12:22,137 --> 00:12:24,840
I see, all right.
Let's do this then.

236
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:28,944
If you lose, I'm smacking
all your asses, with this bat.

237
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,779
‐[Tomori] Win!
‐[team] Yeah!

238
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:33,382
[Yu] <i>Smacking asses</i>
<i>with a bat?</i>

239
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:35,284
<i>What is she, an old woman?</i>

240
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:36,885
Play ball!

241
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,393
Yes.

242
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,595
They must have
the worst batters on the planet

243
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:49,598
‐if they can't even hit
one of our balls.
‐Is that so?

244
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:52,968
Hey! I'm doing you a favor
being out there.

245
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,370
What kind of talk is that?

246
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:55,904
It's the truth.

247
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:57,906
Screw you, I'm outta here!

248
00:12:57,973 --> 00:13:00,476
[Tomori] That won't do.
Please keep pitching.

249
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:03,011
Then think before you open
your big mouth!

250
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:05,381
Kurobane, please go ahead.

251
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:06,515
‐[Arifumi] Huh?
‐OK.

252
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:08,984
I cast a spell for thee,

253
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,586
I cast it, don't you see?

254
00:13:10,652 --> 00:13:14,690
Now that you are nice and calm,
please smile for me!

255
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:18,059
‐[screams]
‐It's from Magic Spells
series number 9,

256
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:19,495
the spell for calming down!

257
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:22,498
Yep. Now everything's
gonna be A‐OK.

258
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:25,501
‐[sighs]
‐Knock it off!

259
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:36,545
‐[batter] Huh?
‐[umpire] Strike! Batter out.

260
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:40,382
That knuckleball's insane.
No way we're ever gonna hit it.

261
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:42,484
Just go ahead and smack me,
I don't care.

262
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:46,888
You know, it's pretty amazing
the catcher manages
to catch pitches like that.

263
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:50,025
[Yu] Guess that means that he's
super high school level, too.

264
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:51,893
There's no way we can win this.

265
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,329
[bat hits ball]

266
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:58,334
[Arifumi] <i>We just need one run.</i>

267
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,369
<i>If the two of us can score</i>
<i>one run,</i>

268
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:02,704
<i>we can win, as long as</i>
<i>we protect that lead.</i>

269
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:03,972
<i>Here goes!</i>

270
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:12,047
[Yu] <i>Not good. So they went</i>
<i>after Yusa after all.</i>

271
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,354
<i>Misa, on the other hand,</i>
<i>has athletic reflexes.</i>

272
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:24,493
‐Damn, why is Yusa so weak?
‐[Yu] <i>I see.</i>

273
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,963
<i>She can make the right</i>
<i>decision, but she can't</i>
<i>physically keep up.</i>

274
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,632
[umpire] Strike! Batter out.

275
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:35,504
[umpire] Out!

276
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,375
[ball hitting glove]

277
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:44,646
[bat hits ball]

278
00:14:58,494 --> 00:14:59,961
[umpire] Ball four!

279
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:01,797
[Yu] <i>Not looking good.</i>

280
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:05,567
[umpire 2] Out!

281
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:07,369
[umpire 3] Safe!

282
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:09,505
[Yu] <i>This is</i>
<i>a total crisis.</i>

283
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:11,473
We should use abilities
as well.

284
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,245
‐[Yu] Specifically...?
‐[Tomori] You need to take over
the opponents' batters.

285
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:21,216
What I want you to do is make
the last two of them listless
so they barely swing their bats.

286
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:22,618
Throw outside
of the strike zone.

287
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,120
Just be careful to not
throw a wild pitch.

288
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:29,591
‐Yeah, got it.
‐All right now,
I'm counting on you.

289
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:31,993
[umpire] Play ball!

290
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,931
[Yu] <i>Never thought</i>
<i>I'd use my powers</i>
<i>for something like this.</i>

291
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,137
‐[umpire] Strike!
‐Huh? What the...?

292
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:43,839
What's the matter?

293
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:48,377
‐[ball hits glove]
‐[umpire] Strike two!

294
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:51,780
‐Hey, are you all right?
‐Yeah, totally fine.

295
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:54,583
It's two outs with the next guy.

296
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:59,455
Arifumi, if you want
to be that thorough
in winning this thing,

297
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:02,057
we have to go all out!

298
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:05,026
Catcher!

299
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:11,433
‐[umpire] Safe!
‐[cheers, shouting]

300
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,234
Takato.

301
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:15,271
[Yu] Wait,
what the hell happened?

302
00:16:15,337 --> 00:16:19,040
‐I didn't think that far ahead.
‐Did he steal home base?

303
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:20,642
Damn, damn, damn!

304
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,412
Guess we ain't winnin' this one.

305
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,646
[ball hits glove]

306
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:26,615
[umpire] Strike! Batter out!

307
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:29,418
Just make sure that you hit
the ball when you bunt.

308
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:33,221
Then use your ability
to run past first base,
and don't forget to touch it.

309
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:35,357
Are you sure that they'll
see me make it there?

310
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:38,427
I'll record the evidence with
a super‐high‐speed camera.

311
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:40,228
Understood.

312
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:47,603
[umpire] Strike!

313
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:49,871
Strike two!

314
00:16:49,938 --> 00:16:53,041
[Yu] <i>If I screw up</i>
<i>the next one, I'm out.</i>

315
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:57,246
[Arifumi] <i>Here it comes,</i>
<i>four‐eyes.</i>

316
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,651
[Yu groans]

317
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:04,586
‐Yes!
‐[whoosh!]

318
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:07,122
[Takato] Huh? Whoa!

319
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:08,457
[umpire] Uh...

320
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:10,326
He touched first base,
it's plain as day.

321
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:13,295
Come on now, it's safe.
Call safe!

322
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:15,831
Hmm... Safe!

323
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:18,634
[Takato] What the heck happened?

324
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,136
That was great.
We won't let it go to waste.

325
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:23,305
I need a pinch runner!

326
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:30,646
[Misa] <i>Yusa's weak,</i>
<i>but I'll use my own game sense</i>
<i>to hit the ball.</i>

327
00:17:37,353 --> 00:17:38,520
All right!

328
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:40,221
That's the way.
It was awesome!

329
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:43,091
It's your turn to bat now,
so what are you going to do?

330
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:45,026
A sacrifice bunt,
and once it succeeds,

331
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:47,128
one base hit
will get us a walk‐off.

332
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:50,198
Huh? I can't hit like that
with my ability.

333
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:54,436
‐How about you go face things
head on once in a while?
‐[Yu] Huh?

334
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:57,606
Show me the fiend
that cheats on tests.

335
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,352
Please hit it!

336
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:17,025
‐Damn!
‐[player] First base!

337
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:19,928
‐They're just a bunch
of amateurs!
‐[umpire] Out!

338
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:25,601
[Yu] <i>I have to face</i>
<i>this crap head on?</i>

339
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:28,003
[Misa] Lead! Lead!

340
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:31,407
Strike!

341
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:34,175
‐Strike two!
‐Damn!

342
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:43,519
Foul ball!

343
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:45,621
<i>I finally hit it.</i>

344
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,824
‐[bat hits ball]
‐[umpire] Foul!

345
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,759
‐[bat hits ball]
‐[umpire] Foul!

346
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:52,661
[umpire] Foul!

347
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:55,831
[Arifumi] <i>Hmm.</i>
<i>His timing is inching closer.</i>

348
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:58,700
<i>I'll move it a bit more</i>
<i>on this one.</i>

349
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:10,446
[Yu] <i>Crap!</i>
<i>It's all over.</i>

350
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:13,715
It's not over. Move it.
He fumbled!

351
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:16,084
[Yu] Huh? Oh!

352
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:17,953
[umpire] Safe!

353
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,256
We can do this.
I have the game sense!

354
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:22,724
Takato, home!

355
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,926
[screams]

356
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:28,997
Huh?

357
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:36,905
Safe! Thatâ€™s the game!

358
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:38,507
[cheering, shouting]

359
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:41,076
[Misa] Did you see that?
I ruled!

360
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:45,447
[boy] That was amazing,
Yusarin!

361
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:48,817
‐So did we win?
‐Yes, by the skin of our teeth.

362
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:52,187
We won. That's awesome.

363
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:54,490
All right!

364
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:58,860
<i>Wait, why am I getting so happy</i>
<i>about something like this?</i>

365
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:02,864
[Tomori] We were victorious.

366
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:06,935
Please never use
that ability again, ever.

367
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:10,706
[Arifumi] I'm just
an ordinary pitcher.

368
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:13,542
But Takato, the catcher,
is different.

369
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:17,313
He's a catcher that really
deserves to be in the spotlight.

370
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:20,249
The two of us have played
together for a long time.

371
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:23,585
He knew that the baseball team
at our school was weak.

372
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:27,623
But still he chose
to pair up with me.

373
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,958
I just wanted
to take him to nationals,

374
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:32,261
even if it meant
using this power.

375
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:36,031
The nationals,
that big stage where even
pros would notice him.

376
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:40,602
So instead of personal gain,
you were using your ability
for your friendship.

377
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:45,307
‐That's right.
‐We won the game today because
we cheated with our abilities.

378
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:48,677
But you've been cheating while
pitching for quite a while.

379
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:52,881
But there are people
who will notice him out there,
even if you don't cheat,

380
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:57,253
and it doesn't matter
if it's in college or
in the business leagues.

381
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,256
You can keep watch over him
as his best friend.

382
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,259
Someday he'll shine out there

383
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:06,061
and you'll point to him and say,
"That is my closest friend."

384
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:12,534
‐I'm sure of it.
It'll be all right.
‐I know.

385
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:18,807
[Tomori] As a small experiment,
can you try taking over
his body?

386
00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:20,542
Uh‐huh. What for?

387
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:22,210
Like I said,
it's an experiment.

388
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:24,313
You don't say that
to your test subject.

389
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,349
He's the test subject,
so don't worry.

390
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,818
[sighs] Whatever.

391
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:37,025
[sighs] Huh?

392
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,127
Huh? Whoa! What the...?

393
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:40,996
Thank you for indulging me.

394
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:44,766
No, it wasn't anything much.
Did you figure something out?

395
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,968
[Tomori] I'm not sure for now.

396
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:49,971
Just going to see how things go
for a while.

397
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,108
[Yu] I beg you, just this once,

398
00:21:53,174 --> 00:21:56,312
can I have dinner
without pizza sauce?

399
00:21:56,378 --> 00:22:00,616
‐[Yu] I'm back!
‐[Ayumi] A secret recipe
of the Otosaka house.

400
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:02,384
A cream stew full of broccoli!

401
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:03,852
[Yu] <i>It's red!</i>

402
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,488
But cream stew is supposed
to be white, isn't it?

403
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:09,658
That is what makes it
a secret family recipe.

404
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:11,627
[Yu] <i>Just as I thought.</i>

405
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:13,295
<i>What do I believe in,</i>
<i>you ask?</i>

406
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:15,264
<i>I have to believe</i>
<i>in myself, of course.</i>

407
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:16,798
[announcer]
<i>The power to believe...</i>

408
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:19,368
Oh! It's a new commercial
from Yusarin.

409
00:22:19,435 --> 00:22:21,603
And it's How‐Low‐Hello's
new song.

410
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,807
That reminds me, did Yusarin
really transfer to your school,
Big Brother?

411
00:22:25,874 --> 00:22:27,343
[Yu] Huh? Yeah.

412
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:28,744
That is just...

413
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,314
so incredibly amazing!

414
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,583
[shrieks]

415
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,385
[sighs]

416
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:38,587
[theme song plays]

417
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:45,060
[woman singing in Japanese]
