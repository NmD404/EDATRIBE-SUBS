I keep hearing about.

176
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:14,902
All right, I will take you
with me, then!

177
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:16,436
Revolu...

178
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:19,607
Damn it!

179
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:22,776
That ability of yours only
brings death and misfortune.

180
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:42,329
[man] One‐Eyed?

181
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:45,232
Could you be the Reaper?

182
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:48,636
Yeah. The big, bad reaper!

183
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:53,373
[boom!]

184
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:55,909
Friendly neighborhood Reaper
here.

185
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:00,748
[man straining]

186
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:02,382
[boom!]

187
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:05,786
[Yu laughing hysterically]

188
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:21,234
This is too tough, man.

189
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:22,970
I don't wanna do this.

190
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,340
Who the hell made this plan,
and why do I have to do it?

191
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,311
I've practically visited every
corner of the damn world.

192
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:33,814
That's enough, isn't it?

193
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:37,651
I'm so tired of doing this crap
day in and day out.

194
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:41,021
Someone please take over
for me.

195
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:47,194
[chuckles] I know
what I can do.

196
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:50,998
I could just take over
the world with my powers.

197
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:53,133
It would be easy.

198
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,235
I'm a god!

199
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:57,170
Everyone will fall in line!

200
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,272
Do as I say!

201
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:00,674
[hysterical laughter]

202
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:09,983
Huh?
What the hell is this?

203
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:11,719
Filthy garbage!

204
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,332
What’s going on?

205
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:29,169
Why do I feel angry at myself
for kicking this thing?

206
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:30,671
I don't get it.

207
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:35,609
I'm crying. What the hell
is happening to me?

208
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:37,878
What's up with this?

209
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:41,114
I still need to keep
doing my best.

210
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,783
[sniffling]

211
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,602
[gasping]

212
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:03,203
It's the Reaper!

213
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:05,639
[shrieking]

214
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,876
[gunshot]

215
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,786
Gimme that!

216
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:32,833
[guard] Why won't
any of it hit?

217
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,902
Is that kid some kind of demon?!

218
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:36,904
Worse. He's the One‐Eyed
Grim Reaper!

219
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:39,940
‐We can't win.
‐Out of my way!

220
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:44,144
[kids screaming]

221
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,581
Say goodbye to the boogieman.

222
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,386
You're kidding me!
That was an RPG.

223
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:55,989
[snarls]

224
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:01,529
‐[boy 1] You saved us.
‐[girl] Thank you so much.
‐[boy 2] We appreciate it.

225
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,983
[gasps]

226
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:25,619
[screams]

227
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,921
[Yu] It's close to here.

228
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:50,711
I did it! Ha ha ha!

229
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:53,413
I finally got
the One‐Eyed Reaper!

230
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:54,915
Huh?

231
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,920
You shouldn't pick
on the weak, you bully!

232
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,922
Are you freakin' kiddin' me?

233
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:04,057
Do you have any idea
who that is, kid?

234
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:07,294
No clue, but still,
I won't let you hurt him!

235
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,930
That guy has a huge bounty
on his head.

236
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,199
If I nab him,
I get paid a king's ransom.

237
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:14,134
[girl]
Yeah, but it's still wrong!

238
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,871
All right, little girl,
if you want some pain,
I'll deliver.

239
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:21,642
Do whatever you want.
I will not stand aside, ever!

240
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,043
[snarls]

241
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:30,851
‐What the...?
‐[clang!]

242
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:33,086
[Yu] Of all things.

243
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:37,124
The very last ability wielder
in the whole world

244
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:39,627
had the power of courage in her.

245
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:44,732
But that kind of reckless valor
will get you killed someday.

246
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:51,238
‐Just go home now.
‐Huh?

247
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,407
You shouldn't...

248
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:58,311
You still have plenty of courage
without the power.

249
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,714
Run along now.

250
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:03,751
OK, but I'll go call for help.

251
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,219
I'll be back just as soon
as I can.

252
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,324
It's over.

253
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:12,926
I promised.

254
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:14,862
I need to get back.

255
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,864
It's all over.

256
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,733
So I need to get back.

257
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,369
I accomplished everything.

258
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,071
So I need to get back.

259
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:27,608
Get back... to where?

260
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:30,110
[thwack!]

261
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,684
[Yu muttering]

262
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:38,686
I need to get back.

263
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,623
I must have made...

264
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:45,192
a promise.

265
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:49,563
‐[man laughing]
‐Lap of luxury, here I come!

266
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,164
‐[helicopter hovering]
‐Huh?

267
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,835
What is that?

268
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:59,472
[Shunsake] Yu!

269
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:05,212
[woman singing
ballad in Japanese]

270
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:17,124
[sighs]

271
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,900
[Tomori] Took you long enough.

272
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:35,909
Thanks for all the hard work.

273
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:38,311
And for keeping
the promise we made.

274
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:44,918
[groans]

275
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:47,487
[Tomori] Your life
is not in danger,

276
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,324
but you should take some time
to rest properly.

277
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:52,526
[Yu] OK.

278
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:00,834
Oh, by the way, miss,
who are you?

279
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,203
[gasp]

280
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:05,773
So that's how things roll.

281
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:08,576
Of course it's understandable.

282
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:10,077
Since you plundered thousands,

283
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:12,179
tens of thousands of abilities,

284
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,848
the stress caused to your brain
must be staggering.

285
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:17,918
It's a blessing that you
can even talk.

286
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:24,057
My name's Tomori
and I am your lover.

287
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:27,494
A lover? But I don't
even recognize you.

288
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,964
[Tomori] That hurts, a lot more
than I expected.

289
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:33,901
I'm so sorry.
Did I make you sad just now?

290
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:35,636
Yeah, a little bit.

291
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:38,572
Because we were classmates
and worked together

292
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:40,240
in the student council.

293
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,444
And before you left,
you promised me that we
would be lovers.

294
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:46,046
Uh‐huh?

295
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:49,316
Sorry, I don't remember
any of that.

296
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:50,584
Huh?

297
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:52,720
[Tomori] These flash cards,

298
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,522
I made them for you,

299
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,725
so you held onto them
until the very end.

300
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,527
Did they come in handy?

301
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,262
So, these were a gift?
You made these?

302
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,564
Yes.

303
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:07,034
While I was traveling,

304
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,202
they were like
a good luck charm.

305
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,073
This was the one thing
I couldn't part with.

306
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:17,344
Even though it's so tattered
and half torn.

307
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,515
It means a lot.
Thanks for that.

308
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:24,652
[sobbing] If you were able
to come back like this

309
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:28,121
because of it,
I couldn't be any happier.

310
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:30,257
Did I make you sad again?

311
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:33,761
[Tomori] No. I'm just happy.

312
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:35,095
That's all.

313
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:36,830
I'm not sure I get it,

314
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,699
but please don't cry.

315
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,168
[Tomori] That's impossible.

316
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:49,009
Yu Otosaka,
I'm so glad you're back!

317
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:52,179
[woman singing in Japanese]

318
00:23:01,955 --> 00:23:05,325
[Tomori] This is a camcorder
that I kept recording things

319
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:07,528
I didn't want
for the longest time.

320
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:10,764
But from now on, I will keep
recording all of you.

321
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:15,536
I will record lots and lots
of happy, everyday life.

322
00:23:15,536 --> 00:23:20,508
That way, we can leave behind
lots and lots of happy memories.

323
00:23:20,508 --> 00:23:23,043
‐Sounds good to me.
‐Yep.

324
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:25,646
Oh, can I be a part
of the memories, too?!

325
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:27,480
Of course.

326
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,984
Not sure what to say
right now.

327
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:32,520
Then just be honest.

328
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,791
I'm looking forward
to the future.

329
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,460
Yay! Let's make it a good one!

330
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,195
I'm so there!

331
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,434
From now on,
we'll make sure our lives

332
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:49,903
are filled with fun
and happiness.

333
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:52,372
[giggles]
