1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:05,248
[Yu] So do your time leap
and change this world for us.
[Kumagami] Just make sure
to time it right...

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:06,750
[Shichino] Take my power
of permeation.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,218
[Shunsake]
Been a while, little bro.

4
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:11,021
[Yu] I'm leaving the rest
up to you, Big Brother.

5
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:13,056
‐Uggh!
‐[teakettle whistling]

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,057
Huh?

7
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:16,993
Hey, might as well stay in bed.

8
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:19,429
We already did your job
and made food.

9
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:21,097
Oh, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:23,867
[young Yu] Jeez, we have rules
for a reason.

11
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:26,236
You better make breakfast
tomorrow, all right?

12
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:29,172
[young Shunsuke, Yu, and Ayumi]
Let's dig in!

13
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:34,277
Hey, Ayumi, how old are you
again, now?

14
00:00:34,277 --> 00:00:35,879
I'm eight, of course.

15
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:38,882
[Shunsuke thinking]
<i>That means we get captured</i>

16
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:40,483
<i>around three years from now.</i>

17
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:43,319
<i>After I made the time leap,</i>

18
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:46,289
<i>I started by becoming friends</i>
<i>with Kumagami and his group.</i>

19
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,324
<i>That way we could fight</i>
<i>together,</i>

20
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:50,293
<i>like we had promised,</i>
<i>in the future.</i>

21
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:53,864
<i>Kumagami was the one</i>
<i>that found me.</i>

22
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:56,733
[Kumagami] That's an amazing
ability you've got.

23
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,769
Jeez, about time you showed up.

24
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:01,004
Huh? What are you talking about?

25
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:05,175
We were best friends.
We swore that we would
change the world together.

26
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:07,644
And I'm here to make sure
that we do!

27
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:09,580
Stay back,
don't come any closer!

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,347
[Shunsake] Waaah! [laughs]

29
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:13,684
[thud!]

30
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:17,387
[Kumagami moans]

31
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:18,755
What in the world are you?

32
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:21,224
Come on, you know
what my ability is.

33
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:23,727
Put two and two together
and take a guess.

34
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:27,631
‐Can it be that we met
in the future?
‐Yeah, you got it!

35
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,501
[Kumagami] Hey, we may know
each other in the future,

36
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,135
but for now we're strangers.

37
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,804
Don't get all chummy on me.

38
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:36,272
Jeez, you're such
a drag here, Pooh.

39
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:37,407
Pooh?

40
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:39,576
I call you Pooh
after that red‐shirted bear.

41
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:43,146
No way. I'd never let someone
call me a nickname
that stupid.

42
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,581
[chuckles]

43
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:47,483
[Shunsake] <i>At that point,</i>
<i>Kumagami had already made</i>

44
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,120
<i>a small group</i>
<i>of ability wielders.</i>

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,523
<i>I followed him</i>
<i>to their safehouse</i>

46
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:56,326
<i>and met with</i>
<i>the fledgling group</i>
<i>as I had originally planned.</i>

47
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:59,596
This is the one
who can time‐leap.
Shunsuke Otosaka.

48
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:03,600
It's been a while.
At least that's the way
it's been for me, not you.

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,235
Apparently he knows us.

50
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:07,904
He recently came here
from the future.

51
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:10,140
You really expect us
to believe that crap?

52
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,908
‐[Shunsake] You're Shichino.
‐Huh?

53
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:15,512
The wielder of permeation,
the ability to pass
through matter.

54
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:17,781
Unfortunately, passing through
even one wall

55
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:20,884
‐makes you feel like you
just ran a marathon.
‐[Shichino] What?

56
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:22,886
‐[Shunsake] Next Medoki.
‐Huh?

57
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,855
[Shunsake] You possess powers
of hypnotism.

58
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:29,059
You can make someone
fall asleep, but you also
fall asleep afterwards.

59
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:32,028
‐[Shunsake] Then Maedomari.
‐Yes.

60
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:36,032
[Shunsake] Able to erase
a memory from someone
with pinpoint accuracy.

61
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:39,169
However, for it to work,
you have to touch the target.

62
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:42,072
And it takes you a long time
to find that memory.

63
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:45,075
‐How's that?
‐[Maedomari] Amazing.
You're spot on.

64
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:48,545
That doesn't prove anything.
Kumagami could have
told you all that.

65
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:53,083
But that would mean Kumagami
is someone we can't trust.
Are you cool with that?

66
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,385
So, since you came
from the future,

67
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,588
you obviously want
something from us.

68
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,623
Yeah. Let me explain.

69
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:03,393
[Shunsake] <i>And so I told them</i>
<i>about the tragic future</i>

70
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:05,796
<i>everyone</i>
<i>with special powers faced,</i>

71
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:08,999
<i>about myself and about them,</i>

72
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:13,169
<i>and then about the plan that I</i>
<i>had made with Kumagami</i>
<i>in the future.</i>

73
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,271
<i>There was only one path</i>
<i>for us to take.</i>

74
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:20,043
<i>We need to find everyone</i>
<i>and protect ourselves.</i>

75
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:24,648
<i>And so we started</i>
<i>creating a syndicate</i>
<i>of ability wielders,</i>

76
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:27,618
<i>but in the end, it was just</i>
<i>a gathering of children.</i>

77
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:32,222
<i>No matter how many times</i>
<i>we started over, we weren't</i>
<i>able to protect ourselves.</i>

78
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:35,458
<i>What's worse,</i>
<i>there were members</i>
<i>that went out of control</i>

79
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:39,730
‐and assaulted the lab facility
to save their friends.
‐[young Shichino] Damn it!

80
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,566
[young Kumagami]
We don't have enough power
to protect ourselves.

81
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:45,335
This wasn't something
children could take on
in the first place.

82
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:47,504
[young Maedomari]
What should we do?

83
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,372
[sighs]

84
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:51,508
We can get help
from some adults.

85
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:54,711
Adults? There's no way we can
trust them, and you know it.

86
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:57,147
They don't have any abilities.

87
00:03:57,147 --> 00:04:00,350
How can they possibly understand
what we're going through?

88
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:04,154
Some of them used to have
abilities.

89
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:05,756
In fact, I know a few of them.

90
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:08,659
Don't you all think
it's at least worth a shot?

91
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,128
‐[Medoki] Well, if you say so.
‐[Maedomari] Let's try it out.

92
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:13,697
[Shichino groans]

93
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:17,033
So, what will we do, exactly,
Shunsuke?

94
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:20,003
Well, let me think
about it for a bit.

95
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:21,404
Pooh.

96
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:25,842
[Ayumi] Big Brother Shun,
we'd like to wish you

97
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:28,645
‐a happy 15th birthday!
‐[laughter]

98
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:32,583
[Shunsake]
<i>I need to time‐leap soon</i>
<i>or I'll get caught.</i>

99
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:37,821
[announcer] <i>Get ready for</i>
<i>the Mega Jumbo Fortune Lottery!</i>

100
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:39,723
<i>Our number‐one prize is...</i>

101
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:41,324
<i>600 million!</i>

102
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:44,728
[Shunsake] <i>Six‐hundred?</i>
<i>If we had that kind of money,</i>

103
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:47,330
<i>we could easily sway</i>
<i>some adults.</i>

104
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,600
<i>But why stop there?</i>

105
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,135
<i>If I use my ability...</i>

106
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:56,406
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>This is the only way left.</i>

107
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:59,109
‐We need funding.
‐Oh?

108
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:02,145
I'll leap back to the past
and gather all sorts

109
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,014
of gambling information
like horse‐racing and lotto.

110
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:06,149
‐Nice.
‐And after that?

111
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:09,152
We'll gather even more wielders
and create a syndicate

112
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:11,054
the scientists
can never touch.

113
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:13,690
So we have to follow
this guy's orders again?

114
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,226
Come on, just give him a chance.

115
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:18,829
Well, see ya yesterday.

116
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:22,699
I just wish I didn't have to
explain all this again.

117
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,434
Arrggh.

118
00:05:25,902 --> 00:05:28,071
[Shunsake] <i>The morning</i>
<i>that I made the time leap,</i>

119
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:32,976
<i>I noticed something wrong</i>
<i>when I looked in the mirror.</i>

120
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:38,381
<i>This ability takes a bit</i>
<i>of vision away from me</i>
<i>each time I use it.</i>

121
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,851
<i>Since then, we added</i>
<i>all sorts of comrades</i>

122
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:44,354
<i>and created a plan for us to</i>
<i>gather a large sum of money.</i>

123
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:47,858
<i>It took many tries</i>
<i>and many time leaps.</i>

124
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,961
<i>My vision gradually</i>
<i>started to fail.</i>

125
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:54,464
<i>My ability takes in the light</i>
<i>off of every object,</i>

126
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:57,233
<i>every person, everything I see,</i>

127
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,435
<i>and uses it to take me</i>
<i>into the past.</i>

128
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:04,741
<i>If I went blind, I wouldn't</i>
<i>be able to use it again.</i>
<i>But I knew the risk.</i>

129
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:08,244
[Kumagami] The research facility
was one step ahead of us again.

130
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:11,447
How many times
has this happened?
It's getting more frequent.

131
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:14,084
At this point, we're fighting
over ability wielders.

132
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:18,522
Shunsuke, we need a place
to keep them safe,
not to hide them.

133
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:23,159
Yeah. Give me a little time
to think up a plan... Pooh.

134
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:27,497
[Shunsake] <i>How many times</i>
<i>have I experienced this?</i>

135
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:30,667
<i>An environment</i>
<i>where I can protect them.</i>

136
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,402
<i>Is there such a thing?</i>

137
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:35,105
By the way, entrance exams
are coming up for you.

138
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:36,773
Have you picked
a high school yet?

139
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:40,176
[Shunsake] <i>Hey, now,</i>
<i>there's an idea.</i>

140
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:43,714
You! You are a freaking genius,
you know that?

141
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:45,849
Great, now will you
let me breathe?

142
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:49,185
[Shunsake] I'm going to leap
one more time, Pooh.

143
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:52,889
‐[Kumagami] Why?
‐I created a syndicate
and gained funding.

144
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,292
And yet I haven't been able
to protect everyone.

145
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,529
But you can't.
You know what'll happen.

146
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,697
Of course I do.
One more time leap

147
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:03,066
and my eyesight
is as good as gone,

148
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,201
but I have to take this chance.

149
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:09,439
You'll only get one shot,
so what are you planning
to do, exactly?

150
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:12,743
Create a school.

151
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,077
Why a school?

152
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,546
I've said it many times.

153
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:18,915
Our abilities disappear
once we're past adolescence.

154
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:20,717
If we build a school for them,

155
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:23,754
we can protect ability wielders
until they reach adulthood.

156
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:28,424
That way, I can protect
the potential ones
like you and Ayumi.

157
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:32,428
[Kumagami] I see, but this will
truly be your last gamble.

158
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:35,065
And it will cost you
your eyesight.

159
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:38,201
I know, but I'll live with it.

160
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,639
Of course you will.
You haven't changed one bit.

161
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,377
[Shunsake, chuckling] Please
make sure to find me after I've
gone completely blind.

162
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:49,780
[Kumagami] Leave that to me.

163
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,216
[Shunsake] <i>I made</i>
<i>my very last time leap.</i>

164
00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:59,222
<i>I haven't seen light since.</i>

165
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:03,794
<i>From that point on, I walked</i>
<i>down the ultimate path</i>
<i>in darkness.</i>

166
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:05,629
<i>But not alone.</i>

167
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:09,700
<i>For the final touch,</i>
<i>we decided to buy out</i>

168
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,002
<i>a certain educational</i>
<i>institution.</i>

169
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:14,404
<i>It was a pretty tiresome job.</i>

170
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:18,408
<i>But the joy everyone felt</i>
<i>once it was over</i>
<i>made it all worth it.</i>

171
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:21,712
Now, something can be made
of this, right?

172
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:24,948
Yeah. You really came through
on this, thank you.

173
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:26,883
But this is just
the beginning.

174
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:28,418
I know that.

175
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:32,255
On that note, Pooh, I have
two favors to ask of you.

176
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,490
‐Go ahead.
‐First order of business.

177
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,459
I want you to erase
my existence

178
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,194
from you and Ayumi's memories.

179
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:41,397
‐Why?
‐If that doesn't happen,
there's no way I'll be able

180
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,567
to move around freely
from here on out.

181
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:47,237
I can no longer
live in the open. Forever.

182
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,573
I must keep living
behind the scenes.

183
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:52,543
‐Oh, I see.
‐Second.

184
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:55,579
I want you to create similar
syndicates all over Japan

185
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:59,115
and build more schools that can
harbor those with abilities.

186
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:00,450
Hadn't thought of that.

187
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,853
Even if we can't reach them
from here,

188
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:04,821
it's still our duty
to protect them.

189
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:07,691
But if I do that, my face
will be known all over

190
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,425
and it will become
dangerous for me.

191
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,061
[laughs] Well,
if that's the case,

192
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:13,897
how about you hide your face
with that long hair of yours?

193
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:18,068
Good idea. A little water
on top would make it perfect.

194
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:19,603
Uh‐huh.

195
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:27,878
Did you really
just drench yourself?

196
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:29,780
[Kumagami] Sure did.

197
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,382
[both laugh]

198
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,722
[young Shunsuke] I'm back.

199
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:42,225
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick
about you!

200
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:44,394
You could have tried
to give us a call.

201
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,797
I'm sorry. I brought a friend.

202
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:49,432
Is it cool if she comes in
for a bit?

203
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:51,502
This place is a mess!
Hold on!

204
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:55,539
‐Medoki, go do it.
‐[Ayumi] Where should I start?

205
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,474
‐[Medoki] Ayumi?
‐Oh, yes?

206
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:07,884
[Yu] Ayumi? Who is it?

207
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,621
[sighs]

208
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:12,623
[thud!]

209
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,926
Thank you.

210
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:18,995
‐Maedomari.
‐Yes.

211
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:33,744
[sighs] There, it's over.

212
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:35,011
I owe you one.

213
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,348
[Shunsake] Your future should be
fine from here on.

214
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:40,383
Live your lives peacefully.

215
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:45,856
I'll always love you,
no matter what.

216
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:50,493
‐All right, shall we?
‐Yes, sir.
‐Sure.

217
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:52,763
[Shunsake] <i>And so I left,</i>

218
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:56,867
<i>completely vanishing</i>
<i>from Yu and Ayumi's lives.</i>

219
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,635
And that's the end.

220
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:01,638
So you created this school
we've all become a part of

221
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:04,374
by time‐leaping repeatedly.
Wow!

222
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:07,844
[Shunsake] I'm sorry we didn't
make it in time to help
your big brother, Nao.

223
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:12,015
No. He's well on his way
to recovery right now.
It's all right.

224
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:15,686
You erased my memories of you
using an ability?

225
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:17,921
Yep, that's how it all
went down.

226
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:19,656
[Yu] You even lost
your eyesight.

227
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:22,859
I tried to leap again,
but it just wasn't happening.

228
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:25,962
There is something I still
have left undone.

229
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:28,799
I believe that
Kumagami mentioned it to you.

230
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,334
A promise the two of us
need to fulfill.

231
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:34,871
Ayumi. He said that we
could save her.

232
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:36,339
But you can't see.

233
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,642
You have to make
my time leap your own.

234
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:40,811
Use that ability of yours
and presto.

235
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:43,379
Plunder, right?
I've dreamt about it.

236
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:45,849
Taking abilities
is your true power.

237
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:48,451
And it's our only chance
to save Ayumi.

238
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,220
I never knew that.

239
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,023
‐[Tomori] Takajo and I knew
the whole time.
‐Huh?

240
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:55,659
Kumagami saw through
your ability.

241
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:57,828
It's kind of his thing,
you know.

242
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:05,902
His ability is the plunder
of other abilities.

243
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:11,307
Crazy! I can't believe that kind
of power is even real.

244
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,943
It's way too powerful.

245
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:15,278
We need to investigate
how he does it

246
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,180
before we go in guns blazing.

247
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,749
Good idea.

248
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:21,852
[Tomori] We'll have to keep
our guard up at all times.

249
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:23,720
As a result
of our investigation,

250
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,622
we realized that you had
misunderstood

251
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:28,158
the true nature
of your ability.

252
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:30,393
It's not that you are
merely possessing them.

253
00:12:30,393 --> 00:12:34,464
The method by which
you plunder abilities
is by possessing wielders.

254
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:40,270
As proof of that, everyone
you've possessed up till now
has lost their powers.

255
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,174
You're saying that we could have
avoided a lot of crap
from the get‐go.

256
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:46,476
I could have possessed
the target outright?

257
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:48,612
Then everything
would have been fine?

258
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:52,916
Even for ability wielders,
that kind of treatment
violates human ethics.

259
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,418
We figured it would be better
for everyone concerned

260
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:58,589
if you understood why you
shouldn’t use your ability
carelessly.

261
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,392
Also, we were afraid
that you would have become
a dangerous threat

262
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:05,596
if you kept gaining
more power through plundering.

263
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:08,965
It was fortunate you didn't
realize this until now.

264
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:11,902
Very impressive.
I knew I liked you.

265
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:14,771
Then I can...

266
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,045
Ugggh!

267
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:25,849
My ability itself
should not have been lost, Yu.

268
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:28,318
Plunder that so you can
leap into the past

269
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:31,688
and save our sister.

270
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:34,390
All right, you should jump
to the day

271
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,326
that Ayumi develops
her ability.

272
00:13:36,326 --> 00:13:39,896
Once you get there, plunder
collapse from her ASAP.

273
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:41,532
That should make it
safe for her.

274
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:44,067
Afterwards,
find me in the past

275
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,770
and fill me in
on everything that's going on.

276
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,104
You got all that?

277
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:51,474
[Yu thinking]
<i>Ayumi, I'll save you.</i>

278
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:54,878
‐[Yu] All right.
‐Good.

279
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,613
Then I'm counting on you.

280
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:07,090
I'm leaving the rest to you,
bro.

281
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,893
Don't worry,
I won't mess this up.

282
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,669
Now go!

283
00:14:28,612 --> 00:14:31,014
Ehh! [gasp]

284
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,020
Ayumi!

285
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:40,757
What is today's date?

286
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:44,060
Yes, right where I need to be.

287
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,862
[thud!]

288
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:49,265
The ability is collapse.

289
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:52,468
‐[Yu] Here we go.
‐[Takajo]Any idea
what that is?

290
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:56,840
No. My guess is they can destroy
anything they target.

291
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,076
‐[Tomori] Where's this guy?
‐This is our condo complex.

292
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:02,378
‐[Yu] Can I have a minute?
‐[Tomori] What is it?

293
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:04,414
It's probably my little sister.

294
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:07,483
‐What’s your basis for that?
‐[Yu] She’s absent from school
with a cold.

295
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,553
To be at home at this time
of day

296
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:11,287
means it has to be
my little sister.

297
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:14,825
You're unusually sharp.
It's uncharacteristic.

298
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:17,894
Well, none of us are scientists,
but still...

299
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:19,229
I say we visit her.

300
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:21,632
That way we can see
if she's actually turned

301
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:23,567
into the wielder
of a special ability.

302
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:27,003
Wait, won't it seem
a little strange if we all
show up at once?

303
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,773
Tomori, it should just
be you and me.

304
00:15:29,773 --> 00:15:32,242
That makes sense.

305
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:35,879
You're right.
You're right indeed.
Let's do that.

306
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,181
‐Hmm?
‐Hmm?

307
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:41,051
[Nomura] Come on,
it's time to go home!

308
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:44,254
Ayucchi, get better soon, 'K?

309
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:47,323
I'm sorry for being
so rowdy just then, sir!

310
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,794
[Yu] <i>So it was her.</i>

311
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:56,933
Anyway,
I'll get out of your hair.

312
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:58,535
Get well soon, kiddo.

313
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:01,004
[Ayumi] Thanks for coming.
I hope to see you again soon.

314
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:04,775
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐I'm gonna go see her off.
Back in a bit.

315
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:07,077
Whoo‐hoo‐hoo!

316
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:08,278
No.

317
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:13,383
[Tomori] Please ask her
what the nightmare was about.

318
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:17,487
It might be a clue
to figuring out
what the collapse ability is.

319
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,155
[Yu] Hey, Tomori,

320
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:22,926
if I told you that
I had time‐leaped here
from the future,

321
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:24,427
what would you think?

322
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:27,230
I would believe you.

323
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,433
If it was for Ayumi's sake,
you'd do something
just like that.

324
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,235
I have no doubt.

325
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:35,238
Good. Awesome.
That saves a lot of trouble.

326
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:39,843
In two days, Ayumi will die
when collapse goes
out of control.

327
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:42,746
I used a time leap so I could
come back here

328
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:44,581
and prevent that
from even happening.

329
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:46,349
[Tomori] So that's how it is.

330
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:49,185
I'm worried about you
doing this on your own,

331
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:52,022
so the student council
will help you.

332
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:54,324
That's great, thanks.

333
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,427
‐[Yu] You know...
‐[Tomori] Yes?

334
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:00,931
[Yu] I think I may have
completely misunderstood you.

335
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:03,934
After I lost Ayumi,

336
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:06,970
I became reckless
and nearly went to pieces.

337
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,205
I fell down a dark pit,

338
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:11,374
but then you came
and pulled me out.

339
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:14,144
[Tomori] Since you're talking
about the future,

340
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:16,079
I don't recall any of this,

341
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,282
but if you say that's
how it happened,
I guess it's true.

342
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:23,920
[Yu] I saw all sorts of
horrible things,

343
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,889
but you always knew
what to do.

344
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:27,423
[Tomori] Sure.

345
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:29,960
[Yu] Thank you.

346
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:34,030
[Tomori] Well... you're welcome.

347
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:37,968
I guess it's time
for bed again, isn't it?

348
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:39,703
No, not just yet.

349
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:43,406
‐Let me cast a magic spell
that can cure your cold.
‐Sure.

350
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,014
[Yu] How do you feel?

351
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:53,016
Pretty good.
Thanks, big brother.

352
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:55,986
[Yu] <i>Ayumi's ability</i>
<i>is no longer with her.</i>

353
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:58,488
<i>One more thing to do.</i>

354
00:17:58,488 --> 00:17:59,890
[bell chiming]

355
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,359
[Yu] See ya. I'll come
pick you up to go home.

356
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,929
You're still recovering
so don't overdo it.

357
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,231
Right. I'll do
my very best, sir.

358
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,969
[Yu] <i>This is the hard part.</i>
<i>I'll need to be careful.</i>

359
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:15,572
[Tomori] Good morning.

360
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:17,808
[organ plays "Charge!"]

361
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:19,175
[Yu gasps]

362
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:21,812
I can't believe you got ahold
of those things.

363
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:24,014
And what are you
supposed to be?

364
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:26,049
They decided that no matter
what I did,

365
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,018
I wouldn't look like
a middle‐school student.

366
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:30,186
So I'm disguised
as a teacher.

367
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:34,024
[Tomori] Are you sure you
shouldn't have a disguise?

368
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:36,126
Hell yeah.
I want her to know

369
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:38,261
it was Ayumi's big brother
that showed up.

370
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:42,132
Good idea. That totally changes
how formidable you look.

371
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:45,536
Hmm. Everyone,
I'm counting on you.

372
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:48,739
Right. We'll make sure
to save your sister's life.

373
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:52,342
‐After that, we party! Yeah!
‐Yeah!

374
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:55,646
By the way, there isn't
a magic spell for
saving someone's life.

375
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:57,981
‐I'm sorry.
‐Now, over here.

376
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,283
We'll go in from
the back entrance.

377
00:19:00,283 --> 00:19:01,484
[Yusa] Oh!

378
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:10,326
[man] Hey, are you a student
of this school?

379
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:13,697
[Takajo] Uh, I'm a teacher here.
Is there some kind of problem?

380
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:17,634
I don't recognize you at all.
Let's go to the faculty office.

381
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,537
[Takajo] Well, sure, I'll go.
After all, I am a teacher.

382
00:19:20,537 --> 00:19:23,139
[Yu] <i>I've already</i>
<i>freakin' lost one!</i>

383
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:26,076
<i>At least I still have</i>
<i>Tomori and Yusa.</i>

384
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:29,412
[boy] Whoa. Hey,
you're Yusarin, aren't you?

385
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:30,847
No, I'm totally not.

386
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,749
[boy] I knew it.
You are her!

387
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:36,887
Everyone, Yusarin,
the famous idol, just
transferred to our school!

388
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:39,089
[students cheering, shrieking]

389
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:41,491
[girl] She's prettier
than on TV.

390
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:44,360
[Misa] Grrr! I ain't nothing
like Yusarin!

391
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,764
So you're saying you aren't like
how you act on TV?

392
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:50,801
‐Ah, for the love of crap.
‐[spits]

393
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:53,704
Would a pop idol
do something like this?

394
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:57,340
‐[boy] What should I do
with this saliva?
‐[Tomori] So creepy!

395
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,043
Hey, this other new girl
is pretty cute, too.

396
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,645
Maybe she's an idol
like Yusarin.

397
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:03,714
[girl] They could be filming
a secret show right now.

398
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:06,016
[boy] Wait, I thought
Yusarin was in high school.

399
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,318
You damn traitor!

400
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:10,253
Don't leave me here
by myself!

401
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:11,722
[Yu]
<i>They were caught instantly.</i>

402
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:14,190
<i>What was the point</i>
<i>of wearing disguises?</i>

403
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,193
[girls shrieking,
footsteps thundering]

404
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:20,396
[Yu] <i>One hour left.</i>

405
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:23,499
[tires squeal]

406
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,470
[Konishi] It's all because
you showed up.

407
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,842
[gasp] Oikawa! It's like he's
completely forgotten about me.

408
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:34,010
He just looks at you
all the time!

409
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,446
[gasping]

410
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:40,083
[Ayumi gasps]

411
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,053
[Konishi] It's all your fault.

412
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:46,957
It's all your fault.

413
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:55,165
[blade clicking]

414
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:01,938
‐It's all your fault!
‐No, that's not true!

415
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:06,042
That's why I'll make you
feel pain for a change!

416
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:10,981
[gasp] Who are you?

417
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:12,849
Big Brother Yu?

418
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:15,018
I'm gonna have to scare you
a bit.

419
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:19,590
[shrieks]

420
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,695
What's happening?

421
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:27,397
[Yu] The next time you try
to harm my little sister,

422
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:30,366
you won't get off this easily.

423
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:33,103
Get lost before I get mad!

424
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,906
[screams]

425
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,676
I was so scared!

426
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,545
I'm so glad you're safe.

427
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:44,180
Let's go home for today.

428
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,417
‐Sound good to you?
‐Uh‐huh. Yeah.

429
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:57,794
[Yu] <i>I saved her.</i>
<i>I was able to save her.</i>

430
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,429
<i>We actually did it.</i>

431
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:02,498
<i>I don't care if people say</i>
<i>I have a sister complex.</i>

432
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:05,936
<i>I never want to lose</i>
<i>Ayumi again.</i>

433
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:16,547
You're already here, Kumagami?
That was fast.

434
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:19,616
Huh? Hold on.
You already know about me?

435
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:21,818
That's right, Pooh.

436
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,620
That makes it easy.

437
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,557
Come with me,
you and your little sister.

438
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,129
Sure thing. Take us to him.

439
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:35,165
To our big brother.
