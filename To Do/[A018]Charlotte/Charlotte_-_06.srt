00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:05,756
[sighs]

2
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:10,667
I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:13,336
I don't think I'll be able
to make breakfast for you.

4
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:15,706
You're not doing anything
with a high fever.

5
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:18,742
You keep resting.
I'll call the school for you.

6
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,144
And I don't want you
making dinner either.

7
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:23,179
If you say so.

8
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:25,215
‐[teacher] Oikawa.
‐[Oikawa] Here.

9
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:26,750
Otosaka.

10
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:29,485
Oh, right. Otosaka is absent
today with a cold.

11
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:31,588
‐[teacher] Kato.
‐[Kato] Here.

12
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:33,524
‐[teacher] Kijima.
‐[Kijima] Here.

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,325
‐[teacher] Kiyama.
‐[Kiyama] Here.

14
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:37,961
‐[teacher] Konishi.
‐[Konishi] Here.

15
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:39,796
‐[teacher] Komatsu.
‐[Komatsu] Here.

16
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:41,998
‐[teacher] Komiyama.
‐[Komiyama] Here.

17
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:47,638
[theme song plays]

18
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:54,010
[woman singing in Japanese]

19
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,062
[footsteps sloshing]

20
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,969
‐[whoosh!]
‐[students gasp]

21
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:41,952
The ability is collapse.

22
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:43,987
[thud!]

23
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:46,122
[Yu groans]

24
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,625
Collapse?
Any idea what that could be?

25
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:54,164
No. My guess is, they can
destroy anything they target
at will.

26
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,266
Still a guess.

27
00:02:56,332 --> 00:02:59,269
[Yu thinking] <i>The fact that</i>
<i>it's not destruction</i>
<i>is kind of scary.</i>

28
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:02,939
‐[Tomori] Where is this guy?
‐[Takajo] Let's see.
What? No way.

29
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:05,676
[Takajo] This is
our condo complex.

30
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:08,612
Cool. Then we don't have to
worry about them.

31
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,080
[Tomori] Is that so?

32
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:12,949
This person is sitting
in their condo right now.

33
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:15,919
‐Don't you think
that's a little strange?
‐[Yu] Why is that?

34
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:18,822
Parents can't be wielders
of special abilities,

35
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,157
'cause it only happens
during adolescence.

36
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:24,060
‐Yeah, that's right.
‐So then that means...

37
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:27,497
They caught a cold and are
absent from school or something.

38
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:30,767
[Yu] <i>Impossible!</i>

39
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,604
Hey, I saw that.
What's with the sudden anxiety?

40
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,506
I'm sure that it's nothing.

41
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:37,641
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that?

42
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,745
My little sister is...
sick at home.

43
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:43,246
‐[girls] Hmm.
‐[Yu gasps]

44
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:45,849
This might be proof that
if one sibling has an ability,

45
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,084
the other will, too.
Interesting.

46
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:55,158
Well, we're no scientists,
but still,

47
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:57,528
I say we visit Ayumi
and see if she's really

48
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:00,363
turned into a wielder
of a special ability
while we're at it.

49
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,634
Wait. Won't it seem strange
if all of you drop by at once?

50
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,536
[Tomori] Oh, right.

51
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:08,004
Then I guess I'll just
go by myself.

52
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:11,141
[Yu] <i>No way.</i>
<i>Ayumi is a fan of Yusa.</i>

53
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:14,344
<i>If I bring her along,</i>
<i>I'm sure Ayumi would be happy.</i>

54
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,980
Is something wrong?

55
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,282
<i>But the fan boy</i>
<i>might get in my way.</i>

56
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,585
<i>I want it to be</i>
<i>just Tomori and Yusa.</i>

57
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:25,956
<i>Maybe I should take over</i>
<i>his body and make him jump</i>
<i>from the window.</i>

58
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:28,458
Cool. So that's how
a giraffe sleeps, huh?

59
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:32,529
Yes, indeed. They sleep by
wrapping their necks around
in a coil

60
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:36,499
Wait, there's a giraffe here?
Where? I don't see it anywhere.

61
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,334
Hyah!

62
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:40,504
[screams]

63
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,673
‐[shrieking]
‐[Tomori] Whew!

64
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:45,241
I thought it was
kind of senseless for him
to come with us.

65
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:47,811
‐[Yu] Way to go, Tomori!
‐Is he OK?

66
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:50,814
He's got a full‐body
protector suit on.

67
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:53,550
He's fine as long as he didn't
fall head‐first.

68
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:55,151
Someone just fell out
of a window.

69
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:57,588
Could you send an ambulance,
please?

70
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:59,222
Now, once school lets out
for the day,

71
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,424
the three of us
will go visit Ayumi.

72
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:06,963
I'd like to buy a get‐well gift,
so we'll stop
at a convenience store.

73
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,734
Oh, me too. I want to buy
something for her as well,
please.

74
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:13,003
I was just thinking
I might want to buy

75
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,838
a few porridge packs
on my way home.

76
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,172
[Tomori] So, what do you think,
Yusa,

77
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:18,141
shall we eat the same thing
as Ayumi and you

78
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,544
‐and have porridge for dinner?
‐Sounds good to me.

79
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,980
You guys can eat
whatever you want once you
get to your own homes.

80
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,216
[Tomori] I suppose if we were
in the way, we could...

81
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:29,686
‐I think it would be a lot
better if we ate together.
‐Why do you say that?

82
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:31,121
Because...

83
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:33,790
I'm living away
from my parents, too,

84
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:36,059
so I'm all alone,
even if I go home.

85
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:39,195
[Tomori] I'm used
to being alone.

86
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:41,565
But Kurobane just moved out
recently.

87
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,667
Maybe what she says is true.

88
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:46,570
[Yu] <i>No. Yusa</i>
<i>isn't the only one.</i>

89
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:52,075
[Tomori] <i>I swore that I wouldn't</i>
<i>trust anyone ever again.</i>

90
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:54,778
<i>I snuck out of that school.</i>

91
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:57,180
[Yu] <i>Her father sold her off</i>
<i>to scientists.</i>

92
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:58,782
<i>She couldn't trust after that.</i>

93
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,350
<i>She's still alone, too.</i>

94
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:04,487
<i>The fact that I have a sister</i>
<i>makes me fortunate.</i>

95
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:06,056
All right, fine.

96
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:08,458
We can all eat porridge
for dinner together.

97
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,861
‐[beep]
‐[cashier] Your total
is 1,360 yen.

98
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:12,996
[Yu] <i>That’s way more</i>
<i>than I've got!</i>

99
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:14,731
Hey, don't worry.
I'll pay for this.

100
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,700
And these, too.

101
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,035
Is that... stewed enoki?

102
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:21,638
Yeah! Stewed enoki mushrooms
are the best!

103
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:24,708
They'll make the perfect topping
for our porridge tonight.

104
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:27,043
We don't all have
strange tastes like you.

105
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,013
Well, I really don't care as
long as you're paying for it.

106
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,682
I'm glad you see it that way.

107
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:35,852
Excuse me, that big can
of cookies back there...
can I have that?

108
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,955
I've never seen anyone
buy that before!

109
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,825
‐That one is 2,500 yen.
‐That's way too pricey!

110
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:44,127
[Yu] And what the heck
is with that fancy bag?

111
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:45,996
I've never seen anyone
buy that, either.

112
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,832
Then again, I didn't even know
it was an option.

113
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:51,968
[clerk] Thank you so much!

114
00:06:57,574 --> 00:06:59,009
It's this one.

115
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:01,411
My sister is
a pretty huge fan of yours.

116
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:04,548
Awesome! That makes me
look forward to meeting her
even more.

117
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:07,884
However, don't forget
she's in bed with a fever.

118
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:09,720
We can't let her get
too excited.

119
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:11,855
At the very least,
she'll get a nosebleed.

120
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:14,691
‐Huh?
‐I want things to go gradually.

121
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,727
"Oh, wow, could that be
Yusarin?"

122
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,629
So don't go full‐on idol
from the start.

123
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:22,599
Don't worry. I have a disguise
for exactly this kind
of situation.

124
00:07:25,368 --> 00:07:26,369
[Yu] Perfect.

125
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:29,506
Now, wait out here
for a few moments.

126
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,844
[lock thrown]

127
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:40,183
Hmm? Guests?
I wonder who.

128
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:45,789
Huh? Look, everyone,
my big brother is finally home.

129
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:48,258
Oh! Sorry for
the intrusion, sir.

130
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:50,594
I'm Nomura,
the class representative.

131
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:54,464
We came here in order to visit
Ayucchi while she's sick.

132
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:56,432
[boy] I'm Oikawa.

133
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,069
I'm very lucky to have
your sister as a friend.

134
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,805
It is a pleasure to meet
a member of her family.

135
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:04,908
Can your brown‐nosing
be more obvious?

136
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:06,242
You already got rejected.

137
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:09,479
Ayucchi will hate you even more
if you do that.

138
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:12,683
[Yu] <i>So this is the guy</i>
<i>that asked Ayumi out</i>
<i>and got dumped?</i>

139
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:15,018
<i>Hmm?</i>

140
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:18,655
[Nomura] Sorry to barge in
with so many people.

141
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:21,024
Come on now,
it's time to go home.

142
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:23,560
I'm sorry for being
so rowdy just then, sir.

143
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:28,164
‐Ayucchi, get better soon, OK?
‐[Oikawa laughs feebly]

144
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,442
Hey, Ayumi. Sorry to barge in.
How you feeling today?

145
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,477
Wait, I didn't call for you
just yet.

146
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:43,880
Oh, I thought it was
just a personnel swap.

147
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:47,283
Ahh! Hi, Tomori.
I'm so glad you're here!

148
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,554
It's good to see you again, too.

149
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:53,423
Oh, I see. The two of you
must be dating now.

150
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:56,326
‐[both] No way.
‐Aww! You look good together.

151
00:08:56,392 --> 00:09:00,196
Anyway... we have
one more guest.

152
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:01,798
[Yusa] Nice to meet you.

153
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:06,937
It's Yu... sa... rin.

154
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,939
I knew this would happen!

155
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:10,874
[Yusa] She saw through me
instantly.

156
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:14,545
I got this. Make sure to breathe
from your mouth a little bit.

157
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:16,179
[Ayumi breathing]

158
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,450
All right,
you're in the clear.

159
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:23,353
Oh! You're right.
That's such an amazing trick.

160
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:26,022
‐[Ayumi sighs]
‐I'm so glad.

161
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,793
It's Yu... sa... rin!

162
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,327
[Tomori] I got it.

163
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:33,764
Should I cast my magic charm
that stops nosebleeds?

164
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,833
No, I think it will
do the exact opposite
of what you intend.

165
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,535
[Ayumi sighs]

166
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:41,805
My, what a surprise.
Yusarin actually here
in my home.

167
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,740
Have you finally calmed down?

168
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:45,642
Oh, good.
That's much better.

169
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,244
Oh, here are some cookies
as a get‐well gift.

170
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,013
I really hope you enjoy them.

171
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,916
[Ayumi] No way! I made Yusarin
worry about me!

172
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,351
[Yu] Try not to think of that
right now, OK?

173
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:58,789
‐She's just one of
my classmates, that's all.
‐Yep, yep, yep.

174
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:00,757
[Ayumi sighing]

175
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:03,159
[Yu] <i>Her speech patterns are</i>
<i>starting to catch on already.</i>

176
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:06,329
Now, the get‐well gift
from me. Ta‐da!

177
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:09,132
Oh! Stewed enoki. Thank you.

178
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:10,734
Do you have an appetite
right now?

179
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,236
‐We bought you
some pouched porridge.
‐What about you?

180
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:17,841
‐We're eating porridge too.
‐Yay! It's a porridge party!

181
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,243
[all] Time to eat!

182
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:25,516
[Ayumi and Yusa]
It's so super‐duper delicious.

183
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:26,917
I know, isn't it?

184
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:29,419
[Ayumi and Yusa]
Thank you for the meal.

185
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:32,523
‐That was oddly satisfying.
‐[phone rings]

186
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,494
Excuse me.
Hi, Yusa speaking.

187
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:39,996
Of course.

188
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:43,867
Oh, yes, I understand.
I'll be seeing you soon.

189
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,370
I'm really sorry, but I have to
go to work right now.

190
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:48,438
Whaaat?!

191
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:51,608
You're talking
to a show biz celebrity.

192
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:52,676
Stop complaining.

193
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:55,145
Oh! You know,
you’re absolutely right.

194
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:57,514
Go out there and rock
their socks off, OK?

195
00:10:57,581 --> 00:11:00,183
Good night, and thank you
for the delicious food.

196
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,153
‐Ayumi, please get better soon.
‐You know it.

197
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:05,321
Thank you for visiting me,
Yusarin.

198
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:08,792
You're welcome back any time,
so don't be shy.

199
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,663
[Tomori] So, I guess
we'll clean up now.

200
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:16,366
You're not going to wash them?

201
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:19,035
There’s not that many.
I'll do it later.

202
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:21,672
‐Aaah!
‐Don't be such a slob!

203
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:25,576
We're cleaning 'em.
I'll handle scrubbing,
and you'll dry them.

204
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:27,310
O...K.

205
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,121
Huh. I think you two are dating
and keeping it a secret
from me.

206
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,623
[both] Not happening.

207
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,093
You're so compatible.
You even talk at the same time.

208
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,428
‐[both] No, we don't.
‐See what I mean?

209
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:48,098
Admit it, you'd make
a totally great couple.

210
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:51,935
I'd never be a good match
for someone as intelligent
as your brother.

211
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,672
His looks alone put him
way out of my league. Ha‐ha.

212
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:58,642
[sighs] I think you're
such a good match

213
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,111
that you're even
too good for him, Tomori.

214
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:02,746
[Yu] <i>Don't be fooled, Ayumi.</i>

215
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:06,349
<i>She might as well be</i>
<i>calling me dumb and ugly.</i>

216
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,119
Hey, why don't you watch
some TV?

217
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:11,021
[sighs]

218
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,689
Whatever.

219
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:14,891
[Yusarin singing]

220
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,695
Wow! That was fast.
Yusarin must be supersonic.

221
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:21,131
[Yu] That's prerecorded.

222
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:24,267
Oh, yeah, I see. [giggles]

223
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:33,844
[Yu] Here, take this.

224
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,182
You should turn in
for today.

225
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,317
I'll tuck you in, OK?

226
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,123
Good thing you have
a great big brother.

227
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,359
‐[Yu gulps]
‐[Ayumi] Yeah, but...

228
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,928
[Ayumi] I'm a little scared
of going to sleep.

229
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:53,396
Huh? What's the matter?

230
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:55,899
I had a scary dream
this afternoon.

231
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:59,870
Well, it's pretty common
to have nightmares and stuff

232
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:01,204
when you're running
a high fever.

233
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,206
There's nothing
to be uneasy about.

234
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:06,242
By the way, what kind of dream
were you having?

235
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,580
Don't ask her that.
It will just remind her of it.

236
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:10,981
Yes, you're right.

237
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,983
Anyway, I'll get
out of your hair.

238
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,450
Get well soon, kiddo.

239
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:16,787
Thanks for coming.
I hope to see you again soon.

240
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:20,757
I'm going to go see her off.
Back in a bit.

241
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:22,859
Whoo‐hoo‐hoo!

242
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:25,328
[both] It's nothing like that.

243
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,733
[Tomori] Please ask her
what the nightmare was about.

244
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,103
It might be a clue
to figuring out what
the collapse ability is.

245
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:37,107
Hold on. We still don't have
proof that Ayumi is the one
with the special ability.

246
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:40,376
It can be someone else that
lives in this condo complex.

247
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:43,313
It's true that we don't
have proof,

248
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:45,849
but the possibility is still
incredibly high.

249
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,918
And collapse...

250
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:51,421
I can't help but feel
that it will be dangerous.

251
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,991
[Yu] <i>That's the same terror</i>
<i>I felt initially.</i>

252
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,193
So, get it out of her soon.

253
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,796
This is for Ayumi's sake
as well.

254
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:02,599
Yeah, all right.

255
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,902
[Tomori] Even if her fever
goes down,

256
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:08,438
make her stay home tomorrow
just in case.

257
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:12,509
As it stands, we don't have
enough information.

258
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:15,779
Yeah.

259
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:16,880
[door opens]

260
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:20,584
‐[Yu] I'm back.
‐Welcome back, lover boy.

261
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:27,323
Hey, Ayumi, that bad dream.

262
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,726
You think you can tell me
what it was about?

263
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:33,329
[Ayumi] Hmm... Sorry. I don't
remember it all that well.

264
00:14:33,396 --> 00:14:35,932
‐Even a vague idea?
‐Hmm...

265
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,901
Something breaks.

266
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,503
What does?

267
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,672
[Ayumi] I think the ground?

268
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:44,340
‐What kind of ground was it?
‐Uh...

269
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,910
It's really hard to remember
that much detail.

270
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:50,480
It was like there were
cracks in the ground
and it was splitting up.

271
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:53,550
Oh, why are you asking
about this anyway?

272
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:55,418
Uh...

273
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,420
Wouldn't it be scary
if it came true?

274
00:14:57,487 --> 00:14:59,355
Come on,
nightmares don't come true.

275
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:01,525
That's just spiritual
mumbo‐jumbo.

276
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:06,563
[Yu] <i>The world is full of</i>
<i>spiritual things, though.</i>

277
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,332
[Takajo]
The ground splitting up?

278
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,535
Is that some kind of hint?

279
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,870
Maybe that ability
is something so horrible

280
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:17,307
that it will also rope in
the person using it.

281
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:21,211
[groans] We still don't have
enough information.

282
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:22,546
[Yusa] So, what should we do?

283
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,881
For now we can do surveillance.

284
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:27,250
We'll use the cameras set up
around the middle school

285
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:31,454
to watch the ability;
that will allow us to get
the information we need.

286
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:36,059
Also, we should let
the teachers know to keep
their eyes on Ayumi.

287
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:40,263
The middle school has
lots of people, so it will be
dangerous if something happens.

288
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,998
It's safer for her
at the condo.

289
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:43,600
I'd like to be more prepared,

290
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,469
so make sure she stays home
from school again tomorrow.

291
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:48,104
[Yu] All right, I can do that.

292
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:51,007
Should I go cast a magic spell
that cures her cold?

293
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:55,478
There it is! Yusarin's
Magic Spell series, 21.

294
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:58,882
If you have a cold,
it's the only cure for you!

295
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:01,718
‐[Tomori] Shut up!
‐[Yu] She'll probably get
a nosebleed again,

296
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:03,754
so I'd like you to pass
this time.

297
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,456
OK. Then I'll just visit
once she's feeling better.

298
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:08,859
[Yu] Yeah. That helps a lot.

299
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:14,364
[Yu] 36.5°.

300
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,166
Your fever's gone down.

301
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:18,168
I fought off the illness,
Commander.

302
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:21,672
I'm ready to return
to active duty and doing
what I do best.

303
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,707
So you didn't have
a weird dream?

304
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,343
‐No.
‐Look, you're still recovering.

305
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,513
I think you should stay home
one more day.

306
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,617
Aww! But I'm losing my mind
staying in bed all day long.

307
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:35,619
I wanna go back to school!

308
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:37,688
[Yu] There's still a chance
that your cold will relapse.

309
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:39,189
Trust me, it's for the best.

310
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:42,392
So you just suck it up
and get back in bed, all right?

311
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,127
‐No excuses.
‐Aww!

312
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:45,862
I'll contact your school.

313
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:48,632
[whining]

314
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:58,909
I may be a little girl,

315
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:02,513
but I'm not some pushover
you can keep locked up all day.

316
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,057
The grudge of the pizza sauce
will be avenged!

317
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:17,794
[Takajo humming]

318
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,763
[Yu] Are your injuries
healed already?

319
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,264
I'm assuming you mean
the injuries

320
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,000
from when I was pushed through
the window two days ago?

321
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:27,571
‐Uh, yeah.
‐I've gotten used to
Tomori‐induced injuries,

322
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:29,439
so I can bounce back
from them fairly quickly.

323
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,510
Though, when I first met her,
it was an instant trip
to the hospital.

324
00:17:33,577 --> 00:17:37,313
[Yu] <i>If I was in</i>
<i>your shoes, I'd never be able</i>
<i>to deal with it all.</i>

325
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,784
It really makes me unsure
whether or not Tomori
should be leader.

326
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:45,188
You know, she's a lot more
calculating than you
give her credit for.

327
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:48,959
[vibrating]

328
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,595
Darn it.
She’s calling us already?

329
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:55,131
Let's hurry up and eat.

330
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:57,033
Took you long enough.

331
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,969
[Takajo] Both of us
were eating pasta,

332
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:01,104
so we couldn't wolf it down,
sorry about that.

333
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:04,140
[Tomori] Why the hell were you
twirling pasta around your fork

334
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,441
at a time like this?

335
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:06,710
What's up?
Did something happen?

336
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:09,312
Ayumi is at school right now.

337
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,516
Huh? No, I contacted her school
and made her stay home,

338
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,217
just like you told me to.

339
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:16,086
What was her condition?

340
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:19,022
Well, her fever was gone,
but I was worried
about her relapsing,

341
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:21,357
so I told her to stay home
one more day.

342
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:23,026
Her temperature's normal.

343
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:26,229
She decided to go
and attend school

344
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:28,431
from the third period onward.

345
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,366
I have a bad feeling.

346
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:33,670
We need to go check
on Ayumi right away.

347
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,915
[guard] Huh?
Uh, nice seein' ya, miss.

348
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,384
[Oikawa] Um, Otosaka?

349
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,386
I recently found a sweet shop

350
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,388
that serves really good
red bean soup.

351
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:54,758
I'd like to treat you
to some, OK?

352
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:56,660
I'm sorry,
but I just got better,

353
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,394
so I have to pass, Oikawa.

354
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,964
[gasp] Wait. Hold on a second!

355
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:05,936
If right after getting better
is bad, how about we go
on the weekend?

356
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:08,505
[Nomura] Thud!

357
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:10,306
You really don't get it, do you?

358
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:12,943
You've already been denied once,
so just give up.

359
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:15,612
Move it! If you don't get out
of my way, I'll make you!

360
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,047
Oh, put a sock in it.

361
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,115
Don’t worry.
I can handle this guy.

362
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:20,851
You go on ahead.

363
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,587
I really appreciate it, Nomura.

364
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:25,421
[Oikawa] Wait. Otosaka!
Hold on!

365
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:27,624
[Nomura] Just give it up!

366
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:30,193
[Yu] Why are we doing this
again?

367
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,195
It's a shortcut.

368
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,534
Huh?

369
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:39,302
Konishi?

370
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:42,072
It's all because you showed up.

371
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,140
Huh? What is?

372
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:45,509
[Konishi] With Oikawa...

373
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,110
What are you talking about?

374
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:51,181
I used to eat lunch with him
all alone, every single day.

375
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,884
We were supposedly dating.

376
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,121
But ever since you showed up,
Oikawa...

377
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:01,792
Oikawa, it's like he's
completely forgotten about me!

378
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,060
He just looks at you
all the time!

379
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,797
[shrieks, gasps]

380
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,969
[Ayumi gasps]

381
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:15,338
Wait, Konishi, please
listen to me!

382
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:17,007
It's just a misunderstanding.

383
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:19,242
Put that box cutter away, OK?

384
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,578
It's all your fault.

385
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:25,315
It's all your fault.

386
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:28,619
It's all your fault.

387
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:49,139
[blade clicking]

388
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:57,614
It's all your fault.

389
00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:59,215
No, that's not true!

390
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:03,353
That why I'll make you
feel pain for a change!

391
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,089
Someone, please.

392
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:09,560
Help me! Help me!

393
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:14,230
‐[Nomura snickers]
‐[Ayumi] Help me!

394
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:16,833
[whoosh!]

395
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:26,342
[screams]

396
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:38,354
[Tomori] This is...
the collapse.

397
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:41,057
‐[gasping]
‐[bell rings]

398
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:43,059
[Medoki] We didn't
make it in time.

399
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:49,600
‐I'm going in!
‐You can't, it's too dangerous!

400
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,168
Ayumi... Ayumi!

401
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:55,271
Don't go!
You'll get trapped inside.

402
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:00,376
Ayumi!

403
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,816
[bricks rattling]

404
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:08,051
‐[screams]
‐Hey, what are you doing?

405
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,386
Get away from there,
it's dangerous!

406
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:12,723
Ayumi! Ayumi!

407
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,358
[column rumbling]

408
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:16,893
Huh?

409
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,137
[theme song plays]

410
00:23:56,492 --> 00:23:58,294
[thunder rumbles]
