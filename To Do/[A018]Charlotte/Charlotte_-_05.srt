00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:31,776
but my dream is to film
a Zhiend music video.

167
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:36,446
[Yu] <i>She's never had</i>
<i>this expression before.</i>

168
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:39,650
[Tomori] Of course, filming
a documentary would be OK, too.

169
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,886
[Yu] Yeah.
Don’t film poor old me.

170
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:43,788
Just go ahead and film them
if you want.

171
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:47,357
[Tomori]
Don’t worry, I'm never gonna
film you again, I promise.

172
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:50,695
[humming with song]

173
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:52,697
Keep it. I'm giving it to you.

174
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:54,999
Huh? No way.
I'd feel bad about it.

175
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:58,235
I have quite a bit saved up
thanks to a few of our jobs.

176
00:10:58,302 --> 00:11:01,305
I can just buy a new one,
so don't worry about it.

177
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:03,340
[Yu] I see.

178
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:05,275
Then I'll take it.

179
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:06,577
[Tomori] Good.

180
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:10,047
Two will keep watch at a time.

181
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:12,382
We'll take shifts
all the way until morning.

182
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:16,253
The boys will sleep four hours,
then switch places with us.

183
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,422
[owl hoots]

184
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:21,892
[soft guitar music plays]

185
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,265
[Takajo] Hey, Otosaka.
It's our turn now.

186
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:29,634
[Yu sighs]

187
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,502
Hey, time to switch.

188
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:34,438
[Yu, groggily] Oh,
it's that time already?

189
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:38,342
[Yu] <i>This again.</i>
<i>Who was that person?</i>

190
00:11:42,913 --> 00:11:45,583
Whoa! A trout!
I caught a rainbow trout!

191
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,954
Damn it.
I'll catch one bigger than that.
Trout, trout, come to me now!

192
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,156
I'm not going to lose either.

193
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:59,463
‐[splash]
‐All right, got one!

194
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:03,300
[Tomori] Oh, wow,
rainbow trout is tasty.

195
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:06,303
[Takajo] Yusarin, this one
is cooked perfectly.

196
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,404
I'm not Yusarin!

197
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:10,675
But I guess
I'll let her enjoy it.

198
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:12,109
[Yusa] Huh?

199
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:15,045
Oh. Are you sure you don't want
to eat it, Takajo?

200
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:17,347
I'm sure. It's all yours.

201
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:19,016
Ahhh!

202
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:21,786
[Yusa] Oh, it's so delicious!

203
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:24,555
‐Things like this are nice
every so often.
‐[Yusa] Yes!

204
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:28,158
[Yu] <i>Is it me,</i>
<i>or does she just want to play?</i>

205
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,861
So, um, are we spending
the night again?

206
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:32,863
Yes. Is there a problem
with that?

207
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,866
I was thinking I'd like
to take a bath today.

208
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:38,268
[Tomori] That's fine.
I have one all ready.

209
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:42,072
‐Come on, I'll show you.
‐[Yusa] Huh?

210
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:49,313
‐Uh... how nice.
‐Here's a towel and some soap.

211
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,618
[Misa] You've got some nerve.
You set this up and just assumed
I would jump right in.

212
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:57,955
I'll keep an eye out
in case the boys decide
to try peeping. OK?

213
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,226
[Yu] You said there was
a bath all ready?

214
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,361
‐It's only for girls.
‐[Yu] Huh?

215
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:06,463
You boys can clean yourselves
down at the river.

216
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:09,266
I can't bathe in the water
that Yusarin has bathed in?!

217
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,535
Turnoff!

218
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:18,609
[Yu] You don't look that ripped
when you have clothes on.

219
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:22,112
[Takajo] Because of my ability,
I had to train my body.

220
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:24,815
Regardless of how much armor
I would wear under my uniform,

221
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:28,485
I had to build a body
that wouldn’t get too injured
when I teleported.

222
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:31,789
You did all that just so you
could properly use your ability?

223
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:35,693
Yes. But I doubt that I'll be
the only one who does that.

224
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,327
Huh? What do you mean by that?

225
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:39,664
[Takajo] In the future,
you may face a challenge

226
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,498
that's beyond your expectations

227
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:43,901
and that forces you
to make a change.

228
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:46,637
‐You never know.
‐[chuckles] Yeah.

229
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:50,340
Because taking someone over
for only five seconds
is so useful.

230
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:53,243
It's because you haven't...

231
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,145
Just forget I said anything.

232
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,815
What? Come on, now.
You got me curious.

233
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:59,650
With an attractive face
like that,

234
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:02,319
you might have some issues
dealing with the ladies.

235
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:04,922
Of course, just saying that
gets under my skin.

236
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:06,591
You're telling me.

237
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:09,694
I was just dumped
by an intelligent
and beautiful girl

238
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,395
thanks to this ability.

239
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:12,530
A wise choice.

240
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:14,965
I think we should focus
on love and romance

241
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:17,301
only after we are freed
of these abilities.

242
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,404
[Yu] How old do we need to be
for them to be gone?

243
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,841
[Takajo] It should happen
by the time we graduate
high school.

244
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:26,644
Two more years.
That's a long time.

245
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,947
[Takajo] Yes. For us,
it is a very long time.

246
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:31,982
You know what?
This is way too cold.

247
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,450
[sneezes]

248
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,786
[Misa sighs]

249
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:38,355
Ah, this feels good.

250
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:46,864
[Tomori] We'll sleep using
the same rotation as yesterday.

251
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:50,000
[Yu] Tomorrow is Monday, right?
Are we gonna go to school
from here?

252
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:53,337
Haven't you been listening?
We're staking out
until they show up.

253
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:57,675
This is ridiculous.
It feels like we're all trying
to live out here or something.

254
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:59,944
[Tomori] That's exactly
what I'm after.

255
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,515
Besides, it's not like
ditching class will affect
our school reports at all.

256
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:07,885
Even so, I'd like to go home
at some point.

257
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:09,654
I have a younger sister.

258
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,455
Yes, I already know that.

259
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:14,759
Then I'll promise to be
back in the morning.
Just let me go home.

260
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:19,564
[Tomori] I can't. If I allow
that for you, everyone else
will say the same thing.

261
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,567
‐[Tomori] Besides, I think
it'll be all right.
‐[Yu] What will?

262
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:27,404
I'm sure everything will be
squared away by tomorrow.

263
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,741
Man, I'm really sick of corn.

264
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:33,110
[boy] Excuse me.

265
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:38,382
What do you guys think you're
doing all the way out here?

266
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:41,118
Someone really showed up.
Is this the guy?

267
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:43,721
Well, we all met after
running away from our homes.

268
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:47,124
We hit it off pretty well
so we decided to set up camp
together.

269
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:49,359
[Yu]
<i>Another obvious lie.</i>

270
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:52,597
I take it, since you're camping,
that you intend to stay here.

271
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:55,265
Yes. We’re planning
to stay here forever.

272
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:57,301
It's not like people
will find us here.

273
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,803
[Saito] Really?
Well, I found you.

274
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:01,271
And I'm sure your parents
are worried as well.

275
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:05,743
If you're thinking of calling
the police, you should know
that they'll arrest you, too.

276
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,913
‐What for?
‐Simple. It's private property.

277
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:10,581
[others gasp]

278
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,687
And then there's this.
That’s you, isn't it?

279
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:18,455
What is that, a magazine?

280
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:20,891
[Tomori] A scoop article on you
practicing flight.

281
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,760
You're joking.

282
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:26,096
It's too easy to get caught
if you practiced
in public mountains.

283
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:30,568
But this place is private
and conveniently close
to the boundary of Tokyo.

284
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:33,437
Normally, you'd be fine,
but we camped out

285
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:35,239
and showed no sign of leaving.

286
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:38,475
You got restless and decided
to try and scare us off.

287
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:42,880
Once we were gone, you could
practice flying again in peace.

288
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:45,482
If you really believe that,
you must be insane.

289
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,451
I'll call the police for you.

290
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:51,355
[Tomori] You're not very sane
either if you're coming out here
all by yourself.

291
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:52,957
I came to pick some chestnuts.

292
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:56,060
[Tomori] There aren't any
chestnuts this time of year.

293
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:57,995
And you can't deny
that you were out here

294
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,097
because I already captured you
on film.

295
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:01,298
How very sad for you.

296
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:06,003
You little brat!
Give it to me now!

297
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,107
‐Yes!
‐You used the well to trap him?
‐[whoosh!]

298
00:17:10,174 --> 00:17:13,844
Of course.
If you fall into a hole that
you don't know the bottom of,

299
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:16,847
you use your ability.

300
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:20,417
I put some hay at the bottom,
just in case I was wrong.

301
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:23,487
But thanks to you, I have some
amazing footage for a scoop.

302
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:26,323
She set a trap out here and
didn't even tell us about it?

303
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,392
She is just like the devil.

304
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,795
Give me the camera!

305
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:32,963
[Tomori shrieks]

306
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,498
Otosaka, take over his body!

307
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,734
Then I'll defeat him using
my teleport ability.

308
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,369
No way.
That hurts every time I do it.

309
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:41,138
‐[Saito] Hyah!
‐Damn it!

310
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:43,407
Thanks a lot.

311
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:46,944
‐He's escaping.
‐And so fast.

312
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:49,614
[Yu] <i>I have no choice.</i>

313
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,786
[wind whistling]

314
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:57,555
[gasp]

315
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,661
<i>I'm so high up!</i>

316
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,865
[Yusa whimpers]

317
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:10,067
I have to control it for now.

318
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,936
Stop... stop... stop!

319
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:14,739
Stop!

320
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:20,077
‐[gasp]
‐You took such
a reckless risk there.

321
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:24,248
I should have just
taken him over immediately
instead of complaining.

322
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:27,417
Oww! What is this?

323
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:30,154
What just happened?

324
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,458
Well, a bruise
or a broken bone for one.
You're pretty lucky.

325
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,094
My camcorder is fine, too.

326
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:39,329
It's a good thing you survived.

327
00:18:39,396 --> 00:18:41,732
[Saito] What the hell?
Who are you guys?

328
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,368
We all have special abilities
like you.

329
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:48,906
But these abilities are kind of
like diseases that only show up
during adolescence.

330
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:52,643
They'll disappear, but if
someone finds out about you,

331
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,912
you'll turn into a guinea pig
for scientists.

332
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:57,247
You don't want that, do you?

333
00:18:57,314 --> 00:19:00,951
And what would happen
if your ability disappeared
while you were flying?

334
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:02,620
You would fall to your death.

335
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:05,623
Is this something
to risk your life over?

336
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,192
Misa, if you would, please.

337
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:09,860
Of course.

338
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,429
I see.

339
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:14,464
I thought that this power to fly

340
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:16,400
was something granted
just to me.

341
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:18,435
But I guess
there are others, too.

342
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,104
What a bummer.

343
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,406
I wanted to fry freely someday.

344
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:25,209
I even had a dream of becoming
"Sky‐high Saito,"

345
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,044
the biggest star in Hollywood.

346
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,013
[Yu]
<i>What a corny name?!</i>

347
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,215
I understand the feeling,

348
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:33,150
but for the sake
of your life and future,

349
00:19:33,217 --> 00:19:35,620
please don't use
your ability anymore.

350
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:38,689
I got it.

351
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:40,490
[Tomori] Thank you so much.

352
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,794
‐That ended peacefully.
‐Phew! That took so long.

353
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:47,832
Yeah. That's totally
how I feel.

354
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:49,967
I'm back.

355
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,669
[groans]

356
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:54,872
I didn't think
the student council was
something this busy.

357
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,306
I can't help it.

358
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:57,742
[Ayumi] I know you're
very competent,

359
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:00,377
but are you being pulled
all over the place?

360
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:02,379
It's really nothing
that extravagant.

361
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:06,250
Well then, in honor
of my big brother
and all of his hard work,

362
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:07,585
I have prepared a feast!

363
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:10,387
Chanpon noodles
with lots of vegetables!

364
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:14,391
[Yu] <i>It's not red.</i>
<i>This is... doable!</i>

365
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,395
‐It's time to dig in.
‐It's time to eat.

366
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:20,397
[Yu] <i>At last!</i>

367
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:21,832
So, how is it?

368
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:24,334
[Yu] Delicious!
So delicious it makes me cry!

369
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:28,272
[Ayumi] Actually, I wanted
to use the pizza sauce
as a secret ingredient,

370
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:30,741
but I only have
a tiny bit left.

371
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:33,578
If you can make food that's this
delicious without pizza sauce,

372
00:20:33,644 --> 00:20:36,246
can't you leave it out
of all the other food, too?

373
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:38,015
The Otosaka pizza sauce
secret recipe

374
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:40,518
needs to be handed down
to the last generation.

375
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:43,387
But when I was about to go
to the supermarket,

376
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,222
the security guard stopped me.

377
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:47,758
I couldn't buy
the ingredients for it.

378
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:49,994
[Yu] <i>Nice security!</i>
<i>This is the first thing</i>

379
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,462
<i>that's made me feel happy</i>
<i>about moving here.</i>

380
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,465
But this is delicious
all on its own,

381
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:57,334
so you really don't need
any secret ingredients.

382
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,804
If you say so.
That saves me a lot.

383
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,907
[Yu] <i>Yes.</i>
<i>I succeeded in getting rid</i>
<i>of that pizza sauce</i>

384
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:05,042
‐once and for all!
‐[Ayumi coughs]

385
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:07,678
You really aren't feeling well,
are you?

386
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:10,247
[Ayumi] No, no.
I'm totally fine now.

387
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:12,116
By the way,
I had so many stories

388
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:15,185
that I wanted you to hear
while you were gone,
Big Brother.

389
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:16,521
Yeah? What stories?

390
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:18,589
For starters, I was suddenly
asked out

391
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:20,991
by one of the boys
in my class the other day.

392
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:24,562
‐What? And what did you do?
‐Oh, you know.

393
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:25,896
Oh, don't give me that.

394
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,966
[giggles] I politely declined
the offer.

395
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:31,769
Oh, man, that could have been
a pivotal moment

396
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:33,571
that would have changed
your entire life.

397
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:35,472
[Ayumi] Aww. What do you mean,
Big Brother?

398
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,511
‐Do you want me to have
a boyfriend or something?
‐It depends on the guy.

399
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:43,447
[Ayumi] It's gonna have to be
someone better
than my big brother.

400
00:21:43,514 --> 00:21:47,852
‐[Yu] Hmm. Someone like that
is a rarity.
‐[Ayumi] You're right.

401
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:51,288
‐[coughs]
‐Oh, I'm sorry.

402
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:54,224
You might have
a cold or something.

403
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,127
A fever.
How is your appetite?

404
00:21:57,194 --> 00:22:00,931
It's OK. I can finish eating
all of this, no problem.

405
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:05,035
[Yu] 37.8°.
You totally have a cold.

406
00:22:05,102 --> 00:22:07,437
After your body is warmed up
from your bath,

407
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:09,574
you need to crawl
right into your bed.

408
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,475
Right. Roger that.

409
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,077
[coughs]

410
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:14,378
I'm sorry.

411
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:16,146
Can you fall asleep like this?

412
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:17,381
I'll be all right.

413
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:19,016
Don't you worry.

414
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,151
OK. Sleep tight, Ayumi.

415
00:22:21,218 --> 00:22:22,352
Good night.

416
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:24,589
Good night. Sweet dreams.

417
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:34,031
[Yu] <i>Well, if she stays put,</i>
<i>she should be all right.</i>

418
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:38,703
[theme song plays]
