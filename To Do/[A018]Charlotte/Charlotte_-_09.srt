of the trick?

171
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,677
[Kumagami] Next is the location
of the one with telepathy.
Take this.

172
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:25,846
Just make sure to time it right.

173
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:28,582
You're the only hope we have
now, understand?

174
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:31,451
If you fail,
they will dispose of you,

175
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:33,921
and then they'll come for us.

176
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:36,824
Yeah. I know that.

177
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,460
[Shichino] Oh, man, is Kumagami

178
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,931
really wasting his time
with that idiot right now?

179
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:46,934
‐Oh, you jealous, Shichino?
‐You know that's not it.

180
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:50,003
We've been waiting
for this moment for a long time.

181
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:52,072
A situation like this
is about the only thing

182
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:54,207
that will make
his little brother serious.

183
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,811
[Shichino] No, man,
he's just overly attached
to his little sister.

184
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,614
He cares for his siblings.
All we can do now is trust him.

185
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:04,785
I just wonder what our odds are
of actually winning
this little gamble.

186
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:07,187
If it ain't 100%,
I want no part of it.

187
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:09,289
There can't be any mistakes.

188
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:13,226
Does that mean you're actually
gonna use your power
to contribute to us somehow?

189
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:17,297
We've done our part and managed
to find someone with telepathy
for the team, you know.

190
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:20,934
Like I've told you,
I'm just waiting for
the perfect moment, OK?

191
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:22,670
So, it's never
gonna happen then?

192
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,705
‐You piss me off.
‐[door bangs]

193
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,674
Less chitchat, more eating.

194
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:30,077
Damn it.
I hope this world changes.

195
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:32,179
I can't take it.

196
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:34,715
It's time now. Pack up.

197
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:38,819
Well, so much for smelling
the air outside.

198
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,087
Excuse me.

199
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:44,825
[guard] Hey, you. Did you accept
something from someone?

200
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:48,028
Not a thing.

201
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,164
Then you're fine.

202
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:52,866
[Ayumi] I don't get it.

203
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:54,535
Why do they treat him
differently?

204
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:55,969
He do something bad?

205
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:58,038
He's not as powerful
as big brother,

206
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:01,509
but he has an ability
that is pretty amazing.

207
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:11,151
[Yu] <i>All the plans</i>
<i>for saving our brother</i>
<i>are in place.</i>

208
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:15,488
<i>The only question now is</i>
<i>when to go through with it.</i>

209
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:22,896
[woman over loudspeaker]
<i>That ends today's program.</i>

210
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,198
<i>All test subjects</i>
<i>other than those called over</i>

211
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:27,334
<i>must return to their rooms</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

212
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:29,737
Cool. Guess we'll go back.

213
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:32,540
Oh, I nearly forgot.
They called me over!

214
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,876
They what? Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

215
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:38,646
‐Go back, kid.
‐[Yu] Wait!

216
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:41,949
This is absurd. My sister
doesn't have abilities.

217
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:45,085
‐Why is she being called over?
‐[Ayumi] Big Brother Yu!

218
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:50,357
[structure rattling]

219
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:52,359
Ayumi! An earthquake?

220
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:55,362
‐[bell chimes]
‐[woman over loudspeaker]
<i>We have shut D Block down.</i>

221
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:58,098
<i>Please remain where you are</i>
<i>until you receive...</i>

222
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:00,734
What the hell's going on?

223
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:03,504
[Yu] <i>I have a really bad feeling</i>
<i>about this.</i>

224
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:09,042
Come on, let me outta here!
Hey!

225
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,678
Damn it!

226
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:20,854
[electronic chime]

227
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:28,495
It's you.
What just happened?

228
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:30,363
Do you know where Ayumi is?

229
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:34,167
Your sister's dormant power
was prematurely forced
into the open.

230
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,236
Her ability was collapse.

231
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:39,573
They shut D Block down
because half of it caved in

232
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:41,474
when her ability was set free.

233
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:43,176
‐Is she OK?
‐She's fine.

234
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:45,813
But due to the unstable nature
of her power,

235
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:47,681
they have her restrained
at the moment.

236
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:49,349
Just like my big brother.

237
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:53,554
No. After they dissect her,
they’ll get rid of her body.

238
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:58,325
You don't have time
to stand here!

239
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:02,863
You can save her
if you use the true ability
you've been hiding.

240
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:05,599
Plunder: the most powerful
of abilities.

241
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:09,402
‐How do you know?
‐You don't have time
for me to explain.

242
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:12,105
[Yu] <i>He's right.</i>
<i>Just go.</i>

243
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,910
All right.

244
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:22,182
And now they will
dispose of me as well.

245
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:24,752
[alarm sounding]

246
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:31,391
[Yu] <i>I'm going</i>
<i>up against someone</i>
<i>with telepathy.</i>

247
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:34,895
<i>Gotta be mindless, mindless,</i>
<i>mindless!</i>

248
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:37,965
[telepath] <i>Who is it?</i>

249
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:39,567
[Yu]
<i>That was in my head?</i>

250
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,234
<i>It's gotta be him,</i>
<i>the telepath.</i>

251
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:42,870
[telepath] <i>What do you want</i>
<i>with me?</i>

252
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,705
[Yu] <i>I gotta see his face.</i>

253
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:46,674
[telepath]
<i>What about my face?</i>

254
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:51,411
[Yu] <i>It's fine.</i>
<i>I'm done here already.</i>

255
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:53,514
What do you mean?

256
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:56,083
Hey, stop!

257
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,086
‐[Medoki] Excuse me, sir.
‐Huh?

258
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:00,754
[guard groans]

259
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:06,960
[Maedomari] So, uh, I don't need
to erase this guy's memory,
do I?

260
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,097
I hope that's the case...

261
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:13,934
‐[boy] What's going on?
‐[girl] Let me out!
Let me out!

262
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:15,936
‐[boy] Shutting down B Block!
‐[woman] <i>I repeat:</i>

267
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:27,447
I don't care who it is,
just tell me!

268
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:29,983
That voice. I can figure out
the direction, too.

269
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,653
[Yu] Big Brother,
can you hear me? It's Yu!

270
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:35,623
Yu? You've taken
that kind of power now?

271
00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:37,525
If they find out,
you're done for.

272
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:41,328
[Yu] I didn't have a choice.
They're about to dissect
Ayumi!

273
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:43,330
Ayumi! What's she have?

274
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,299
[Yu] An ability strong enough
to destroy this place.

275
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:47,868
Her too, huh?

276
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:49,670
[Yu] <i>I'll save you,</i>

<i>so do your time leap</i>
<i>and change this world for us.</i>

278
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,975
How the hell are you
gonna pull that off?

279
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:57,578
Damn, I just need light
in my eyes.

00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:09,957
‐[Yu] Shichino.
‐Damn it.

283
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:13,226
Why do I have to do this
for a sister‐complex guy

[Yu] What the hell‐‐
‐No time to explain!

00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:19,800
‐Take my power of permeation.
‐You sure?

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,571
I'm telling you, we don't have
any time left. [coughs]

287
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:26,740
[Yu] I understand.

288
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:30,878
Don't make me
regret this, OK?

But I really don't have
any time to waste.

301
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:20,393
I know. I'm leaving the rest
up to you, Big Brother.

[Shunsuke] Yeah. For the future.

No, for every one of us.

[gasp] What is it
with you and screaming?

309
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:44,351
Where are we?

310
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:47,855
A hospital. You collapsed
during Zhiend's gig.

311
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:51,391
‐Do you remember that?
‐[Yu] That's right.

312
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:52,793
Ayumi's gone.

313
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:55,596
Did you have a bad dream
or something?

314
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:56,997
[Yu] <i>Dream?</i>

315
00:17:56,997 --> 00:18:00,133
<i>Was what I saw</i>
<i>really a dream?</i>

316
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:04,204
<i>No. In the past,</i>
<i>Ayumi had said</i>

317
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:07,808
<i>that she felt like we had</i>
<i>one more member in our family.</i>

318
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:09,910
[Tomori] It's best if you don't
get up yet.

319
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,145
I think I might have
a big brother.

320
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:15,348
‐In fact, I'm almost sure of it.
‐What?

321
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:18,886
[Kumagami] Oh.
So you remember now.

322
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:25,793
Who are you?

323
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:28,328
[Kumagami] I find people
with special abilities.

324
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:29,930
Does this help at all?

325
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,765
[gasp] Water boy!

326
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:33,901
You're pretty handsome
when you're dry.

327
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:36,970
You were there, too,
in my dream.

328
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,073
[Kumagami] But this is
the first time
you've seen me like this.

329
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:43,443
Kumagami, you know all about
my brother, don't you?

330
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:45,913
Yeah, I do.

331
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:47,480
Please, tell me everything!

332
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,118
Calm down.
That's what I came here to do.

333
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:53,954
Come with me quietly,
and I swear,

334
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:56,423
all the questions you have
will be answered.

335
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:59,693
After that, you'll rescue
that sister of yours.

336
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:01,962
[gasp] What did you say?

337
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:06,366
You're going to save
your sister's life,
simple as that, Yu Otosaka.

338
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:08,602
But how can I save someone
who's already dead?!

339
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:12,072
Remember your brother?
If you do, then you already know

340
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:14,608
what Shunsuke's ability is.

341
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,243
Understood.

342
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:20,413
Hmm? Just to clarify here,
you mean the Shunsuke?

343
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:23,116
‐[Kumagami] That's right.
‐[Tomori gasps]

344
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:25,719
Wait, you're kidding me.
You're his little brother?

345
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:29,022
‐But you look nothing alike.
‐Does that really matter?

346
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:31,525
So, uh, can I go see him
as well?

347
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:34,828
‐It's been a hot minute.
‐How do you know him?

348
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:37,565
He's the one that guided
my path,

349
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:40,233
after my big brother became
the way he is.

350
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:43,170
I met the one person
I could truly trust,

351
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,905
and that's how
I'm here now.

352
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,908
[Yu] <i>So she was</i>
<i>talking about Shunsuke.</i>

353
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:50,811
That's fine. Follow me.

354
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:52,846
[Tomori] Thank you very much.

355
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:09,897
We have to walk from here.

356
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:18,506
[controller beeps]

357
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:24,945
Whoa!

358
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:27,748
This is so cool!

359
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:30,183
Money is no object here.

360
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,521
[Yu] What is this?

361
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:36,423
It's kind of
an ability research center.

362
00:20:36,423 --> 00:20:38,926
Didn't that start this mess
in the first place?

363
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:40,260
Not so.

364
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,362
Stop yapping and follow me.

365
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:45,699
‐Incredible! Can I record this?
‐[Kumagami] No, of course not.

366
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:46,967
Nuts!

367
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:49,770
[controller beeps]

368
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,939
[ding]

369
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:54,007
[Tomori] Overkill much?

370
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,910
[Kumagami] This is
the last safe place we have.

371
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:06,219
[Yu] <i>So close.</i>
<i>He's so close to me.</i>

372
00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:12,125
[panel beeping]

373
00:21:21,702 --> 00:21:24,304
Been a while, little bro.

374
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:29,342
‐I brought him.
‐Yeah, thank you.

375
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:30,578
That's him?

376
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:32,245
For real?

377
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:35,849
He still hasn't remembered?

378
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:38,819
It seems like he still hasn't
regained all the memories

379
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,154
‐that Maedomari erased.
‐I see.

380
00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:43,691
Erased memories?
What do you mean?

381
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:47,394
That voice must be Nao.
It's been a while, hasn't it?

382
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:50,864
Yes. I still walk down
the path you set for me.

383
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:52,465
It really changed my life.

384
00:21:52,465 --> 00:21:54,735
You've been helping out
quite a bit.

385
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:57,437
‐I'm proud of you.
‐Thank you very much.

386
00:21:58,138 --> 00:21:59,773
[Yu] What the...?

387
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:01,308
How about you, little bro?

388
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:03,376
You just gonna stand there
and gawk?

389
00:22:03,376 --> 00:22:05,846
This is
our melodramatic reunion.

390
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:08,115
‐At least give me a hug.
‐No, thanks.

391
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:11,151
Still confused.
Lots of questions.

392
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:12,720
Well, that's a bit lonely.

393
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,288
Though I'm probably reaping
what I've sown.

394
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:17,525
Guess I should tell
the whole story.

395
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:20,227
‐Right, Pooh?
‐Yeah.
‐Hmm?

396
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:21,929
[Toromi and Yu] Pooh?!

397
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:23,296
[Shunsake, chuckling] Relax.

398
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:25,332
The story of my time leap's

399
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:27,167
going to take
quite some time to tell.

400
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,436
[giggles] I'm in
for the long haul.

401
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:34,141
[Yu] <i>Just what is he going</i>
<i>to tell us?</i>

402
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:54,962
