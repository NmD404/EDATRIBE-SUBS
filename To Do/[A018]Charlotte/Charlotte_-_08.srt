how many points do I have total?

20 for the costume,
30 for the editing,

Well, I suppose I could judge it
from a business standpoint.

[Yu] <i>A foreigner?</i>

167
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:07,301
[woman, softly]
Why avoid me? Jeez!

168
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,737
[Yu gasps]

169
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:14,007
[Yu] <i>What... was that?</i>

170
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:16,310
<i>It can't be.</i>

171
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,780
Hey, wait. Do you...
understand me?

172
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,385
[woman] Take me somewhere
I can eat modern yaki, pronto.

173
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:26,587
[Yu] Uh, I'm sorry,
what did you say?

174
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:30,957
You got sand in your ears?
Mo‐dern ya‐ki, now.

175
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:33,594
‐Modern yaki?
‐You gotta be kidding.

176
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:37,298
Nobody seems to know.
What the hell is with Japan
these days?

177
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:39,133
Jesus!

178
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:42,136
[Yu] Are you talking
about okonomiyaki
with noodles in it?

179
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:45,506
Yes, noodles!
That's exactly what I want.
Is there a place nearby?

180
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,774
[Yu] If you don't mind it
being Hiroshima yaki,

181
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,710
you can find it
in any hole‐in‐the‐wall.

182
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,078
‐[woman] Does it have
noodles in it?
‐Uh, yeah.

183
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,416
‐[woman] Then let's get going!
‐All right, all right,
I'll take you there.

184
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,017
[waiter] Welcome.

185
00:10:57,017 --> 00:11:00,221
‐One Hiroshima yaki.
‐And a medium draft beer.

186
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:01,922
Got it.

187
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:05,292
‐Not for me.
I'll have oolong tea.
‐[waiter] Rock on.

188
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,262
Oh, sorry, make that two
Hiroshima yakis.

189
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:09,530
[waiter] No problem.

190
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,765
<i>Even if I go home,</i>

191
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:14,868
<i>nobody's gonna have dinner</i>
<i>ready for me anymore.</i>

192
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:19,673
<i>I have to get used</i>
<i>to this lifestyle.</i>

193
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:29,316
Aaaah!
Man, that hit the spot.

194
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:31,152
You wanna cook it yourself?

195
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:34,488
Oh, actually, she's blind
so would you mind
cooking it for us?

196
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:38,425
Sure thing. Huh?
Hold on. This woman is blind?

197
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:40,327
No way. Are you...?

198
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:43,197
That's right,
the vocalist for Zhiend.

199
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:45,266
I'm Sala Shane.

200
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:46,833
[Yu] <i>I knew it.</i>

201
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,935
Wow! I can't believe Sala
dropped by

202
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:51,372
my filthy
little okonomiyaki shop!

203
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,607
I'm so excited
about the gig tomorrow.

204
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:56,076
Please, can I get an autograph
on a signboard?

205
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,512
[Sala] Sure. Love to.

206
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:01,715
‐[Yu] I'm surprised she can
write that without seeing.
‐Here you go.

207
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:04,017
You're the greatest!
And here's your food!

208
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:05,986
Eat up and enjoy!

209
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,225
Hmm.

210
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:13,093
[Yu] Is there a problem?

211
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,328
[Sala] Hmm...

212
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:15,696
The pancake's thin.

213
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,598
[Yu] I told you
it wasn't modern yaki.

214
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:19,400
There are going to be
differences.

215
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,136
Oh, right.
But it's still good.

216
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:24,505
Nothing less from Japan.

217
00:12:24,505 --> 00:12:28,775
[waiter] Thank you very much!
Can't wait to see you rock it!

218
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:32,213
Sorry.
I was short on cash.

219
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:33,947
[Sala] Eh, it's whatever.

220
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:37,651
So, uh, did something bad
happen to you recently?

221
00:12:37,651 --> 00:12:41,355
‐Huh?
‐The way you breathe and talk
says a lot on its own.

222
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:45,659
You've been oozing out despair
from the moment we first met.

223
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:47,528
I don't talk about it.

224
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:52,133
[Sala] If I had to guess,
I'd say you lost someone
very close to you.

225
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,500
You're amazing.

226
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,068
That's exactly it.

227
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:59,206
If you don't mind,
can you tell me about it?

228
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:11,252
[Yu] Just the other day,
I lost my little sister.

229
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,953
[Sala] Oh, my God!

230
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:14,855
You've gone above and beyond
for me.

231
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:18,959
The least I could do
is put up some smoke
for that sister of yours.

232
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,228
Put up smoke?
You mean burn some incense?

233
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:23,997
‐Yeah, incense.
‐No, you don't have
to go that far.

234
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:26,533
[Sala] Come on,
I'm begging you here. Please?

235
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:30,104
[Yu] All right, I get it.
Would you please quit bowing?

236
00:13:35,142 --> 00:13:38,245
[Yu] Hey, I have a favor
to ask you.

237
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:39,513
[Sala] Hmm?

238
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:42,015
There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

239
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,819
They're siblings that really
love your band.

240
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:48,689
Huh. It sounds like
those friends of yours

241
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,757
aren't just ordinary fans.

242
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:52,893
Uh, no, not really.

243
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:55,762
Could you hold on just a second?

244
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:57,764
[Yu] <i>I just realized</i>
<i>that this is</i>

245
00:13:57,764 --> 00:13:59,566
<i>the first time</i>
<i>I've ever called her.</i>

246
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:01,468
<i>It feels weird.</i>

247
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:04,171
[line ringing]

248
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:07,073
‐[Tomori] Tomori here.
‐Hey, it's me, Otosaka.

249
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:10,244
[Tomori] You're calling me?
That's weird.

250
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:11,878
Is something wrong?

251
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:14,881
OK, try not to freak out
too much when I tell you this,

252
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:17,651
but the vocalist for Zhiend
is in my house as we speak!

253
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:19,186
[Tomori] <i>And?</i>

254
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:21,655
Huh? What's the deal?
You don't believe me?

255
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:26,360
[Tomori] No, I believe you.
There's no reason
for you to lie.

256
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,163
<i>So, what do you want?</i>

257
00:14:29,163 --> 00:14:30,231
You can meet her.

258
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:32,166
<i>What would be the point</i>
<i>of that?</i>

259
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,369
[Yu] Oh, I don’t know.
You can talk to her, interact.

260
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:38,805
<i>Sure, but I wouldn't go</i>
<i>out of my way to do that.</i>

261
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:41,242
Look, I love Zhiend's music
and stage presence,

262
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:45,312
so I just wanna listen to
their CDs and watch their gigs.
That's all.

263
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:46,847
[Yu sighs]

264
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:48,915
<i>Is that really</i>
<i>all you called me for?</i>

265
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:51,285
‐I'm hanging up.
‐No, that's not it!

266
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:55,088
<i>You're trying my patience here.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>

267
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:59,760
Thanks for waiting.
The person I'd like you to meet
is still a little far from here.

268
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,962
When do you have to be back by?

269
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:04,898
Time isn't really a factor, kid.
Don't worry.

270
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:06,767
Take me wherever you'd like
to go.

271
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,969
I know we only met
a few hours ago,

272
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:12,939
but what's important to you
is already important to me
at this point.

273
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,775
Are you sure that it's
all right?

274
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:16,910
I mean, your gig
is happening tomorrow.

275
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,513
[chuckles] The band members
and our producer

276
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:21,215
will just have to make do
somehow.

277
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:24,285
That helps a lot.
Thanks a bunch.

278
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,623
Oh, I have to tell her
I don't need dinner.

279
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:32,759
Oh, damn it.
I did it again.

280
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,362
She's not here anymore.
[sighs]

281
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:39,133
And with that heavy sigh,
I've officially lost count.

282
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:42,035
Did you remind yourself
of your little sister again?

283
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,208
Wow, you see through pretty much
everything, don't you?

284
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:54,281
Hey, I need food, stat.

285
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:56,317
What? How is it possible
you're still hungry?

286
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:59,820
That one was just lunch, silly.
Now it's time for dinner.

287
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,022
OK, do you have something
in mind?

288
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:06,026
After a relaxing train ride,
soba is the only choice.

289
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:09,029
Great God in heaven!

290
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:12,098
Croquet Soba is the most amazing
thing I've ever tasted!

291
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:17,171
Ahh! What miraculous chemistry!

292
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:20,474
I gotta pay my respects
to whoever came up with this.

293
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:22,709
I'm so happy for you.

294
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:26,513
[Yu] Hey, can I ask you
one thing?

295
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:28,149
[Sala] Yeah, of course you can.

296
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,284
Sorry if this is
a delicate question,

297
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:33,520
but your eyes,
are they 100% blind?

298
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,722
Yep. I can't see a thing.

299
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:37,791
But you can write autographs.

300
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,861
I'm assuming that means you
weren't born blind, were you?

301
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:43,530
No. But I've come to think of it
as my penance.

302
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,865
Wait, penance?

303
00:16:44,865 --> 00:16:48,769
This is how I atone
for all my sins.

304
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,173
Have you ever thought about
the great tragedy of life
before?

305
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:54,074
That was
an abrupt change of topic.

306
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:57,411
[Sala] Life is something
you only live once, right?

307
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:59,079
[Yu] Of course.

308
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,882
[Sala] I had dreamed
of spending my life
working on stage

309
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:03,684
as the front man for a band.

310
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:08,355
But my life was already
beyond hope before I knew it.

311
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:11,292
And I couldn't grant myself
that dream.

312
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:14,861
I was pitiful at both
singing and playing guitar

313
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:19,300
and watched as people my age
were showered with praise
for their songs.

314
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,067
I hated God.

315
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,570
OK, but aren't you living
that dream right now?

316
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,073
‐Yes, but that's only because
I was able to cheat.
‐How so?

317
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:31,077
[Sala] How isn't important.
The fact is that I was greedy.

318
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:33,880
There was a time when I was
popular in Japan too.

319
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,186
A social phenomenon!
A person of the times.
That kind of success.

320
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:41,588
When you're making
the kind of money I was,

321
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:44,158
the people around you start
to look at you differently,

322
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:45,659
and always for the worse.

323
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,529
In the end, you even become
a threat to your family.

324
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:51,798
My little brother was once
kidnapped for ransom.

325
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:55,001
That's when I walked away
from the life.

326
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:59,573
After that, I decided
to be the front man
for a really dull band.

327
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:03,877
Finally, I bartered my eyesight
away to God,

328
00:18:03,877 --> 00:18:05,412
and that's the end.

329
