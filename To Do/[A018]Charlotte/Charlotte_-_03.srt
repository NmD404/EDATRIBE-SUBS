1
00:00:03,453 --> 00:00:06,890
Sorry, but I overslept
this morning and ran
out of time.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,826
So it's omelet rice again.

3
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:12,329
Y‐You know, I don't need
to bring lunch anymore.

4
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,231
Oh? Really? Why is that?

5
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:16,734
Well, most of the guys don't
bring their own lunches.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,669
They all go to the cafeteria.

7
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:21,104
I'm going to be eating
with them from now on.

8
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:24,474
[sighs] Too bad.
I like to make your lunch.

9
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:28,846
But, since I made it today,
I want you to take it with you!

10
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,313
Uh, sure.

11
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:38,889
[Yu thinking] <i>There’s no way I'd</i>
<i>be able to eat omelet rice</i>

12
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,324
<i>with a message written on it</i>
<i>in a classroom.</i>

13
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,630
[theme song plays]

14
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,070
[woman singing in Japanese]

15
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:21,559
‐[Takajo] Oh, good morning.
‐Yeah, good morning.

16
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,794
You seem fairly spiritless
today.

17
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:27,164
No, this is about how low
my spirit is all the time.

18
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,431
Especially mornings.

19
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,968
Tell you what: at lunch today,
I'm gonna buy you

20
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,736
the limited edition
beef tongue curry,

21
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,938
guaranteed to lift your spirits
right up.

22
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,508
Will you make it there in time
to get a limited edition?

23
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:40,477
With my ability for speed,
it'll be a piece of cake.

24
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:42,479
Ah, that's right.

25
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:47,050
[bell tolls hour]

26
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:48,752
[whoosh!]

27
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:50,621
[muffled moaning, clatter]

28
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:52,155
[Yu groans]

29
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:00,063
Huh?

30
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,966
Hello, I've been
waiting for you. Here you go.

31
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:07,037
[Yu] Right now, I think
it would be better if we got you
straight to the hospital.

32
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,773
Oh, I'm used to this.
It happens all the time.

33
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,675
I'm sorry to make you
worry about me.

34
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:14,745
[Yu] <i>His ability</i>
<i>is way too half‐assed.</i>

35
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:24,855
<i>Ahhh! A flood of spices.</i>
<i>This is how curry should be!</i>
<i>Delicious!</i>

36
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:27,190
I'm glad it exceeds
your expectations.

37
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:30,561
Curry is something that should
be spicy, after all.

38
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:34,598
[Takajo] It's medium spicy,
but is that the right level
of spice for you?

39
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:37,134
The beef tongue melts
in your mouth.
It's the best!

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,603
‐[Takajo] You must
really love curry.
‐Mm‐hmm.

41
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,505
I'd actually forgotten
how much.

42
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:42,906
[buzz]

43
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:47,344
OK. I understand.

44
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,179
Our comrade is coming again.

45
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:51,815
We should head
to the student council room.

46
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:55,819
[crash!]

47
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,989
[wet footsteps]

48
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:02,726
Why does that guy always
show up soaking wet?

49
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:07,297
He can't use his special ability
unless he gets soaking wet
while fully clothed first.

50
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:10,167
[Yu]
<i>What a cumbersome,</i>
<i>half‐assed ability.</i>

51
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,942
The ability is channeling.

52
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,045
‐What is "channeling"?
‐Spiritualism.

53
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:24,748
Allowing dead individuals
to possess them like shamans.

54
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:28,986
Someone who can really
use that as a special ability
and not just a fraud?

55
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,321
That’s pretty amazing.

56
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:34,391
One more: pyrokinesis.

57
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:35,826
[gasp]

58
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:39,062
I can't believe this person
has two abilities.

59
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:42,766
I'd like to get moving and grab
this one as quickly as possible.

60
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,268
Wait, this is an ordinary road.

61
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,337
And is that
supposed to mean something?

62
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:50,641
‐It means they're on the move.
‐In the middle of a weekday?

63
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,475
Are they ditching school
or something?

64
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,311
But this road is troubling.

65
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,148
It'd be much better if
it wasn't a narrow alley
that's not very popular.

66
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,883
So, what’s the big deal?

67
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,653
Oh, well, we should
head out there anyway.

68
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,988
[snarls]

69
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,961
‐Huh? This is the place?
‐Yes.

70
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,604
What's the matter?

71
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,206
It looks like that person
must have been pretty desperate

72
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,475
‐when they passed through here.
‐How's that?

73
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,845
[Tomori] This side of the box
has no dust on it.

74
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,582
In other words, whoever it was
ran through here
and bumped into this box.

75
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,152
[Takajo] What you're saying is
that you think this person
was being chased.

76
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:36,854
Sounds like there was
an incident.

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,257
‐Another troublesome‐‐
‐For now we'll keep
moving forward.

78
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,862
[Tomori] Two new sets
of footprints.

79
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,496
One of them
has a short stride

80
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,632
and the other one
is quite a bit longer.

81
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:51,935
This totally indicates a girl
being chased by an adult.

82
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,637
We have to hurry.

83
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,450
‐Oh, that thing earlier?
‐[Tomori] What was it?

84
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:10,988
They were filming something
where an idol was being chased
by a big guy.

85
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:13,624
‐[Tomori] An idol?
‐Let's see...

86
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:15,926
Right, it was Yusa Nishimori.

87
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,562
‐I've heard that name before.
‐[Yu] <i>Me too.</i>

88
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,531
‐[fanfare plays]
‐Yusarin?!

89
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,801
[Yu] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>It's the idol that Ayumi likes.</i>

90
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,436
‐So you know her?
‐She's the unbelievable
lead vocalist

91
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:28,939
for the band How‐Low‐Hello
and an upcoming gorgeous
super idol

92
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:32,209
that sings and dances
like no one I've ever seen
in my life!

93
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:34,912
I can't tell you what
a big turnoff that is. Stop!

94
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,015
Her career started
in the sixth grade when
she won the grand prize

95
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,751
in the 14th
reader‐model audition
for the magazine <i>Petit Banana</i>

96
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,753
and debuted
as their exclusive model!

97
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,057
Then she landed a job
as a regular member of
the "Movement Morning!" show

98
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:49,159
but quit two years later
to focus on school.

99
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:52,162
She restarted her career
in show biz after‐‐

100
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:53,764
Hold it.
Let's get back to the point.

101
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,800
So that girl caused some issue
with her special ability

102
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,902
and became a fugitive,
am I wrong?

103
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:02,305
‐You really don't have
to say that for us to know it.
‐[Yu groans]

104
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:04,508
[Yu] Her agency
is Sea Rex Productions.

105
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,677
Wouldn't it be quicker
if we just called them?

106
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:10,581
‐We're talking show biz here.
They're not gonna tell us
anything.

107
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:12,182
Then what should we do?

108
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,384
[Tomori] Let's see.

109
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:15,853
[gasp]

110
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,556
A suspicious target.
I'll chase him!

111
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,630
‐[Yu] Tomori!
‐Otosaka, use your ability!

112
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,831
[Yu] Huh?

113
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:30,000
[energy pulses]

114
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,538
[groans]

115
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:38,976
[Yu moans]

116
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,711
I'm the one who actually
feels the pain,

117
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:43,947
so I'd rather you not
use this tactic from now on.

118
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:46,984
‐This is why
we get compensation.
‐What?

119
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,419
[groans] That hurt.

120
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:52,556
Damn it, what would you have
done if the camcorder broke?

121
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:53,991
[Yu] That's your issue?

122
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,126
[Tomori] Wake up, bastard.

123
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:57,628
[suspect groans]

124
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,663
[Tomori] Who the hell are you?

125
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,431
No, who the hell are <i>you?</i>

126
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:05,202
Tell us what we wanna know
and we'll call
an ambulance for you.

127
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:08,105
You realize you're headed
straight to death right now?

128
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:10,874
I was just offered a job,
all right?

129
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,175
[Tomori] What kind?

130
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,678
Sorry, I can't tell you that.

131
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:18,481
Is it something you're willing
to lose your life to protect?

132
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,121
[suspect] I'm looking
for Yusa Nishimori.

133
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,557
[Tomori] And who asked you
to do that?

134
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:27,825
[suspect] Taiyo TV.

135
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,392
Right. What was their name?

136
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:35,032
I don't know the person's name.
And that's the truth.

137
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:39,570
Great, understood.
I'd already called for
an ambulance before you talked.

138
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,073
[siren wails]

139
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:49,246
[stranger] Hey.
What the hell are you guys?

140
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:54,117
Just some people looking for
a woman named Yusa Nishimori.

141
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:55,653
Her nickname is Yusarin!

142
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:56,954
Why are you looking?

143
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,956
I don't exactly know
the reason why,

144
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:02,292
but it's a fact that
she's being chased, so we
thought we'd help her out.

145
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,995
‐You guys know Yusa?
‐I'm a huge fan!

146
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:06,864
‐[kick]
‐Would you stop interrupting?

147
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,300
I was watching you.
How the hell did you
defeat that guy?

148
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,736
[Tomori] We did it
using special abilities.

149
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,839
Probably a lot like the ability
Nishimori has.

150
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:18,542
[stranger] How do you know
about that?

151
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:23,180
If you just trust us, I believe
we can help save her from harm.

152
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:26,584
I see. I'm gonna need
to see some proof.

153
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,587
Show me that you have
the same power that she does.

154
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,556
It's not exactly
the same power, but...

155
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,091
What the...?

156
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,693
[Tomori] Here.

157
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:39,129
Now do you believe
what I'm saying?

158
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:42,833
Yeah. Come on,
I'll take you to her.

159
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,269
‐Though it's a bit confusing.
‐[Tomori] What do you mean
by that?

160
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,705
Things got slightly complicated.

161
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:51,341
I want you guys
to see for yourselves.

162
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:56,814
[Tomori] So this
is a nightclub.

163
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:04,154
[Yu] You really don't
have to film all this, do ya?

164
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:06,123
[stranger] This way.
And don’t lag behind.

165
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,025
Hey, I'm back.

166
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:10,493
So how is everything
outside today?

167
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:15,666
Ohh! It actually is
the real Yusarin!

168
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:19,102
‐I have all
the How‐Low‐Hello CDs.
‐Big turnoff!

169
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,471
Thanks so much,
that's wonderful.

170
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,174
[Yu] <i>It really is</i>
<i>the girl I saw on TV.</i>

171
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,076
Hey, what is with those guys?

172
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:29,613
They're just like Misa
and have special abilities
that they can use.

173
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,517
Wait a minute, I thought
her name was Yusa,
but it's actually Misa?

174
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:35,919
That's the part
that makes this complicated.

175
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:38,756
What are you doing?
You sure we can trust them?

176
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:41,892
I watched them use their powers
to defeat those other guys,
all right?

177
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,062
Is it OK if we ask her directly
what's going on here?

178
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:48,899
If you ask something stupid,
you're not getting out of here
in one piece.

179
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,568
[Yu] <i>Why you gotta be so scary?</i>

180
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,870
Tomori, be really careful here.

181
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,471
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:56,807
It's very nice to meet you.
I'm Tomori.

183
00:10:56,874 --> 00:11:01,044
I'm Yusa Nishimori,
nicknamed Yusarin.
It's very nice to meet <i>you.</i>

184
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,480
[Yu] <i>So she</i>
<i>calls</i> herself <i>Yusarin?</i>

185
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:05,916
This is the first time in
my life I've met a real idol.

186
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:09,720
You're so unbelievably cute,
you almost look like a doll.

187
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:12,656
‐I want to get as close
to you as she is.
‐Hey, back off!

188
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:16,126
Now, now.
So first off, could you please
tell me your actual name?

189
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:19,897
‐It's Yusa Kurobane.
‐Yeah? Well, I wasn't
asking you!

190
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:22,465
[Yu] Your real name sounds
more like a stage name.

191
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,367
Yes. I hear that a lot.

192
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,369
But Kurobane means
"black feathers,"

193
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,338
and it's not really suitable
for an idol,

194
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,407
so they renamed me Nishimori.

195
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:32,075
That makes sense.

196
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:33,410
Now, there are some occasions

197
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,278
when you are not
Yusa Kurobane.

198
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:36,714
Are you aware of that fact?

199
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,782
No, she's not, so how do you
know about it?

200
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:41,619
‐I wasn't asking you, bastard.
‐What was that?

201
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:43,587
So, was I right about that,
Kurobane?

202
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:46,924
That's exactly it.
I guess you can call it
sleepwalking.

203
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,226
I've been falling asleep
without realizing it,

204
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:53,196
and then when I wake up,
I'm somewhere else,
with no idea how I got there.

205
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:56,133
The doctors who examined me
said there's a chance
that I have

206
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:57,334
a multiple personality disorder.

207
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,269
Oh, they did, huh?

208
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:04,241
Well, it's not schizophrenia,
so you don't have to worry
about that.

209
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,443
[sighs]

210
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:15,085
She has her own special ability
just like the three of us.

211
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,589
Her power is
to allow a dead person
to possess her body.

212
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,023
Seriously?

213
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,893
I believe that the ability is
calling forth this Misa girl

214
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,462
that you guys
were talking about earlier.

215
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,565
‐[Yusa] Misa?
‐[Tomori] Is something
the matter?

216
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:31,301
‐[Kota] Don't ask anything.
‐Is it someone she knew?

217
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:33,537
Yeah, she was Yusa's
older sister.

218
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:36,907
She died six months ago
in an accident.

219
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:39,643
You bastard.

220
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,545
Don't go blabbing on
about things

221
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:44,314
to some stranger
you just met!

222
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:47,084
‐[Takajo groans]
‐Can I assume that you're Misa?

223
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,021
It's so annoying how cramped
it is with all of you here!

224
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:53,323
[Yu]
<i>She’s totally changed.</i>

225
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,098
‐[Tomori]
‐Whoa, that's really impressive.

226
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:05,669
[Sho] Calm down, Misa!
You're gonna burn us all
to death!

227
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:11,775
[Misa] I suppose
that wouldn't be good.

228
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,746
[Tomori] I'm very surprised.

229
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:18,949
It seems she can't call forth
the spirit on her own

230
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,150
and that Misa is in control.

231
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,885
So you got a problem with that?

232
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:24,321
[Yu] <i>Another ability that's</i>
<i>somehow half‐assed.</i>

233
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,725
That means she has
an unparalleled ability
to be possessed.

234
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:32,262
And Misa, who possesses Yusa,
has pyrokinetic ability.

235
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:33,631
Yeah.

236
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:36,033
So, what is your relationship
with these two?

237
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:40,037
They're my friends
from back when I was alive
and still causing trouble.

238
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:44,341
[Tomori] Do you have any idea
why your little sister
is being chased?

239
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,943
Yeah. 'Cause of this.

240
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,212
Yusa accidentally brought this
home from some shoot.

241
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,215
It belongs to one of
the bigger‐name producers
at the TV station.

242
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:55,519
And she accidentally read
a text that was sent to it.

243
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:58,722
Stealing company money,
organized crime connections.

244
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:01,992
Stuff that would get the guy
arrested if it was taken
to the cops.

245
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:04,361
[Tomori] Did you guys think
to turn the power off?

246
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,930
Yeah. But it was on
until yesterday.

247
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:08,766
[Tomori] Then they probably
already know

248
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:12,035
that you're hiding somewhere
in this area from the GPS.

249
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,338
Even if you gave
the phone back now,
you wouldn't be safe.

250
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:17,575
And, if you gave it
to the police,

251
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,943
it would look like Kurobane
sold out the producer

252
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,479
and could keep her
from working in show biz.

253
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:25,415
OK, I'll burn it down,
station and all.

254
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:28,852
Are you stupid? You do that,
and your little sister
will end up in prison!

255
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,088
Who the hell do you think
you are, huh?

256
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:35,526
Do you really want to do
something that will land her
a stint in juvenile hall?

257
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:38,228
That would make
absolutely no sense.

258
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,632
[Tomori] Now please calm down.
You want to save your sister,
right?

259
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,667
Huh? Yes, of course.

260
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:45,235
Then we should help each other

261
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,971
turn the tables on this guy
and threaten him instead.

262
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:49,206
Huh?

263
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:50,841
Can we win?

264
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:53,644
I'm really good at creating
wonderfully devious plans

265
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:56,346
for threatening others,
so you can trust me.

266
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:58,315
You've got spunk.

267
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:00,918
All right then,
I'll do whatever you say.

268
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,386
I'd like the both of you
to help as well.

269
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:06,724
[Sho] Of course we will,
if Misa says so.

270
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,794
Oh my, I didn't fall asleep
again just now, did I?

271
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:13,564
You must be really tired,
that's all, it's all right.

272
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:16,199
Why don't you have some
roasted marshmallows and relax?

273
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:20,003
[Yusa] Oh!
The marshmallows turned
into freshly roasted ones.

274
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,907
[Takajo thinking]
<i>This is unbearable.</i>

275
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:26,376
<i>I have no clue how I should</i>
<i>approach Yusarin from now on.</i>

276
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:29,246
<i>Every picture I had in my head</i>
<i>about her has been blown.</i>

277
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:30,748
[Yu]
<i>You're a scary guy.</i>

278
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:33,551
First we should head to a shop
that sells work clothes.

279
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:38,922
‐What for?
‐You two are going to need
a set of fireproof clothing.

280
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,393
[vibrates]

281
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,463
[line rings]

282
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,766
‐[click]
‐[producer] <i>It's me.</i>

283
00:15:58,475 --> 00:15:59,677
Huh?

284
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,613
So you finally showed up.

285
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,582
Realize that you couldn't
escape?

286
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:08,686
[Yusa] Um, I really don't know
the reason why I'm being
chased so much.

287
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,888
Did I do something wrong?

288
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,723
[producer] Give me back
my phone!

289
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,992
‐Is this the one?
‐[producer] Yeah.

290
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,662
Even if I return it to you now,
am I, like, still in trouble?

291
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:22,700
Whatever happens,
there's no future for you
in this industry anymore.

292
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:25,636
There's no more future for me?

293
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:29,507
Bastard! The one who has
no future is you!

294
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:32,976
[groaning]

295
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:37,114
I think I'll take out one more!

296
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,617
[groaning]

297
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:42,853
What the...
What the hell's going on?

298
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,723
You probably thought that
you had me cornered tonight,

299
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:50,027
but you didn't realize that it
was me that had you cornered
all along.

300
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,896
You really are senseless,
you know?

301
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:54,865
[producer] What the hell
are you?

302
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,868
I mean, are you really
Yusa Nishimori?

303
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:01,672
Of course, I'm Yusa Nishimori,
the real Yusarin, who else?

304
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,974
And in order to ensure
my success,

305
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:08,178
I'm willing to kill anyone
who gets in my way, like them!

306
00:17:08,245 --> 00:17:10,013
[screams] That hurts!

307
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,151
This is getting boring.
I'll get rid of them
all at once.

308
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:19,122
W‐Wait, wait, wait.
Just a minute. Hold on, please.

309
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:23,126
‐Like I'm gonna wait!
‐[producer groans]

310
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,601
What the hell is going on here?

311
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:35,205
[Misa] I can bury you
in the shadows at any point
I want, understand?

312
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:38,576
I get it, I give up.
Please, don't hurt me.

313
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,678
[Misa] I'll give this
back to you.

314
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:43,647
But there is no next time.

315
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:46,449
I'll eradicate you
in a heartbeat.

316
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,986
[producer whimpering]

317
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:52,289
[both snicker]

318
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:59,229
[Tomori] Thank you very much
for all your help.

319
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,831
[Misa] No, you helped us.

320
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:02,966
He believed that everything
that happened tonight

321
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,835
was done by Yusa
all on her own.

322
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:08,772
That producer will never dare
to go up against her again.

323
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,043
No, I'm afraid everything is not
completely settled yet.

324
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:18,816
And so I'd like you to transfer
into Hoshinoumi Academy

325
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:21,519
and do everything you do
alongside us from now on.

326
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:22,886
Why would she do that?

327
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:25,088
Just like how
I explained earlier.

328
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:28,458
If she gets caught
by the scientists, her days
as a guinea pig will begin

329
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:32,095
and she will never be able
to return to a normal life,
understand?

330
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:34,865
The condo next to our academy
will be the safest place

331
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:39,069
for Kurobane to continue to grow
and live something
of a normal existence.

332
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,440
[Misa] That's a life‐saving
story for Yusa.

333
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:44,942
We'll do that.

334
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:46,343
Hold on!

335
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:47,678
Then, well...

336
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:49,346
If Yusa's powers disappear,

337
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:52,049
does that also mean
we'll never see Misa again?

338
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:54,718
Yeah, that's exactly
what I wanted to ask.

339
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,654
Well, I suppose
that will happen,

340
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,522
but she's already dead,
isn't she?

341
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:01,659
Isn't it amazing that you were
able to see her at all?

342
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,695
‐But‐‐
‐Sho, it's just like she says.

343
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:06,129
In reality, she's not here.

344
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:10,333
It's time to say goodbye
and let her go.

345
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,240
Then at least let me tell her
how I truly feel about her.

346
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:19,142
[Misa] Hmm?

347
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,417
Well, uh...
How do I put this?

348
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:30,821
Now is when I can't
think of what I should say?

349
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:34,792
Huh? Sho? Did you used to have
the hots for me?

350
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:38,328
Uh...

351
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:39,830
That's right.

352
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:41,965
I really loved you, Misa.

353
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:43,567
It's embarrassing to say...

354
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,335
but I was in love

355
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:49,039
and you passed away
before I could tell you.

356
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:52,242
We had a motorcycle accident
while we were riding together.

357
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,213
I was OK, but I was the one
that killed you.

358
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,881
It's my fault.

359
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:01,218
I see. It's all right.

360
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,988
I made you harbor
such immense feelings inside,

361
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:08,559
but I was the one that looked
for dangerous thrills.

362
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:10,994
I reaped what I sowed.

363
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,933
Don't cry,
that's not like you at all.

364
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,802
Sho, forget about me.

365
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:22,139
And starting tomorrow,
live your own life.

366
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:25,342
And don't keep dragging
the dead into it.

367
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:28,045
Otherwise, your life
will get screwed up

368
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:31,682
and you won't be happy
in the future, OK?

369
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:34,918
Jeez, you really are
a troublesome boy.

370
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:37,588
Sho.

371
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,489
[Sho] All right, Misa.

372
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:43,561
I'll walk my own path
that you're not a part of.

373
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:46,396
I'll sever my feelings
for you.

374
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,165
And that's how I'll live on.

375
00:20:48,231 --> 00:20:50,834
Good. And I hope
that both of you

376
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,670
live very long and happy lives.

377
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:55,639
‐Yeah.
‐Sure.

378
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:58,942
See ya!
And thanks for everything.

379
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:02,412
'Cause it was
absolutely great!

380
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:06,784
[Yu sighs]

381
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,519
[Yu]
<i>It was a really long day.</i>

382
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:10,453
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

383
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,022
You are so late!

384
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:13,691
If you're going to be this late,

385
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:15,593
I told you that I wanted you
to call!

386
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:19,129
How about you?
What are you doing up
at this hour?

387
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,599
Eating dinner together
as a family is a rule

388
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:24,635
that's been passed down
the Otosaka house
for generations.

389
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:28,338
Sorry, I was busy again today
doing work for
the student council.

390
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:32,275
Aww. When you say that to me,
I can't say anything back.

391
00:21:32,342 --> 00:21:35,245
So tell me, what is it you made
for dinner tonight?

392
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:38,816
I made a very satisfying
spaghetti with meat sauce.

393
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:43,921
[soft music in background]

394
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:47,858
Oh! It's How‐Low‐Hello again!
[giggles]

395
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:52,162
‐[sighs]
‐[woman singing in Japanese]

396
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:58,135
Wow, it really is the same
person that I met today.

397
00:21:58,201 --> 00:22:00,838
Huh? Who exactly
are you talking about?

398
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,440
You know, Yusa Nishimori,
the actual person.

399
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:06,844
You mean the real one?
So you've actually gotten
to meet Yusarin?

400
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,781
[Yu] <i>Oh, crap!</i>
<i>But they didn't tell me</i>
<i>to stay quiet about this.</i>

401
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:12,816
<i>So I guess I can tell her.</i>

402
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:15,052
She's transferring
into my academy tomorrow.

403
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:18,421
What? Oh, that makes me
so jealous!

404
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:21,424
Do you think that maybe I'll be
able to meet her soon?

405
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:24,194
Well, I guess that certainly is
a possibility.

406
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,629
Wow!

407
00:22:25,696 --> 00:22:28,966
‐Oh, wow.
‐Let's start by cleaning up
your nosebleed.

408
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:31,368
It's just something
that's so amazing!

409
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:35,372
[Yu] <i>Come on,</i>
<i>you're getting way too excited</i>
<i>about this.</i>

410
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,542
[theme song plays]

00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,015
