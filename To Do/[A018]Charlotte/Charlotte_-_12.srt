[shrieking]

3
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:33,380
It... hurts.

4
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,874
[Shichino] Of course it hurts.

5
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:37,043
It's only been two days
since the surgery.

6
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:39,679
‐[Yu] Two days?
‐[Shichino] That’s right.

7
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,280
[Yu] Why can't I move?

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,550
[Shichino] Like I know.
Ask the doctor.

00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:47,687
[theme song plays]

00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:54,060
[woman singing in Japanese]

11
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:22,081
Hey, are you feeling
any better?

12
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:23,382
[Yu] Medoki?

13
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:25,251
[Medoki] I'm glad.
Just like we planned.

14
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:27,220
We were able
to prevent a collapse.

15
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,023
[Shichino]
We didn't plan anything.
We're just dealing with it.

16
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:33,827
[Medoki] If that was the case,
you would have done more
than just give him a shot.

17
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:35,394
[Shichino] I'm not a doctor.

18
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,230
[Yu] Um, what happened to me?

19
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,499
How did I end up here
like this?

20
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:42,769
[gasp] Tomori.

21
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,237
Is Tomori all right?

22
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:45,839
[Maedomari] She's fine.

23
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,507
She's also here
in this hospital.

24
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:49,843
Yeah, thanks to Kumagami.

25
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:51,244
[Yu] I see.

26
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:55,248
I'm glad.
And how is he doing?

27
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,953
Huh? It can't be.

28
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:02,488
‐[Medoki] Yes.
‐[gasp]

29
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:05,659
It wouldn't have happened if you
weren't so damn busy trying
to save your own ass.

30
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:09,529
You have no room to complain.
You were the one who said
we should bet everything

31
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:14,701
‐on his ability to time‐leap,
did you forget that?
‐No way... Kumagami is...

32
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:18,605
Those guys must have decided
that they didn't need
your time leap

33
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:19,806
to get what they wanted.

34
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,474
Collapse was the biggest threat
to them

35
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:24,477
so they tried to use
hostages as shields.

36
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,913
Both sides miscalculated.

37
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:28,615
It's all my fault.

38
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:30,950
You shouldn't blame yourself.

39
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,387
‐[Yu] Hey.
‐[Medoki] Hmm?

40
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:37,223
[Yu] Are we gonna have to deal
with this stuff all the time?

41
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:39,458
[Medoki] Not from those two,
at least.

42
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,229
We erased their memories using
Maedomari's ability.

43
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:47,200
But there's no telling when you
might be targeted next.

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,736
All in all, I'm just glad
you woke up.

45
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:51,871
We’ve been taking turns
watching you.

46
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:54,574
Hey, uh, it's time now.

47
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:56,209
Right.

48
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,012
‐Hold on.
I have one more question.
‐What is it?

49
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:01,648
Why isn't my brother here?

50
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:04,551
‐Really? Are you that stupid?!
‐No, you need to calm down.

51
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:06,452
‐What does he mean?
‐[Shichino] Let go!

52
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:09,222
He means that,
for your big brother,

53
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:12,358
Kumagami was his best friend
in the world.

54
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:21,000
[wind whistles]

55
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:26,773
‐[knock on door]
‐Yes, come in.

56
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:30,009
‐Hey, Big Brother.
‐[Yu] Oh, Ayumi.

57
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,711
It's been a while.

58
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,813
Are you sure it's OK to talk?

59
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:35,682
Yeah.
As long as I stay still.

60
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:38,251
They said you'll never see
from your right eye again.

61
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:42,021
Apparently, it was such
a big accident,
I shouldn’t be alive.

62
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:45,324
I'd rather lose one eye
than my life.

63
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:47,493
‐[Ayumi] But...
‐With proper rehabilitation,

64
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:51,130
they said I could live a life
that's almost the same
as before.

65
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,232
It would be nice
if that's the case.

66
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:55,168
How are things at the facility?

67
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:58,505
Everyone is super nice to me
so it's been really great.

68
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:02,709
But Big Brother Shun
has looked heartbroken
since the accident happened.

69
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:05,211
I'm worried about him.

70
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:07,180
[Yu thinking] <i>Big brother.</i>

71
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,518
<i>Losing Ayumi was the most</i>
<i>painful thing that's</i>
<i>happened to me.</i>

72
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:16,089
<i>For Shunsuke, Kumagami was</i>
<i>someone just as special.</i>

73
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,258
<i>And if I had died</i>
<i>because of the collapse,</i>

74
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:21,961
<i>what would Ayumi</i>
<i>have gone through?</i>

75
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,667
‐[knock on door]
‐Yes, come in.

76
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,603
Hey there, it's been a while.

77
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:33,406
[Yu] Takajo, it really does feel
like it's been a while.

78
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:36,610
You look like you're in
a lot more pain
than I had imagined.

79
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,545
Yeah. What a sight, huh?

80
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,213
And I come bearing gifts.

81
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:42,982
I think this will make you
perk right up.

82
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:45,118
What is all this?

83
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:47,754
A lunch box with insulation!

84
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,623
And the contents are...

85
00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:55,461
[drumroll plays]

86
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:58,131
The smell. I know it.

87
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,699
‐[fanfare plays]
‐[Takajo] That's right!

88
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,168
‐[Takajo] The cafeteria's
beef tongue curry!

89
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,071
Whoa! I never thought I'd
have it in this place.

90
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:07,741
‐I can even help you eat it.
‐Please do.

91
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:10,376
‐[Takajo] Say ahh!
‐[Yu] Ahh!

92
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:16,783
So good! This reminds me
of the days back in school.

93
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,619
Yes, this is truly the taste
of our adolescence.

94
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:22,255
‐Another bite, please! Ahh!
‐There's still plenty left,

95
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:24,924
so just eat until
you get bored of it.

96
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,467
By the way,
how is Tomori doing?

97
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:36,770
Her injuries are a lot less
severe than yours,

98
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,173
‐so they'll probably
let her out soon.
‐That's good to hear.

99
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:44,110
[Takajo] You've had
a lot of hardships lately.

100
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,512
No kidding.

101
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:47,246
We're looking forward
to you guys

102
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:49,583
coming back to the council
once you’ve healed up.

103
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,686
Granted, I love holding down
the fort with Yusarin,

104
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:55,221
but it's just not the same.

105
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:59,058
‐[knock on door]
‐[Yu] Yes? Come in.

106
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:00,727
I came to visit!

107
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:02,796
Uh... aah!

108
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,898
Hey, Kurobane.
What’s up?

109
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:08,434
Not much. I made this for you
if you're interested.

110
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:11,037
Ah, would that be cream stew,
by any chance?

111
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:13,940
That's amazing, you got it!

112
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:17,511
Yusarin's handmade
cream stew!

113
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:20,146
This recipe is cherished
in the Kurobane household

114
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:21,748
as a tasty source
of strength.

115
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:25,585
It even works wonders
on illnesses and injuries.

116
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:27,320
[Yu] <i>I see.</i>

117
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,590
<i>So that's the reason</i>
<i>she brought me cream stew</i>
<i>that day.</i>

118
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,825
Thanks a lot.

119
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:35,461
Yep. Now then, open wide.

120
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,763
Uh... ahh!

121
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:38,665
Ahh... up!

122
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,868
Well? What do you think?

123
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:45,204
Mmm. Great. I feel a bit more
energetic already.

124
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:47,741
Ahh? I'm so glad.

125
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:51,110
[Yu] <i>Takajo can never know</i>
<i>this happened.</i>

126
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:56,616
[Yu] Misa, you there?

127
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:57,851
Hmm? Huh?

128
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:00,053
[whoosh!]

129
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:02,255
[Misa] Calling on the dead now?

130
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:05,559
Yeah. Where do people go
when they die?

131
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:09,495
Who knows?
I never left this place.

132
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:12,699
I'm like a candle that Yusa
is holding onto.

133
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,568
When her ability fades away,

134
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,836
my flame gets
snuffed out with it,

135
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:19,305
just like a candle in the wind.

136
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:21,808
I see. In that case,

137
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:25,078
shouldn't you use
all the time you have
to visit your loved ones?

138
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:27,881
Huh? What's all this about?

139
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:30,817
I almost died the other day
and it made me think.

140
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:33,787
You could be gone at any point
in time, you know.

141
00:08:33,787 --> 00:08:36,623
You should visit your friends
while you still can.

142
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:38,091
I hear ya.

143
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:39,926
I know I got one more chance,

144
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:42,361
but that doesn't make it
any easier.

145
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:46,165
You know, I used
to eat that a lot.

146
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:48,735
It used to be
our mom's best dish.

147
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:52,238
But Yusa copied her and made it
all the freakin' time.

148
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:54,373
[Yu] <i>Just like our family.</i>

149
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:57,176
Unlike Yusa, I made
our parents miserable,

150
00:08:57,176 --> 00:09:01,080
though you could say dying
was the worst way
to be a bad daughter.

151
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,118
[Yu] Then you should go
see them again, before
the ability is gone.

152
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:10,089
Yeah. Well, I'll take that
suggestion into consideration.

153
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:11,591
[whoosh!]

154
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:15,028
‐[Yusa] Was I asleep again?!
‐No, you're all right.

155
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:19,198
If you don't mind me asking,
Yusa, what do your parents
do for a living?

156
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:21,434
Oh, yes, they make soba noodles

157
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:23,670
deep in the mountains of Nagano
and serve them.

158
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,707
I see. Then I suggest you go
visit them sometime soon.

159
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:31,545
‐Huh?
‐[Yu] No, you don't have
any time left, go now!

160
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:35,248
S‐Sure. I'll talk it out
with my manager right away.

161
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:45,191
[Yu] <i>This is really gonna take</i>
<i>some getting used to.</i>

162
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:56,202
<i>Fairly close to Last Supper,</i>
<i>"Fair Supper" for short.</i>

163
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:58,371
<i>This is a show</i>
<i>where celebrities...</i>

164
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:01,107
She made regular appearances
on a show like this?

165
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:04,343
[Yusa] <i>... wouldn't be their</i>
<i>last supper but is a supper</i>
<i>fairly close to it.</i>

166
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:07,313
<i>On today's show,</i>
<i>I'll be introducing you</i>

167
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:09,883
<i>to the Fair Supper from me,</i>
<i>Yusarin!</i>

168
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:11,651
<i>It's just over this hill.</i>

169
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:13,620
[announcer] <i>Actually,</i>
<i>this is a soba restaurant...</i>

170
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,823
[Yu] <i>She used her work to go see</i>
<i>her parents, huh?</i>

171
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,491
<i>Nice Yusa.</i>

172
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,426
[announcer] <i>... and she seems</i>
<i>very happy about it.</i>

173
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:22,596
[Yusa, giggling] Hi!

174
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:26,600
[Yusa] This is the handmade soba
and wild greens
tempura set‐meal.

175
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,636
First, I'll have some
of the tasty soba.

176
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:33,472
I'll take the dipping sauce
and dunk it.

177
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:36,810
Mmm‐mm.

178
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,545
So good!

179
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:41,681
Next up, I'll have
some mugwort tempura.

180
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:44,450
<i>Mmm, mmm, mmm!</i>

181
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,453
This is really tasty too!
[giggles]

182
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:49,155
[Yu] <i>With such</i>
<i>a lack of vocabulary,</i>

183
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:52,158
<i>I'm surprised they chose you</i>
<i>to be the host of a food show.</i>

184
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:55,328
[Misa] <i>Honestly,</i>
<i>there's nothing special</i>
<i>about the taste.</i>

185
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:59,599
<i>It's so plain, in fact,</i>
<i>you could get the same</i>
<i>from a store.</i>

186
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:03,870
Misa! What the heck
are you doing?

187
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,007
But the love of my parents
is the secret ingredient

188
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:10,376
that makes this so exquisite.

189
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:16,449
That's why I love this dish.

190
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:19,686
Nothing can ever replace it.

191
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,725
Thanks for the awesome meal.

192
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,563
[mother] You reminded me
of Misa just now.

193
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,230
‐[mother] I'm sorry.
‐[father] Yeah.

194
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,701
<i>She was a delinquent with</i>
<i>a bad mouth and attitude,</i>

195
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:36,402
<i>but she was good deep down.</i>

196
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,573
That was a great way
to repay them.

197
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,347
‐[knock on door]
‐Uh, yes? Come in.

198
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:50,116
Good morning, brother!

199
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:52,586
Oh, hey, good morning.

200
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,420
Ta‐da!

201
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,191
Happy birthday
to the best brother ever!

202
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:01,661
‐Huh?
‐Today is your 16th birthday!

203
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,163
Congrats on another trip
around the sun!

204
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:05,565
No kidding, it is?

205
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:08,301
I would never forget
such an important day.

206
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:12,438
So I made sure to pull out
all the stops.

207
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:17,744
[lighthearted music plays]

208
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:21,147
Uh... what's wrong?
Don’t you want to eat it?

209
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:22,481
[Yu] Yeah, of course.

210
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:25,552
Yeah! Then open wide
for the airplane.

211
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,386
I can eat it by myself.

212
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:31,658
That's silly. You're recovering,
so take it easy.

213
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:35,194
Ahhh!

214
00:12:35,194 --> 00:12:38,097
Ahhh!

215
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:42,001
[Yu] <i>Huh?</i>
<i>It's sweet but it's good.</i>

216
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,603
[Ayumi] Here.

217
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:45,972
[Yu]
<i>It's the same flavor.</i>

218
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,844
<i>Maybe it's that ingredient</i>
<i>Misa was talking about.</i>

219
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:52,245
So, do you like it?

220
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:54,681
‐It's great.
‐I'm so happy!

221
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:56,950
‐[Ayumi] Now next. Next, next!
‐[Yu] Tasty.

222
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,352
[Yu] <i>Guess my vocab's limited,</i>
<i>too.</i>

223
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:01,788
<i>I probably shouldn't</i>
<i>criticize Yusa.</i>

224
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:07,694
[clapping]

225
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:12,365
‐Grats on getting all better.
‐I'm coming along, anyway.

226
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:14,901
There's a favor I'd like
to ask of you.

227
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,041
[Yu] Hey, bro.

228
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,010
I heard you'd been
up here all along.

229
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:28,014
Could you please say something?

230
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:29,949
[Shunsake] This hospital's
all right.

231
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:32,385
You won't have to deal
with the police here.

232
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:34,487
[Yu] More than that.
I...

233
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,524
[Yu] <i>He's just like</i>
<i>how I was back then.</i>

234
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:40,694
The terrorists are acting up
overseas.

235
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,129
Japan will become involved
shortly.

236
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:46,866
‐[Yu] Huh?
‐[Shunsake] And Kumagami is
no longer here either.

237
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:50,737
I wonder, what will happen
to all of us?

238
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:03,482
It's been a while.

239
00:14:03,482 --> 00:14:05,752
Uh‐huh. Uh, Tomori!

240
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:08,655
Oh, gee,
it's nice to see you, too.

241
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:11,558
W‐Well, I was just surprised.

242
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:14,060
The hospital discharged me
a little while ago.

243
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,495
So I thought I'd come
and have a chat with you.

244
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:19,633
Have you heard anything
from your big brother yet?

245
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,500
[Yu] He said Japan will soon
be involved

246
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,170
in the activates
of overseas terrorists.

247
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,672
[Tomori] Interesting.

248
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:28,608
My brother's had all the life
knocked out of him.

249
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,109
He's so different.

250
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:34,648
Dangerous people may keep coming
after me in the future.

251
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:36,616
I don't want to lose anyone

252
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:38,518
or make them miserable
ever again.

253
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:40,654
If there's something I could do
with my powers,

254
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:43,823
I'd like to do it,
but I don't know how.

255
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:48,361
Tomori, what am I
supposed to do?

256
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:58,337
[Tomori] There's only one thing
I can think of.

257
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:00,640
All right, what is it?
Please, tell me.

258
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,743
Your big brother's
research facility.

259
00:15:03,743 --> 00:15:05,845
The scientists there
have already completed

260
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:08,948
the anti‐ability vaccine
in preparation for Charlotte.

261
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:10,149
Yeah?

262
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:13,520
So then, everything ends
if you can plunder

263
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,221
all of the abilities
that exist,

264
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:16,590
as well as any new ones

265
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,592
that might happen to sprout up
in the meantime.

266
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:21,127
Of course there are risks.

267
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:23,129
What will happen to you
after gaining

268
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:25,599
thousands upon thousands
of abilities?

269
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,366
[Yu] What will happen?

270
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:28,968
[Tomori] You might turn
into a monster

271
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:31,905
that can potentially annihilate
the human race.

272
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:36,743
Even then, will you be able
to hold on to your sanity?

273
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:39,045
It definitely won't be easy.

274
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:41,948
But it's something
only you can do.

275
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:44,518
That is the only method
I can think of

276
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:47,053
that can save all
of the ability wielders.

277
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:53,960
To be honest, I wasn't planning
on having this talk with you.

278
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,430
But... you came back here
from the future

279
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,032
in order to save Ayumi.

280
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:02,702
Then you came to rescue me
and Kumagami too.

281
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:05,705
At first, I thought you were
just a filthy cheater,

282
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:07,941
but I can believe
in the person you've become.

283
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:10,243
That's a drastic change
of opinion.

284
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:14,413
Well, this is way too
reckless for it to be
one of my tactics.

285
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:17,784
Forget I mentioned it.

286
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:21,020
Now, you should probably
be getting some rest.

287
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,622
Later.

288
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,927
‐[Yu] Hold on.
‐Hmm?

289
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:29,262
I'll try it.

290
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:31,097
[Tomori] No way, it's reckless.

291
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:33,466
I'm serious.
Besides, I kind of owe you one.

292
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:36,803
And if you think it's
the only way, that's all I need.

293
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:38,772
Your motive is a bit weak.

294
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:41,641
But what happened to us could
very well happen again.

295
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:45,712
This time I'll be
the one that saves you.

296
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:48,247
‐I promise.
‐Why is that?

297
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,416
Because I love you.

298
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:54,654
Huh? What are you talking about?
You mean like romance?

299
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:56,289
Yeah, romance.

300
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:58,357
You say that
with such a straight face.

301
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:02,128
I don't think there was ever
a time that you thought
favorably of me.

302
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:05,131
I've said this before,
but in a different world

303
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:08,134
I threw myself into despair,
and you were there

304
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:10,069
the whole time
watching over me.

305
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,071
[Tomori] This is just
a wild guess,

306
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:15,408
but wasn't that my way
of taking responsibility
for Ayumi's death?

307
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:17,911
Yes, but you still
saved me.

308
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:21,280
So, how do you stumble
from that

309
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,882
into a full‐blown romance?

310
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:24,784
It doesn't make
any sense at all.

311
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:27,020
Right, like you need reasoning
to fall in love.

312
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,456
You're the one who's using it
as a reason, you big moron!

313
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,258
[both growling]

314
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:35,294
[Tomori] See? Our compatibility
is absolutely the worst.

315
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:36,730
[Yu] But I still love you.

316
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,332
You’re so strange,
you know that?

317
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:42,869
‐Say whatever you like.
‐[sigh]

318
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:47,306
OK, fine, I'll say it.
I'll be waiting, here.

319
00:17:47,306 --> 00:17:49,042
Huh? For what?

320
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,977
For when you've saved
the ability wielders

321
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,379
and finally come back
to me.

322
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:57,216
Once you've pulled that off,
the two of us can become lovers.

323
00:17:57,216 --> 00:18:00,754
Aren't you overestimating
my abilities?

324
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:02,622
Think of it as incentive.

325
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,157
If you really manage
to do this,

326
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:06,626
I've no doubt you will be
irresistibly dear to me,

327
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:08,194
after such a big feat.

328
00:18:08,194 --> 00:18:10,564
[Yu] That sounds
like a challenge.

329
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:12,932
So, has that increased
your motivation?

330
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:14,400
[Yu] Yeah, bigtime.

331
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,235
Then promise me.

332
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:18,004
Swear you'll come back.

333
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:21,608
We will meet again.
I know it.

334
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:22,942
Yeah.

335
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:25,278
I'll make sure to come back.

336
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:28,615
If you lie, you'll cut off
the tip of your finger.

337
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:30,617
Pinkie promise!

338
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:33,086
That's a scary promise.

339
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:35,421
So that you'll keep
your motivation up.

340
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:36,723
Sure.

341
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:39,325
Good. Then start with me.

342
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:43,730
You're going to plunder
every single ability, remember?

343
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,966
I see. This is what
the mission entails.

344
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:48,668
Hadn't thought of that.

345
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:51,337
‐Yep, go ahead.
‐[Yu] I'm sorry.

346
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,873
There's really no need
to apologize.

347
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:56,776
I'll finally be
a regular human again.

348
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:11,925
Thank you very much.

349
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,765
[Yu] Big brother,
I have a plan.

350
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:22,335
I'm going to go plunder
the abilities of every
wielder in the world

351
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:24,170
and save them.

352
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,005
[Shunsake] That's impossible.
Don’t bother.

353
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:27,741
Out of all
the ability wielders,

354
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,242
I'm the strongest,
aren't I?

355
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:31,911
I don't want Kumagami's
sacrifice to have been a waste!

356
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,447
You're not the only one
who feels that way!

357
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:36,449
Damn it. Damn it!

358
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:40,186
He saved me so many ways
just by being at my side.

359
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:43,823
But I didn’t even get to say
thanks to him in the end.

360
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:46,660
[Yu] That's why I'm going.

361
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,997
So that no one
who's important to me
will ever suffer again.

362
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:52,766
Don't you feel that way, too,

363
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:55,635
especially after losing
Kumagami?

364
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:58,337
Are you serious about this?

365
00:19:58,337 --> 00:20:02,375
Sure am. I've already taken
Tomori's ability.

366
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,677
Taken...?

367
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:05,712
The wheels are already
in motion.

368
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:08,147
and I'm not turning back.

369
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:10,216
[Shichino]
That's some determination.

370
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:13,753
But how are you going to search
for ability wielders?

371
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:16,389
Someone close
to the syndicate's leader

372
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,425
must have an ability similar
to what Kumagami had.

373
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,561
They couldn't gather
that many ability wielders

374
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:24,163
in such a short time otherwise.

375
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:28,535
Yu, fly overseas.
Leave Japan to the rest of us.

376
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:30,103
We lost Kumagami.

377
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,739
But we're still a powerful
syndicate in our own right.

378
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:35,709
We'll hold them down until
their abilities are gone.

379
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,243
If we can't do that much,

380
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:40,279
we couldn't possibly look him
in the eye again.

381
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,982
Yu, you just turned 16,
isn't that right?

382
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:45,451
‐[Yu] Yeah.
‐You don't have much time left.

383
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:48,121
You'll have to do all this
in record time.

384
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,856
Right.

385
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,394
[Takajo] Otosaka.

386
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:57,096
[Yu] Oh, hey, guys.

387
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:59,398
I heard the whole story
from Tomori.

388
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:01,601
[Misa] We want you to take
our powers too.

389
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:04,571
If it helps you even
just a little bit,
it'll be worth it.

390
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,105
Take Yusa's too.

391
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:08,975
Misa, you know
what that means for you?

392
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,977
Yeah, I'm cool with it.

393
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:13,980
This is as good a spot
as any for me to fade.

394
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:18,552
Come on, dude.
Don’t make this harder
than it has to be.

395
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:21,420
[Takajo] That's right, Otosaka.
Go ahead.

396
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:26,993
All right then.
If you're absolutely
sure about this.

397
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:30,096
Yeah. See ya.

398
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:34,000
Right.

399
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,234
[energy pulses]

400
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,637
[Yusa, gasping] What the...?

401
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,873
Sorry, did I doze off again?

402
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:44,343
Yusa, your big sister entrusted
me with this letter to you.

403
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:46,145
[opening letter]

404
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:49,649
"Yusa, I've had
a blast lately.

405
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:53,119
It was fun hanging out
with those guys
from the student council.

406
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,322
I felt that I wanted to be
with you forever.

407
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:59,726
[Misa] <i>But the one thing that</i>
<i>was hardest for me, Yusa,</i>

408
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:02,128
<i>was that I was always</i>
<i>right there with you,</i>

409
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:04,864
<i>yet we never really saw</i>
<i>each other.</i>

410
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:07,133
<i>I love you more than anything.</i>

411
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:10,604
<i>And now I'll be a good</i>
<i>dead person and fade out.</i>

412
00:22:10,604 --> 00:22:12,572
<i>Goodbye for now.</i>

413
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:14,641
<i>From Misa."</i>

414
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:17,844
[Yusa, sobbing] My big sister
was always together

415
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:20,213
with all of you,
wasn't she?

416
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,083
‐Yeah. We had
a lot of fun together.
‐Indeed.

417
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:28,221
In that case, I'm glad.

418
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:32,058
‐Otosaka, don't keep us waiting
too long, OK?
‐Yeah.

419
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:35,428
After all,
we're high‐school buddies
who suffered together.

420
00:22:35,428 --> 00:22:38,331
We're friends for life.
We'll be waiting here for you.

421
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:40,934
So get back to us
as soon as you can.

422
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:44,303
‐[Yu] Right.
‐[Yusa] Yep.

423
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:53,279
[woman singing in Japanese]

424
00:22:58,117 --> 00:23:01,721
About frickin' time.
Take this, I insist.

425
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:05,324
It isn't much, but it's
all I can do for now.

426
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:07,093
What is it?

427
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:15,001
While you're there,
it should help you get by,
if only a little bit.

428
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:17,136
[Yu] You made this
in one night?

429
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:19,839
I know what your standardized
test scores are like.

430
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,443
Yeah. After all, I'm just
a filthy cheater, aren't I?

431
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:28,515
Fine. In return, I want you
to hold onto this for me.

432
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:30,984
Sure, I understand.

433
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:33,219
It'll be here
when you get back.

434
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,560
[Yu] <i>I'm uneasy.</i>
<i>It's all so uncertain.</i>

435
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,261
<i>But I have to do this,</i>

436
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:45,131
<i>because I am</i>
<i>the only one that can.</i>

437
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:47,767
Well, it's time to go.

438
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:51,270
Right, have a safe trip, 'K?
