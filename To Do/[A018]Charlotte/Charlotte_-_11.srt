1
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:13,071
Hey, Yu, Ayumi.
It's been a while.

2
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:16,408
[phone ringing]

3
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:18,777
What is it?

4
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:25,884
‐Um... Who are you again?
‐He's our big brother.

5
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:28,521
I had to erase
the memories you had of me.

6
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,623
I didn't want to,
but it was necessary.

7
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:33,692
Necessary?
I don't understand.

8
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:36,028
Well, there was
a lot going on.

9
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:38,130
Seems like it, big bro.

10
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:41,233
Uh... huh?

11
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:45,437
Yu, it seems that
you're finally fully aware

12
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:47,239
of the true ability
that you wield.

13
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,042
That's why I had you
come here together.

14
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:52,878
I would have ended up here
whether you brought us or not.

15
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,581
‐Convenient.
‐What do you mean by that?

16
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:57,355
It's a long story.

17
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:02,287
[Shunsake]
So you used my time leap.

18
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:04,222
Well, that was
a job well done.

19
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:05,791
[Yu] What's gonna happen now?

20
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,860
Can you maybe come home
and live with us?

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,762
More like the reverse.

22
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:11,797
You can plunder
any ability that you want.

23
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:14,533
You were the strongest
of all ability wielders.

24
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,835
You even have the power
of time leap.

25
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,271
That makes you a liability.

26
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:21,006
What are you trying to say?

27
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:24,610
There are syndicates around that
would try to use your powers.

28
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,646
I can't let you live
in the open anymore.

29
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:30,448
You'll have to remain here
until your powers fade.

30
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:32,651
‐For real?
‐[Shunsake] Yeah.

31
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:34,286
[Shunsake] You may already know,

32
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:36,622
but we created this research
facility as a safehouse

33
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:38,123
for ability wielders.

34
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:41,794
In other words, this is the best
place that you could be.

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,264
Come with me.

36
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,918
Hmm? Look who it is.
So nice of you to drop by.

37
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,453
Grandpa here
is head of the research team.

38
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:11,890
‐Dr. Tsutsumiuchi.
‐[Yu] I know.

39
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,727
[Yu] He's the one
that saved me back then.

40
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:16,261
And this?

41
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,496
A research facility that
is creating a vaccine

42
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,734
to prevent future outbreaks
of special abilities.

43
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:24,236
Vaccine?
You mean we're all sick?

44
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:28,140
Yes. The special abilities
are a disease.

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,777
So before particles are spread
all over Earth again,

46
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,680
we need to vaccinate
every person in the world.

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,048
[Yu] Particles?

48
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:38,717
Have you ever heard
of a long‐orbit comet

49
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:40,285
by the name of Charlotte?

50
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,521
Yes! I know about it, sir.

51
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:46,091
Oh, you must really like
the stars a lot, young lady.

52
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:50,028
‐That's right. Stargazing
is my favorite hobby.
‐Mm‐hmm.

53
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:54,900
Charlotte's long orbit
brings it by Earth
every 75 years.

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,670
And when it does,
an unknown particle

55
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,905
is showered
onto our planet's surface.

56
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:03,375
Those who inhale the particles
generate special powers

57
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,211
during the times
when they are most sensitive.

58
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:09,447
The particles make their way
into the cerebral nerves,

59
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:13,251
then dig up and awaken
a sector that is
supposed to stay dormant.

60
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:16,388
And that is the reason
we have powers?

61
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,857
[Dr. Tsutsumiuchi] For instance,
400 years ago,

62
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:20,826
we had
an extremely close encounter

63
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,861
and many particles came down.

64
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:25,698
In Europe, some of those
that inhaled the particles

65
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:28,266
became witches
with special powers.

66
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,604
The people
who feared the abilities
conducted a witch hunt

67
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:36,208
and tens of thousands
of ability wielders
were mercilessly slaughtered.

68
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:40,746
Roughly 12 years ago,
that comet barely grazed
our atmosphere again.

69
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:45,150
Soon, one after another,
young people began to wield
special abilities.

70
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,586
Yu, he's talking
about us, you know.

71
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,354
[Ayumi] Hmm?

72
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,823
We're developing a vaccine

73
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:53,391
so that this doesn't happen
again in the future.

74
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:56,028
Its production has already begun
in Japan.

75
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,230
Sounds like there's
nothing to worry about, then.

76
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,199
No. Japan may be safe,
but that doesn't mean

77
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,168
it's the same
everywhere else in the world.

78
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,571
Witch hunts are still happening
all over.

79
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:06,905
It never ends.

80
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:09,374
[Yu] But that has
nothing to do with us.

81
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,844
You can't just dismiss
what's going on, Yu.

82
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:15,581
The ability wielders overseas
have banded up.

83
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:19,585
There's always the possibility
that they'll become terrorists
and interfere in world affairs.

84
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,286
Use the vaccine!

85
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:23,488
[Shunsake]
We can curb the number
of infected that way,

86
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:26,592
but it doesn't do anything
for the people who already
developed abilities.

87
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:29,461
Then just make a wonder drug
to counter it or something.

88
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:30,763
Disappointing.

89
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:32,264
It would seem
your sharp intellect

90
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:35,834
doesn't exactly run
in the family, Otosaka.

91
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:39,638
Unfortunately, it takes
a very long time
to create a new drug.

92
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:42,941
We don't know what's gonna
happen to us from here on out.

93
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:47,212
But I promise to protect you
both the best I can.

94
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:51,249
All right then,
but at the very least,

95
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,952
I'd like Ayumi to regain
her memories about you.

96
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:56,054
‐Impossible.
‐Why is that?

97
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:58,256
I got all mine back, didn't I?

98
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,093
We don't know why you were
the only one that regained
memories.

99
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,897
Was there a large factor
somewhere that caused it
or was it just coincidence?

100
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:08,000
In either case,
it's impossible for now.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,071
Damn it, that's just
so sad for Ayumi.

102
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:17,342
Starting today, we can make
all new memories as siblings.

103
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:18,811
Hi, Ayumi.

104
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:21,647
I'm your oldest brother,
Shunsuke.

105
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:23,516
It's very nice to meet you.

106
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:25,283
[Ayumi] Hmm.

107
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,621
OK. Can I call you "Shun"
for short, Big Brother?

108
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,488
‐Yeah.
‐Jeez, that was quick!

109
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:32,390
[Ayumi giggles]

110
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,928
[Shunsake] You won't be able
to see your school friends
for a while,

111
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,963
but these guys will be
your new friends.

112
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,832
They're also
ability wielders.

113
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:43,268
Ayumi Otosaka.
It's super nice to meet you.

114
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:46,071
‐It's nice to meet you too.
‐You're so sweet.

115
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:48,974
Shichino, why don't you walk
through a wall for starters?

116
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,977
Sure thing.
Try not to wet yourself.

117
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,382
Wow! That's incredible.

118
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,685
The recreation room here
is pretty substantial.

119
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,354
I think you'll find plenty
of fun things to do.

120
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:05,390
What about music?
Can I listen to How‐Low‐Hello
if I want?

121
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,926
‐Sure can.
‐[Ayumi] All right!

122
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:10,796
[Shunsake] I'll be
teaching you academics.

123
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:13,532
‐[Ayumi] OK.
‐[Medoki] You're adorable.

124
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:15,901
[Ayumi] Thank you very much.

125
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:19,772
[Yu thinking] <i>I feel like</i>
<i>everyone is keeping</i>
<i>their distance from me.</i>

126
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:22,074
[gasping]

127
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:25,310
Huh?
Is everyone gone already?

128
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,880
[Shunsake] They call this one
the Bunei Invasion

129
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,815
and the second one
the Koan Invasion.

130
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:31,083
[Ayumi] Those are funny names.

131
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,151
[Shunsake] In the literature...

132
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:36,021
[Medoki] Got a sister complex?

133
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,056
No, not really.

134
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:39,758
You look so fussy.

135
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:42,995
‐Big Brother took Ayu
away from you.
‐Wow, Big Brother.

136
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:45,230
Not true. I'm just bored.

137
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,866
Then you wouldn't mind
hanging out with me.

138
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,536
I want you to play
for me, OK?

139
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,437
Play?

140
00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:03,348
All right, I got a good hand.

141
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:04,883
Reach!

142
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,284
[Kumagami] Ron.

143
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:09,555
Double‐value tiles
and little three dragons.

144
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,824
All told, I have 36,000 points.

145
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:13,191
‐[Yu shrieks]
‐Crazy.

146
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,861
I've never seen someone
bomb out in round one.

147
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:17,495
You really suck at this game.

148
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,965
Are you sure you're Shunsake's
little brother?

149
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,900
Damn it, let me play one more!

150
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,503
No. I just found
another one.

151
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:26,839
As usual,
it's rather sudden.

152
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,809
Well, my power doesn't let me
choose when to find them.

153
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:32,410
It's always quite random.

154
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,048
Believe me, I wish I could use
my ability proactively.

155
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:37,850
It would make things
so much simpler.

156
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,018
So, what did you find
exactly?

157
00:07:40,018 --> 00:07:43,221
[Kumagami] An ability wielder.
What else?

158
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,959
[Yu] <i>So he didn't have to be</i>
<i>drenched in water!</i>

159
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,061
You're going
to the student council?

160
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:51,329
‐That's right.
‐Mind if I tag along this time?

161
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:52,898
Are you really that stupid?

162
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:55,834
Out of everyone here, you're
in the most danger by far.

163
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,235
You can't just leave.

164
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,638
Oh, right, I forgot about that.

165
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:02,340
[Yu] <i>I wonder</i>
<i>how Tomori's doing.</i>

166
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,944
<i>Wait, why am I thinking</i>
<i>about her?</i>

167
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:16,488
[Kumagami] Please head over
to Hoshinoumi Academy.

168
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:19,592
What's wrong?
Is something the matter?

169
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:22,094
[driver] No, I'm fine.

170
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:33,238
Huh? Hey, we were
supposed to take that turn.

171
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:34,907
Furuki.

172
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:36,575
[Furuki] I'm sorry, Kumagami.

173
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:38,877
I have to take you
to a different location.

174
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:40,913
I don't have a choice.

175
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:43,048
My family...

176
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:45,984
They've taken
my family hostage.

177
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,554
You didn't say you had
a family.

178
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:51,957
If you guys had found out,
I would have had to leave
the syndicate.

179
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:53,726
That is the rule, yes.

180
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:55,728
I prided myself on helping you.

181
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:58,831
It was my greatest honor
and purpose in life.

182
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,966
Please forgive me.

183
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:06,672
[Kumagami] Sheesh. Guess it's
gonna be one of those days.

184
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,846
[Furuki] Over here. Follow me.

185
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,413
[Kumagami] Sure.

186
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,786
[Furuki] Hey, I brought him!

187
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:23,021
[Kumagami] <i>Here goes.</i>

188
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:31,830
[man, Eastern European accent]
Welcome, mighty one.

189
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,701
‐You certainly took
your time getting here.
‐Some foreigners. Oh, brother.

190
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,270
He's here, OK.
Give me back my family.

191
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,273
[man] Not yet. There is one more
thing we need you to do.

192
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:43,341
We'll contact you later.
Now leave.

193
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,310
That's not what you promised!

194
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,480
If he ever again wants to see
them alive, he'll do it.

195
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,783
You want to see them again,
don't you?

196
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:53,519
This can't be.

197
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,221
‐[Furuki] I'm sorry.
‐[Kumagami] It's fine.

198
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,625
Furuki, you can just think
about your family.

199
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,527
Sorry!

200
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:05,130
It's your turn.
Make sure he lives.

201
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,187
[Kumagami] <i>Where... am I?</i>

202
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:32,758
<i>My head feels woozy.</i>

203
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:36,461
<i>Looks like they injected</i>
<i>a truth serum.</i>

204
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,764
You're obviously after
information.

205
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,800
[man] We'd like to know
about every other psychic

206
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,368
that you're hiding from us.

207
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:45,604
Hah. Do your worst.

208
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:54,513
[chuckles]

209
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,414
I won't have any left soon.

210
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:58,817
I'll make sure you pay
for my dentures.

211
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,825
[Kumagami groaning]

212
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:09,461
[screams]

213
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:22,007
I told them anything
and everything, didn't I?

214
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:24,543
[retches]

215
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,144
[coughs]

216
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:30,282
I'm sorry, Shunsuke.

217
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:54,507
Hyah!

218
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:07,185
[phone rings]

219
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,655
‐Hello?
‐[man] <i>You are the one</i>
<i>who gathered</i>

220
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:11,757
<i>all the psychics</i>
<i>in this country, correct?</i>

221
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:13,526
[Shunsake, thinking]
<i>He's a foreigner.</i>

222
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:16,061
‐So, what if I am?
‐[foreigner] <i>Kumagami told me</i>

223
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,564
<i>who the strongest psychic</i>
<i>in this country was.</i>

224
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:19,865
<i>He was very helpful.</i>

225
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,134
[Shunsake thinking]
<i>Kumagami did?</i>

226
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:24,036
<i>They must have</i>
<i>interrogated him.</i>

227
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,704
Is he still alive?

228
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,439
[foreigner]
<i>Yes, for the moment.</i>

229
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:30,208
<i>But he's missing</i>
<i>all of his nails and teeth.</i>

230
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,110
What the hell!

231
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,812
What do you want from me?

232
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:35,781
[foreigner]
<i>We want Yu Otosaka.</i>

233
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,282
That won't happen!

234
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:40,285
<i>We have kidnapped a psychic</i>
<i>by the name of Nao Tomori.</i>

235
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:43,956
<i>We would like him in return</i>
<i>for both Tomori and Kumagami.</i>

236
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:47,025
‐Where at?
<i>‐Furuki will take you there.</i>

237
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,493
Furuki?

238
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:51,163
<i>I would like Yu Otosaka</i>
<i>to come by himself.</i>

239
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:54,332
<i>I have heard all about you</i>
<i>from Furuki and Kumagami.</i>

240
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:58,804
<i>We've been planning</i>
<i>this operation for quite</i>
<i>some time now.</i>

241
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:00,806
<i>If the plans diverge,</i>
<i>we will assume</i>

242
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,941
<i>you went to the past</i>
<i>to try and change things</i>

243
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:05,644
<i>and we will kill</i>
<i>Furuki's family.</i>

244
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:06,912
[click]

245
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,584
[Shunsake] <i>They went</i>
<i>that far.</i>

246
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:17,055
Make a call.
Furuki's cell.

247
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:19,525
‐[Furuki] Otosaka.
‐Are you all right?

248
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:20,959
Did they hurt you, too?

249
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,697
[Furuki] <i>They threatened me.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

250
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:26,599
[Shunsake thinking]
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

251
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:29,568
[Shunsake] <i>How long have they</i>
<i>been threatening you?</i>

252
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:32,838
[Furuki] Since before we started
building the academy.

253
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:35,107
[Shunsake, thinking]
<i>That makes it pretty tough.</i>

254
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,577
[Furuki] <i>If I talked, they said</i>
<i>they would kill my family.</i>

255
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:40,445
I thought about suicide,

256
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,315
but I couldn't leave
my family behind.

257
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:46,418
So that's...
that's why all this happened.

258
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,420
[Shunsake] <i>It's an error</i>
<i>in my judgment.</i>

259
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,556
<i>There's no need for you</i>
<i>to torment yourself.</i>

260
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:53,158
I'll make sure
your family's safe.

261
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:55,227
[Furuki] <i>I'm really sorry.</i>

262
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:59,097
[Maedomari] So they've made it
out to Japan as well?

263
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:01,534
[Shichino] How did they get
their hands on Kumagami?

264
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:04,236
[Shunsake] They've been
threatening Furuki.

265
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:08,040
It was my mistake.
I knew he had a family
from the start,

266
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,675
but I let him join anyway.

267
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:11,777
We're dealing
with some evil people.

268
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:13,912
Then why don't we have
your little brother time‐leap

269
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:16,749
to before Furuki started getting
threatened by these jerks?

270
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:19,885
Because it began before
the academy was even built.

271
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:22,921
If he goes back to that point,
it could mess things up.

272
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:26,859
Meaning there's
a possibility our syndicate
may not even exist.

273
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:28,894
They have us backed
into a corner.

274
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:32,130
Then how about we just have
your little brother
rescue Kumagami?

275
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,601
If we do that, Furuki's family
will be sacrificed.

276
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:39,071
They're watching us closely.
They'll know if we try it.

277
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:42,007
[Medoki] How about using
an ability wielder other than
your little brother?

278
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,276
They specifically said Yu
needs to go alone.

279
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:47,746
If we screw this up,
everyone they've captured
will be killed.

280
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:50,382
There's nothing
we can do then.

281
00:14:50,382 --> 00:14:52,818
If your brother goes in alone
like they said,

282
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:54,920
‐it might be our best shot.
‐What?

283
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,155
If we're dealing
with other ability wielders,

284
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:58,657
we can plunder them.

285
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,893
Even if he screws up,
he can just use time leap

286
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:02,961
to redo everything
from this point in time.

287
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,963
That way there won't be
any irregularities,

288
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:07,733
so they won't be able to tell
that he time‐leaped.

289
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,771
We'll bet everything on him.

290
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:22,447
[Kumagami] So unbecoming.
What a sight.

291
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:27,553
[straining]

292
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,121
Tomori's captured?

293
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,890
They took out
a ton of security guards.

294
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,560
They’re obviously professionals
from overseas,

295
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,461
and I'm sure that they're armed.

296
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:38,831
You want me to take them on
by myself?

297
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:41,199
[Shunsake]
You'll be fine. I know it.

298
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,435
First, you'll need to plunder
all their abilities

299
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:45,203
and make them drop
all their weapons.

300
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:48,841
‐Can you do that?
‐Sure thing, if they don't
shoot me first.

301
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:53,445
The enemy wants you alive.
They won't do anything that
might kill you, understand?

302
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,180
Still, if you get caught,

303
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,250
or if they put Nao and Kumagami
in harm's way,

304
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,154
use your time leap quickly
and come back
to this point in time.

305
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:03,589
We'll try something else.

306
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,358
And try not to get worked up.

307
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:08,460
Your collapse power
will trigger,

308
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,863
and then your own life
will be in danger.

309
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:13,098
Yu, understand?

310
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,701
What's with all this?

311
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,435
Yu?

312
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,840
What is this?
There's no way in hell
I can do something like that!

313
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,376
I'm not some one‐man army,
all right?

314
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:28,714
I'm just a guy who cheated
his way through school
and got caught in the act!

315
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:32,117
I'm selfish and cowardly
and only think of myself!

316
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,452
All I ever wanted
was to be popular

317
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,589
and glide through life
without problems!

318
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,524
That's all I am.

319
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:40,726
What can I...?

320
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:42,595
[structure rumbling]

321
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:44,129
[Shunsake] Calm down!

322
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,900
Just focus on my heartbeat.
Concentrate, Yu.

323
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:56,241
‐Are you calm now?
‐Uh‐huh.

324
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,276
I'm sorry, I was rushing things.

325
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:02,047
If you think you're in trouble,
just time‐leap back
to this point.

326
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:04,116
That's all you need
to remember.

327
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:08,186
We still have some time.
Think it over for a bit.

328
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,729
[Tomori] <i>I gotta say,</i>
<i>you seem like you'd be popular</i>

329
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:18,163
<i>from just your good looks.</i>

330
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,098
<i>Did you really need to play</i>
<i>the genius</i>

331
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:21,800
<i>by cheating as much</i>
<i>as possible?</i>

332
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,469
[Yu] <i>We didn't</i>
<i>start off that great.</i>

333
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:26,238
Some investigation,
of course.

334
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:28,907
My dream is to film
a video for their band.

335
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:31,343
That's why I've decided
to stick with you

336
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,680
until this is through
and you're back to normal.

337
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,883
[Yu] <i>It was</i>
<i>the same thing with Ayumi.</i>

338
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:40,953
<i>You can't have something</i>
<i>once you've lost it.</i>

339
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:45,457
<i>I will rescue Tomori.</i>

340
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:47,926
‐I'm ready.
‐So you're OK with it?

341
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:49,127
Mm‐hmm.

342
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:51,463
We'll go as far as
we can with you,

343
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:52,798
so you won't be alone.

344
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,868
If something happens,
we'll rescue you.

345
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,503
[Yu] OK.

346
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:02,541
‐I'm guessing you're Furuki.
‐[Furuki] Yeah.

347
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,209
[Furuki] Get in.

348
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,118
I brought him!

349
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:18,056
[Yu] <i>Looks like it's just</i>
<i>these two out in the open.</i>

350
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,193
<i>But they're adults,</i>
<i>not ability wielders.</i>

351
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:25,197
Then, as I promised, I will
let your family go free.

352
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:27,032
Here, catch!

353
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,136
[man in suit] That's the key
to the condo.

354
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:33,706
The location is written
on the tag.

355
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,843
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:40,746
This was the only thing
I could do!

357
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,717
[Yu] <i>Let's do this.</i>

358
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,698
<i>They're not armed?</i>

359
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:01,433
Are you satisfied now?

360
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:04,136
‐Where is Tomori?
‐[man in suit] Right below us.

361
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:06,505
Both of them
are in the basement.

362
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,041
Let them go now
and I won't hurt you!

363
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,248
[screeching]

364
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,120
[screams]

365
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:27,025
I gotta time‐leap.

366
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,594
[mumbling]

367
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:29,795
Huh?

368
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,864
[man 2] It's pointless.

369
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:35,500
Even your impressive powers
won't let you travel
to the past

370
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,069
with only one healthy eye.

371
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:39,738
[Yu growls]

372
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:41,306
Use collapse if you like,

373
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,510
but your friends in the basement
won't survive it.

374
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,679
Damn it!

375
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:53,285
Hyaaaaa!

376
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:56,121
[screams]

377
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,098
‐Damn it, that wasn't necessary!
‐Hurry!

378
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:08,366
[Yu shrieking]

379
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:16,909
[Maedomari] Not good.
He's using collapse.

380
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:19,011
Why isn't he using
time leap?

381
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,580
I have no idea.
What do we do?

382
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,949
[explosions]

383
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,388
No way.

384
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:32,490
Why the hell are you
just standing there?

385
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,828
‐We have to save them!
‐[Shunsake] Y‐Yeah.

386
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:39,665
[Shunsake] How does it look?

387
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:41,266
[Maedomari] Pretty hopeless.

388
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:43,869
But we still
have to search for them.

389
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:49,007
‐Nao!
‐Kumagami! Yu!

390
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:51,143
Shunsuke, over here!

391
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:53,311
[Maedomari] Are those
the main culprits?

392
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:56,048
‐[Shunsake] Medoki, please.
‐[Medoki] Right.

393
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:01,153
I found your brother!

394
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:03,722
He blocked it
with telekinesis.

395
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,858
He's still alive.

396
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:09,027
However, they ruined one eye.

397
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:11,930
So that's why
he couldn't time‐leap.

398
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,568
‐Please, take him somewhere
safe for me.
‐[Shichino] Right.

399
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:20,105
I swear, if he ends up being OK
but the other two die
because of all this,

400
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:21,840
I'm gonna be seriously
pissed off.

401
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,977
Kumagami, Nao...
where are you?

402
00:21:24,977 --> 00:21:27,846
[Maedomari] Found them!
They're both here!

403
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:34,386
Over here!

404
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:38,891
Kumagami! Kumagami!
You there?

405
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,226
Come on, answer me. Hey!

406
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,036
Kumagami.

407
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:54,573
[Kumagami, feebly]
Is that you, Shunsuke?

408
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:58,711
I... tried my best.

409
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:01,046
Kumagami! Don’t you die!

410
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:03,816
I won't allow it.
Do you hear me?

411
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:06,151
You've gotta stay
by my side forever!

412
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:09,354
I'm afraid that might be
too tall of an order now.

413
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:13,826
Shut up! Don't talk like that.
You can't go off on your own.

414
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:15,894
You can't leave me here!

415
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:17,362
[Kumagami] Shunsuke...

416
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:24,402
guess the name "Pooh"
was just a lie after all.

417
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:31,443
Kumagami! Kumagami!

418
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:36,148
Kumagami!

419
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:39,852
[theme song plays]

420
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:55,534
