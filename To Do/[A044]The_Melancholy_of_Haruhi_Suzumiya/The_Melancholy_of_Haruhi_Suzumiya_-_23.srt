1
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,333
[HARUHI laughing]

2
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,083
[TANIGUCHI]
Huh?

3
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,583
[KYON sighs]

4
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,333
[HARUHI]
Well, here we are!

5
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,250
[KYON] Doesn't that mean
we shouldn't be going in?

6
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:50,166
Even little kids would avoid
shooting in a spot like this.

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,000
Except for the stupid ones,
that is.

8
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,500
[HARUHI]
Don't just stand there.

9
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,500
Hurry up and climb over already!

10
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,208
[KYON] Oops, forgot.
She's really stupid.

11
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,875
Come on, Mikuru. Hurry up!

12
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:00,916
[gasps]

13
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:03,250
Mm-mm...

14
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,166
[laughs]

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,625
The fence is rather high;

16
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,875
it might be too difficult
for everyone to climb over.

17
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,708
Would you have
a solution for us?

18
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:11,750
[KYON]
Hm?

19
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,958
[gasps]

20
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,583
Wow, that gate's
gotta be really old...

21
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,083
[TANIGUCHI] Am I gonna have to
play a sea monster or somethin'?

22
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,333
[TSURUYA] The lake didn't always
have this fence around it.

23
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,375
You know, people used
to fall in a lot.

24
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,875
[KYON] Thank god,
they're all so clueless.

25
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,875
[HARUHI]
There. That'll do the trick.

26
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,125
So this is the scene
where Mikuru gets cornered

27
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,500
by the baddie.

28
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,208
She can't use her beam
'cause Yuki neutralized it.

29
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,458
Well, the cue cards are done.

30
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,166
Here, hang onto this
for me, kid.

31
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,208
Huh?!

32
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,083
[HARUHI]
Mikuru, are you ready?

33
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,333
[whimpers] Yes.

34
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,375
[HARUHI]
Come on, louder!

35
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,416
Yes!

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,833
[KYON]
I feel your pain.

37
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,625
[HARUHI]
Okay! Here we go!

38
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,166
And... action!

39
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,208
[yelps]

40
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,083
[MIKURU]
E-E-Even in times like this,

41
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,750
I won't ever run away!

42
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,125
Y-You're an evil bad alien...

43
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,708
And... now, you better
leave this planet at once!

44
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,958
[HARUHI]
Cut!

45
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,375
[NAGATO] For he is very
valuable to us, you see.

46
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,708
And while we're seizing him
and his hidden powers,

47
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,666
we will also invade the Earth.

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,791
[HARUHI]
Cut!

49
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,083
I-I won't let you
get away with that!

50
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,208
I will risk my own life
to stop you!

51
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,250
[HARUHI]
Cut!

52
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,666
See? You're startin'
to get the hang of it!

53
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,875
Good job!

54
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,375
Okay, c'mere a sec.

55
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,500
I gotta talk to you
about the next shot.

56
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,333
[MIKURU]
Okay...

57
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,666
[KYON]
I hope we get out of here soon,

58
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,250
before anybody in the
neighborhood notices we're here.

59
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,375
So that's your
video camera, huh?

60
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,250
[laughs] I betcha got a lotta
goofy shots of Mikuru on there.

61
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,291
[laughing]

62
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,000
[KYON]
I don't see what's so funny.

63
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,250
There's a lot of
damaging stuff in there.

64
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,083
What if Miss Asahina stops
coming to school because of it?

65
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,333
[HARUHI]
We're back!

66
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,708
And we're gonna be
kickin' things up a notch!

67
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:05,541
Check it out!

68
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,875
Cool, huh?

69
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,416
[KYON]
Oh god, no!

70
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,708
It's gonna be a repeat of
what happened yesterday!

71
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,208
This is bad!

72
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,625
Go ahead, Mikuru.

73
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,625
I don't care what comes
outta that miracle Mikuru IR.

74
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,833
Whatever it is, make sure
it's destructive!

75
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,083
[yelps]

76
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,166
[MIKURU screams]

77
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,083
[HARUHI]
Oh, come on, Yuki!

78
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,791
You're supposed to be
an evil witch!

79
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,708
Stop whipping out
the wrestling moves!

80
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,750
Well, I guess this works, too.

81
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,708
Whatever gets more viewers.

82
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,666
Hey, Kyon!
Why aren't you rolling?

83
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,541
This is Yuki's concept!
Don't waste it!

84
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,625
[KYON]
It's not a concept.

85
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,125
This is racy stuff...

86
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,583
I shouldn't be
shooting this, but...

87
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,416
Put the target in
the center and hit record.

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,750
No, I mustn't, I mustn't.

89
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,750
[crash]

90
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,958
[GROUP]
Huh?

91
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,250
You better leave
this planet at once!

92
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,541
[HARUHI] Oh, geez! I can't
believe we lost another contact!

93
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,875
My mistake.

94
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,625
I disabled the laser function
she had access to.

95
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:10,500
However, a high-frequency
molecular cutter was activated.

96
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,625
[BOTH gasp]

97
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,291
That looks like damage
from a monofilament attack.

98
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,250
Oh, no!

99
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,541
I'm really sorry about that.

100
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,000
But, um... what did you
inject me with this time?

101
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,041
I altered the phase of
your dimensional cycles,

102
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,958
and generated a force
field around your body,

103
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,625
which alters
gravitational waves.

104
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,166
I understand.

105
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,625
For the time being, it looks
like it's been taken care of.

106
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,916
[KYON]
Yep, still don't get it.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,750
As for what happened
to the fence,

108
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,958
the others seem to think
it was old and falling apart.

109
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,166
And thankfully, it was the only
thing that got damaged.

110
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,833
Yeah, but what are we gonna do?

111
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,625
I mean, if we keep
shooting this thing,

112
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,958
I'm scared that something
really bad's gonna happen.

113
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,083
Regardless, we can't interfere
with the completion of the film.

114
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,083
Can you imagine what
Miss Suzumiya would do

115
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,583
if we tried to force her
to stop shooting it?

116
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,333
[KYON sighs]

117
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,541
I don't care.

118
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,833
I guarantee,
she wouldn't be happy at all.

119
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:10,208
A closed space would be
torn apart by the Shinjin.

120
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,291
You have to understand,

121
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,083
Miss Suzumiya's
having so much fun,

122
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,833
she just can't help herself.

123
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,083
And in a way, this is a
chance for her to play god.

124
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,916
The process of putting
the movie together

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,208
is Miss Suzumiya's way
of creating a world

126
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,416
that functions
according to her will.

127
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,416
[KYON]
Selfish as ever, I see.

128
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,791
Of course, Miss Suzumiya doesn't

129
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,750
realize any of this
is happening.

130
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,666
She thinks she's creating
a fictional world

131
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,333
for the story of her movie.

132
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,375
However, I believe
that subconsciously,

133
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,833
she's so passionate about it,
she's actually starting

134
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,083
to change the reality
of this world.

135
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,791
[KYON]
Fiction, he says.

136
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,250
Either way you slice it,
we get a bad ending.

137
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,666
If we have to choose between

138
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,666
stopping the shoot or
seeing it through to the end,

139
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,666
I would strongly recommend
we finish it.

140
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,375
Even if Miss Asahina turns
into some kind of super woman?

141
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,250
Compared to having
the Shinjin appear,

142
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,125
it's a small price to pay.

143
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,291
Think about it.

144
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,583
Wouldn't it be easier
to deal with

145
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,541
abnormal phenomena
one at a time, as opposed to

146
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,208
having the world rebuilt from
scratch right under your feet?

147
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,791
[KYON s

148
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,750
If you ask me, it's all pretty
much the same thing, isn't it?

149
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,625
Here's another option
for us to consider:

150
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,041
We could knock Haruhi out cold

151
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,208
and wake her up
after the festival's over.

152
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,666
That's a frightening
thought to consider.

153
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,166
But if you're prepared to take
responsibility for the outcome,

154
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,791
I wouldn't get in your way.

155
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,875
[grunts]

156
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,458
[growls]

157
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,416
I don't think my shoulders can
handle the weight of the world.

158
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,833
[MIKURU]
Um...

159
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,708
I don't want you
to worry about me.

160
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,500
I'll be okay and find a way
to get through this.

161
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,041
[gasps]

162
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,083
[KYON]
I am in awe of her selflessness!

163
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,333
[HARUHI] These are the
characters you guys play.

164
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,333
Here's the deal,

165
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,666
since Mikuru's the hero,

166
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,916
she doesn't believe
in hurting innocent people.

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,416
Yuki takes advantage of this

168
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,125
and uses her magic to
get you guys to attack her.

169
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,750
Since Mikuru wouldn't
hurt you guys,

170
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,791
she gets beaten up!

171
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,458
[GROUP gasps]

172
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,375
Mikuru's gonna get beaten up!

173
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,916
Here's what you do!

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,500
The three of you are gonna throw
Mikuru right into the lake!

175
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,125
[BOTH gasp]

176
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,708
Wait a second,
you wanna throw her in there?

177
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,291
The water might be warm
but it's cold out!

178
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,250
Besides, that water's
pretty filthy!

179
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:21,458
B-But Miss Suzumiya,
couldn't we do this at a pool?

180
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,916
No one said this shoot
was gonna be easy.

181
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,708
So suck it up already!

182
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,708
You have to make
these kinds of sacrifices,

183
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,375
especially if they're gonna help
us get the realism we're after!

184
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,666
You can't let something
like this stand in your way!

185
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,083
You have to overcome it!

186
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,583
This is a big step up
for you as an actress!

187
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,875
See what I'm saying?

188
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,375
Good! Get ready!

189
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,541
Hang on!

190
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,625
[KOIZUMI]
Mm-mm.

191
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,708
I-I'll... Okay! I'll do it!

192
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,958
Thatta girl!

193
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,208
Yes!

194
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,250
That's why I picked you
to be a brigade member!

195
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,375
[MIKURU whimpers]

196
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,041
[KYON]
Miss Asahina...

197
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,500
One, two, three!

198
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,125
[MIKURU screams]

199
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,750
[KYON]
Heaven protect her.

200
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,666
[KOIZUMI] What's happening?
Just grab my hand. It's okay.

201
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,500
[coughs]

202
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,458
[KYON]
Good grief!

203
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,208
We've got enough crap here
to open up a pawn shop,

204
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,750
but we don't
have a towel for her?

205
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,416
What's up with that?

206
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,708
[HARUHI]
Hm...

207
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,375
This could work for the
scene where they meet.

208
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,458
You can feel the awkwardness
between Itsuki and Mikuru.

209
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,958
[KYON]
Really?

210
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,375
Looked like Koizumi was just
acting like he always does.

211
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,625
We're moving on
to the next setup!

212
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,916
It's the scene right
after Itsuki saves Mikuru,

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,500
where he picks her up and
carries her back to his house.

214
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,583
[gasps]

215
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,666
Hang on!

216
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,666
That makes absolutely
no sense at all!

217
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,291
What happened to Nagato,
Taniguchi, and the others?!

218
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,833
The audience is
gonna get totally lost

219
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,750
if they just disappear
from the story!

220
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,125
Oh, be quiet!

221
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,125
The audience is gonna be
so wrapped up in the story,

222
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,458
they'll be fine with it!

223
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,875
[KYON]
No they won't!

224
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,625
You just wanna see Miss Asahina
get tossed in the lake!

225
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,208
My house isn't
too far from here,

226
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,375
and Mikuru looks
like she's freezing.

227
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,041
Is it cool if
she changes clothes?

228
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,041
'Cause she might end up
catching a cold!

229
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,375
That's a great idea!

230
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,625
Can we use your house
for our next location?

231
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,125
It's the perfect place
to shoot the scene

232
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,208
where they get all
friendly with each other!

233
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,750
Yep! Go ahead,
knock yourself out!

234
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,416
Uh, what do you want us to do?

235
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,291
You can go home.
I'm done with you.

236
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,625
[BOTH]
Huh?!

237
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,000
[KYON] Congratulations,
you guys have been sacked.

238
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,083
It looks like you're about
as important to Haruhi

239
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,375
as a bunch of spent BBs.

240
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,958
Which isn't such a bad thing,
if you wanna know the truth.

241
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,791
[TSURUYA]
Ta-da! Here it is!

242
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,041
[KYON]
Ginormous!

243
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,125
What sorts of evil things
do I have to do

244
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,916
to live in a place like this?

245
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,000
So anyway, this is my room!

246
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,958
You guys can wait here till
Mikuru's done with her bath.

247
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,666
[KYON] Whoa, this place
makes my bedroom

248
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,291
look like a cat condo.

249
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,625
[HARUHI]
Great room!

250
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,791
This is a perfect location!

251
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, yeah!

252
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,625
Hey, Tsuru, I wanted
to ask you something.

253
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,791
When you get the...
[whispering continues]

254
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,833
[laughs]

255
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,875
[KYON]
Huh?

256
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,250
[TSURUYA]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

257
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,083
Here you go.

258
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,500
Thank you!

259
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,708
Thanks for waiting.

260
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,250
Sorry I took so long.

261
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,541
[TSURUYA]
Here you go!

262
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,791
[KYON gasps]

263
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,500
[KYON] Am I being
tested here or something?!

264
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,750
Miss Asahina, that outfit
is absolutely criminal!

265
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,708
Here you go! Drink up!

266
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,208
[KYON]
Thanks.

267
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,458
Thank you.

268
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,375
[KYON]
Watching her take a sip

269
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,500
is another direct hit
to my libido!

270
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,333
Okay, let's knock this one out!

271
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,708
[KYON] And with that,
we started shooting.

272
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,333
In the shot, Koizumi carried the

273
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,708
pretending-to-be-unconscious
Miss Asahina into the room.

274
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,583
For some unknown
and convenient reason,

275
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,333
there was a futon
spread out on the floor.

276
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,416
Go, Mikuru, start waking up.

277
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,625
[whimpers]

278
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,375
[KOIZUMI]
Are you awake now?

279
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,041
Yes...

280
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,958
But, um...
I don't know where I am.

281
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,708
[KOIZUMI]
You're in my room now.

282
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,916
Thank you for taking care of me.

283
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,708
[KYON]
She seems a little too sexy.

284
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,875
Is that acting?

285
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,541
[HARUHI] Bring your faces
closer together.

286
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,416
Yeah!

287
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,166
Now, Mikuru, close your eyes.

288
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,333
Koizumi, put your
arm around her!

289
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,208
All right, now push
her down and kiss her!

290
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,250
[grunts]

291
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,208
[growls]

292
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,250
Hold it!

293
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,541
This is going too far!

294
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,375
Why is this scene
happening anyway?!

295
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,833
What is this?!

296
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,750
It's a love scene, of course.

297
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,625
We have to have one to
pat out the picture's runtime.

298
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,000
You're crazy!

299
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,416
Are we shooting a movie
for late-night TV or what?!

300
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,000
And why are you suddenly
getting into it, Koizumi?!

301
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,041
If this thing ever screens
at the school festival,

302
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,083
I guarantee you're gonna
get a ton of hate mail

303
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,250
crammed in your shoe
locker the next day!

304
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,500
I'll even write some myself!

305
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,958
[TSURUYA laughs]

306
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,125
Mikuru, you're so weird!

307
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,750
[KYON]
Normally, I'd disagree,

308
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,083
but she is acting
a little strange.

309
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,041
Her eyes are all glazed over,
and her cheeks are flushed.

310
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,916
She looks like she'd let
Koizumi do whatever he wants!

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,041
This isn't funny anymore!

312
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:11,458
Hey... Koizumi, I feel hot...
and my head's all heavy...

313
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,583
[KYON] Geez, it's like somebody
drugged her or something.

314
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,625
[gasps]

315
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:22,125
Sorry, I sorta spiked her juice
with a little bit of sake.

316
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,958
I was told it would help her
loosen up and act better.

317
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,416
[HARUHI]
Hmph.

318
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,541
It's not right to get
people loaded like that!

319
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,833
Just look at her, she's sexier
now than ever before!

320
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,958
Don't listen to him,
kiss her! Go ahead!

321
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,583
Kiss her right on the mouth!

322
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,541
[growls]

323
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,208
Don't do it, Koizumi.

324
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,916
Madam Director...

325
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,625
I hate to say it, but I'm
feeling a little overwhelmed.

326
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,625
Besides, it looks like
Miss Asahina's

327
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,250
reached her limit, too.

328
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,708
Nah... I feel fine...
Let's keep shouting...

329
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,708
Aw, geez! This won't do...

330
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,750
[MIKURU]
Huh?

331
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,916
Man, I can't believe
you'd get so plastered

332
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,875
from just a little sake.

333
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,666
[KYON] I can't believe
you made her drink it!

334
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,083
Come on, snap out of it!

335
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,208
[yelps]

336
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,875
You call that a reaction?

337
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,916
Whenever I tap you on
the head with this thing,

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,583
you have to straighten
out your back.

339
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,958
That's the rule!

340
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,416
Let's try it again, okay?
Now focus!

341
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,500
[yelps]

342
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:34,875
[yelps]

343
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,125
[KYON]
Cut it out!

344
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,791
How is that supposed to help?!

345
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,041
And how is any of this
gonna fit in the movie?!

346
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,875
Huh?! What's your problem?

347
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,958
I don't have to tell you
how I'm gonna use this,

348
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,041
that's my business!

349
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,541
You can't tell me
because you have no idea!

350
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,375
Stop making excuses!

351
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,958
Oh, yeah!
Like you know anything!

352
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,750
You don't even know
what this movie's about!

353
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,625
How dare you make
selfish demands?!

354
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,500
You're the one who's
being selfish here!

355
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,875
You're just hitting Miss
Asahina because you want to!

356
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,416
How dare you
treat her like that?!

357
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,958
Don't you talk to me like that!

358
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,416
Who do you think you are?!

359
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,250
This is called "story" and
it's important for my movie!

360
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,041
Get it now?!

361
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,541
It's not important!

362
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,166
Know what?! This sucks!

363
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,958
Miss Asahina is not your toy!

364
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,875
Shut up! It's important to me!

365
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,291
And I can treat her
like a toy if I want to!

366
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,541
[growls]

367
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,250
[BOTH gasp]

368
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,666
[HARUHI]
Wha-What is it?!

369
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,791
What is your problem
anyway, huh?!

370
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,875
You just have to do
what I tell you!

371
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,208
I'm the brigade leader!
I'm the director!

372
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,500
Whatever!

373
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,000
Do what I say or get out!

374
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,916
[KYON]
Let go, Koizumi!

375
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,708
I don't care if it's
a person or an animal,

376
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,541
if they won't listen,
they deserved to be smacked!

377
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,166
If she doesn't learn
her lesson now,

378
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,000
she's gonna grow up to be
some kind of lonely freak!

379
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,291
[MIKURU]
Stop it! Don't!

380
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,375
Stop fighting... Stop it!

381
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:28,000
Or else... Nevermind,
it's classified anyway...

382
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,958
[TSURUYA]
I'm sorry, Kyon.

383
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,083
I got a little carried away.

384
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,750
You don't have
to worry about Mikuru.

385
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,125
I'll take her home
or have her stay the night.

386
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,750
I always thought of you
as being more rational

387
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,291
than you were back there.

388
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,375
[KYON]
Yeah, so did I.

389
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,208
The good news is that
closed space hasn't appeared.

390
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,208
It looks like Miss
Suzumiya's subconscious

391
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,250
was able to control
itself this time.

392
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,708
[KYON]
Awesome. Less work for you.

393
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,916
[KOIZUMI]
By the way, if you're free,

394
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,375
there's a place
I'd like to take you to.

395
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,625
And what if I said no?

396
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,791
I don't think this
should take too long.

397
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,458
[KOIZUMI] Do you remember what
Miss Suzumiya said yesterday?

398
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:28,250
How am I supposed to remember
all the crazy stuff she says?

399
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,375
When you see this, I'm sure
it'll come back to you.

400
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,458
I think they've been like that
ever since this morning.

401
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,541
Did someone come out here and
paint 'em all or something?

402
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,000
No, that's the natural coloring
of their feathers.

403
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,375
There's no mistaking it.

404
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,458
Well, maybe all
the gunfire yesterday

405
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,875
scared the heck out of 'em.

406
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,375
Even if that were
really the case,

407
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,458
do you think this is
what would happen?

408
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,041
[KYON]
Yeah, I know.

409
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,000
[HARUHI] It would be so awesome
if the pigeons were all white,

410
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,250
but I guess it doesn't matter
what color they are.

411
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,916
[KYON]
Apparently, it did.

412
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,125
Here's my perspective
on the situation.

413
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,666
Miss Suzumiya's special.

414
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,250
However, at one point,

415
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,458
she was given her godlike powers
by someone or something else.

416
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,041
Ultimately, she's just an
ordinary human being,

417
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,791
as opposed to a divine being.

418
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,291
Her presence in this world
is proof of that.

419
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,541
Well, that's a
new spin on things.

420
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,125
Correct me if I'm wrong,

421
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,416
but didn't you say
something before

422
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,125
about how Haruhi
was a god?

423
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,833
Really? Did I say that?

424
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,500
[KYON]
Don't mess with me.

425
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,583
Of course I'm only kidding.

426
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,666
Miss Suzumiya is the one who
can create the world around us.

427
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,500
And at the same time,
she can destroy it.

428
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,375
Perhaps the reality
we're currently in

429
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,041
isn't working as
efficiently as it should.

430
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,375
And perhaps the only person

431
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,000
who has the power to fix
this failed world of ours

432
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,750
is the one we've come
to know as Miss Suzumiya.

433
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,083
[KYON]
Yeah, sure.

434
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,333
[KOIZUMI]
Consider this:

435
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,166
If she's creating all this
strange phenomena

436
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,125
to fix whatever's wrong
with the world,

437
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,833
then our attempts
at covering it up

438
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,666
might be preventing that
change from taking place.

439
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,958
[KYON]
Hmph. So what?

440
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,791
[KOIZUMI] It means we
could be in a lot of trouble,

441
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,208
that's what.

442
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,833
When Miss Suzumiya
changes this world

443
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,041
to a version that's
functioning properly,

444
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,125
do you think there would
still be a need for us

445
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,375
and our special abilities?

446
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,791
Or, will we be considered
the bugs in the program

447
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,041
and exterminated?

448
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,875
[KYON]
Who knows?

449
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,875
Honestly, with all its faults,

450
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,875
I like the world the way it is.

451
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,375
It's been built piece by piece
by so many different people,

452
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,458
from ancient times
to the present.

453
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:34,000
If I had my way, I wouldn't
change a single thing about it.

454
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,333
That's why I do what
I can about Miss Suzumiya

455
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,500
and the situations
she puts us in.

456
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,083
I wonder if this world
is really worth

457
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,666
all the trouble
you're going through.

458
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,750
Oh?

459
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,833
I thought you of
all people felt it was.

460
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,000
Otherwise, you
wouldn't have come back

461
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,458
from closed space that one time.

462
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,166
Or am I mistaken?

463
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,416
Well, who knows? I don't.

464
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,375
It's out of character for me
to be so presumptuous.

465
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,500
And for a second there,

466
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,875
I might've sounded
like I was inferring

467
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,250
that we were the
protectors of this world.

468
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,791
Please forgive me.

469
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,000
[KOIZUMI]
Rather than being angry today,

470
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,250
it seems Miss Suzumiya
is too busy feeling sad.

471
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,541
[KYON]
Really? Why's that?

472
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,250
[KOIZUMI] I thought you
of all people would know why.

473
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,166
I don't mind
explaining it, though.

474
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,958
Miss Suzumiya always thought
that no matter what happened,

475
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,500
you'd be right there,
by her side,

476
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,875
even though you'd
sometimes complain.

477
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,250
You alone would forgive her.

478
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,541
[KYON] Yeah, well, the only one
who could forgive her now

479
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,375
would be a martyred saint.

480
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,708
[KOIZUMI] Do you think
you could say something

481
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,000
to Miss Suzumiya
to cheer her up?

482
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,625
If you don't, she might
continue to get depressed.

483
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,250
And then something much worse
than closed space could appear.

484
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,416
I don't even want to think about

485
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,375
what would happen
to the world if...

486
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,875
...well, if she were to sink
into a deep depression.

487
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,291
[KYON] So, you're telling me
to go cheer her up.

488
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,833
[KOIZUMI] You just need to get
back together with her again.

489
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,875
[KYON] Yeah, see,
that's where you're wrong.

490
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,958
I was never "with her"
to begin with.

491
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,500
[KOIZUMI]
Oh, well...

492
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,000
I thought that you would've
cooled off a bit more by now.

493
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,291
I guess I was wrong.

494
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,958
[KYON] The reason
I got so angry yesterday

495
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,500
was because I couldn't
stand watching

496
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,083
Miss Asahina getting abused
and degraded like that.

497
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,833
But that's not the only reason.

498
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,833
I could've been suffering
from calcium deficiency.

499
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,583
So, before bed last night,
I downed a liter of milk.

500
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,083
And it seemed to
calm me down a little bit.

501
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,833
It... could've been
a placebo effect, though.

502
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,125
[TANIGUCHI]
Yeah, movie, what a joke.

503
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,416
[KUNIKIDA]
Don't listen to him.

504
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,791
He's just upset
'cause he wanted to

505
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,291
hang out with you guys
and Miss Suzumiya some more.

506
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,625
He even cancelled
his plans on that day.

507
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,375
Don't tell him that, you jerk!

508
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,291
So anyway, you can
just forget about

509
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,208
me helping out on any more
of your stupid projects.

510
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,958
Movie... yeah, right.

511
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,958
Nobody's gonna watch that trash!

512
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:08,708
For real.

513
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,083
[KYON growls]

514
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,916
You're the last person
I wanna hear that from.

515
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,250
[TANIGUCHI]
Hm?

516
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,333
[KYON] It's not like I
can't imagine it, though.

517
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,041
But hearing a guy like him
say it really pisses me off.

518
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,541
At least Haruhi's
doing something

519
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,833
for the school festival.

520
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,333
She's trying to get involved.

521
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,791
Can you say the same
about yourself?

522
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,291
Who cares if it's stupid?!

523
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,916
At least she's trying
to make something.

524
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,041
Look at you!

525
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,041
You're just sitting
there complaining!

526
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,458
Man... That really
pisses me off!

527
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,791
Why am I so angry
about it though?

528
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:40,958
I wonder...

529
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,458
Is it because I've
suddenly found a passion

530
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,125
for making movies or something?

531
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,333
Is there something wrong, Kyon?

532
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,541
Miss Suzumiya looked upset, too.

533
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,125
Did something happen?

534
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,000
[TANIGUCHI]
Lovers' spat, whatever.

535
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,166
[KYON]
Hmph.

536
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,583
I get it now.

537
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,000
I do what Haruhi tells me to do,

538
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,208
and then I go out
and complain about it.

539
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,708
There's no difference
between me and Taniguchi.

540
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,333
I mean, I got so mad at the
stuff he was saying just now,

541
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,541
but how's it any different
from what I've said before?!

542
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,166
Dammit! Taniguchi, you bastard!

543
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,583
Thanks to you,
I've realized something

544
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,541
and I'm not happy about it!

545
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,500
And now, I'm gonna go do
something I know I'll regret!

546
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,750
Dammit... Dammit! Dammit!

547
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,125
[HARUHI gasps]

548
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,541
Hey, Haruhi.

549
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,916
What do you want?

550
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,750
We're gonna finish this movie,
and it's gonna be awesome.

551
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:38,875
[HARUHI gasps]

552
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:46,666
[chuckles]

553
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,708
Well of course, it will!

554
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,041
I am the director, after all.

555
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,791
Everyone knows it's
gonna be awesome.

556
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,291
I certainly don't need
you to tell me that.

557
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,833
[KYON]
Man, talk about a mood swing.

558
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,666
Oh, well. Things get weird
when Haruhi's grumpy,

559
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,375
so I guess this
really is for the best.

560
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,041
Here we go!

561
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,041
You could've at least

562
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,958
tried to pick a better way
to say it to her.

563
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,041
Sorry.

564
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,083
Not only is she back
to her old self,

565
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,333
now she's even more
powerful than ever!

566
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,000
Sorry.

567
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,833
We won't be able to cover things
up for much longer.

568
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,666
Can you believe
how perfect this is?!

569
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,458
I was just thinking about a
scene with cherry blossoms!

570
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,833
This weird weather came along
right at the nick of time!

571
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,666
Let me see your victory pose!

572
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,541
[MIKURU]
Huh?

573
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,500
[whimpers]

574
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,375
I know!

575
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,958
We need to find ourselves a cat!

576
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,166
A cat?

577
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,125
Yeah. Every witch
needs a familiar, right?

578
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,333
And nothing says
familiar like a cat!

579
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,750
I wonder if there's
a black cat around here.

580
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,041
Wasn't Nagato supposed to be

581
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,333
playing an evil alien
in this thing?

582
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,750
You and your details.

583
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,500
I need a cat for this movie,
so let's find one!

584
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,666
How 'bout it, Yuki?

585
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,916
Do you know any
place around here

586
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,958
where we can find
a buncha stray cats?
