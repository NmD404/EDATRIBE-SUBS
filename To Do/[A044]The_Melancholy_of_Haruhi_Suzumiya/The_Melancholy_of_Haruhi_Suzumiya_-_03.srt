1
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,500
You're... an alien?

2
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,375
[YUKI] My mission is to observe
Haruhi Suzumiya and report

3
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:39,000
the information back to the data
integration thought entity.

4
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,833
I've been performing
this task daily

5
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,083
since my creation
three years ago.

6
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,166
It has been quite peaceful
and there have been

7
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,791
no uncertain factors.

8
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:50,208
However, irregularities have
appeared near Haruhi Suzumiya

9
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,083
which cannot be ignored.

10
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,583
That would be... you.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,916
[YUKI] To the data integration
thought entity,

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,541
the third planet in the
solar system, this planet,

13
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,083
held no special value.

14
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,000
However, the current inhabitants
of Earth as it is known

15
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,416
by your kind, developed
a cognitive ability

16
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
that could be
considered intelligence.

17
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,500
Consequently, the significance
of the planet increased.

18
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,625
There was the possibility
that your kind might

19
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,250
provide an answer in overcoming
the inert evolution

20
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,250
the entity is experiencing.

21
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,375
Throughout the universe, it is
common for organic lifeforms

22
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,000
to develop a consciousness.

23
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,166
Human beings from Earth
were the only creatures

24
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,625
whose consciences evolved
into intellect.

25
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,375
The entity carefully,
yet thoroughly,

26
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,416
continued its observations.

27
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,250
Three years ago, they noticed
an abnormal flare up of data

28
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,833
on the surface of the planet.

29
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,791
This explosion of information
started from one area

30
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,500
of a bow-shaped archipelago,

31
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,666
then quickly enveloped
the entire planet

32
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,083
and surged further
outward into space.

33
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,458
In the center of all this was...

34
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,750
For the three years since,
multiple investigations

35
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,916
and observations have occurred
regarding Haruhi Suzumiya.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,416
However, she remains an enigma.

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,625
Regardless, one section
of the entity...

38
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,958
...continues to perform its
analysis of Haruhi Suzumiya.

39
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,541
The entity believes she will be
the key to human kind's

40
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,208
auto-evolution
as well as its own.

41
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,916
Because the entity is an
astro-being, it can not

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,416
directly communicate with
organic lifeforms.

43
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,791
The entity does not communicate
through language,

44
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,083
and your kind has no way of
communicating without language.

45
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,125
That is why the data
integration thought entity

46
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,000
created interfaces
such as myself.

47
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,416
Through me, it can make contact
with the human species.

48
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,500
[KYON]
Uh...

49
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,875
We believe that Haruhi Suzumiya
has the potential for

50
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,791
auto-evolution. She has
the power to manipulate

51
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,791
the environmental data
around her for her benefit.

52
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,708
That is the reason
why I am here,

53
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,416
and the reason why you are here.

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,875
[KYON]
Hold it. Just hang on a sec.

55
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm totally lost.

56
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,125
Trust me...

57
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay, first of all, why me?

58
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,458
I mean, for starters, let's just
say I believe all this stuff

59
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,375
you're tellin' me about
this data-integrated

60
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,375
whatchamahoozit thingy in space.

61
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,083
But if it's true, why reveal
your identity to me?

62
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,333
You have been chosen
by Haruhi Suzumiya.

63
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,250
Whether she knows it or not,
Haruhi Suzumi has the power

64
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,000
to affect her surroundings by
transforming her will into

65
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,666
absolute data. There is
a reason she chose you

66
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,833
rather than someone else.

67
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:40,500
No way.

68
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,041
Way.

69
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,666
You and Haruhi Suzumiya have
the possibilities in your hands.

70
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,041
You're serious about all this.

71
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,708
Of course.

72
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,750
[KYON] Here I am, amazed
that the silent one had

73
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,000
finally started talking,
but the stuff that was

74
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,333
coming out of her mouth
was completely whacko.

75
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,541
I never imagined she'd
be so... out there.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,333
You know, you'd really make
Haruhi ecstatic if you

77
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,625
went up to her personally
and told her all this stuff.

78
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,625
Hate to say it, but I'm having a
hard time keeping up with this

79
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,166
kinda talk, it's so confusing.

80
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,000
The data integration thought
entity is under the impression

81
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,416
that if Haruhi Suzumiya
is made aware of her worth

82
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,625
and her abilities, it would
create a catastrophic event.

83
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,541
For now, we must continue our
observations unbeknownst to her.

84
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,041
Okay... but I could run out
right now and tell Haruhi

85
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,541
everything you just
explained to me.

86
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,083
[YUKI]
She does not take

87
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,666
the information you
feed her seriously.

88
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,125
That's true.

89
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,208
I am not the only interface
that the data integration

90
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,250
thought entity has placed
upon this planet.

91
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,625
Another section of the entity
is determined to use

92
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,125
more proactive methods
with Haruhi Suzumiya

93
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,791
in order to observe the
fluctuations of data.

94
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,000
You are the key to
Haruhi Suzumiya.

95
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,875
If there is danger,
you are the first target.

96
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,291
[KYON]
I'm outta here...

97
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,875
[police siren]

98
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:58,333
[KYON]
Humanoid inter... what?

99
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,875
Aliens.

100
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,250
[KYON sighs]

101
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,791
[KYON] She's always by
herself reading this stuff.

102
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,333
Maybe that's where her weird
fantasies come from.

103
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,583
I'll bet that when
she's in class

104
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,875
she doesn't talk to anybody.

105
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,500
She just stays cooped up
in her own little world.

106
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,083
Yuki and Haruhi need to
just chill out and enjoy

107
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,750
some plain, old ordinary
school life.

108
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,375
[HARUHI] I can't believe it!
He's finally here!

109
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,000
Isn't it amazing?!
Mysterious transfer student!

110
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,625
It's gotta be!

111
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,041
You haven't even seen him yet,
how do you know he's mysterious?

112
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,833
Like I said, a student who
transfers during this strange,

113
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,166
in-between time in the middle
of school has a good chance

114
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,333
of being a mysterious
transfer student!

115
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,083
If you don't mind,
I wanna know just who

116
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,500
gave you that statistic.

117
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,333
Because if it's true, and
you take into account all

118
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,833
the mysterious people in Japan,

119
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,250
then everyone would
be considered--

120
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,291
I'm gonna go check him out!

121
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,500
And, you're not listening,
are you?

122
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,208
[KYON] After school when
I stopped by the club,

123
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:50,000
Miss Asahina had heroically
recovered after only one day.

124
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,291
[KYON] I'm surprised
to see you back here

125
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,041
after everything that happened.

126
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,541
[MIKURU] Yeah, but after
thinking about it,

127
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,916
I realized I still had concerns.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,666
[KYON] I could swear
she said that before...

129
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,250
[KYON]
What're you concerned about?

130
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,583
[MIKURU]
Um... It's nothing.

131
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,125
Huh?

132
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,208
You wanna sit in for a game?

133
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,333
So, Nagato,
you ever play Othello?

134
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,125
[MIKURU]
Uh...

135
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,916
[KYON]
Hmm?

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,416
[HARUHI]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

137
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,625
Someone transferred into
freshman class 9 today,

138
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,750
and he's joining us!

139
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,958
His name is--

140
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,583
Itsuki Koizumi. How do you do?

141
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,333
This is the SOS Brigade!

142
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,625
I'm Haruhi Suzumiya
the Brigade leader,

143
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,500
and these are brigade
members numbers one,

144
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,625
two, and three!

145
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,708
By the way, you're
member number four.

146
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:46,291
Everyone should make him
feel right at home!

147
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,666
I don't mind joining you guys,

148
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,666
but I was wondering what
kind of club this is anyway.

149
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,416
Let me tell you exactly what the
SOS Brigade is all about.

150
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,625
Attention.

151
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,375
The SOS Brigade's mission
is to find aliens,

152
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,416
time travelers, and ESPers
and hang out with them!

153
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,083
[KYON]
It's as if the whole world

154
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,208
has come to a grinding halt.

155
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,583
No, not really.

156
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,625
But I was reminded of
Haruhi's declaration

157
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,500
on the first day of school.

158
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,041
Oh, I get it.

159
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,250
As expected from Miss Suzumiya.

160
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,625
[KYON]
What did he just get?

161
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,250
All right, I'll join your club,

162
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,416
and I hope to have a
good time with all of you.

163
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,791
[KYON] What? Even after
what she just said?

164
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,375
Was he even listening?

165
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,416
Nice to meet you.
I'm Itsuki Koizumi

166
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,541
and I just transferred here.

167
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,625
There's still a
lot I don't know,

168
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,375
so I hope you'll
show me the ropes.

169
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,375
Uh, yeah, um...

170
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,291
[HARUHI]
That's Kyon!

171
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,708
And the cute one is Mikuru!

172
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,833
And the one over there
with the glasses is Yuki.

173
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,291
Uh...

174
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,500
[screams]

175
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,875
Oh my, are you all right?

176
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,750
We've got five members now, and
that means we're an official

177
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,750
extracurricular club!

178
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,666
I'm fine, really. Thanks.

179
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,750
Yay! The time has finally come

180
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,958
for the SOS Brigade
to be unveiled!

181
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,250
For gaters, get ready to do
your best and fight as one!

182
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,958
[KYON] Fighting? Unveiled? And
now Nagato's become a member...

183
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,583
I mean, are you sure you're
okay with that, Nagato?

184
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,541
Moving right along, it's now
after school the following day.

185
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,916
[MIKURU]
Noooo!

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,041
[HARUHI] Come one, hurry up!
Take your clothes off!

187
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,416
--[MIKURU sobbing]
--[HARUHI laughs]

188
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,208
[screams]

189
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,125
Holy--!

190
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,708
Sorry!

191
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,291
[HARUHI] When it comes to moe,
the maid costume is essential.

192
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,333
You need one in every
school-based story.

193
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,291
What kind of school-based
story is this?

194
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,750
[HARUHI] And now...
it's time for pictures!

195
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,750
[gasps]

196
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,708
But... Don't take a picture!

197
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,333
[HARUHI]
Chin down a bit... Good.

198
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,666
Grab hold of the apron...

199
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,375
Bigger smile... Work it!

200
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,666
Kyon, take over for me, okay?

201
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,666
Mikuru, let's make
things a little sexier!

202
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,666
--What're you doing?!
--Come on, it's okay!

203
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,833
[KYON]
There's nothing okay about it.

204
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,708
Yeah, I should talk.
I'm the one taking the pictures.

205
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,500
[HARUHI]
Yuki, gimme your glasses.

206
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,333
Here we go!

207
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,250
[KYON]
And glasses are on.

208
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,458
What is she planning to do
with these photos anyway?

209
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,958
[HARUHI]
Yeah, perfect!

210
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,583
A glasses-wearing lolita
maid with great boobs!

211
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,208
This is so awesome!

212
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,791
Noo!

213
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,416
[HARUHI] From now on, Mikuru,
whenever you're in this room,

214
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,916
you gotta wear this outfit!

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,625
[MIKURU]
No...

216
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,541
Uh! What's going on here?

217
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,250
[HARUHI]
Oh, right! Now we're talkin'!

218
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,208
Let's all have some
fun with Mikuru!

219
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,833
[KYON]
That's enough.

220
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,541
Thanks for the offer,
but I'll pass.

221
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,416
I'd be afraid of
the consequences.

222
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,708
Please continue though.
Don't mind me.

223
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,375
[KYON] I could use
a little help here...

224
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,333
Haven't you had enough?
Just cut it out already.

225
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,208
You've gotta be breaking
several laws here.

226
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,500
What're you talkin' about?!

227
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,458
Whatever...

228
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,458
I got a lot of photos anyway.

229
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,125
[HARUHI] Okay, the very first
meeting of the SOS Brigade

230
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,333
is about to begin!

231
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,250
We did a lot to come
this far this fast.

232
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,416
We passed out flyers,
we made a website,

233
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,625
and now, we see that the SOS
Brigade's fame at this school

234
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,416
has sky rocketed!

235
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,916
Sure, you could say...

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,375
[KYON] I wonder what part of
"traumatizing Miss Asahina"

237
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,083
makes this a big success?

238
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,708
[HARUHI] However, we haven't
gotten a single email

239
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,625
concerning strange phenomena.

240
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,916
Also, not even one student's
come by yet to consult us

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,458
about anything weird or...

242
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,791
[KYON]
Yeah, go figure.

243
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,041
I mean, it's not exactly clear

244
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,625
what we're even
supposed to be doing.

245
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,625
After all, we just found out
what this club's for yesterday.

246
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,750
[HARUHI]
People like to say stuff like,

247
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,458
"Good things come
to those who wait."

248
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,791
But in these times,
we cannot sit and wait!

249
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,208
We must find those good things

250
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,625
even if we have to dig up
every inch of this Earth!

251
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,500
So then, let's go
search for them!

252
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,375
For what?

253
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,541
The mysteries of this world!

254
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,166
[KYON] And with that, we are now
going on a tour around the city

255
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,500
in search of mystery
and phenomena.

256
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,583
On Saturday, meet at 9 am in
front of Kitaguchi Station.

257
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,166
Those who arrive late shall
receive the death penalty.

258
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,958
Death penalty...?

259
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,958
You know, I really hate
to waste a day off...

260
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,333
You're late! Penalty!

261
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,541
[KYON] Haruhi's proposal:
Split off into groups of two,

262
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,625
search the city for
mysterious phenomena.

263
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,000
If we find any, alert
the others via cell phone.

264
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,083
That is all.

265
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,750
I guess we got our groups.

266
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,083
[KYON] It might be a lucky
day for me after all.

267
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,833
I mean, if I can go on
a date with Miss Asahina,

268
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,416
treating everyone to lunch
'cause I was late

269
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,458
is a small price to pay.

270
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,666
[HARUHI]
Kyon, are you paying attention?

271
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,541
Would you be serious here?
This isn't a date, got it?

272
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,250
[KYON]
Yeah, I hear ya.

273
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,125
Look, this isn't fun and games!

274
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,625
You mess around
and I'll kill ya!

275
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,833
[KYON] And with those parting
words, Haruhi's team left

276
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,125
to investigate the east side of
the station while Miss Asahina

277
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,416
and I were ordered to search the
west side. However...

278
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,583
What should we do?

279
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,750
[KYON]
Beats me.

280
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,125
[MIKURU]
This is the first time

281
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,500
I've ever gone for
a walk like this.

282
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,083
By like this, you mean...?

283
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,125
Out walking alone with a boy.

284
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,333
Oh!

285
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,125
Come on, I can't believe that.

286
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,958
You're telling me that you've
never gone out on a date

287
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,208
with anyone before?

288
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,625
[MIKURU]
Never.

289
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,166
Hah, you're kidding, right?

290
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,458
I mean, don't you have guys
just lining up to ask you out?

291
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,666
Mm. But... I can't do it.

292
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,458
You see, I'm not supposed to
go out on dates with anyone.

293
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,750
At least not in this--

294
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,791
[gasps]

295
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:14,916
Kyon.

296
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,125
I've gotta favor to ask of you.

297
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,750
[KYON] After a couple of false
starts, Miss Asahina finally

298
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,083
started putting her words
into complete sentences

299
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,750
and began to explain.

300
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,625
[MIKURU] You might not believe
a word I'm about to say,

301
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,958
but the truth is, I'm not
actually from this time plane.

302
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,666
I come from the future.

303
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,541
I can't tell you from which
time period or time plane

304
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,041
I come from, though.

305
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,625
Telling anything about the
future to anyone from the past

306
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,250
is restricted.
I was told this before

307
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,833
I boarded the time machine.

308
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:48,000
Ah... think of it as being
a lot like animation.

309
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,541
The pictures look like
they're in motion, right?

310
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,875
But it's just a series of still
frames laid out in a sequence.

311
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,083
Time is just like that...

312
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,583
Time travelling is moving in a
three-dimensional direction

313
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,541
along the various time planes.

314
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,125
I'm from the future.
That means on this time plane,

315
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,208
I'm sort of like an extra
picture in the middle

316
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,750
of one of those flip book
animation things.

317
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,416
[KYON]
What is it now?

318
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,291
As for me, I'm here because
a large time click

319
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,166
happened three years ago.

320
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,041
That's three years ago from
the current time in this plane.

321
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,916
We arrived in the
past to investigate,

322
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,791
and we were surprised
once we got here.

323
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,166
No matter how hard we tried,

324
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,500
we couldn't go further back
in time from that plane.

325
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,250
The conclusion was that there
had to be a large time gap

326
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,833
between the time planes.

327
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,250
It wasn't until recently that we
found the thing that caused it.

328
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,750
That is... recently in the
future where I come from.

329
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,125
So what is the reason?

330
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,208
Miss Suzumiya.

331
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,583
[KYON]
Not again.

332
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,416
She was at the very center
of the time distortion,

333
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,541
and I can't explain any more
of this to you because

334
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,416
it's classified information.
But we are certain that it was

335
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Miss Suzumiya who closed
our access to the past.

336
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,916
[KYON] It's hard to believe
that Haruhi would be able

337
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,333
to do something like that.

338
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,708
Believe me, it's a
mystery to us as well.

339
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,458
And Miss Suzumiya doesn't
realize that she's

340
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,708
the cause of the time quake,
either. That's where I come in.

341
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,166
I was sent here to see whether
or not there'll be any new

342
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,958
time anomalies occurring
near Miss Suzumiya.

343
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,541
I guess... I'm kind
of like a watchdog.

344
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,375
I'll understand if you
don't wanna believe

345
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,791
what I just told you.

346
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,750
No, it's not that, it's just...
why are you telling me?

347
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,666
Because you are the one that
Miss Suzumiya has chosen.

348
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,291
I can't explain because it's
classified information,

349
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,416
but you are very important
to Miss Suzumiya.

350
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,333
There are reasons behind
everything she does.

351
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,291
Every time she raises her
hand or takes a step.

352
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,416
What about Nagato
and the new guy?

353
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,916
[MIKURU] Oh, well, they're in
very similar positions to me.

354
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,958
I never expected Miss Suzumiya
to get us all together

355
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,000
in such a precise
manner, though.

356
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,666
So that means you
know who or what

357
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,291
both of them really are, right?

358
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,333
That's classified.

359
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,666
[gasps]

360
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,625
Can you tell me what's
going to happen to Haruhi?

361
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,125
[MIKURU]
That's classified.

362
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,666
Well, if you're
from the future,

363
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,500
you already know
what happens, right?

364
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,583
[MIKURU]
That's classified.

365
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,791
Well, then, why don't you just
tell Haruhi all this stuff?

366
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,500
[MIKURU]
That's classified.

367
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,541
I'm sorry, but I'm
not authorized

368
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,125
to say anything
right now.

369
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,166
You don't have to believe me.

370
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,583
I just wanted you to know
about it, that's all.

371
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,666
[KYON] I just heard the same
thing a couple of days ago,

372
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,541
didn't I?

373
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,625
[MIKURU] I'm sorry to dump
all this on you like I did.

374
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,666
Don't apologize, I don't mind.

375
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,708
[KYON] So now we've got an
alien and a time traveler.

376
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,291
What's going on here?

377
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,458
If there's anybody out there
who believes in all this stuff,

378
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,125
please, call me.
We'll trade places.

379
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:34,916
Miss Asahina.

380
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes?

381
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,875
You mind if we put
all this on hold?

382
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,750
I mean, is it okay if we
just put aside whether

383
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,500
I believe you or not and
just get back to it later?

384
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,708
Sure.

385
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,875
Before we do, can I
ask you one question?

386
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,500
Yes, what is it?

387
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,416
If you wouldn't mind, could you
tell me how old you really are?

388
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,375
That's classified.

389
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,416
[KYON]
After that little conversation,

390
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,041
Haruhi called me on my cell,

391
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,541
and we all got together
again at noon.

392
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,583
Find anything?

393
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,458
[KYON]
Nothing.

394
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,791
Were you guys really looking?

395
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,791
I hope you weren't just
wandering around, Mikuru.

396
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,583
Ah! N-No!

397
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,375
What about you?
Did you find anything?

398
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,625
[KYON] While we ate lunch,
Haruhi said she wanted

399
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,500
to split up into groups again.

400
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,083
An unmarked one again.

401
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,666
[HARUHI] We'll meet back
at the station at four.

402
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,666
Make sure to find something
this time, you got that?

403
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,333
[KYON] This time, we split
up to search the north end

404
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:33,666
and the south end. Nagato
and me took the south side.

405
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,625
You know what you told me
about the other day?

406
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,875
What?

407
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,375
Well, suddenly I find
myself thinking that it

408
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,500
doesn't really sound so
far-fetched anymore.

409
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,541
Oh...

410
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,041
[KYON] If I have to pass
the time with Nagato,

411
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,083
this is about the
only place to do it.

412
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,958
[KYON]
Oh brother.

413
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,125
[screams]

414
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,750
[HARUHI] What time do you
think it is you idiot?!

415
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,791
[KYON] Sorry, but I
actually just woke up.

416
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,666
[HARUHI]
Huh?!

417
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,208
What did you just say to me?!

418
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,791
We were supposed to meet
you at four, right?

419
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,125
[HARUHI] Get your butt back
here! You got 30 seconds!

420
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,583
[KYON]
I had my work cut out for me.

421
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,833
We had to leave,

422
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,291
but getting Nagato to
move when she's reading

423
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,208
is impossible. First, I had
to get her a library card

424
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,750
so she could check out the book.

425
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,375
Meanwhile, I had to ignore the
incessant calls from Haruhi.

426
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,750
Late! Penalty!

427
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,500
[KYON] In the end, we
didn't find anything

428
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,583
even remotely close
to phenomena.

429
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,791
The day's activities

430
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,916
were a waste of both
my time and my money.

431
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,208
Before we split up though,
Miss Asahina...

432
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,000
I wanted to thank you for
listening to my story today.

433
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,250
[KYON] ...whispered into my ear,
which felt pretty good

434
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,625
if I may say so.

435
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,875
All right, spit it out, what
were you doing today?

436
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,416
Wait a minute, what about you?

437
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,666
Were you able to find any of
your mysterious phenomena today?

438
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,750
Well, they wouldn't be
careless enough to let you

439
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,125
find them in one day, right?

440
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,458
I mean, what did
you expect, anyway?

441
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,041
We're gonna need to review
your behavior on Monday.

442
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,833
[KYON]
And with that, she stormed off.

443
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,333
[sighs]

444
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,916
[KYON]
You're kidding me...

445
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,708
[KYON] The weekend was over,
and I was sweating from all

446
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,541
the humidity this morning.
Oh, the rainy season.

447
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,166
Haruhi walked in right
before the final bell rang.

448
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,750
Send me some of that breeze.

449
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,000
You're on your own there.

450
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,250
[sighs]

451
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,041
Hey, Suzumiya, ever happen
to hear the story

452
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,708
about the blue bird
of happiness?

453
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,541
What about it?

454
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,083
Nevermind, it doesn't have
to do with anything.

455
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,041
Then don't talk about it.

456
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,791
[KYON] After being showered from
behind by Haruhi's aura of

457
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,750
unpleasantness all day, I fled
to the safety of the club room.

458
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,666
Much like a rat running
from a brush fire...

459
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,000
There was someone
I needed to talk to.

460
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,333
Koizumi, don't you also have
something you want to

461
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,875
talk to me about
regarding Suzumiya?

462
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,166
Heh...

463
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,625
[KOIZUMI] I get the feeling that
the other two have already

464
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,750
talked to you about her,
am I right?

465
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,875
Yeah.

466
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,541
[KOIZUMI]
Well, how much do you know?

467
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,166
[KYON] Just that Suzumiya
isn't your ordinary person.

468
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,458
[KOIZUMI] Good. That'll make
my side of things easier,

469
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,291
because that's
definitely the case.

470
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,750
How about you start by telling
me who you really are?

471
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,166
Well, as you might've
already guessed,

472
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,875
I'm what's called an ESPer.

473
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,875
It's best we call it
that for now, okay?

474
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,416
To tell you the truth, I wasn't
planning on transferring

475
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,833
into this school so suddenly,

476
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,583
but the circumstances
have changed.

477
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,500
And I have to say that
I really didn't expect

478
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,083
the two of them to join up with
Haruhi Suzumiya so quickly.

479
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,583
Either way, I'm sure we're going
to have the chance to talk more

480
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,375
about all this later. A
picture's worth a thousand words

481
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,208
they say, and I definitely have
something to show you.

482
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,791
But for now, I think I'll give
you the short version.

483
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,625
The organization that
I belong to has

484
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,833
other ESPers besides yours
truly. Actually, this school's

485
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,500
already been secretly
infiltrated

486
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,041
by a bunch of us agents.

487
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,416
And ever since the organization
started up three years ago,

488
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,666
we've been watching
over Miss Suzumiya.

489
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,000
Three years ago.

490
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,083
That's when something
very interesting happened.

491
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,791
That is also when the powers I
have now awakened inside me.

492
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,833
How is Haruhi involved
in whatever happened

493
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,416
three years ago?

494
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,000
[KOIZUMI] You see, the elders
in the organization believe that

495
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,833
this world is sort
of like a dream that

496
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,875
a certain entity is showing us.
Because it's all just a dream,

497
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,166
it'd be quite easy for that
entity to alter our reality.

498
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,625
It could change it, destroy it,
even create a new world.

499
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,875
And we're pretty sure that we
found that entity right here.

500
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,416
You're saying that's Haruhi?

501
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,000
For millennia, people have
referred to such an entity

502
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,666
as "god" or something similar.

503
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,916
[KYON]
Well done, Haruhi.

504
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,916
You got people calling
you a god now.

505
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,916
Just look at this way for a
moment: you got ESPers like me

506
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,875
as well as beings like Mikuru
Asahina and Yuki Nagato

507
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,208
all hangin' around in the
same place. You think it's

508
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,500
simply coincidence that we've
all come together like this?

509
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,083
It's all happening because
Miss Suzumiya wished it.

510
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,291
She wished for it
three years ago.

511
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,250
So are you saying
that Haruhi remodeled

512
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,166
the universe three years ago?

513
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,000
Well, it would be more
accurate to say that

514
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,125
this world started
three years ago.

515
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,208
It's better than saying
it was remodeled.

516
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,666
Anyway, it's just a theory
us ESPers have.

517
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,666
Uh...

518
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,083
Whatever...

519
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,625
And just what do you ESPer
guys wanna do with Haruhi?

520
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,666
[KOIZUMI] Listen, if this
world upsets its god,

521
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,500
it'd be destroyed and recreated
in a blink of an eye.

522
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,500
We wanna prevent that
from happening.

523
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,541
I mean, I kinda like this place.
Warts and all, you know?

524
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,000
[KYON] Why don't you
just walk up to Haruhi

525
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,541
and talk to her about it?

526
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,375
Well, there are some members
in the organization who think

527
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,083
we should do just that, and
others think that we should be

528
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,416
more aggressive in
stimulating her powers.

529
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,250
Either way, most of us
think that this is

530
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,333
definitely not something that
we can easily get involved with.

531
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,708
The bottom line is that
she doesn't yet realize

532
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,333
her true potential.
If that's the case,

533
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,333
the organization feels
it'd be best if she

534
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,708
never finds out about her powers
and lives happily ever after.

535
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,000
You're gonna let
sleeping gods lie, huh?

536
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,583
Good way of putting it.

537
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:43,083
[KYON] You sure you guys aren't
the ones dreaming this world up?

538
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,625
I guess that's also
a possibility.

539
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,333
But as of right here, right now,
we're simply acting on

540
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,708
the worst of worst
case scenarios

541
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,625
that we can come up with.

542
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:52,750
I got an idea.

543
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,416
You're telling me you're
an ESPer, right?

544
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,708
If that's really the case,
then show me your power.

545
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,250
If you can do that,
then I'll believe

546
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,000
everything you've said
to me. For starters,

547
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,625
how 'bout you try heating up
this cup of coffee here?

548
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,666
While that would be
rather convenient,

549
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,208
my powers aren't like that.

550
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:09,625
In fact, most of the time, I
don't have any powers at all.

551
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,916
It's only when all sorts of
conditions are present

552
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,458
that I can actually use them.

553
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,958
And like I said
before, I believe

554
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:18,041
I'll have the opportunity to
show you in the near future.

555
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,916
I do apologize for speaking
for such a long time.

556
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,208
Now, excuse me. I think
that's enough for today.

557
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,708
See ya tomorrow.

558
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,375
[KOIZUMI]
Oh, by the way.

559
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,500
The biggest mystery
is definitely you.

560
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,333
I know it's kind of rude, but I
did some checking up on you.

561
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,708
I hope you don't mind it.

562
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:37,916
I assure you that you...
are an ordinary human.

563
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,958
[MIKURU]
Huh...?

564
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:40,875
[gasps]

565
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,041
[KYON gasps]

566
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,083
Uh! I'm so sorry about that!

567
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,416
Heh...

568
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,125
[KYON] Jeez, you don't
have to do everything

569
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,166
Haruhi tells you to do.

570
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,250
[KYON slurps]

571
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,708
[KYON]
For some reason,

572
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,333
Haruhi never showed up
to the clubroom that day.
