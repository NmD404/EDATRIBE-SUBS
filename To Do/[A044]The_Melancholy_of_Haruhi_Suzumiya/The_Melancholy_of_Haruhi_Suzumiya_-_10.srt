1
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,041
[KYON] Okay, I wanna know what
you've got up your sleeve.

2
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,041
[KOIZUMI] Nothing.
Really, there's nothing.

3
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,625
I know that the
organization doesn't have

4
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,208
anything to do with this,

5
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,125
although, I did
report it to them.

6
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,250
No, we're just going
on a little retreat.

7
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,416
[KYON] A little retreat
that you set up.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,541
I'm just making sure
nothing funny's going on.

9
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,291
[KOIZUMI] Miss Suzumiya
was interested because

10
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,916
it's a deserted island
that's privately owned.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,250
She said it was a closed
circle or something.

12
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,333
[KYON]
Okay, what's a closed circle?

13
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,541
[KOIZUMI]
Like in mysteries,

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,250
it's a situation
where all contact

15
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,500
with the outside world
has been cut off.

16
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,708
[KYON] Like a cabin in the
mountains during a blizzard,

17
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,666
or someone who can't get
back to civilization because

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,666
a typhoon destroyed the bridge.

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,208
[KOIZUMI] Exactly. A person or
group of people get trapped

20
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,833
because of their surroundings.

21
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,916
In other words,
they get closed in.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,083
[KYON] And how does that tie in
to this retreat we're taking?

23
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,125
[KOIZUMI] We're going
to a deserted island.

24
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,833
It's the perfect
close-circle setting

25
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,041
when you think about it.

26
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,916
All we need is a storm
to whip up around us

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,125
and--voila! Much better
than a cabin in a blizzard.

28
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,208
[KYON] You might be wondering
why I'm chatting with Koizumi

29
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,416
on the deck of a ship
in the middle of the ocean.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,416
This all started as I was
recovering from getting

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,166
my final exams back.
In other words: Black Monday.

32
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,041
On that fateful day, the
SOS Brigade had a meeting.

33
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,750
Good, everyone's here.

34
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,125
Now, today's meeting
is super important.

35
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,000
If any of you happened
to show up after me,

36
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,875
I was thinking of making that
person "it" whenever we play

37
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,666
"Kick the Can" forever.

38
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,583
[KYON] Naturally, I had
no idea we were having

39
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,750
an important meeting today.

40
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,291
I've decided during the summer
break, the SOS Brigade's

41
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,250
going on its very first retreat!

42
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,375
Going on a retreat?

43
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,625
[HARUHI]
Yep! Retreat.

44
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,666
[KYON] What good is that
gonna do any of us?

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,458
And Koizumi's already
planned our destination.

46
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,208
Correct. It just so happens
that I have a distant relative

47
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,791
who is incredibly wealthy.

48
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,208
He has so much money, that he
actually bought his very own

49
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,958
deserted island and built
his summer house on it.

50
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,333
In fact, the construction was
finished on it not too long ago.

51
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,458
[marker squeaking]

52
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,583
Koizumi, get ready
to hit the roof!

53
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,125
For your distinguished service
and dedication to the brigade,

54
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,916
I'm promoting you
to the rank of...

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,125
...Deputy Chief!

56
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,083
I gladly accept.

57
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:04,666
[marker squeaking]

58
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,375
No, I'm not jealous...

59
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,166
We'll have a luxurious three
nights and four days on...

60
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,666
...a deserted island! And I'm
sure we're going to find

61
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,291
something very interesting
waiting for us there!

62
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,583
In fact, I've
already figured out

63
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,083
what my role in
this adventure is!

64
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,250
[KOIZUMI] Now then, let's think
about detectives for a minute.

65
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,416
The great detectives in
mystery novels always seem

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,208
to find themselves
getting involved in

67
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,500
one incomprehensible
situation after another.

68
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,000
Why do you think that is?

69
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,750
[KYON] Because if they didn't,
you wouldn't have a story.

70
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,625
[KOIZUMI]
That's right. No story.

71
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,416
Their cases are
entirely fiction.

72
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,666
They exist only in the
surreal world of the story.

73
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,916
Although, maybe it's better
if we don't get too wrapped up

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,791
in a metafictional
conversation just yet.

75
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,458
I mean, after all, Miss Suzumiya
seems pretty gung-ho

76
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,833
about throwing herself
into a world like that.

77
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,041
[KYON]
Come to think of it,

78
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,250
she created the SOS
Brigade to do just that.

79
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,083
If you're in search
of surreal happenings

80
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,625
like the kind in mystery novels,
you need to go someplace

81
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,416
that has the right environment
for that kind of thing.

82
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
When you think about it, that's
how every single one of the

83
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,541
great detectives in fiction
got involved in their cases.

84
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,708
Yeah, but there's no way

85
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,625
we'd just stumble
across a case that easy.

86
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,708
[KOIZUMI] True, nothing
ever happens in reality

87
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,291
like it does in stories.

88
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,625
However, the island we're
heading for right now

89
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,541
is a spot that everyone
in the world would think

90
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,541
the perfect place for a
gruesome murder mystery.

91
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,291
[KYON]
Everyone in the world, huh?

92
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,291
That's a heck of a world
you got there, sport.

93
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,250
Look at it this way:
Wherever a great detective goes,

94
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,208
a strange case is practically
guaranteed to happen.

95
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,708
See, it says if all great
detectives have a kind of

96
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,791
supernatural power that attracts
all their cases to them.

97
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,333
Are you sane?

98
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,791
[KOIZUMI] I always act with
a reasonable amount of sanity.

99
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,041
All that stuff about great
detectives, closed circles

100
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,708
and stuff aren't my personal
views on the subject.

101
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,916
I was merely pointing out the
way Miss Suzumiya was thinking.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,416
In other words, well,
she wants to be one.

103
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,416
[HARUHI]
Hm...

104
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,375
[KOIZUMI]
A great detective.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,708
This one!

106
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,916
So close!

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,166
[KYON] What's close?
We're playing old maid.

108
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,583
Hurry! Next one!

109
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,833
--Too bad.
--[giggles]

110
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,625
Hey, do you wanna
know something?

111
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,041
My big brother Kyon
tried to leave me at home.

112
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,541
[KYON] That's because I
didn't intend to bring you

113
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,166
in the first place.

114
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,458
[grunts]

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,166
[gasps]

116
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,041
[giggles]

117
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,041
[KYON'S SISTER sobs]
No!

118
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,125
Well, we're all happy
you're here now.

119
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,166
Yay!

120
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,750
She won't be any
trouble, I promise.

121
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,333
Mm-hm!

122
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,083
[KYON] Thanks to Miss Asahina's
smile, the kid was off the hook.

123
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,083
[HARUHI] How much longer
till we get there?

124
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,500
[KOIZUMI] It'll take about
six hours by ferry.

125
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,666
Then, an acquaintance will
be waiting to pick us up

126
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,250
when we arrive at the port.

127
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,166
From there, we'll board
a private cruiser

128
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,416
and it'll be another
hour on the water.

129
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,416
A deserted island with a
towering mansion will be

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,333
waiting for us at
the end of our trip.

131
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,000
I've never actually been there,
so it'll be interesting

132
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,750
to see what the
mansion looks like.

133
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,375
I bet it'll be a
really strange building.

134
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,666
Hey, do you know the name of
the architect who built it?

135
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,791
[KYON]
Why do you care?

136
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,166
Never really thought
to ask about that.

137
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,875
[KYON'S LITTLE SISTER]
Yay! I'm out first!

138
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,291
Amazing!

139
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,041
[KOIZUMI] Come to think of it,
I did hear the architect

140
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,333
they commissioned to design
it was somewhat famous.

141
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,416
[KYON]
Perfect. "Somewhat" famous.

142
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,958
For starters, if the
mansion is anything

143
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,041
like what Haruhi's expecting,
I'm sure it's totally weird.

144
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,208
It'll probably look like
something Antoni Gaudi built

145
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,500
after drinking himself stupid

146
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,333
and staying up for
three days straight.

147
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,833
[HARUHI] An island. A mansion.
It's the ideal location

148
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,458
for the SOS Brigade's
summer retreat.

149
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,458
Hm...

150
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,333
Woo-hoo! I'm the
third to get out!

151
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,875
How 'bout the loser has to
buy drinks for everyone else?

152
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,583
I'll take a can of
100% fruit juice, please.

153
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,041
And I want some cola.

154
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,833
And I'll be having
the royal milk tea.

155
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,833
[KYON]
Hey, you haven't won yet, buddy.

156
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,458
Yep, deserted islands are
all about weird happenings.

157
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,166
[KYON] I hope nothing happens,
I hope nothing happens...

158
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,416
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

159
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,875
I'm not too sure about that.

160
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,583
Whether or not anything
weird actually happens...

161
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,750
Hm...

162
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,166
...I'm hoping that
this trip will at least

163
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,166
be a fun one for us all.

164
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,166
Uh.

165
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,375
Ah! Ha-ha!

166
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,458
Hey, Mikuru, Little Sister,
let's go up to the deck!

167
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,791
Maybe we'll see a monster
squid or something.

168
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,208
Sure!

169
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,500
Squid, squid!

170
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,083
[KYON]
If a giant squid shows up,

171
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,250
Nagato'll have to deal with it.

172
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
[KYON]
Oh brother...

173
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,291
[HARUHI] You dork, are you
sleeping? Come on, wake up!

174
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,208
Are you just gonna sleep
through our entire trip?

175
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,916
[MIKURU giggles] I just took
a picture of you waking up.

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,833
And I took a couple
of you sleeping.

177
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,416
You were sound asleep,
weren't you?

178
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,583
[KYON] Huh? Really? Why would
Miss Asahina wanna take pictures

179
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,083
of me sleeping? Maybe she
wants to put a picture of me

180
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,458
in a cute frame, keep it next
to her bed, and every night,

181
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,833
just before she drifts
off to sleep, she--

182
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,208
[HARUHI]
What's with the goofy face?

183
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,583
You might wanna stop 'cause
you look like a moron.

184
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,250
I've temporarily given Mikuru
the responsibility of being

185
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,375
the SOS Brigade's photographer!

186
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,958
It's important to
maintain a record

187
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,291
of the brigade's activities
for future generations.

188
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,541
But I decide what
pictures to take.

189
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,708
Why would anybody care what
I look like when I'm sleeping

190
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,958
or when I'm waking up?

191
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,541
While you're sleeping,
the rest of us are on

192
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,541
an important mission, and
I'm gonna use the pictures

193
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,541
of you loafing as a warning to
future generations. You got it?

194
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,208
For a lowly member to lie around
snoring while his leader

195
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,041
is awake is against
morals, orders,

196
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,208
--and the rules of the brigade.
--[ferry horn blares]

197
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,583
[HARUHI]
We're movin' out, people!

198
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,625
A mysterious island awaits us!

199
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,416
[KYON]
Mysterious island indeed.

200
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,458
[KYON] It's not Panorama Island
or Infant Island, is it?

201
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,041
I hope this island doesn't
float away or start to swim.

202
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,666
That'd ruin my day.

203
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,916
[KOIZUMI]
It'll be all right.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,875
It's just your
typical desert island.

205
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,750
Believe me, you can relax
because there aren't any

206
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,000
monsters or mad
scientist anywhere.

207
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,750
I promise you. In fact,
I'll guarantee it.

208
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,875
[KYON] Guarantee it all you
want, I still don't trust you.

209
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:04,000
[KOIZUMI] Mr. Arakawa! It's been
a while since I last saw you!

210
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,833
[KOIZUMI] Ms. Mori! Thank you
for coming to meet us.

211
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,166
I'm sorry for
troubling you both.

212
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,833
Now, I'd like to
introduce the two of you

213
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,708
to my incomparable
group of friends.

214
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,000
[ARAKAWA] The boat we'll be
taking is right over here.

215
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,250
It should only take us
about a half an hour or so

216
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,041
to reach the master's island.

217
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,250
My apologies in advance
for any inconvenience.

218
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,958
You're kidding!
I don't mind at all!

219
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,708
The more remote
it is, the better!

220
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,250
Another half hour?
Take as long as you need!

221
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,000
A deserted island in
the middle of the ocean's

222
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,875
exactly what I'm looking for!

223
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,708
Hey, you two should be
totally excited about this.

224
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,875
This island's got a mansion

225
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,916
and a suspicious-looking
butler and maid!

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,083
What's with you guys?
I bet you'd maybe find

227
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,000
two islands like this
in Japan, tops.

228
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,125
[KYON]
There aren't even two.

229
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,625
Oh, wow, that's so amazing!

230
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,083
I'm really looking
forward to this.

231
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,583
Wow!

232
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,000
[KYON]
I wonder if Miss Asahina

233
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,375
is trying to pick
up some maidisms

234
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,333
from Ms. Mori. She's looking
at her so intensely.

235
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,250
So does the house on the island
have some kind of cool name?

236
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,791
[MORI]
I'm sorry?

237
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,916
"The House of Black Death,"
"Lyra Manor," "Kouketsu Castle"?

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,041
The mansion has to have
a name like that, right?

239
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,375
No, it doesn't.

240
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,791
Maybe it's got a dungeon
full of funky contraptions

241
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,416
where the architect
died unnaturally,

242
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,666
or a room where,
if you sleep in it,

243
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,041
you die a horrible death, right?

244
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,416
No, there isn't.

245
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,333
[KYON]
Way to kill the mood.

246
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,708
[HARUHI] Hey, does the master
of the house wear a mask

247
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,166
'cause he's
horribly disfigured?

248
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,416
Or maybe there's three
psychotic sister living there.

249
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,833
Or maybe,
everyone's disappeared!

250
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,583
No, not at all.
At least, not yet, anyway.

251
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,333
But there's a good chance
something weird like that'll

252
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,000
happen at some point, right?

253
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,541
There's always a
possibility, yes.

254
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,625
Wow, I think I see it!
Is that the mansion?

255
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,208
[ARAKAWA]
Yes, that would be it.

256
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,750
[HARUHI sighs]
It looks so normal...

257
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,583
Someone's waving at us.

258
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,625
Who's that? He looks too young
to be the master of the house.

259
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,833
He's also been invited
to stay a few days.

260
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,125
That's mister Yutaka Tamaru,
the master's younger brother.

261
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,250
I remember meeting
him once before.

262
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,125
Thanks for the heads up.
You think you could let us know

263
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,666
about these things
ahead of time?

264
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,041
This is the first I've ever
heard about any other guests.

265
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,875
[YUTAKA]
Welcome!

266
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,833
[doorbell rings]

267
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,916
Ah, welcome, everyone.

268
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,250
On behalf of my colleagues,
I would like to thank you

269
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,250
for inviting us to your home.

270
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,125
It's truly an honor to be able
to stay in such a grand estate

271
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:51,083
as yours, sir. We appreciate
your kindness and generosity.

272
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,083
My, oh my. I have to say
you're quite different

273
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,041
from what Itsuki's told me.

274
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,541
Indeed, I think I was expecting
someone who was more direct.

275
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,750
You were?

276
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,541
It's really cool to
meet you, Mr. Master!

277
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,875
But let's cut to the chase;

278
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,833
has anything strange ever
happened in this house?

279
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,416
What about the island? You hear
any story from the locals?

280
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,166
Do they have a spooky
name for the island?

281
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,458
Are they afraid to come near it?

282
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,791
That's the kind of
stuff I'm in to!

283
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,583
[laughs]

284
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,375
Sounds like you have
quite a hobby there.

285
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,458
Although, I've yet to see
anything strange happen here.

286
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,125
Construction on the
house was finished

287
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,208
the day before yesterday.

288
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,458
And as for the island,

289
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,791
I don't recall anyone
saying it was haunted.

290
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,750
After all, it was deserted.

291
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,541
Now, why don't you all come in
and make yourselves at home?

292
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,750
The mansion's western-style, so
feel free to keep your shoes on.

293
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,208
[MIKURU]
Wow, what a lovely room!

294
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,041
It's nice we each get
to have our own room

295
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,791
instead of having to share.

296
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,875
By the way, the doors
do have locks, right?

297
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,583
Of course. And they're
not automatic locks,

298
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,333
so you won't get
stuck in the hall.

299
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,541
However, I would appreciate it
if you didn't lose your keys.

300
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,875
If you want, you can
stay with me in my room.

301
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,750
Only if you behave,
you got that?

302
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,833
Okay...

303
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,375
It's suspicious because
nothing looks suspicious.

304
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,833
And if it looks suspicious
to begin with, well, then what?

305
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,291
[HARUHI] It'd be suspicious,
of course! Geez...

306
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,041
[KYON] In other words,
to her, everything,

307
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,416
including things that aren't
suspicious, are suspicious.

308
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:15,541
[HARUHI]
I got it!

309
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,250
[KYON]
Got what?

310
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,416
The culprit!

311
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,708
What culprit? What're
you talking about?

312
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,000
Look, nothing's
even happened yet.

313
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,458
We just got here, okay?

314
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,458
[HARUHI] My gut says it's
the owner of this house!

315
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,833
Keiichi did it! And the
first victim will be...

316
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,708
...Mikuru!

317
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,083
[KYON] Would you stop
saying stuff like that?

318
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,541
We're their guests!

319
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,666
Can't you just act like a
normal high school student?!

320
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,750
I guess you're right.
Maybe we should go swimming.

321
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,666
We got the whole ocean
to ourselves down there,

322
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,541
so we might as well take
advantage of it, right?

323
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,958
[KYON]
Oh, man...

324
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,958
Although, I'm sure Haruhi
would never seriously wish

325
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,833
for anyone to die, it's scary
to hear her go off like that.

326
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,208
[KYON] This moment is the best
part about this whole trip.

327
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,666
Now this is what having a
retreat by the sea's all about.

328
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,000
Hm?

329
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,416
[KOIZUMI] You know, we all have
different ideas of what's fun.

330
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,333
A person should spend
their time on vacation

331
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,375
doing the things they like.

332
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,416
That's especially true
for Miss Suzumiya.

333
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,958
We need to keep her occupied
so that she doesn't get bored.

334
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,208
And we wouldn't want that
to happen, now, would we?

335
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,750
Kyon, Koizumi! Come on,
stop sittin' around

336
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,458
and get over here!

337
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,750
Heh, heh! I'm coming, too!

338
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,958
Over here! Over here!

339
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,875
[KYON]
Too many beach balls!

340
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,250
[giggles]

341
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,291
Huh?

342
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,916
[cheering]

343
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,041
[ALL sighing]

344
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,083
[KYON'S LITTLE SISTER]
That was so much fun today.

345
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,916
Wow, this is so delicious!
Who made all this?

346
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,333
I'm glad you like it.
The butler, Arakawa,

347
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,166
is also the head
chef around here.

348
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,000
I'd like to
personally thank him.

349
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,000
Please call him in
when he's done.

350
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,125
[KYON'S LITTLE SISTER]
Can I have some of that?

351
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,375
Wow, she sure eats a lot.

352
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,666
[MORI] Would you like
something to drink?

353
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,041
[MIKURU]
What's wrong?

354
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,250
[KYON'S LITTLE SISTER]
I don't like bell peppers...

355
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,083
If you wanna grow up
to be like Miss Asahina,

356
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,583
then you're gonna
have to eat them.

357
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,291
[KYON] It's not often
we get to eat this good.

358
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,500
[chuckles]

359
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,791
Wow! I can't believe
this is free!

360
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,250
I just wish the school cafeteria
had a spread like this!

361
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,041
It'd be like heaven!

362
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,333
[ALL laughing]

363
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,250
[KYON screams]

364
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,625
--[HARUHI cackles]
--[KYON] So after living it up,

365
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,750
courtesy of Mr.
Tamaru's hospitality,

366
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,250
we were able to get
through the first day

367
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,625
without anything terribly
strange happening.

368
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,500
Now, if the story ended there,
it would've been perfect.

369
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,416
No such luck, though...

370
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,666
[KYON]
The next morning, as if on cue,

371
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,916
a huge storm rolled in.

372
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,708
The master's not what
you'd call a morning person,

373
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,125
and he tends to be...
difficult when he wakes up.

374
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,916
Please excuse his absence
at the table in the mornings,

375
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,916
and I do appreciate your
understanding in the matter.

376
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,375
Great, that's just our luck.

377
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,958
A typhoon hits as we're
starting our vacation.

378
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,125
[KOIZUMI] The storm seems
to be moving fairly quickly.

379
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,166
Things'll be back to normal
in a couple days.

380
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,958
You'll see. It'll disappear
as quickly as it appeared.

381
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,208
[KYON] It's strange, though. I
don't remember hearing anything

382
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,958
about a typhoon yesterday.

383
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,541
[KYON] Who's head did
this massive storm

384
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,166
come creeping out of?

385
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,250
Okay, what we've got here
is a deserted island

386
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,666
in the middle of a storm.

387
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,791
This is a rare opportunity.

388
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,250
We might even experience
something weird.

389
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:46,875
Awesome...

390
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,833
[MIKURU whimpers]

391
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,291
[KYON] Taking the boats out
that day was not an option.

392
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,500
The waves were just too big.

393
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,333
Now, thanks to Haruhi's wish,

394
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,500
we found ourselves the
unwilling guests trapped

395
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,166
on a spooky deserted island.

396
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,375
A closed circle...? No way...

397
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,875
[KYON]
Since we couldn't go outside,

398
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,291
we decided to spend the day

399
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,000
in the game room which was
in the mansion's basement.

400
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,625
Here's my Super Ultra
Miracle Eccentric Serve!

401
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,750
[KYON'S LITTLE SISTER]
Hey, whatcha readin'?

402
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,916
Is it good? Huh?

403
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,458
[KYON growls]

404
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,666
I call... Reach!

405
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,583
Wrong! My hand's
wroth 10,000 points.

406
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,000
That is definitely a
full hand, Miss Suzumiya.

407
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,625
[KYON] Good we're not
playing for money.

408
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,083
I'm glad to see you're all
having a good time here.

409
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,875
If you guys don't mind,
can I sit in for a hand?

410
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,500
Please.

411
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,500
What's it mean when
you pitch in a piece?

412
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,958
Please excuse me, everybody.
I'm afraid I have some work

413
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,166
that needs to get done.

414
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,875
Enjoy yourselves.

415
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,208
Keiichi and Yutaka Tamaru.
Mr. Arakawa and Ms. Mori.

416
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,541
They seem normal

417
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,625
even though they're
acquaintances of Koizumi's.

418
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,958
We'll meet a couple
more characters

419
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,708
before something
strange can happen.

420
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,708
I call Reach!

421
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,833
[ALL]
Who is the king?

422
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,375
I am the king!

423
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,458
Okay, number 2! You have to
turn around, look back at us,

424
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,500
and say, "I love you!"

425
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,583
Who has number 2?

426
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,750
I love you.

427
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,958
[growls] No, not
like that, Yuki!

428
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,750
You have to say it with
more feeling, all right?!

429
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,083
I love you.

430
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,625
Go on, Kyon.
Show her how to do it.

431
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,041
Why do I have to?

432
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,666
It doesn't matter why.
It's the king's orders, okay?!

433
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,208
--I love--
--[HARUHI] Psyche!

434
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,625
[KYON]
Selfish king...

435
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,708
That's typical Haruhi for you.

436
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,416
I thought I'd be able
to skip the rest of this

437
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,041
chapter of adolescence,
with little more than a laugh.

438
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,125
But that's not how
the dealer cut the deck.

439
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,000
Now, I don't know
who this "dealer" is,

440
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,416
or what kind of deck they
were cutting for that matter,

441
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,875
but if I knew who
this dealer was,

442
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,208
I'd make sure they'd never
shuffle cards or cut a deck

443
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,083
for the rest of the year.

444
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,333
Hey, Haruhi-- Ah!

445
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,041
[KYON grunts]

446
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,541
What a wimp!

447
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,166
You should expect pillow fights
when you're on a retreat!

448
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,000
[KYON] Where does that
girl get her energy?

449
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,250
She was up all night.

450
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,958
[KOIZUMI]
Pillow fights, huh?

451
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,416
No wonder Miss Suzumiya was
going through all the rooms.

452
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,833
It looks like she went around
and confiscated all the pillows

453
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,416
on the second floor.

454
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,125
[KYON] She's stealing all of the
weapons before the battle, huh?

455
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,583
Mr. Arakawa, is there
anything wrong?

456
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,583
I sent Mori up to Mr. Yutaka's
room a while ago.

457
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,291
When she came back down, she
told me that he wasn't there.

458
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,250
He isn't in the house?

459
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,458
His bed hadn't been slept in,
and we looked for him

460
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,791
in the usual places, but I'm
afraid he's nowhere to be found.

461
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,791
Have you gone in Mr. Keiichi's
room and checked with him?

462
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,333
[ARAKAWA] Yes. Well, we
tried calling the phone in

463
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,083
the master's bedroom,
but there was no answer.

464
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,916
[HARUHI] What's that? Did you
say that Mr. Yutaka's missing

465
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,125
and Mr. Keiichi isn't
answering his phone?

466
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,708
If asked to summarize, yes,
that is exactly what I said.

467
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,750
[KOIZUMI] We should probably
check Mr. Keiichi's room.

468
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,583
Mr. Arakawa, do you have a key?

469
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,291
The master's chambers are
different from the other rooms.

470
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,416
Unfortunately, he's the only
one with the keys to it.

471
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,375
It's a precaution. He brings
work-related documents

472
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,916
to the island.

473
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,750
[KOIZUMI] We'd better go up
to his room and try knocking.

474
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,458
Come on, Kyon. I've got
a bad feeling about this.

475
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,458
Yuki, Mikuru, let's go, guys.

476
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,250
Stay here, Little Sister,
we'll be right back.

477
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,791
[HARUHI]
Huh...?

478
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:49,875
Huh?

479
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,708
[KOIZUMI]
Mr. Keiichi! Mr. Keiichi!

480
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,666
If you're here, answer us!

481
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,958
No good, it's locked.

482
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,750
I don't think we have a choice.
We're going to have to

483
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,750
break the door down
to get in this room.

484
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,666
We can't waste any more time
talking, he might be in trouble.

485
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,333
All right.

486
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,708
Very good, sir.

487
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,125
[grunting]

488
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,500
[KYON]
Breaking doors like this only

489
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,500
happens in the movies, right?

490
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,416
[yelling]

491
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,791
[groans]

492
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,916
[gasps]

493
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,958
[KYON] Impossible...
You're joking, right...?
