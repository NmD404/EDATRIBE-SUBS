1
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,416
[KYON] During final exams,
Haruhi, who suffered a bout

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,541
of melancholy during
the Star Festival,

3
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,166
had recovered from the
aforementioned melancholy

4
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,291
enough to go back to doing
whatever she wanted to do.

5
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,916
However, as an adverse reaction
to her emotional improvement,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,958
the blue-colored baton
of depression had been

7
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,208
handed off to me.

8
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,375
[KYON sighs]

9
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,791
[KYON] Haruhi always
seemed to have time

10
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,625
left over during an exam,
and today was no exception

11
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,708
About 30 minutes before pencils
down, she was sound asleep

12
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,500
in the desk behind me.

13
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:59,041
Annoying. Oh, it's annoying.
It's so annoying.

14
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:30,833
[KYON]
According to Haruhi,

15
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,083
there is no such
thing as a break

16
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,666
for the SOS Brigade.

17
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,791
Even during exam time, when all
the other clubs went on hiatus,

18
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,750
this mysterious brigade,
which wasn't really even a club,

19
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,958
was open every day
without a holiday.

20
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,333
Kinda like a convenient store...

21
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,875
[HARUHI]
Hey, come take a look at this.

22
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,000
[KYON]
What is it?

23
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,416
You can't tell what it is?

24
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,875
I've no idea.
I don't get it at all.

25
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,500
It's the logo for
the SOS Brigade.

26
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,250
A logo? That's funny, 'cause
to me, it looks more like

27
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,208
a drunken tapeworm
wrapped around a tube.

28
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,250
Well, take a closer look at it!

29
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:11,250
See, it says "SOS Brigade"
right there in the middle!

30
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,458
[KYON] Now that she pointed it
out, I can't really say for sure

31
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,666
whether I can or can't
see it, but I wouldn't

32
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,208
disagree with anybody if
they said it was or wasn't.

33
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,875
And how many negatives did
I just use in that sentence?

34
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,083
If somebody's got time,
total it up for me.

35
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,791
You're the one that's
got the most free time.

36
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,333
Anyway, I was thinking
of putting this thing

37
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,958
on the homepage of the
SOS Brigade website.

38
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,208
[KYON]
You mean, this pathetic website

39
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,833
that only has a homepage?

40
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:36,250
This website that you made isn't
getting us any visitors at all.

41
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,708
It's so frustrating.

42
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,958
There's nothing on here
that spices it up.

43
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,833
It's all because
you got in my way.

44
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,833
We'd've had a ton of hits
if you'd let me post

45
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,916
these erotic pics of Mikuru.
So I got to thinkin',

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,625
I should paste a cool logo or
symbol for the SOS Brigade

47
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,041
on the homepage.

48
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,083
[KYON] Just get this stupid
excuse for a website

49
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,583
off the net already.

50
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,041
The access counter hasn't
even reached three digits yet,

51
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:01,041
and 90% of those hits have been
you checking the site for hits.

52
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,000
Write a blog on
there or something.

53
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,500
Isn't it your job
to keep a record

54
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,833
of the brigade's activities?

55
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,375
Ugh, too much of a hassle.

56
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,583
[KYON]
Well, it's a hassle for me, too.

57
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,333
Okay, Kyon, your job for
today is to make this logo

58
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,416
show up on the homepage
of the website.

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,083
[KYON]
Why don't you do it yourself?

60
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,916
I'm the brigade leader! It's
the job of the brigade leader

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,541
to give the orders!
Besides, if I did everything,

62
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,250
there'd be nothing left for you
guys to do, isn't that right?

63
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,375
I'm always spelling this stuff
out for you, why don't you

64
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,666
use your head? How do you
expect to improve yourself

65
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,166
if you only do what you're told?

66
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,875
There you go, talking
in circles again.

67
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,625
Are you telling me to do it
or not to do it? Which is it?

68
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,375
[HARUHI]
Enough! Get on it!

69
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,583
[sighs]

70
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,833
[KYON] Reluctantly, I shrunk the
master painter Haruhi's tapeworm

71
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,791
into an appropriate size. Then,
I pasted it, still reluctantly,

72
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,708
into the file, and uploaded it.

73
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,250
Starting tomorrow and lasting
until summer vacation,

74
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,375
we get to have our exam break.

75
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:58,166
It's also the time when my
teacher's mark my answers wrong.

76
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,875
Damn, that's annoying.

77
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,458
Guess I'll go and ogle
Miss Asahina for some comfort.

78
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,916
I knocked on the door, fully
expecting Miss Asahina's voice

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,833
to call out a wispy
"Yes" in reply.

80
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,000
--[knocks]
--[HARUHI] Come in.

81
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,291
[KYON]
You're the only one here?

82
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,125
Yuki's here, too.

83
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,000
[KYON] She's more like
an accessory to the room,

84
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,041
so you can't really
count her as a member.

85
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,833
I mean, officially, she's a
member of the Literary Club,

86
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,000
so I guess I should
correct myself.

87
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,250
You and Nagato are
the only ones here?

88
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,708
[HARUHI] You wanna file
a complaint about it?

89
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,875
[KYON] If I wrote down every
complaint I had about you,

90
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:36,083
it would fill up an entire sheet
of A4-size paper, both sides.

91
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,583
When you knocked on
the door just now,

92
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,166
I thought for sure we were
going to have a visitor today.

93
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,750
[KYON] Just being careful. I
don't wanna accidentally walk in

94
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,083
while Miss Asahina's changing.

95
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,083
[KYON] That lovely, innocent
young girl just can't seem

96
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,041
to figure out how
to lock a door.

97
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,125
So now, what's all
this about a visitor?

98
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,958
Don't tell me you
don't remember?

99
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,166
[KYON] I hope she isn't
gonna say anything

100
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,583
about the Star Festival
three years ago.

101
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,416
Oh, come on, it's
something you did,

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,416
and without getting
my permission first.

103
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,166
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

104
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,583
Those posters you put up
all over the school.

105
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,458
Right, those things.

106
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,041
[KYON]
Those posters were my attempt

107
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,333
at getting the student council
to keep the SOS Brigade alive

108
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,541
as a sort of jack-of-all-
-trades counseling thing.

109
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,291
I even drew them all
and stuck them up

110
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,833
on every bulletin board
in the school.

111
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,500
[HARUHI]
Anyway, take a look at this.

112
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,416
Something weird's
happening here.

113
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,041
Maybe it's just the
computer acting up.

114
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,875
[KYON] The SOS Brigade's logo
was warped, as if somebody used

115
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,458
a gathering filter on it.

116
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,083
On top of that, the counter
and title were gone.

117
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,208
It was subtle, but it was
different from the page I made.

118
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,666
It looks like the file on
the server has been corrupted.

119
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,541
So do you know how long
it's been like this?

120
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,000
No, it was like that
when I checked it today.

121
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,125
Who do I complain to about this?

122
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,500
[KYON] It isn't worth
filing a complaint.

123
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,541
[KYON]
Hm?

124
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,833
[KYON growls]

125
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,166
It's weird. Wait, I know,
it's hackers or crackers

126
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,791
or whatever they're called.

127
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,416
No way. It's probably
just an error.

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,958
It's so irritating. I can't
believe someone would make

129
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,750
a cyber terrorist attack
on the SOS Brigade!

130
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,208
Oh, when I find out who's
doing this, I'll make 'em do

131
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,958
30 days of community
service, no trial!

132
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,333
[knocking]

133
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,958
Come in.

134
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,958
Well, this is unusual. Miss
Asahina hasn't shown up yet?

135
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,750
[HARUHI] The juniors have more
exams to take, don't they?

136
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,333
[KYON] Hey, everyone, just
hurry up and go home already.

137
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,958
I mean, of all places,
why do you wanna meet here?

138
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,166
Oh, and Haruhi, is there
any special reason

139
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,500
you're not saying anything
about Koizumi knocking?

140
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,250
[KYON] I'm looking forward
to Miss Asahina's tea.

141
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,416
[KYON grunting]

142
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,541
[HARUHI]
That's not it! No, to the right!

143
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,750
[KYON] For a while, I found
myself stuck there catering

144
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,791
to Haruhi's impossible orders.

145
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,250
--[knocking]
--That's not it!

146
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,250
--[HARUHI] Come in.
--[KYON] At last,

147
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,666
the sound of my salvation.

148
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,083
[MIKURU]
Uh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

149
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,416
I had exams until fourth period.

150
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,958
[KYON] With a humble apology,
she appeared, no, descended.

151
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,000
The angel of the
club, Miss Asahina.

152
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,583
Well, I, um... Let's see...

153
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,375
I, um, I sort of brought
a visitor with me.

154
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,541
[KYON] Unbelievable!
I never thought anyone

155
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,916
would come to us for counseling!

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,125
But somehow has,
and there she is!

157
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,041
Her name was Emiri Kimidori,
a junior who seemed

158
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,958
very quiet and pure.

159
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,041
So, lemme get this straight.
You want us, the SOS Brigade,

160
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,041
to go and search for
your missing boyfriend?

161
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,083
Yes...

162
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,666
Hm...

163
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,666
Ah.

164
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,833
[sighs]

165
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,500
[KYON] Oh, great.
It seems that she thinks

166
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,000
the purpose of the
SOS Brigade really is to be

167
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,791
a mobile task force or jack-
-of-all-trades counseling-thing.

168
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,958
So, what exactly
is troubling you?

169
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:57,291
He hasn't been in school
for the longest time.

170
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,750
Have you tried calling him?

171
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,583
He doesn't answer his
cell or his home phone.

172
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,166
I even went to his house,
but he wasn't there.

173
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,625
[HARUHI]
Hm...

174
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,583
What about your
boyfriend's family?

175
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,000
As far as I know,
he lives alone.

176
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,458
A while ago, I remember hearing
they lived and worked overseas,

177
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,083
but I don't have any of
their contact information.

178
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,375
Really? Well, are his
parents in Canada?

179
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,208
No, I believe they live
somewhere in Honduras.

180
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,416
Oh-ho, yes, Honduras! Indeed!

181
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,833
[KYON] What's with this "Indeed"
stuff? I doubt she even knows

182
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,500
where Honduras is.

183
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,375
Let's see, somewhere
below Mexico, right?

184
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,583
That night when I went to see
him, the house was pitch-black.

185
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,208
I'm so worried.

186
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,250
Yeah, I can totally understand
how you're feeling about this.

187
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,541
[KYON]
Liar. You don't understand

188
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,875
the feeling of being in love.

189
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,125
Anyway, I'm surprised you
came to the SOS Brigade

190
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,625
with this mystery.
So why'd you come to us?

191
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,250
My boyfriend used to talk
about the SOS Brigade.

192
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,291
That's why I'm here.

193
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,416
Oh? So who is this boyfriend?

194
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,666
--Ya--
--[cat meows]

195
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,083
is his name.

196
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,208
Don't know him, who's he?

197
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,750
[HARUHI growls]

198
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,458
[KYON]
Hm?

199
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,166
[MIKURU]
Hm?

200
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,333
To tell you the truth,

201
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,666
he's the president
of the Computer Club.

202
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,833
[KYON]
Hm...

203
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,500
[gasps]

204
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,666
[KYON]
The guy Haruhi took pictures of

205
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,500
as he sexually
harassed Miss Asahina!

206
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,166
The guy Haruhi
blackmailed so she could

207
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,250
take his top-of-
-the-line computer.

208
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,125
The poor guy who was forced
to hook the computer up

209
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,708
with tears in his eyes.

210
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,458
I totally forgot about him.

211
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:30,250
Okay, I got it. Don't worry,
we'll do something about this.

212
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,583
Miss Kimidori,
today's your lucky day!

213
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,000
Since you're the SOS
Brigade's first client,

214
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,458
I'll solve the case of your
mystery boyfriend for free!

215
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,791
[KYON] You planned on
charging money for this?

216
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,125
Hey.

217
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,625
Taking her case was the easy
part, but what're you gonna do

218
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,666
if you can't solve it?

219
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,833
We'll solve it. I'm sure
the Computer Club chief's

220
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,875
suffering from the May
Melancholies, even if it's

221
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,208
a couple months late.

222
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,041
We'll just stroll into
his house, grab him,

223
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,666
slap him around a little,
and drag him outta there.

224
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,125
[KYON] I think she's serious
about that. But if he's got

225
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,916
a girlfriend like Miss Kimidori,
why's that guy hiding out

226
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,500
in the Computer Club?

227
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,791
Are you and Miss Kimidori
friends or something?

228
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,791
[MIKURU] Mm-mm. I've never
spoken to her before today.

229
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,041
[KYON]
If she needed help,

230
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,250
why didn't she go to a
teacher or the police?

231
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,125
No, maybe she did, but they
didn't take her seriously.

232
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,541
That's why she came to
the SOS Brigade for help.

233
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,625
Yeah, that's what's
going on here.

234
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,791
Looks like Haruhi's using
this as an opportunity

235
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,625
to attract bigger cases.

236
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,333
Bet she can think she
can solve those, too.

237
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,541
We could always pass out flyers

238
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,916
at the front gate
like we did last time.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,208
[KYON] The president
of the Computer Club

240
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,791
lived in a one-room condo.

241
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,166
The building wasn't the best,
but it wasn't the worst.

242
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,958
It was your typical
three-and-a-half story deal,

243
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,416
nothing special.

244
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,791
[HARUHI]
Let's do it.

245
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,166
[HARUHI]
Well, this is the place.

246
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,166
[HARUHI] But how're we
gonna get in there?

247
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,166
[doorbell rings]

248
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,958
[KYON]
Next time, try that first.

249
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,333
How 'bout if we go up on
the balcony in the back?

250
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,166
Maybe we can get in if we
break the glass or something!

251
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,583
[KYON sighs]

252
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,125
[KYON] The room's on the
third floor, and it's not like

253
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,958
we're a gang of teenage burglars
trying to rob the place.

254
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,875
I don't want a
criminal record yet.

255
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,333
Yeah, okay. Then let's go
down to the manager's office

256
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,791
and borrow the key.

257
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,291
We'll just tell the manager
that we're friends of his

258
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,541
who are worried about him.

259
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,541
[KYON] That excuse is
getting a little old.

260
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,875
[lock clicks]

261
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,250
[KYON] With eyes like liquid
helium, she stared back at me.

262
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,625
You've gotta be kidding.

263
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,625
I didn't realize
it was open. Whatever.

264
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,458
Guess we might as well go in.

265
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,916
He's probably hiding under
the bed or something.

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,916
Come on, let's drag
his butt outta there.

267
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,291
[KYON] She doesn't even feel
guilty for swiping that computer

268
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,333
right out of his hands.

269
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,041
Well, that's strange.
I totally thought we'd find him

270
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,916
in a corner of the room
curled up in a ball.

271
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,666
Kyon, do you know where
someone with a case

272
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,375
of the May Melancholies
in July might scurry off to?

273
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,958
[KYON] He's either traveling
in Central or South America,

274
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,041
or he really doesn't
wanna be found.

275
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,666
We should leave now.

276
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,791
[KYON] That's the first
time she's spoken today.

277
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,375
Miss Nagato's right,
we need to go.

278
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,000
[KYON] Don't sound so serious,
don't breathe on me,

279
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,791
you're too close, and
you're freakin' me out.

280
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,916
I'm feeling a little
strange in here.

281
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,250
It's a sensation

282
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,416
--[HARUHI] Awesome! 
--I'm all too familiar with,

283
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,958
--Warabi Mochi!
--so we should get going.

284
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,750
It expired three days ago,
but I'm sure they're still good.

285
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,375
Come on, let's eat!

286
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,333
--Say "ah," Mikuru!
--No, don't!

287
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,833
Ah...

288
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,000
Ah...

289
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,791
What do you mean "familiar"?

290
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,708
It's a familiar scent. This room
has the same kind of smell

291
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,083
as closed space.

292
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,166
[KYON]
Come to think of it,

293
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,833
you're a real life
ESPer, aren't you?

294
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,541
There's another
dimensional layer.

295
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,500
As we stand here,
it's beginning to shift.

296
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,041
[KYON]
Okay, looks like it'd be best

297
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,375
if we all got the
hell out of here.

298
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,333
[MIKURU whimpers]

299
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,583
I am so hungry.

300
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,500
That's it for today. Dismissed!

301
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,458
[KYON]
Hey, wait! What about the case?

302
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,458
Don't worry,
we'll figure it out.

303
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,333
[HARUHI]
See ya!

304
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,958
[KYON]
She's already bored.

305
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,958
Um, is anything the matter?
Why did you want us to come

306
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,041
back here without
telling Miss Suzumiya?

307
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,666
[KYON] Those two seem to
think there's something fishy

308
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,541
with that room.
Isn't that right?

309
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:22,125
Yes. I'm sure we'll find out
once we get back inside.

310
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,041
Right, Miss Nagato?

311
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,208
[NAGATO] There is a
localized non-corrosive

312
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,875
alternate space in this room.

313
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,291
It's happening independently
in limited mode.

314
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,833
[KYON]
Wow, it almost sounds like

315
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,041
you're just flipping through

316
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,708
a dictionary, pulling
out words at random.

317
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,375
She's saying that
there's something similar

318
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,958
to closed space in here.

319
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,666
It's not the same as the ones
created by Miss Suzumiya.

320
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,708
The one in this
room smells different.

321
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,083
Do you think the disappearance
of the Computer Club President

322
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,041
is related to this space?

323
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,916
Yes.

324
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,916
[gasps]

325
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,625
[indecipherable muttering]

326
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,500
[KYON]
I should've told her to wait.

327
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,291
[gasps]

328
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,208
[KYON]
I couldn't enjoy the feeling

329
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,708
of Mikuru clutching my arm

330
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,500
because I was trying really hard
to figure out where I was.

331
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,583
I remember I was standing
in a small, one-room condo

332
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,166
a second ago, not
this creepy place.

333
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,958
I have analyzed the entry code.
It overlaps standard space.

334
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,458
It is merely out of phase.

335
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,791
[KOIZUMI] This doesn't seem
to be closed space, though.

336
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,750
It's slightly different. In one
segment of this spatial data,

337
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,208
there is junk information
that seems to have originated

338
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,041
with Haruhi Suzumiya.

339
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,541
[KOIZUMI]
Can you tell how much?

340
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,416
Insignificant levels. She only
triggered this situation.

341
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,291
I see, so that's what happened.

342
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,583
[KYON] Can Miss Asahina and I
join this conversation?

343
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,375
So the president of the Computer
Club is somewhere in here?

344
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,791
[KOIZUMI]
It seems that way.

345
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,041
This alternate space
created itself in his room,

346
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,333
and for some reason,
he became trapped within it.

347
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,000
[KYON]
Then where is he?

348
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,875
Wait!

349
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,875
Do you think you can tell me
what you're gonna do first?

350
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,625
I just wanna be
ready for it, okay?

351
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,041
Nothing.

352
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,250
There it is.

353
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,125
[KYON gasps]

354
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,291
[KYON]
What is that?!

355
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,333
I can definitely
feel its animosity.

356
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,541
[KYON] Those two have ways
of defending themselves,

357
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,125
but Miss Asahina and I
don't even stand a chance!

358
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,583
You wouldn't happen to have...
laser guns or anything?

359
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,916
We're forbidden to carry
firearms because it's dangerous.

360
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,541
[KYON]
Sure, I can understand that.

361
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,791
They wouldn't do her any good
anyway. Besides, she might

362
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,541
accidentally leave it
on the train or something.

363
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,750
Huh...? [gasps]

364
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,916
[KYON] Do you guys know
what camel crickets look like?

365
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,833
For those of you who don't,
I'd like to show you what

366
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,708
I'm looking at right now.

367
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,875
[KYON]
What is this?

368
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,041
[KOIZUMI]
A camel cricket.

369
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,916
[KYON]
Got it. Thanks, Captain Obvious.

370
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,791
[NAGATO] It's the creator
of this dimension.

371
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,833
[KYON]
No way. Did Haruhi do this, too?

372
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,416
[NAGATO] The cause is different,
but she was the catalyst.

373
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,458
[KYON]
Okay, you can move now.

374
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,416
Looks like I can still
access my powers in here.

375
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,083
At least, partially.

376
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,875
But it's only a tenth of
what I usually work with.

377
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,833
Maybe it was determined
that this was all the power

378
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,041
I needed.

379
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,416
[KYON] Yeah, great. Uh,
Nagato, what is that insect

380
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,458
and where is the
Computer Club guy?

381
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,500
It is a data lifeform.
It is currently using the

382
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,000
male student's brain to increase
its probability of survival.

383
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,500
[gasps] Are you saying the
president's inside that thing?

384
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,041
Exactly.

385
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,916
I see... This camel cricket is
a manifestation of the thing

386
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,625
the president fears the most.

387
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,500
If we defeat it, we can shut
down this alternate space.

388
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,666
Am I mistaken?

389
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,000
No mistakes.

390
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,000
Then this should
be relatively easy.

391
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,791
[KYON] Miss Asahina's giving me
a workout. I'm so gonna lose it.

392
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,875
And she's taken away my
mobility so I can't escape.

393
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,541
Don't worry, it'll be over soon.

394
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,916
Just hurry up and do it.

395
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,208
Roger that.

396
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,666
[KOIZUMI grunts]

397
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,333
[KOIZUMI]
Fumoffu!

398
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:52,833
[KOIZUMI shouts]

399
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,166
Pausing integral seconds
between display.

400
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,791
[KYON]
A force field?!

401
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,583
[KOIZUMI]
Second Wave!

402
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,333
Did that work?

403
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,291
I guess it didn't work.

404
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,250
Is it over now?

405
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,583
[KYON, MIKURU sigh]

406
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,208
[KYON]
Looks like he's still alive.

407
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,791
I suddenly found myself standing
in that one-room condo again.

408
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,875
[NAGATO] It arrived
280 million years ago.

409
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,500
When "it" landed on this planet,

410
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,833
"it" could not find the
necessary means to survive here.

411
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,125
To preserve itself,
"it" went into hibernation.

412
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,416
When humans created
the computer network,

413
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,666
"it" shifted into a
half-wakened state.

414
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,375
Then, an explosion of
unmeasured amounts of data

415
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,708
from a parallel world
caused "it" to fully wake.

416
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,958
[KYON] That explosion of
data from a parallel world

417
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,208
turned out to be the SOS Brigade
logo that Haruhi drew.

418
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,791
That was the trigger.

419
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,125
[NAGATO] In Earth measurements,
this emblem contains

420
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,500
approximately 436
petabytes of data.

421
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,458
[KYON] No way! That thing
isn't more than 100 kilobytes!

422
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,958
[KOIZUMI]
A symbol she happens to draw

423
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,791
turns out to be
something amazing.

424
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,833
Only Miss Suzumiya
could do that.

425
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,875
[KYON] Now I was honestly
starting to get scared.

426
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,083
It can't just be coincidence.

427
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,583
[KYON]
The SOS Brigade is formed

428
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,083
Miss Asahina joins because
she's the perfect mascot.

429
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,375
Koizumi joins because
he's a transfer student.

430
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,041
Nagato joins because she's
been there from the start.

431
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,583
On top of that, Miss Asahina
came from the future,

432
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,083
and Nagato is
sort of... alien-ish.

433
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,083
If all of this really
was Haruhi's doing,

434
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,208
it's just too good to be true.

435
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,458
[KYON] Koizumi says that it's
all because Haruhi wished it,

436
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,958
but I don't believe that.

437
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,375
Look, I'm just an ordinary guy.

438
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,833
And, if it's really true that
everything Haruhi does is

439
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,958
significant in some way,
why did she choose me to become

440
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,875
a member of the SOS Brigade?

441
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,583
Is it because I've got
latent super-crazy powers,

442
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,791
or do I have a secret identity
that no one's told me about?

443
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,041
What in the hell am I, anyway?

444
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,916
[KYON] I know, I'm the
conscious of the SOS Brigade.

445
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,208
I'm here because I have to stop

446
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,458
Haruhi's illegal
club activities.

447
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,916
It's my job to make her have
a normal high school life.

448
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,416
All right, you gotta tell me
what that camel cricket was.

449
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,750
A data lifeform.

450
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,625
Any relation to
your entity thingy?

451
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,583
A similar source. The other
lifeform evolved differently

452
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,208
and its race perished.

453
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,500
[KYON] Or so you thought, until
you found a survivor right here.

454
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,416
Why Earth of all places?

455
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,083
It would've been nice if
it decided to hibernate

456
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,916
on Neptune or something.

457
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,583
To think the internet was the
nursery for an evil overlord-y

458
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,125
thing like that.

459
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,750
[KYON]
Hang on a second.

460
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,583
I just realized, nothing
happened in this room

461
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,708
when Haruhi finished
drawing the logo

462
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,250
And when she showed it to me,
nothing happened then either.

463
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,125
For a while now, this room has
been in an alternate dimension.

464
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,708
Elements and force fields
collide with one another here,

465
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,791
cancelling each other out and
creating a sort of saturation.

466
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,416
But there's no room left for
anything else to blend in.

467
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,625
So, while I wasn't looking,
this room was turned into

468
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,458
an ominous den of weirdness?

469
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,458
Not to worry, I think
it's harmless. Probably...

470
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,291
Oh brother. I really don't
feel like going insane

471
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,000
or looking for a rope
to hang myself with

472
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,000
just because this
place is so strange.

473
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,416
I'm doing my best to make
sure that doesn't happen.

474
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,541
Well, I hope and pray that this
kind of stuff isn't happening

475
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,125
because you're doing your best.

476
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,125
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

477
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,458
[KYON gasps]

478
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,166
[KYON] There's almost
30,000 hits on this thing!

479
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,708
The data lifeform reproduces
itself by installing

480
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,125
hyperlinks at various locations.
It then copies information

481
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,000
about itself into the brains
of humans who see the emblem

482
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,875
creating more closed space.

483
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,375
[KYON] However, since the
data's become corrupt,

484
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,541
the humans who
saw it most likely

485
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,416
did not suffer a
negative effect.

486
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,375
According to Nagato, there
were eight other idiots

487
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,666
who saw the logo, five of which
were North High students.

488
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,666
Guess this means we have
to go rescue them, too.

489
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,000
[whistle blows]

490
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,958
[COACH] All right, dammit!
Hustle up, take a knee!

491
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,083
[KYON] If you look at it long
enough, the thing actually says

492
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,208
"ZOZ Brigade."

493
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:24,041
Nagato redid the logo and I
stuck it back onto the page.

494
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,000
The Computer Club guy
came back today.

495
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,250
[HARUHI]
Oh, really?

496
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,166
It was either a case
of the May Melancholies

497
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,958
or an argument with
his girlfriend.

498
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,500
Hey, isn't it amazing though?

499
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,000
Our website's gotten
30,000 hits!

500
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:38,875
It's like people know a good
thing when they see it.

501
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,333
[KYON]
I wonder...

502
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,958
Could it be that she's the
one who destroyed the data?

503
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,666
And the girl who came
to us, Miss Kimidori,

504
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,791
I asked the Computer Club
chief, and he said

505
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,791
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

506
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,333
Nagato's always been
in the middle of this

507
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,625
elaborate scenario, hasn't she?

508
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,583
[KYON] It wouldn't surprise me
at all if you told me this

509
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,166
omnipotent alien terminal
had done something to

510
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,625
Miss Kimidori, making her
come to us with a case.

511
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,750
Maybe sending a fake
client to us was her way

512
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,833
of getting rid of Haruhi's
boredom for a little while.

513
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,166
I wonder if she's been
doing this the whole time.

514
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,083
Keeping the weirder things
at bay and not saying

515
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,750
anything to anyone.
Quietly, from the shadows...

516
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,500
[KYON] Or maybe... getting
involved with this case

517
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,833
was something that
Nagato wished for.

518
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,750
An android made by aliens
living in an empty room

519
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,833
for years on end.

520
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:31,958
Nagato... Is it possible
that you get that way, too?

521
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:35,875
I wonder... Do you feel
lonely when you're alone?
