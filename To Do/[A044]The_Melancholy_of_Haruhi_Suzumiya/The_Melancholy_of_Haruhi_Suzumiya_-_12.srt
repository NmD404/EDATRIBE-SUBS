1
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,750
[KYON]
It was the day after Obon.

2
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,625
Smackdab in the
middle of summer.

3
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,291
Nothing special.
Just an ordinary day.

4
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,750
[KYON] The game on TV
was between schools

5
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,208
from another town.

6
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,750
I had nothing to do
with either school,

7
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,250
but because I tend to
sympothize with underdogs,

8
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,208
I found myself routing
for the losing team.

9
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,375
And that's right about the time
my cell phone started ringing.

10
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,583
[phone ringing]

11
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,375
[KYON]
Haruhi.

12
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,125
[HARUHI]
Hey, you're free, right?

13
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,916
Good, then meet us at 2:00
in front of the station.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,791
But I--!

15
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,791
--[beeping]
--[KYON groans]

16
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,791
[KYON] And just like
that, she hangs up.

17
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,000
How does she know I'm not
doing anything today?

18
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,708
I mean, I could be.

19
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,791
Yeah, I know, I'm
not doing anything,

20
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,916
but still...

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,375
--[KYON] Hm?
--[phone ringing]

22
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:26,583
--[phone ringing]

23
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,666
[KYON]
What?

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,875
[HARUHI]
I forgot to tell you something.

25
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,916
Bring your swim trunks.
And your bike, too.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,750
Oh, and money! Bring money.

27
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,416
That's it! Over and out!

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,750
[KYON]
Uh. No.

29
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,458
What was that all about?

30
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,791
[KYON'S SISTER]
Hm?

31
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,875
[COMMENTATOR] ...rounding
third on his way home.

32
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:46,750
And there's Suzuki on the mound.
He is not having a good day.

33
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,000
You gotta feel bad for that guy.

34
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,916
Oh, that is tragic.
He looks like...

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,875
[KYON sighs]

36
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,250
[KYON]
Oh, well.

37
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,583
[COMMENTATOR]
Even the fans are quiet.

38
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,666
They're not even
booing Suzuki anymore.

39
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,125
So, with that, the score
is now eight, zero.

40
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,125
Kuyamoto's really got their
work cut out for 'em.

41
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,041
You're late, Kyon! Penalty!

42
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,833
You have absolutely no
motivation whatsoever.

43
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,083
How dare you keep your
brigade leader waiting!

44
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,708
You're gettin' a
penalty for this!

45
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,125
[KYON]
I'm here 15 minutes early.

46
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,000
How come I'm still
the last one to arrive?

47
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,708
[HARUHI] Okay, now that we're
all present and accounted for,

48
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,916
we can go.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,541
Koizumi, you're gonna
have to give Mikuru

50
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,125
a ride over there, okay?

51
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,375
[MIKURU]
Hm?

52
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,041
Yuki and me'll hop on
the back of Kyon's bike.

53
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,916
Do you mind if I ask
where we're going today?

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,458
[HARUHI growls]
To the public pool,

55
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,958
where do you think?

56
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,250
We've got lots and lots of
summer vacation-y things to do

57
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,875
during our summer break.

58
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,208
We've only got so much time,

59
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,583
and once it's gone,
it's gone for good, ya know?

60
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,000
So we're gonne do everything
we can while we can

61
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,833
during our one and only
summer as tenth graders.

62
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,541
[KYON]
Once it's gone, it's gone, huh?

63
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,416
[HARUHI sniffing]

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,833
Can you smell the chlorine?

65
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,583
That really makes it
feel like summer.

66
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,833
Woohoo!

67
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,375
Let's go! Ha, ha!

68
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,166
Hurry up and get in, guys!

69
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,500
The water's warm. It's perfect!

70
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,916
[KYON] Can't she see
the no diving signs?

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,291
I mean, they're everywhere.

72
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,625
It kind of makes
me smile, though.

73
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,791
I mean, to see Miss Suzumiya
enjoying herself

74
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,291
in a normal way.

75
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,000
It's rather charming, isn't it?

76
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,291
She called me outta the blue,

77
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,708
ran down a list of
things to bring,

78
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:16,875
and ordered me to meet her

79
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,416
without telling me
what was going on.

80
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,291
Yeah, there's nothing
charming or normal about it.

81
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,625
[KOIZUMI] Well, as long as Miss
Suzumiya's having a good time,

82
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,000
we don't have to worry about
any earth-shattering events.

83
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,083
Man, I hope you're right.

84
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,875
Hm. I don't think you
need to worry about it.

85
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,333
I mean, there haven't
been any problems

86
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,958
since our outing
a few weeks ago.

87
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,958
And right now, as far as
Miss Suzumiya's concerned,

88
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,958
and as far as we're concerned,
the world is at peace.

89
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,000
[KYON]
Hm.

90
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,458
[HARUHI]
Okay, guys, lunch time!

91
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,291
And, surprise, surprise!
Mikuru's made us sandwiches!

92
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,125
[KYON]
Whoa.

93
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,416
It's delicious.

94
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,708
Thank you very much!

95
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,083
I'm gonna have another
piece of fried chicken!

96
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,791
Pour some tea, Mikuru.

97
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,291
[MIKURU]
Okay.

98
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,958
[KYON] Things do seem
peaceful, that's for sure.

99
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,750
[CHILDREN]
We're sorry!

100
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,291
[HARUHI]
Yeah, here I come!

101
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,791
[KYON] Now I know why they call
it a "public" swimming pool.

102
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,208
Seems like everyone
in town's here today.

103
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,541
[whimpering, yelps]

104
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,166
Oh, some on, Mikuru!
You're supposed to catch it!

105
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,458
[KYON] This isn't a bad way
to spend a summer vacation.

106
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:30,583
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

107
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,708
[KYON]
Hm?

108
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,125
These two guys are
my brigade members.

109
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,291
They do what I say,
so if you want somethin',

110
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,375
you can ask them.

111
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,791
[CHILDREN]
Okay!

112
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,000
[sighs]

113
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,833
[HARUHI] I had a couple ideas
about the rest of our vacation.

114
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,208
Check it out!

115
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,708
[KYON]
What's that thing?

116
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,083
it's a schedule of all the
things the brigade's gonna do

117
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,750
before our vacation ends!

118
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,375
[KYON]
The SOS brigade?

119
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,250
You know it! We've only got two
more weeks of vacation left,

120
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,625
right, guys?

121
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,125
But it still feels like
there's a lotta things left

122
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,291
for us to do.

123
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,833
I say we gotta pick up the pace.

124
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,833
So, you made a schedule
of things to do

125
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,875
before our vacation ends, huh?

126
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,083
Go on a trip, go to the
pool, to a Bon fesitval,

127
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,250
see fireworks, part
time job, stargazing--

128
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,958
that's a lotta stuff.

129
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,041
[KYON] And she expects us to do
all this in the next two weeks?

130
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,416
Great.

131
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,875
Can you think of anything
else you wanna do?

132
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:22,958
[MIKURU]
Um...

133
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,041
I'd like to try
goldfish scooping.

134
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,250
Okay! Then goldfish
scooping it is.

135
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,333
We'll start on
the list tomorrow.

136
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,041
Does anyone know if
there's a Bon festival

137
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,958
happening some place close by?

138
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,333
Or if there's a firework show?

139
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,583
[KYON] Why don't you look
this stuff up yourself?

140
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,541
I'll check around and
try to find something.

141
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,500
I'll call you if I do, okay?

142
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,041
[HARUHI] Oh, and don't forget
about the goldfish scooping.

143
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,166
It's Mikuru's only request.

144
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,416
[KOIZUMI]
Got it!

145
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,375
[KYON] How come I always
get stuck with the check?

146
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,500
Becase you were
late, that's why!

147
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,791
And don't you make
us wait tomorrow!

148
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,916
That's it. See ya!

149
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,208
Awesome.

150
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,041
Looks like we're gonna be
running around everyday, now.

151
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,791
[phone ringing]

152
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,583
[KYON] The next morning, I was
waken from my peaceful slumber

153
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,791
by a call from Haruhi.

154
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,041
[KYON] She said they'd
found a Bon festival,

155
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,500
and it was happening tonight.

156
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,500
At a park somewhere.

157
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,416
Well, that was fast.
And convenient.

158
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,375
I was just beginning
to appreciate that fact

159
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,125
when Haruhi suddenly said...

160
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,583
We're all gonna go out
and buy yukatas!

161
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,208
Yuki doesn't have one
and neither does Mikuru.

162
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,791
But I know a place that
sells 'em cheap, so, let's go!

163
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,250
[KYON] Haruhi picked out yukatas
for Miss Asahina and Nagato.

164
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,916
Then, headed for
the changing rooms.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,125
This was gonna take a while.

166
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,958
[KYON] After about an
hour of standing there

167
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,208
and getting strange
looks from people,

168
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,750
the girls finally decided to
come out of the changing room.

169
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,500
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

170
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,583
[BOTH gasp]

171
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,958
[KYON]
Whoa.

172
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,833
You all look really wonderful
in them. I mean it.

173
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,541
[HARUHI] Of course we do!
I picked them out myself.

174
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,083
Especially Mikuru's.

175
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,791
Look at you, you're
so cute. I'm a genius!

176
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,625
I have awesome fashion
sense, don't'cha think?

177
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,541
[HARUHI giggles]

178
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,083
[KYON] Of all the costumes
Haruhi has forced her to wear,

179
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,458
this had to be
the best one yet.

180
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,125
She looks awesome.
Yes, she does.

181
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,708
I always wondered what
it would be like

182
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,250
to wear traditional
Japanese clothing.

183
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,375
It's a little tight around
the chest, but it's beautiful.

184
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,833
We're ready to go!

185
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,250
And now it's off to the Bon
festival to have some fun!

186
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,750
A Bon festival, huh?

187
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,375
I haven't been to one of these
things in a really long time.

188
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,833
[gasps] Look, Mikuru!

189
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,125
They've got goldfish scooping,
just like you wanted!

190
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,833
I bet you're gonna catch a ton!

191
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,791
Don't forget the black
demikens are worth 200 points!

192
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,416
Do you wanna go
scoop some fish, too?

193
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,083
We could have a contest to
see how many we can catch.

194
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,458
I think I'll pass.

195
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,083
Besides, I'm more interested
in the food around here.

196
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,541
How 'bout you, Nagato?
Do you wanna get some food?

197
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,916
Are you actually
into that stuff?

198
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,208
[NAGATO]
That.

199
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,666
Hm? It's yours for 800 yen!

200
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,916
[HARUHI]
Thirteen!

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,666
I caught a whole bunch,
but I only kept one

202
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,041
'cause I don't have any
place to keep all of 'em.

203
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,041
I tried, but I couldn't catch
a single one of them.

204
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,750
Scooping them up is a lot
harder then it looks, huh?

205
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,125
Yeah, well, it's rare for anyone
to catch a lot, let alone one.

206
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,083
If you can figure out
the trick, it's easy!

207
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,291
Huh?

208
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,750
What's with the mask
you've got there, Yuki?

209
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,916
I bought it.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,458
[HARUHI]
I know, but why that one?

211
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,291
Maybe she felt some kinda
connection to it, or something.

212
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,666
[KYON]
Cause she's an alien.

213
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,666
[HARUHI]
Huh.

214
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,208
Well, okay then.

215
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,000
Anyway, there's a ton of stuff
over there we haven't seen!

216
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,458
You still in fun mode?

217
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,833
Of course! Come on! Hurry up!

218
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,875
--[HARUHI] Here.
--[KYON] Hm?

219
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,625
Go ahead and have one,
but only one, 'kay?

220
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,375
Oh, okay. Thanks.

221
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,291
Pretty good, huh?

222
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:42,875
[KYON]
Mm-hm.

223
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,375
You know it.

224
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,583
Okay, we've seen just about
everything there is to see.

225
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,208
So now we're gonna go
shoot off some fireworks.

226
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,041
Really? Fireworks?

227
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,125
We went to all the
trouble of dressing up,

228
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,916
so we'll end our day
with a firework show.

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,708
Why not? There's a booth over
there that's selling them.

230
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,166
Let's go down by the river bank.

231
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,833
[KOIZUMI]
This is going to be so much fun.

232
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,708
[HARUHI]
Come on! Let's do this!

233
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,458
[laughing]

234
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,958
Kakizaki!

235
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,375
[HARUHI laughing]

236
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,166
[giggles] It's pretty.

237
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,750
So, we did the
Bon festival, fireworks.

238
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,125
That's two down.

239
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,750
And tomorrow, we're gonna
go catch some bugs.

240
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,250
Uh, Haruhi, I don't wanna
spoil your fun or anything,

241
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,208
but have you finished
your summer homework?

242
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,708
[KYON] I should talk.
I haven't even touched mine.

243
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,750
Are you kidding? That
stuff's totally easy.

244
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,291
You can finish it all
in about three days.

245
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,625
Huh?!

246
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,708
Yeah, I finished doing all
of my homework in July.

247
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,125
Ya have to get rid
of that junk first

248
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,208
so you can spend the rest
of your summer having fun

249
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,958
and not worrying about it.

250
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:01,958
That's the only way to really

251
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,041
get the most out
of your vacation.

252
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,041
[KYON] Why does she
have to be so smart?

253
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,750
The folks upstairs
weren't terribly fair

254
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,916
when they were divvying
up the stats for us.

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,250
So anyway, we're gonna go
bug catching tomorrow.

256
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,666
And the prize for catching
the most bugs is gonna be...

257
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,083
Hm...

258
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,916
The winner gets to be brigade
leader for a whole day!

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,166
[KYON]
No thank you.

260
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,583
That sounds like fun.

261
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,666
But can we catch just
any random bug?

262
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,333
[HARUHI]
Hm... No.

263
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,541
Only cicadas!

264
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,958
That's it!

265
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,333
I'm calling it the SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest!

266
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,666
Whoever catches the
most cicadas wins!

267
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,791
--[KYON groans]
--[MIKURU whimpers]

268
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,625
[KYON] The next day,
I wanted it to rain so bad,

269
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,375
I drove a nail through
a teruteru bouzu.

270
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,208
But, despite my efforts,
the day was clear and beautiful.

271
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,291
It was the warmest day
of summer so far,

272
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,166
and all the cicadas were
happy because of it.

273
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,958
I wonder if anyone's ever
tried eating a cicada...

274
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,041
[KYON]
No idea.

275
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,166
They could be good
fried in tempura.

276
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,875
[KYON]
Bon appetit.

277
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,958
I always wondered about food
that's deep-fried in tempura.

278
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,125
Maybe the batter they use

279
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,291
is what makes everything
taste so good.

280
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,125
'Cause then cicadas
would taste great!

281
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,541
[KYON] Apologize to the
tempura chefs! Do it!

282
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,000
Ahem. What's wrong
with this picture?

283
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,000
High schoolers carrying nets
and little plastic boxes?

284
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,750
Hello? What're you thinking
making us hike

285
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,791
all the way up here
carrying all this stuff?

286
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,125
What're you talking about?

287
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,750
If we didn't have
the nets and the bins,

288
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,416
we wouldn't be able
to catch cicadas.

289
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,416
[KYON] That's not the point
I was trying to make.

290
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,041
Okay. Let's go hunting.

291
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,000
Remember, winner gets to be
brigade leader for a day.

292
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,916
Ya ready? Go!

293
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,125
[KYON]
Ignored.

294
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,541
She looks determined
to win, doesn't she?

295
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,666
And that would be a good
thing, don't you think?

296
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,791
[KYON] Jeez. I haven't done
this since elementary school.

297
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,875
I know, me too.

298
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,000
Come on. Let's go have some fun.

299
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,041
[sighs]

300
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,625
[KYON]
What's that? You catch one?

301
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,458
Yeah, no. That's not a cicada.

302
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,500
Oh.

303
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:03,958
[KYON gasps]

304
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,541
A Hercules beetle?!

305
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,000
[HARUHI]
Let's tally 'em up!

306
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,416
Mikuru caught one.

307
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,708
Yuki caught four.

308
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,250
Koizumi caught seven.

309
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,125
Kyon caught nine.

310
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,916
But the one who
caught the most is...

311
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,583
[KYON]
Don't say it, we already know.

312
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,625
[HARUHI]
Me, with 12!

313
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,875
I guess I just can't give up
being brigade leader,

314
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,333
even for one day.

315
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,916
Sorry about that, you guys.

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,166
Please tell me that
you're not gonna

317
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,666
batter those things up
in tempura and fry them.

318
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,583
What? Do you really
wanna eat 'em?

319
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,166
No, I don't wanna eat 'em.

320
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,250
Just kidding.

321
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,333
It's important to
follow the spirit

322
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,250
of catch and release
with these guys.

323
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,916
You never know.
If we let them go now,

324
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,750
they might return
the favor some time.

325
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,291
Hurry!

326
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,166
Go back to the mountains and
try not to get caught anymore!

327
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,708
[KYON]
Wait. No.

328
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,125
You act like you
did a good deed,

329
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,958
but all you did was catch 'em
and let 'em go. Come on.

330
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,583
So, the day after our bug hunt,
Haruhi was kind enough

331
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,541
to get us part-time jobs
at a local supermarket

332
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,666
that really needed the help.

333
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,208
See, they were
having a big sale.

334
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,333
Well, don't work too hard, okay?

335
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,041
[KYON] And our job was
to attract cu

336
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,208
[MIKURU]
Thank you for coming.

337
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,208
[KOIZUMI]
Balloon? No?

338
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,375
[NAGATO]
Here.

339
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,000
--[KYON yelps]
--[KID laughs]

340
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,166
[KYON] Can someone please
tell me why I have to wear

341
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,708
this unbearably hot costume?

342
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,000
Part-time job?

343
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,083
She could've found something

344
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,208
a little more
appropriate for summer.

345
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,250
Look at her.
All cool and breezy.

346
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,291
I swear. If she gets more
money then us, I'm gonna riot.

347
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,541
[MIKURU groaning]

348
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,583
Now I know how a snake feels
when it sheds its skin.

349
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,625
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

350
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,250
That's a clever way
of putting it.

351
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,791
Knock, knock.

352
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,166
The manager's super grateful
for all the hard work you did.

353
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,041
Who cares how grateful
he is. What about our pay?

354
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:34,958
[HARUHI]
This is it.

355
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,000
[KYON]
Huh?

356
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,000
This cool frog
costume is our pay.

357
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,250
Can't tell ya how long
I've had my eye on him.

358
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,583
The manager said
we could have it

359
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,250
'cause he thought Mikuru
looked so darn cute in it.

360
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,083
We'll keep him in the clubroom
as a souvenir of today.

361
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,000
Mikuru, you have my
permission to wear him

362
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,000
whenever you want, okay?

363
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,375
Isn't it great?

364
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,916
--[MIKURU whines]
--[KYON] Ribbit.

365
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,291
[KYON] The pool, the Bon
festival, bug catching,

366
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,708
and a part-time job.

367
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,916
Next on Haruhi's
schedule, stargazing.

368
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,750
Wow, that's what a telescope
from this time frame looks like?

369
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,708
It doesn't seem too different
from the ones in Kepler's time.

370
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,250
[KYON]
Yeah, no. It's pretty different.

371
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,250
[MIKURU] Did you buy
this just for tonight?

372
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,958
Oh, no. Astronomy
was sort of a hobby of mine

373
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,291
when I was younger.

374
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,875
All it took was a glimpse
of the moons of Jupiter,

375
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,083
and after that, I was hooked.

376
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,458
[KYON]
Hm?

377
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,458
[KOIZUMI]
I've found Mars. Have a look.

378
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,083
[HARUHI]
I wonder if they're real.

379
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,333
[KYON]
What's real?

380
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,583
Martians, of course!

381
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,125
[KYON]
I kind of hope they aren't.

382
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,750
I mean, octopoid-like monsters,
wriggling around,

383
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,833
plotting to take
over the planet?

384
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,833
Nothing about that
sounds appealing to me.

385
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,125
Oh, what do you know.

386
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,916
And who cares what
they look like anyway.

387
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,166
They might be friendly.

388
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,250
For all we know,

389
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,583
they could be a
reserved race of beings

390
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,208
living in underground
caves. Think of that.

391
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,708
Whoever they are,

392
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,958
I'm sure they're just trying
not to scare us earthlings.

393
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,541
[KYON]
The martians in your imagination

394
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,333
sound unbelievably boring.

395
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,791
[HARUHI]
I've had enough of Mars.

396
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,083
Let's look for UFOs.

397
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,500
On a night like tonight,

398
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,208
I bet there's some kinda alien
scouting fleet up there.

399
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,291
All right, come on, Mikuru.
Help me with this.

400
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,833
[MIKURU]
Uhh... UFO. UFO...

401
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,583
[HARUHI chuckling]

402
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,541
[MIKURU]
Uh...

403
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,083
[KYON]
Our summer vacation continues.

404
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,416
And the next thing
Haruhi said was...

405
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,416
We're going to the
batting cages today!

406
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,916
[KYON]
Why there?

407
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,375
I was watching a high school
baseball game this morning,

408
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,708
and then it hit me!

409
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,166
Why should we settle for
baseball in some sandlot?

410
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,541
What we need to do is
turn the SOS brigade

411
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,958
into a national league team!

412
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,166
[MIKURU whimpers, yelps]

413
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,833
[KYON]
Chuka soba!

414
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,708
[KYON]
She sure is something.

415
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,250
Where does she get
her energy from?

416
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,083
I bet she's got
special mitochondria

417
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,625
packed in her cells.

418
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,916
More than the
average person, anyway.

419
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,916
If only she'd use
her gifts for good.

420
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,208
[HARUHI yells]

421
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,083
[KYON]
After that, we kept going.

422
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,958
Haruhi was determined to stick
to the schedule she made.

423
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,708
So we were constantly on
the move, day after day,

424
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,416
with no time to hit pause.

425
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,666
We went to a real firework show.

426
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,208
The fireworks burst into bloom
in the sky, one after another,

427
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,875
leaving us with a grand
feeling in our hearts.

428
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,166
And on another day,
she made all of us

429
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,250
enter a goby fishing
tournament down by the river.

430
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,875
[MIKURU screaming]

431
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,708
[HARUHI]
Oh! Mikuru, your pole!

432
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,041
[KOIZUMI] Don't worry,
I see it. I'll go get it.

433
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,375
[KYON] And still, another day
was the the "test of courage."

434
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,541
It's a summertime must,

435
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,333
but I doubt anyone
really does it anymore.

436
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,541
[KYON] Then we went and saw this
over-hyped summer blockbuster.

437
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,750
Turned out to be the
same old, same old.

438
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,958
[KYON]
We went to the beach.

439
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,625
Right in the middle
of jellyfish season.

440
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,041
[KYON]
Then, bowling.

441
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,125
But, you-know-who made a rule
where no one could leave

442
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,250
until everyone got a strike.

443
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,541
Then, an excruciating
karaoke session

444
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,250
designed to push our
vocal cords to the limit.

445
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,833
[KYON] Sure, there were a couple
of non-summertime things

446
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,916
that slipped in,
but looking back,

447
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,708
I can honestly say we had
the time of our lives.

448
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,333
The past two weeks were a blast.

449
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,208
[HARUHI] I declare that
on this day, August 30th,

450
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,500
we've done everything
on our list.

451
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,791
[KYON]
And no one died in the process.

452
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,791
[HARUHI]
Hm...

453
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,791
But now I wonder
if we did enough.

454
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:04,000
Maybe if we--No, I guess
we did do everything.

455
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,541
Unless there's something else
you guys wanted to do.

456
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,666
No, not really.

457
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,541
I think we've done enough.

458
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,833
I think I'd like to
sleep for a while.

459
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,250
How 'bout you?

460
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,833
Oh.

461
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,333
Oh, well. That's cool.

462
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,958
We did just about everything
we wanted to do this summer.

463
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,458
We wore yukatas, and
caught a lotta cicadas.

464
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,291
We went all over the place.

465
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,416
I guess that's about it, huh?

466
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,291
[KYON]
Please don't tell me there's

467
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,958
something else she wants to do.

468
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,041
[HARUHI]
Okay, we're done for today.

469
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,125
I set tomorrow aside,
just in case,

470
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,166
but you can just
take the day off.

471
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,833
[HARUHI] I'll see everyone
at the clubroom on Monday.

472
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,541
[groans]

473
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,750
I still haven't done
any of my homework.

474
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:13,000
[KYON] August 31st.
The last day of vacation.

475
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,166
No matter how hard I tried,

476
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,458
I wasn't gonna
finish my homework.

477
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:20,041
Besides, I was still recovering
from all that running around.

478
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,375
So, I made a decision to
spend the rest of the day

479
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,041
in lounge mode.

480
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,250
[MAN]
What the heck?!

481
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,291
[KYON]
Boring.

482
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,416
[KYON]
Uh...

483
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,583
[KYON]
Homework? Yeah, whatever.

484
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,666
[yawns]

485
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:53,500
[sighs]

486
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,125
I guess I'll go to bed now.

487
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,083
I got school tomorrow.

488
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,291
Beep.
