1
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:40,958
[music plays]

2
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,000
[KYON]
Surreal and incomprehensible,

3
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,375
cobbled together during
an all-night editing session,

4
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,541
the movie, spawned from

5
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,791
the director/producer's
whacked out mind,

6
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:49,958
was finished.

7
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,500
The SOS Brigade was now free

8
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:55,375
to spend a peaceful first day
at the school arts festival.

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,666
Fortunately for me,
Haruhi decided she'd handle

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,458
all the negotiating and
promoting stuff by herself.

11
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,791
My job was to drop off the
DVD with the Film Club,

12
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,458
who was screening
the movie for us.

13
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,375
After that, I wandered
around the campus

14
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,250
with a cloud-free conscience,
enjoying the festival atmosphere

15
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,500
despite my sleep-deprived state.

16
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,208
[KYON] However, there was
still one important duty

17
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:26,250
that I had to take care of.

18
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:36,291
that I had to take care of.

19
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:46,291
that I had to take care of.

20
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:56,291
that I had to take care of.

21
00:01:56,375 --> 00:02:06,291
that I had to take care of.

22
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:16,333
that I had to take care of.

23
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:26,333
that I had to take care of.

24
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:36,333
that I had to take care of.

25
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:49,750
that I had to take care of.

26
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,250
[KYON]
Unlike my class of slackers,

27
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,041
whose activity was some
kind of campus survey thing,

28
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,791
Nagato, Koizumi,
and Miss Asahina

29
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,458
were working the attractions
their classes had organized.

30
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,500
[NAGATO] You will buy
soft-serve ice cream

31
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,375
five minutes and
fifteen seconds from now.

32
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,791
You will drop it in
five minutes and

33
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,083
twenty-eight seconds from now.

34
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,375
You will hit your head on a sign

35
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,166
seven minutes and
six seconds from now.

36
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,583
And then, you will bump into
your girlfriend and fall over.

37
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,083
The items in her
bag will scatter,

38
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,000
leading to quarrel...

39
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,541
[KYON]
Take it easy, Nagato.

40
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,583
You're telling their fortunes,
not predicting their future.

41
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,083
You and I both
know very well that

42
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,250
the law of probability
governs all of nature

43
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,708
and the world around us.

44
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,791
And yet, having witnessed
this phenomenon,

45
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,625
I now find it difficult to
believe in such a thing.

46
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,500
Perhaps we should think on this
occurence in a different way,

47
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,041
that we are in the midst
of something supernatural,

48
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,958
a far cry from anything
we have ever known.

49
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,333
For example, let us say
that we have six monkeys...

50
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,250
[KYON]
What is this?

51
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,458
Could you just let us know
when we're supposed to laugh?

52
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,500
Come on in and check
out our stuff today!

53
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,708
You'll be sorry if you don't!

54
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,000
[TANIGUCHI]
Yo!

55
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,250
[KYON]
You guys have any luck?

56
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,125
Nope. Not as much as I expected.

57
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,750
Table Tennis Club had
ping pong ice cream, though.

58
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,875
Senior year, class 3,
had some good oden.

59
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,166
Junior year, class 5, had
chocolate-covered bananas

60
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,458
that were more
bananas than chocolate.

61
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,583
You're kidding!
All you're doing is eating?

62
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,250
Yeah, we're just
sampling the food.

63
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,291
Now it's time to get to
the real deal, though.

64
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,125
The cosplay cafe!

65
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,458
[KUNIKIDA]
Man, that bunny girl outfit

66
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,333
from a while back
was unbelievable.

67
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,000
I wonder what she's
gonna wear today.

68
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,041
Yeah, well, we acted
in your movie for free.

69
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,750
And then I was pushed
in the water for free.

70
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,958
And all we got to show for it

71
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,583
is a coupon for 30%
off some fried noodles?

72
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,166
You ask me, it really
wasn't worth it.

73
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,333
You don't like it, don't come!

74
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,791
Just go home!

75
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, right! Not before I
sneak a peek at Miss Asahina

76
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,875
in all her cosplay glory.

77
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,333
I wonder if she'll be a waitress
in a tight little miniskirt

78
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,875
like she was in the movie.

79
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,625
[KYON] Her sense of style isn't
the same as Haruhi's, buddy.

80
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,333
But a waitress outfit handmade
by one of her classmates?

81
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,416
I'm so there!

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,791
[TSURUYA]
Thank you.

83
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,500
Hey! It's Kyon and his buddies!
Come on over here,

84
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,750
Thanks for coming by.
Table for three today?

85
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,125
Oh, wait. What do you
think about my outfit?

86
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,708
Doesn't this thing look
totally awesome on me, megas?

87
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,208
Aren't I cute, nyoron?

88
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, absolutely.
You're packing them in!

89
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,625
The fish always take the bait!

90
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,083
I mean, it's just
bad fried noodles

91
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,500
made with really
cheap ingredients,

92
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,333
but look at all these
people standing in line!

93
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,291
We're raking in so much money,
I can't stop laughing!

94
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,041
[KYON] Yeah, and I'm
sure it's just coincidence

95
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,125
that all your
customers are guys.

96
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,125
Oh, head over there!
It's the end of the line!

97
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,916
Go on, get in line!

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,041
Here we are.
Please pay in advance.

99
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,250
Oh! And another thing,

100
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,041
we've only got fried
noodles and tap water.

101
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,916
Now, the noodles
are 300 yen each,

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,291
but the water's free,
so it's all you can drink!

103
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,750
So, what's this get us?

104
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,750
Let's see, so it's just
the three of you...

105
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,333
With these things,
we're talking 500 yen!

106
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,791
Some deal, huh?

107
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,833
Okay, boys, hang out
here for a sec,

108
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,208
and your turn'll be
coming up shortly!

109
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,000
Wow, she's a hyper girl.

110
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,666
Is she a member of
you and Suzumiya's

111
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,916
buncha whackos, too?

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,291
Nope.

113
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,583
By the way, don't forget
to split the change with us.

114
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,041
[KYON]
He got me.

115
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,166
The, uh, "shortly" that Miss
Tsuruya was talking about

116
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,708
was 30 minutes.

117
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,750
So, we stood outside and waited
until she finally let us in.

118
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:02,000
[MIKURU]
Okay. Oh! Welcome to our cafe!

119
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,000
[TANIGUCHI screams]

120
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,541
[KYON]
She's a dazzling waitressi

121
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,916
who'd put a million dollar view
of the city lights to shame.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,416
She's got a different glimmer
here than back at the club.

123
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,291
Welcome! And thank you so much
for stopping by to see us today!

124
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,458
[MIKURU]
Um... Uh...

125
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,916
--Taniguchi!
--Kunikida!

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,541
[MIKURU giggles] Thank you
for your help on the movie.

127
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,125
[KYON]
I see...

128
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,625
If they let you take pictures,
there'd be a riot for sure.

129
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,583
I'd give those costumes
the award for best design.

130
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,041
Then you've got those two,

131
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,666
who could be on the cover
of a teen fashion magazine.

132
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,833
[KYON] Put 'em together,
and it's a magnificent sight.

133
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,833
Mikuru's in charge of
collecting the tickets.

134
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,708
She's also the one
clearing the empty plates

135
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,291
and refilling the water.
If I let her serve the noodles,

136
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,000
she'd probably trip and
spill 'em on somebody!

137
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,916
[KYON]
Wow, she really gets it.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,250
In the end,

139
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,958
pressured by the super
fast customer turn-around,

140
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,333
we inhaled the fried
noodles in about five minutes,

141
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,666
and left the place feeling
slightly less than satisfied.

142
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,833
[TANIGUCHI]
Sorry!

143
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,375
[KUNIKIDA]
So, what do you guys wanna do?

144
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,500
I was thinkin' we could check
out the movie you guys made.

145
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,000
I kinda wanna see what I
look like on the big screen.

146
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,875
[TANIGUCHI]
Pass! It's prolly gonna be lame!

147
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,291
[KYON]
I quite agree!

148
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,541
However, hearing that coming
from you really irks me.

149
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,833
Man, those fried
noodles weren't enough.

150
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,125
Oh, yeah! Next up's the barbecue
hosted by the Science Club!

151
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,708
You're still hungry?

152
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,791
Before we hit the barbecue, how
'bout we score us some hotties?

153
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:18,875
Hotties?

154
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,708
That's right,
Mr. Kunikida, hotties.

155
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,625
We find a coupla
girls dressed casual,

156
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,958
kinda like those two. Then we
make with the chit-chat,

157
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,375
and it's on.

158
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,708
It's a tactic I developed
over years of experience.

159
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,833
[KYON]
What good is your experience

160
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,416
when your success rate is zero?

161
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,000
Thanks, but I'll pass.
You guys are on your own.

162
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,416
I think I'll pass, too.

163
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,041
Good luck, and if you
find a girl to hang out with,

164
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,500
you can introduce me
to one of her friends.

165
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,916
Uh, what? So you guys are
just gonna chicken out?!

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,125
[KYON]
I'm not a coward.

167
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,083
It's just that if a
certain someone saw me

168
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,083
hitting on a girl, it could be
a little bit of a problem...

169
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,708
Actually, a big problem.

170

I was walking by the shoe

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,250
arguing with the Festival
Operations Committee.

300
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,916
I guess they weren't going
to let them on stage to play.

The lead singer, Miss Enomoto,

302
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,250
had to go to the
hospital the night before

303
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,291
because she got
a case of tonsillitis.

304
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,875
And on the day of the concert,

305
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,958
Miss Nakanishi, the guitarist,
tripped and sprained her wrist.

306
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,791
So, neither of
them could perform.

307
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,083
Miss Nakanishi's a senior,

308
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,250
and this was her last
North High festival.

309
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,250
She wanted to play
even if it killed her.

310
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,875
They were going
to play new songs,

311
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,333
but in the end, Miss Nakanishi
had to be taken away

312
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,958

help the band out?

315

how they felt.

But when I saw Miss Nakanishi,

320
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,750
I figured there wasn't
anything they could do.

321
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,250
I mean, if you saw her,

322
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,833
you'd feel bad for the other
members of the band, right?

323
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,375
They must've practiced
so hard for that show.

324
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,625
So then, this is
what I told them:

325
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,333
"Since you guys are in a jam,
you want me to fill in for her?"

326
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,625
I'm kinda surprised that

327
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,416
the other two girls agreed
to let you do that.

328
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,125
I told them all I'd do is sing,

329
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,166
and both Miss Okajima
and Miss Zaizen said:

330
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,250
"Hey, with you, we
just might pull it off!"

331
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,833
After all, I was in the
Rock Club for a little bit,

00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,958
I had to go over
the sheet music.

340
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,458
All I could do was get
the main chords down.

341
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,708
That explains Nagato.

342
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,458
Yeah! I barged in on her
fortune-telling racket,

343
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,916
and when I told her
what was happening,

344
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,375
she decided to join me!
Did you see her play?

345
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,625
I never knew she was dexterous!

346
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,625
She took one look at the music
and then played it perfectly!

347
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,833
I wonder where the heck

348
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,833
that girl learned to
play guitar like that.

349
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,791
[KYON] Probably the
moment you brought it up.

350
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,625
[KUNIKIDA] Hey, it looks
like we have a couple guests.

351
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,458
They wanna see Miss Suzumiya.

352
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,500
[HARUHI gasps]

353
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,750
Well? Go talk to them.

354
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,083
[HARUHI]
Okay, but you're coming, too.

355
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,125
[KYON gasps]

356
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,291
[HARUHI]
Is your throat any better today?

357
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,833
Yeah, that's for asking.

358
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,375
And how's your wrist doing?

359
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,958
It's not 100% yet, so studying
for my exams will be a drag.

360
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,166
I wanted to thank you,
Miss Suzumiya.

361
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,208
[gasps]

362
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,833
You won't believe how
many we requests we got

363
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,250
for the original songs
after the show, it's crazy!

364
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,916
We can't dub our stuff
onto mini discs fast enough!

365
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,791
There's so many
people who want it!

366
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,833
[KYON gasps]

367
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,125
But really, it's all
thanks to you.

368
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,416
Because of what you did for us,

369
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
our songs didn't
have to go to waste.

370
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,208
And we really appreciate it.

371
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,125
You're something else,
Miss Suzumiya!

372
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,000
This festival was gonna be my
last memory with the Rock Club,

373
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,958
so I really wanted to play it.

374
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,500
But this was way better than
having us back out of it.

375
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,875
Yeah...

376
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,125
Anyway, we want to do
something for you in return.

377
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,750
No, it's okay, really.

378
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,166
They were great songs,
and I had a blast singing them.

379
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,666
I'd feel bad if
you guys went and

380
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,666
gave me something on
top of that experience.

381
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,333
Actually, why don't
you tell Yuki?

382
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,666
I want her to hear it

383
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,291
'cause I kinda forced her
to come along and play.

384
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,125
[ENOMOTO]
We already went to her class.

385
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,333
She just nodded once,

386
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,458
and then she pointed
us to this classroom.

387
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh.

388
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,875
Hey, we're gonna play a gig
somewhere before we graduate,

389
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,041
so if you want, come check
us out, okay?

390
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,333
And you can bring...
your friend here with you, too.

391
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,625
[KYON] And after that, Haruhi
slipped into one of her moods.

392
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,208
Then when lunchtime came around,
she rushed out of the classroom.

393
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,291
I'm serious!

394
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,500
There wasn't a single
decent-looking

395
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,416
girl at the arts festival!

396
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,666
You wanna know what I think?

397
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,250
I think this school's
built on a bad location.

398
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,708
We'd get a better crowd
if it wasn't on this hill.

399
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,583
[KYON]
After lunch, I took a walk.

400
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,625
I figured it would
settle my stomach.

401
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,916
And no, there wasn't
any other reason.

402
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:35,750
Hey!

403
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,750
Yeah? What is it?

404
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,375
[HARUHI]
I didn't have time to practice,

405
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,708
so we had to make
them sound simpler.

406
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,583
People wanna listen to the
real thing though, don't they?

407
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,541
[KYON] You're talking about all
the people that want mini discs?

408
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,541
[HARUHI]
Yeah.

409
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,875
[KYON]
That was a heck of a performance

410
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,583
for being on the fly, though.

411
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,125
Don't you think it was
good publicity for them?

412
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,291
[HARUHI] If I just had
one more day to practice,

413
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,958
I could've nailed it.

414
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,416
Part of me's asking,
"Was it good enough?

415
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,625
Could it have been better?"

416
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:26,541
I don't know...
How do I explain it?

417
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,833
When I was up on that stage,

418
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,500
I felt like I was really
doing something.

419
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,833
This sucks. I mean, why can't
I just forget about it already?

420
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,291
[KYON]
How should I know?

421
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,666
[KYON]
But I do.

422
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,083
It's because you're
just not used to

423
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,916
being appreciated by others.

424
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,125
The things you do aren't things

425
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,958
that people usually
thank you for.

426
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,458
[HARUHI]
Hm? What is it now?

427
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,208
If you've got something
to say, just say it.

428
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,416
Spit it out already!

429
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,333
It's probably something
stupid anyway,

430
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,291
but don't just stand there
and keep it bottled up!

431
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,875
It's not good for you!

432
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,625
[KYON]
Seriously... It's nothing.

433
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,083
[HARUHI grunts]

434
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,166
[screams]

435
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,916
[coughs, spits]

436
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,041
[KYON chuckles]

437
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,083
Hey! Do you know how
to play any instruments?

438
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,333
I don't...

439
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,083
It doesn't matter 'cause
we got a whole year to

440
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,875
practice our butts off for
the next arts festival!

441
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,333
[KYON]
Oh, come on...

442
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,625
Our goal is to enter next
year's North High Arts Fest

443
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,958
as a real band!

444
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,583
I'll be the lead singer,
and Yuki can play guitar!

445
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,541
And we'll have Mikuru
shake the tambourine

446
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,166
and be a totally awesome
stage decoration!

447
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,708
[KYON]
Oh...

448
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,958
And of course, we'll have to
make a sequel to our movie, too!

449
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,791
Next year, we'll be super busy.

450
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,625
After all, our goal
each year should be

451
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,250
to increase the number of
goals we set for ourselves.

452
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,125
[KYON]
Hold on!

453
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,708
Come on, Kyon, let's get moving!

454
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:49,708
Where are we moving?

455
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,875
We're gonna get
some instruments!

456
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,000
[KYON gasps]

457
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,291
First, we'll hit the
Rock Club's room.

458
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,958
I know we'll find
stuff they're not using

459
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,500
just lying around up there.

460
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,000
Then, we'll ask the ENOZ chicks
to teach us to write music!

461
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:00,750
[KYON]
Huh?

462
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:01,916
[HARUHI]
Don't sweat it.

463
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,833
I'll write the songs,
compose the music,

464
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,291
and I'll do the choreography!

465
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,125
[KYON] But you don't
have to do it right now!

466
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,333
[HARUHI] Are you nuts?
A year's gonna go by like that!

467
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,000
[KYON] And what do you
mean by choreography?

468
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,500
I thought we were
gonna be a band!

469
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,916
[HARUHI]
We need it!

470
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,791
We're gonna create a new
image of what bands should be!

471
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,833
[KYON] But that's no
different from a pop idol!
