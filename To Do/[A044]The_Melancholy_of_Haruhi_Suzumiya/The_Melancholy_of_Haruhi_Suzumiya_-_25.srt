1
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:35,000
[MIKURU sings]

2
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:14,291
[KYON] Her name is Mikuru
Asahina. On the outside,

3
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,375
she seems like a normal,
kind, and extremely cute girl.

4
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,750
But in reality, she's a battle
waitress from the future.

5
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,791
Don't ask me why she's from the
future or why she's a waitress

6
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,833
'cause that's not
important right now.

7
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,333
It's just a couple
of minor details

8
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,833
you need to have
shoved down your throat

9
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,041
before this particular
story can kick into gear.

10
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,416
Um... Not to bother
you people or anything.

11
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,875
We got a lotta good,

12
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,375
crispy nappa cabbage
in the store today.

13
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,666
Uh... Did I mention that
for the next hour only,

14
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,666
all nappa cabbage is
on sale for half price!

15
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,583
[KYON] By the way,
earlier I mentioned she

16
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,125
was a battle waitress,
so you're probably wondering

17
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,416
why she's wearing a
bunny girl costume here.

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,041
You see, that's
because during the day,

19
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,041
she has a part-time job
attracting customers

20
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,625
to the store in the
local shopping area.

21
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,083
I can't believe it.

22
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,125
Look, the nappa
cabbage is cheap today.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,583
Yes, we should hurry
up and buy some.

24
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,500
Hi, Mikuru! Looks like you're
workin' hard out here today.

25
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,416
Why, yes! I'm trying my best!

26
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,958
[KYON]
Mikuru answers cheerfully,

27
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,541
in an outfit that screams
"trying too hard."

28
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,583
And so, thanks to
her innocent charm,

29
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,166
the nappa cabbage
sold out in record time.

30
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,083
You worked so hard.

31
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,416
Sorry this isn't much,
but I want you to have it.

32
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,875
Oh, no! I'm sure it's
more than enough!

33
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,875
I should be the one
apologizing to you.

34
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,750
This is pretty much
all I can do anyway.

35
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,000
See you later.

36
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,291
I have to head over
to the butcher shop

37
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,250
right away now,
without delay.

38
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,916
Accuse me-- Ah!
Excuse me.

39
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,750
[KYON] The girl had
become a sort of mascot

40
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,333
for the local retailers.

41
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,208
And she was loved
by all the people

42
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,166
who lived in the neighborhood.

43
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,708
You can do it, Mikuru!

44
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,666
Bring back the customers
who flock like lemmings

45
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,833
to that huge mega-warehouse
store that opened last year.

46
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,166
The fate of this neighborhood
and its mom and pop stores

47
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,250
is riding on your
shoulders, Mikuru.

48
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,958
Unfortunately, none of this has
anything to do with the story.

49
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,541
[KYON] Anyway, getting
back to the story,

50
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,833
she's actually
a battle waitress.

51
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,708
She was sent back in time to
secretly watch over someone,

52
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,750
and make sure no
harm came to them.

53
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,583
[KYON] And that someone's
name is Itsuki Koizumi.

54
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,416
Looking at him, you'd think
he was your average,

55
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,875
carefree high school student.
In reality, he's an ESPer.

56
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,875
Unfortunately, he's not
aware of his powers yet.

57
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,250
It seems he needs
a catalyst or trigger

58
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,791
to awaken all the super,
incredible powers

59
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,666
lying dormant within him.

60
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,541
[KYON] She looks like she's
got a high school crush

61
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,625
on a boy who she can't
express her true feelings to.

62
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,833
But, we'll just say that
was a little sigh of relief

63
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,083
because she saw
Itsuki was safe.

64
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,416
Mikuru finishes her
other part-time job,

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,000
which also requires
her to be scantily clad,

66
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,708
and goes home
to her tiny room

67
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,166
at the back of the
stationery store.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,958
Aah, welcome back. My,
Mikuru, you seem a bit tired.

69
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,958
Oh, well, I'm fine. Really.

70
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,750
There were a lot
of customers today.

71
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,041
It was quite a busy day!

72
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,708
Aah, that's good.
Have a good evening.

73
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,333
[KYON] With her work
done for the day,

74
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,833
Mikuru can finally take
off that sleazy outfit,

75
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,333
change into something comfier,

76
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,791
and settle down for
a good night's sleep.

77
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,541
[KYON]
Okay, we stopped the camera

78
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,125
just before she took
her clothes off.

79
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,666
So, don't bother asking
us for the footage

80
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,125
'cause we don't have it. Honest!

81
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,041
[KYON] Yuki Nagato
stands here dramatically.

82
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,875
Although we don't
really know why,

83
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,708
you could say she's
not an ordinary girl,

84
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,541
and maybe she's a little weird.

85
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,500
Well, you're right
because she's actually

86
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,083
an evil witch
who's also an alien.

87
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,291
Okay, at this point,
you're supposed to get that

88
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,458
Yuki's planning something
diabolical that involves Itsuki.

89
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,208
But there's no reason
for her to be hanging out

90
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,333
at the high school
after he's gone home.

91
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,708
Also, the lighting's changed.

92
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,666
It was early evening
in the last scene.

93
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,916
But now, it's obviously
the middle of the day!

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,416
I mean, you can do
whatever you want,

95
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,916
but inserting cut
scenes like this

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,166
makes it really
hard for the editor.

97
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,583
Moving right along,

98
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,833
we've got the first battle scene
between Mikuru and Yuki.

99
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,750
All the stuff about them
meeting for the first time,

100
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,375
and the reason why
they're fighting,

101
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,666
I guess that's all gonna be left
up to the viewers' imagination

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,291
for various reasons, which
shall remain unexplained.

103
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,583
In fact, with the way
this has been going,

104
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,625
we'll be lucky if this movie
makes any sense at all.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,083
Koizum-- Uh, I mean Itsuki,

106
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,791
is not a person that
you can control!

107
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,458
I'll protect him
with all I've got!

108
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,666
--[whimpers]
--[gunshots]

109
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,000
[KYON]
Allow me to explain:

110
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,250
The, uh, staff with
the creative design?

111
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,875
It's called the
Starring Inferno,

112
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,916
and it's supposed
to be a magic wand.

113
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,458
It's time to use
my secret weapon!

114
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,500
[grunts]

115
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,208
--Mi-Mi-Mikuru Beam!
--[zap]

116
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,083
[KYON]
Huh?

117
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,416
Let me explain.

118
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,083
The Mikuru Beam is a
super dangerous laser beam.

119
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,958
that shoots out of
Mikuru Asahina's left eye.

120
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,166
[HARUHI]
Cut! Cut!

121
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,416
[KYON] I'm literally
on the edge of my seat

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,708
wondering what's
gonna happen next.

123
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,041
Will Mikuru escape?

124
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,500
And why has Itsuki
suddenly shown up?

125
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,958
Th-This store is... Uh...

126
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,125
The owner's a really
friendly person!

127
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,416
He's a really nice guy!

128
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,208
They've been in
business ever since

129
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,791
Mr. Eijiro's grandpa opened it.
Uh... It's all right here!

130
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,625
Batteries to refrigerators,
they have it all!

131
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,208
Uh... And they...
have a lot of things...

132
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,500
J-Just hope on down
to Ohmori Electronics,

133
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,750
where good deals
are made every day!

134
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,333
[KYON]
Following her defeat,

135
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,791
Mikuru walks the
streets alone, deep in thought.

136
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,250
The Mikuru Beam had no
effect on that alien witch.

137
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,125
What will I do now?

138
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,291
[KYON] Other heroes can
transform into their alter egos,

139
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,791
but Mikuru has to
change her clothes.

140
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,750
You see, she's off
to work again today,

141
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,208
and mustn't be late.

142
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,250
Meanwhile, Itsuki was
walking along,

143
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,916
staring blankly at the
world as he always does.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,166
Ahh!

145
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,416
And who might you be?

146
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I am an alien from
beyond the stars

147
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,833
that uses the art of magic.

148
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,833
Well, is that so?

149
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,500
It is.

150
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,708
And what do
you want with me?

151
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,375
I have come from outer
space with only one goal:

152
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,208
To take your hidden
powers from you.

153
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,333
What would you do if I said
you were being a nuisance?

154
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,750
I am prepared to use
force if I have to

155
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,166
to take your hidden
powers away from you.

156
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,916
Just how would you use
force to obtain my powers?

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,166
Like this.

158
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,833
[MIKURU]
Look out!

159
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,500
[MIKURU]
Ow!

160
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,291
[MIKURU]
Owie...

161
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,708
Uh... I will never let
you get away with him,

162
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,500
you alien witch, you.

163
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,375
You have won today's round,
Battle Waitress.

164
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,500
And I promise you won't
be so lucky next time.

165
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,291
Please make your
funeral arrangements,

166
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,958
for when next we meet,
it will be the last.

167
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,583
Next time, you may
be certain that

168
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:02,458
I will intend to take you down
and destroy you with no mercy.

169
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,625
And who might you be?

170
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,208
[MIKURU]
Huh?! Uh...

171
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,708
Just an innocent bunny
girl passing through here.

172
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,375
That's all I am. Well, goodbye!

173
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,208
Just who in the world, is she?

174
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,083
[KYON] With a forced
look of awe on his face,

175
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,916
Itsuki watches
Mikuru run off.

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,125
And what's with the
camera tilting up like this?

177
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,000
Once again, a huge chunk of
the story has been left out.

178
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,500
After this and that,
involving you-know-what,

179
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,750
uh... the flames of battle
have burst up again.

180
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,125
I think.

181
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,041
E-E-Even in times like this,
I won't ever run away!

182
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,458
Y-You're an evil,
bad alien...

183
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,041
...and now, you'd better
leave this planet at once!

184
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,125
[music plays]

185
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,541
But it is you who should leave

186
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,666
this time plane
immediately, not I.

187
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,958
For we shall seize him
and his hidden powers.

188
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,500
For he is very valuable
to us, you see.

189
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,958
And while we're seizing
him and his hidden powers,

190
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,916
we will also
invade the Earth.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,541
I-I won't let you
get away with that!

192
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,125
I will risk my own
life to stop you!

193
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,791
Prepare yourself then, for I
am about to take your life.

194
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,375
[snickers]

195
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,833
[music plays]

196
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,000
[gasps]

197
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,625
But Tsuruya! Don't tell
me that even you--

198
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,625
Please get yourself
back together!

199
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,791
[laughs]

200
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,750
I can't take you seriously
when you're dressed like that.

201
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,333
I'm sorry, Mikuru.

202
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,375
I'm being controlled
by the alien right now.

203
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,291
Here goes nothing...

204
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,625
[gasps]

205
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,291
[KYON] Uh... Some kind
of electromagnetic waves

206
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,000
coming out of the so-called
Starring Inferno wand

207
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,750
has turned Tsuruya and the guys
into a trio of mindless puppets.

208
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,583
[TANIGUCHI moaning]

209
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,583
[KYON]
Now she's trapped!

210
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,083
What are you going
to do, Mikuru?

211
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,291
[MIKURU whimpering]

212
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,500
[TANIGUCHI, MIKURU scream]

213
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,625
[KYON]
She couldn't do anything.

214
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,958
[MIKURU, TANIGUCHI
screaming, coughing]

215
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,208
[KOIZUMI]
What's happened?

216
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,458
[KOIZUMI]
Just grab my hand, it's okay.

217
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,791
[KYON]
Okay, Itsuki just showed up,

218
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,625
but where's he
been all this time?

219
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,916
I think they
accidentally got him

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,583
in the shot a few moments ago.

221
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,041
Oh... The water's so cold...

222
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,375
Would you please tell me

223
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,041
just what in the world you
were doing here today?

224
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,458
[MIKURU]
Huh? Um.. Oh, yeah.

225
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,333
Evil people and the
lake and uh... I don't...

226
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,916
[HARUHI whispers] This is
when you're supposed to faint!

227
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,500
[MIKURU]
Ohh...

228
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,208
Get ahold of yourself!

229
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,083
[KYON] Normally, in a
situation like this,

230
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,250
you'd call an ambulance

231
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,375
or flag down a passerby
to get some help.

232
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,625
But this boy decides to

233
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,916
carry this unconscious,
innocent, young beauty,

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,041
and is attempting to
take her away somewhere!

235
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,208
Damn you!

236
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,208
Anyway, Yuki's gang
seems to have bailed

237
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,500
without finishing Mikuru off,

238
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,291
which they totally
could've done.

239
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,958
With so many mysteries,
contradictions,

240
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,458
and plot threads left dangling,
we tilt up again as the story

241
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,333
finally reaches
the halfway point.

242
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,458
Hold on, we're only
halfway through this thing?

243
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:12,500
[music plays]

244
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
[KYON]
We're back!

245
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,958
And I think we're
in Itsuki's house.

246
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,291
What bothers me, though,

247
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,250
is that Mikuru, who's been
carried here by Itsuki,

248
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,416
looks like she's just
gotten out of the bath!

249
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,958
Maybe we're
supposed to think that

250
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,000
she was given a bath by Itsuki
while she was unconscious?!

251
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,125
You gotta be kidding me!
Then this would be the point

252
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,166
where anyone's doubt
turns into a white-hot rage,

253
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,458
building into a desire to kill.

254
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,666
But for now, I will not
give it much thought,

255
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,375
doing away with
all the emotions

256
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,916
that might be bubbling up.

257
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,041
We are, after all,
just watching a movie

258
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:45,291
with actors, playing characters.
This isn't reality, right?

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,083
[KYON gasps]

260
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,291
O-Okay, how is this
happening right now?

261
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,875
If your mouth gets
any closer to her,

262
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,208
someone standing off camera

263
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,666
is gonna step into frame
and kick your ass, dammit!

264
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,541
Hold it right there.

265
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,250
Itsuki Koizumi...

266
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,166
You should not be making
the choice of that female.

267
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,791
You must choose me instead,

268
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,125
for the true potential
of your hidden powers

269
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,416
will only be realized when
they mingle with my power.

270
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,875
Please explain exactly
what you mean by that.

271
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,250
[KYON] Okay, why isn't he
at least a little surprised

272
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,458
to see Yuki at the window?

273
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,541
All I can tell you at
this very moment is

274
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,291
that you have two choices
before you right now.

275
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,958
The first choice
is to be with me

276
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,791
and to make this universe
evolve into what it should be,

277
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,333
and the second
is to be with her,

278
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,541
but that will only
destroy the future.

279
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,958
[KYON]
Itsuki was worried now,

280
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,333
more than he ever was.

281
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,500
But, what Nagato-- I mean, Yuki.

282
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,875
What she said just now, she
was talking about him, right?

283
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,125
Very well!

284
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,875
I understand that he--

285
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,958
No, in this scene,
it's me, so I...

286
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,500
I am a kind a of key,

287
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:55,333
and a key all by itself does
not have any power whatsoever!

288
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,916
And a key is nothing but a tool

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,916
with which you
can open the door.

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,875
And when that door
is finally opened,

291
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,166
something is going to change.

292
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,833
And I know that what
will change is...

293
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,333
That's about all
I understand, Yuki.

294
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,125
But right now, I don't have the
right to make that decision.

295
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,833
In fact, I think
it's far too early

296
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,875
for me to come up
with a decision.

297
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,958
Maybe we should put all
of this deciding stuff

298
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,041
on hold for a while,

299
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,625
I really feel that
we need more time

300
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,500
to think this
whole thing through.

301
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,375
Although, if you
ever decide to tell me

302
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,291
the whole truth about it,
now that is a different story.

303
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,333
There will be time enough
for that in the near future.

304
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,708
I know that now is definitely
not the time for it.

305
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,958
We consider a lack
of information to be

306
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,333
more of an obstacle,
a handicap, a critical flaw.

307
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,125
We are unable to make
decisions based on information

308
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,875
that relies on what
is possible or probable.

309
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,708
[KYON] You could say they're
setting up a plot line,

310
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,291
but that dialogue
was incomprehensible!

311
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,791
The important thing
to note is that

312
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,458
the two of them have reached
some sort of understanding.

313
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,041
Uh, I'm standing
here in front of

314
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,250
Keiji Yamatsuchi's Model Shop.
He opened it last year

315
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,208
after quitting his
dead-end corporate job.

316
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,041
And models were his hobby,

317
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,458
so he figured why
not open a store.

318
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:13,833
Unfortunately, his sales
have been down for a while.

319
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,958
And compared to last year,

320
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:21,833
his first-half earnings for this
year are down about 80%. And so,

321
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,750
everyone should come down
here and buy lots of models!

322
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,875
Thank you!

323
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,625
[sighs]

324
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,875
Huh? You want me to hold it?

325
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,083
Y-You should never shoot this

326
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,666
while pointing it
at other people.

327
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,166
You should only shoot
empty cans with it!

328
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,208
Huh? You want me to shoot?

329
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,041
[screams]

330
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,541
[KYON]
I know you've probably

331
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,166
lost all interest in
the story by now,

332
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,083
but here's an
interesting development.

333
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:59,750
Mikuru and Itsuki have
started living together.

334
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,958
Well, now this is like

335
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,875
one of those cute,
young housewives' shows.

336
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,208
And it makes you wonder

337
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,250
what all those sci-fi
battle scenes were about.

338
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,083
Are they trying to spice up the
story by tossing out the plot

339
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,750
and throwing all of those
moe situations at us?

340
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,041
[KYON] And who the heck
is that supposed to be?

341
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,000
Is she Itsuki's
little sister?

342
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,958
And wasn't that cat
staying on Yuki's shoulder

343
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,875
a couple of scenes ago?

344
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,375
Now, Yuki tries a
different plan. And it looks

345
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,833
like she's transferred
into Itsuki's high school.

346
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,416
[KYON] Yuki attempts to ensnare
Itsuki by using her sex appeal.

347
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,875
And if you ask me, I guess
I'd have to say that

348
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,333
all's fair in love
and war, right?

349
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,916
[KYON] Eventually,
Mikuru also transfers

350
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,375
into the same high school.

351
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,083
[KYON]
You might be thinking,

352
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,375
if her job is to protect him,

353
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,250
why didn't she infiltrate
his school earlier/

354
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,500
But, you're asking
the wrong guy.

355
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,041
Yuki and Mikuru's
story of battling

356
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,750
has now turned into a
heated romantic comedy.

357
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,625
Or rather, nothing more
than a love triangle.

358
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,000
[KYON]
When they're at school,

359
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,083
they seem to have agreed
to a truce of some sort.

360
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,208
We must've missed the scene
where they do the whole

361
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,708
"realizing your
true nature" thing,

362
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,791
and the two of them are now
back to pretending to be

363
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,750
the battle waitress
and the alien magician

364
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,291
engaging in really
lame fight scenes.

365
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,791
As for what's
gonna happen next,

366
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,333
even I, the cameraman,
don't know the answer.

367
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,583
It's a fight to the death

368
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,416
that completely lacks
any sense of excitement.

369
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,500
[KYON] This schizophrenic
story reaches its final act,

370
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,958
as if it were written
by a drunk child.

371
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,708
I'm assuming the
director of this film

372
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,375
felt that they needed
to end things quickly,

373
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,458
and it really didn't
matter how they did it.

374
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,375
It's a bit late,
but that's okay.

375
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,250
Anyway, Yuki challenges
Mikuru to a final showdown.

376
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,625
I see now.

377
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,958
[KYON]
What exactly did she see?

378
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,750
Why the long face, Mikuru?

379
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,125
Is another creepy old
geezer stalking you?

380
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,375
Or did your doctor tell you
you've got athlete's foot?

381
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,416
The time has finally
come at last!

382
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,375
I must go and have
the final battle

383
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,958
with the evil alien witch!

384
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,375
That sounds amazing, Mikuru.
We're counting on you.

385
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,250
The Earth is in your--
Pfft! [laughs]

386
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,708
[KYON] I know I'm
nitpicking here,

387
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,958
but I don't see how Mikuru
and Tsuruya know each other.

388
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,208
Sure, you could
say that they met

389
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,958
after Mikuru transferred
to the high school,

390
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,791
but then how does
that explain the scene

391
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,125
where Tsuruya attacked
Mikuru at the lake?

392
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,791
That happened before Mikuru
started going to the school.

393
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,625
That's a huge error
in continuity and if

394
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,166
you don't know
what to do next,

395
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,541
slowly pan the camera
and shoot the sky...

396
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,958
[KYON] Anyway, we've reached the
climax of the film... finally.

397
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,125
And now, let us settle the
final score once and for all.

398
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,416
I am afraid that you and I

399
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,250
do not have very much
time left anymore.

400
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,708
We must resolve our conflict
before our lunch break is over.

401
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,958
That is something
we both agree on!

402
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,875
However, I'm positive
that Itsuki will say

403
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,916
that he's gonna choose me!

404
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Um... Well, I just know
that he's gonna pick me!

405
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,625
That is unfortunate for you
because I do not intend

406
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,875
to acknowledge his
free will at all.

407
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,458
At last, his hidden
powers will all be mine.

408
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,708
[KYON]
If she wants him so badly,

409
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,416
why doesn't she
just go and get him?

410
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,208
Am I the only
one thinking this?

411
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,208
I won't let you do it!

412
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,250
That is the reason
why I have come here

413
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,333
all the way from the future!

414
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:27,375
[music plays]

415
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,541
[yells]

416
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:40,791
Jump!

417
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:46,125
[whimpers]

418
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,625
[HARUHI] Mikuru! You have
to get up and fight! Hurry!

419
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:49,916
[TEACHER] Hey!
What's going on out--

420
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,583
[KYON] Nevermind the
teacher that came bursting

421
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,083
through the door, the battle
continues on the roof.

422
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,583
And it looks like Mikuru's
finally been cornered.

423
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,166
[MIKURU whimpering]

424
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,083
It's really high...

425
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,000
The time has come for
you to give in to me.

426
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,791
The hour of doom is at hand.

427
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,375
[wand pinging]

428
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,208
[KYON] Yuki unleashes her death
blow upon the helpless Mikuru.

429
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,166
I know the special
effects here are weak,

430
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,375
but there's really no other way

431
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,916
to make this thing
more thrilling.

432
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,208
So please, use your
imagination to embellish.

433
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,083
It really looks hopeless!
What'll you do, Mikuru?

434
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,125
[KOIZUMI]
Are you all right?

435
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,791
That's enough, Yuki!
Stop this at once!

436
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,250
Stop talking and get on with it.

437
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,333
--The only thing you have
--[KYON] Hey, Shamisen, stop!

438
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,500
to do is take over his mind,
and then we're done here.

439
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,625
It's not like you haven't done
something like that before,

440
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,750
so just wave your little
stick at him and-- 

441
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,000
I am also a ventriloquist.

442
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,083
[NAGATO]
Take this, Itsuki Koizumi.

443
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,833
I will now proceed
to take control

444
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,166
of your thoughts and actions.

445
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,833
[wand pinging]

446
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:53,875
[KOIZUMI grunts]

447
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,083
--[NAGATO] Curses!
--[SHAMISEN meows]

448
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,416
At last, it is over,
Miss Asahina.

449
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,666
[MIKURU]
Uh...

450
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,416
[KYON] Itsuki's unexplainable
powers have awakened,

451
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
and Yuki, the alien witch,
was transported to

452
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,708
the far reaches
of the universe.

453
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:22,000
Peace has returned to our world.
Thank you, Mikuru Asahina.

454
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:27,500
And thank you, Itsuki Koizumi.
All is well, that ends well.

455
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,583
And we're tilting up again?

456
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:34,625
[music plays]

457
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,500
[HARUHI] This story
is a work of fiction.

458
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,041
All character names,
organizations, incidents,

459
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,166
and any other names,
phenomena, and such,

460
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,000
are fictional as well.
It's all made up.

461
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,458
Even if it
resembles someone,

462
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,333
it's probably
just a coincidence.

463
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,166
Oh! Except for
the commercials.

and Yamatsuchi's Model Shop

465
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,958
for great deals!
Stop by and buy!

466
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:02,250
Huh?! I gotta say it again?
This story is a work of fiction.

467
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,458
All character names,
organizations, incidents,

468
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,000
and any other names...

469
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:09,291
Hey, Kyon! Why do I have to
say all this stuff anyway?

470
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,750
[HARUHI]
It's finished!

471
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,958
That totally rocked!

472
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,458
The SOS Brigade doesn't know

473
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,291
the meaning of the
word "impossible!"

474
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,791
Isn't that right, Kyon?

475
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:25,250
[KYON] You're actually
gonna show this to people?!

476
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,958
It's so good the
theater will be packed

477
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,458
for every screening
during the arts festival!

478
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,666
Maybe we should charge
admission to see the film!

479
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,750
Oh! I should touch base
with the Film Club...

480
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,791
[KYON] I think I'm gonna
skip the festival today

481
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,916
--and take a nap somewhere.
[HARUHI]... for the sequel!

482
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,541
[HARUHI]
Right, Kyon?
