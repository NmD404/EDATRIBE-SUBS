1
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,875
I brought some tea.

2
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:48,833
Here you go.

3
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,708
Oh, thanks a lot.

4
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,375
[KYON slurps]

5
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:56,916
Huh?

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,458
Uh...

7
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,375
Wow, it's really good.

8
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,500
[MIKURU]
Mm-hm!

9
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,666
Here you go.

10
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,333
Why, thank you very
much, Miss Asahina.

11
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,166
[KYON] The SOS Brigade
was officially created

12
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,666
by Haruhi in May.

13
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,250
It's already June now.

14
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,833
During that time, I was involved
in an incident that's, well...

15
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,541
It was like the world got a
sudden case of leg cramps.

16
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,083
All that aside, today's episode

17
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,125
goes a little
something like this:

18
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,583
[HARUHI]
Hey, you guys!

19
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,458
We're gonna enter ourselves
in a baseball tournament!

20
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,250
[KYON] Since the day
of that "incident,"

21
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,458
nothing really out of
the ordinary's happened.

22
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,875
We were enjoying our brief
moment of peace and boredom

23
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:36,291
as best we could. And boy,
was it a brief moment.

24
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,833
You might be wondering why.

25
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,041
[KYON] Because when she
turns on that smile of hers,

26
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,750
somehow I'm the one who always
ends up completely exhausted.

27
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,250
What did you say we're gonna do?

28
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,000
[HARUHI]
We're gonna do this!

29
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,916
"Announcing the ninth all city
amateur baseball tournament."

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,666
And, who's gonna be entering

31
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,833
this little sandlot
baseball game?

32
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,875
You've gotta be kidding!
Us, of course!

33
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,000
So when you're saying "us,"

34
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,083
you're talking
about everyone here

35
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,250
--including me?
--[HARUHI] Somehow,

36
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,625
we need to find at least
four more people.

37
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,125
[KYON] As usual, if somebody's
opinion's inconvenient,

38
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,666
she doesn't even hear it.

39
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,875
Hey, do you even know
the rules for baseball?

40
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,791
Of course I know the rules.

41
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,416
When I tried out for
the baseball team,

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,583
they gave me the rundown
of all of the basics.

43
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,833
But I wasn't having any fun,

44
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,541
so I hurried up and went home.

45
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,333
[KYON] Well, if you think
baseball's so boring,

46
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,833
why do you wanna enter
the tournament so badly?

47
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,083
Because it's our chance
to show the entire world

48
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,041
just who we are! If we win
this baseball tournament,

49
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,375
the SOS Brigade will take
on a life of its own

50
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,083
and be known all over the world!

51
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,666
It's a great opportunity!

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,166
Right, Mikuru? Isn't
that a great idea?!

53
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,875
Huh? B-But I wo--

54
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,958
Don't you think
baseball is great?!

55
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,208
In fact, we're gonna
shoot for the championship!

56
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,791
We can't afford to
lose a single game

57
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,541
because you know
how I hate losing!

58
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,208
[screams]

59
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,291
You got that?

60
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,750
Well, I think it
would be all right.

61
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,041
Don't smile like that
and give into her demands.

62
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,500
Why don't you try
disagreeing with her

63
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,750
every once in a while?

64
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,750
Actually, I think this
is much more sensible

65
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,083
than walking around the city
looking for aliens and UMAs.

66
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,625
[groans] All right, when's this
tournament supposed to happen?

67
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,875
It's this Sunday!

68
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,041
[KYON] Day after tomorrow?
Are you kidding?!

69
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,541
Don't you think
that's way too soon?

70
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,458
But I already turned
in the application.

71
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,583
Oh, don't worry
about it. It's all set.

72
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,791
I put "SOS Brigade"
as our team name.

73
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,833
That's one thing I made sure of!

74
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,500
And as for the other
four players we need,

75
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,250
you got any ideas on
where to find them?

76
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,791
If I come across anybody
walkin' around lookin' bored,

77
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,041
I'll just grab 'em.

78
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,416
[KYON] Scary thing is:
she really means that.

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,166
All right, Haruhi,
just hang on a second.

80
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,833
I think that
Taniguchi and Kunikida

81
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,708
might have some free
time on their hands.

82
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,291
[HARUHI]
They'll do.

83
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,708
[KYON] It's true: Haruhi thinks
of her classmates as objects.

84
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,875
Okay then... Let's see,
we need two more.

85
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,958
Uhm... If you don't mind,
I think I might have a friend.

86
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:24,958
[HARUHI]
Perfect!

87
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,250
[KYON]
Apparently anyone will do.

88
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,291
Hey, wait, Miss
Asahina's friend?

89
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, that's interesting.

90
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,666
Friend from where?
And what time period?

91
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,833
It's okay, she's
from this time-- Uh!

92
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,500
I mean, she's just a friend
I met in one of my classes.

93
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,750
I know someone. It's an
acquaintance who's been curious

94
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,708
about our group for some
time now and I think--

95
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,625
[KYON]
I'll handle it, thanks.

96
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,750
Now that that's settled,

97
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,500
it's time for some
intensive training!

98
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,708
Intensive training?
You mean, right now?

99
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,500
Yeah!

100
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,583
Yeah, but where?

101
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,833
Over there!

102
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,666
[BASEBALL PLAYERS yelling]

103
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,125
[KYON]
So, all of us got roped into

104
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,625
entering a baseball tournament

105
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:04,791
just like that. Why, you ask?
The reason's very simple:

106
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,583
It was because...
Well, Haruhi was... bored.

107
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,125
[giggles]

108
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,541
[HARUHI] Hey, you guys!
Can we use the field now?

109
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,333
And we also wanna
borrow your equipment.

110
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,083
Huh? What the heck
are you talkin' about?

111
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,666
We need to have
baseball practice,

112
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,625
and we're also
kind of in a hurry,

113
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,750
so would ya get lost?

114
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,291
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

115
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,166
[HARUHI] It'll only be for
a little while, right, Mikuru?

116
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,541
[squeals]

117
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,625
[gasping]

118
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,916
[KYON]
Adolescence is so predictable.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,708
For starters, we're
gonna practice catching

120
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,750
1,000 grounders!

121
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,541
Huh?

122
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,125
Wah! [screams]

123
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,250
Oh, come on, the future
of the SOS Brigade

124
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,500
is riding on that ball,
so get ready!

125
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,458
[KYON] This is the first time
that I've heard that our future

126
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,916
was riding on such a tiny ball.

127
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,916
[HARUHI] Okay, Mikuru,
here comes some more.

128
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,083
That hurts! No! Stop!

129
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,583
[gasps]

130
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:21,791
Miss Asahina, are you
all right? Can you stand?

131
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,500
If you're too nice to me,
it'll happen again.

132
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,833
Please don't.

133
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,291
[MIKURU whimpers]

134
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,666
Dammit, you guys! Get back
to your positions right now!

135
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,250
She's injured, okay?

136
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,875
[growls] Fine, then!

137
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,083
Next up, the baseball team!

138
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,125
Why do we have to do it?!

139
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,208
[HARUHI grunting]

140
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,166
All right, you guys!
That's it for today!

141
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,625
[BASEBALL PLAYERS groan]

142
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,458
[sighs]

143
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,875
Well now, that's surprising.

144
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,375
Miss Suzumiya batted
exactly 1,000 hits.

145
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,625
Frankly, I'm more surprised
by the fact that you counted

146
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,166
every single one of them.

147
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,000
Hm? Oh, hey, Nagato.

148
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,666
On the day of the
tournament, I was wondering

149
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,208
if it was possible
to make it rain.

150
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,750
You know, a big one
that'd cancel the game

151
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,000
with a rain delay.

152
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,708
It is possible, but I
would advise against it.

153
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,125
Yeah, why's that?

154
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,166
Any alteration of the regional
climate could possibly

155
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,916
have devastating after-effects
on the eco-system of the planet.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,791
And about when would these
after-effects happen?

157
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,625
Several hundred to 10,000 years.

158
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,958
[KYON sighs]

159
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,375
Then I guess we'd better
try not to do that, right?

160
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,666
Right.

161
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,541
[HARUHI growls, grunts]

162
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,000
[KYON] The day of the baseball
tournament has finally arrived.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,625
[GIRL laughs]

164
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,875
So, you're Kyon?

165
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,541
I hear an awful lot
about you from Mikuru.

166
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,958
Hm... Ah...

167
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,875
Oh, this is Miss Tsuruya,
that friend I was talk--

168
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm Taniguchi. It's very
nice to meet you.

169
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,958
And I'm Kunakida.

170
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,083
Yeah, see, when he asked me,
I just couldn't turn down

171
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,416
my good buddy, Kyon.

172
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,083
--[TSURUYA] So you're...
--[KYON] Oh, brother...

173
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,500
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

174
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,416
Come over here for a minute.

175
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,708
Okay, what were you
thinking? Seriously?

176
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,041
You gonna make something
like her play baseball?!

177
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,541
[KYON] Hey, don't go calling
my little sister a "something."

178
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,791
She's a person!

179
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,083
[HARUHI] Yeah, well,
she introduced herself

180
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,791
as a ten year-old fifth grader!

181
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,458
I mean, she's so sweet! I can
hardly believe she's related

182
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,125
to someone like you.

183
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,541
This baseball tournament's
open to the general public,

184
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,375
it's not some crummy
little league game!

185
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,125
You are aware of that?

186
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,750
[KYON]
Yes, Miss Haruhi.

187
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,416
All the more reason to bring
my little sister today.

188
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,291
We really don't have
a chance of winning,

189
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,458
but since this is Haruhi
we're talking about,

190
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,708
watch us win the
championship by accident.

191
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,333
That would be a pain.

192
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,875
But, if we have a fifth
grader in the lineup,

193
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,583
then we're sure to lose.

194
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,291
Huh. Fine, whatever.

195
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,916
Guess it'll be a handicap.

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,125
I'd feel bad if we won
this thing too easily.

197
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,333
[KYON] She still thinks
we can win this thing.

198
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:50,666
[yelling]

199
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,791
By the way, has it occurred
to you that you need to decide

200
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,833
the batting order and our
positions on the field?

201
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,791
Oh, I thought
about that already.

202
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,583
Here, take a look
at this: two types!

203
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,416
One for batting order,
the other for field position.

204
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,666
Oh, and I'm the pitcher,
and I'll be batting first.

205
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,041
So you're saying all
you've figured out was

206
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,708
how we're gonna
decide those things.

207
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, and? You gotta
problem with that?

208
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,541
This is the democratic method.

209
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,708
In ancient Greece, they
picked numbers out of a hat

210
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,250
to elect their leaders.

211
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,916
[KYON] Don't compare picking
the batting order for a sandlot

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,291
ball game in modern Japan to how
the Greeks picked their leaders.

213
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,291
Besides, you get to
do whatever you want.

214
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,000
How's that democratic?

215
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,958
Whatever. All the more
reason to go home early.

216
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,250
I mean, from what I hear,
our first opponent is a team

217
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,125
of college students,
the Kamigahara Pirates.

218
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,708
Apparently, they're the
favorites to win the tournament,

219
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,583
and the game is called when
one team gets a ten-run lead.

220
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,083
So it's not too early to start
packing up to go home right now.

221
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,416
Play ball!

222
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,541
[gasping]

223
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,833
Hah! You kidding?
You call that a pitch?!

224
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,041
Come on, everybody,
follow my lead!

225
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:03,875
[PITCHER]
Hm.

226
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,291
[CATCHER]
Hm.

227
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,125
I'll try to do my best toda--

228
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:08,875
--[UMPIRE] Stike!
--[yelps]

229
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,208
[gasps]

230
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,333
[KYON] Why's he throwing
so hard at Miss Asahina?!

231
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,875
If he hits her, I'm gonna charge
the mound and deck that guy!

232
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:17,958
[UMPIRE]
Strike!

233
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,208
--[HARUHI] Mikuru!
--Huh...?

234
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,541
Like this! You
swing it and bang!

235
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,083
[UMPIRE]
You're out!

236
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,125
Damn you! Why didn't you
even swing the bat?!

237
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,000
[UMPIRE]
Strike!

238
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:29,958
Strike!

239
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,541
You're out!

240
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,125
Yuki, if you don't swing,
you'll never hit the ball!

241
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,708
Kyon, you're batting cleanup!

242
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,416
You'd better hit the ball!

243
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,125
[KYON] What do you expect
from a cleanup hitter

244
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,791
picked by a lottery?

245
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,500
Strike!

246
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,500
[KYON] Haruhi hit that thing
into the outfield...?

247
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,708
Strike two!

248
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,083
[PITCHER]
Hmph!

249
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,291
Strike three, you're out!

250
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,333
--[HARUHI] You idiot!
--[KYON] I have dishonored

251
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,125
my family...

252
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,666
Let's take 'em out!

253
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,625
[ALL]
Yeah!

254
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,000
Play ball!

255
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,166
[UMPIRE]
Strike!

256
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,833
Huh...?

257
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,750
[UMPIRE]
Strike!

258
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,083
Strike three! You're out!

259
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,708
[KOIZUMI]
Nice pitching.

260
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,208
Piece of cake, no sweat, guys!

261
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,291
[UMPIRE]
Foul!

262
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,833
[BATTER]
Hm.

263
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,333
[HARUHI gasps]

264
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,666
[HARUHI growls]

265
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,000
[KYON] She can only
throw straight pitches

266
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,500
through the strike zone.

267
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,791
When they figured it out,
it was only a matter of time.

268
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,000
On top of that, our
defense has more holes

269
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,083
than an anthill in the Savanna.

270
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,583
We're so toast.

271
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,708
[KYON] The fact that they only
scored two runs off of us

272
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,041
must be because
the opposing teams'

273
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,500
goddess of victory's
running late.

274
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,833
I guess everyone wants
to relax on a Sunday.

275
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,208
Well, the top of
the second inning

276
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,750
went by really quickly,

277
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,541
and in the bottom of the inning,
we gave up a few more runs.

278
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,416
Looks like we'll be
heading home next inning.

279
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,000
[UMPIRE]
Out!

280
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,791
Phew, that was hard!

281
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,208
It's all I can do to just
hit the ball with the bat.

282
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,875
Looks like I'm gonna be
needing it after all.

283
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,708
Time out, ump!

284
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,166
[MIKURU]
W-Wait a minute! Miss Suzumiya!

285
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,166
[HARUHI]
Come on, hurry up!

286
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,583
[MIKURU]
N-N-No!

287
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,458
[HARUHI] Get out of those
right now and put this on!

288
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,708
[HARUHI giggles]

289
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,958
You look good in that!

290
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,916
Can I get a picture of
you guys with my phone?!

291
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,125
I wonder if up in a ponytail
would be better...?

292
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,666
[growls] Fine! Cheer on!

293
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,583
I'm not really sure
how to do this!

294
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:00,291
You do it like this,
and yell as loud as you can!

295
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,666
Yo!

296
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,333
Everyone, pl-please hit
the ball! I'm begging you:

297
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,000
Do your best out there!

298
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,291
Yeah, I'll knock
this sucker out!

299
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,166
Strike out!

300
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,625
Hah, the sun was in my eyes...

301
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,250
Don't sweat it, I wasn't
counting on you anyway.

302
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,125
[whimpers]

303
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,333
Uh...

304
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,458
[gasps]

305
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,083
Safe!

306
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,250
[HARUHI] Mikuru! Just make sure
to hit the ball this time!

307
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,083
--[TSURUYA] Go for it, Mikuru!
--[KUNIKIDA] Miss Asahina!

308
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,333
[gasps]

309
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,458
Strike!

310
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,291
[HARUHI]
Mikuru! Like this! Like this!

311
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,916
[KYON]
What is she doing...?

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,125
Looks like she's trying
to reduce the magic points

313
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,041
of the other team's
pitcher or something.

314
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,166
Well, it seems to me that she's
trying to signal for something.

315
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,833
[KYON]
Did we ever decide on signals?

316
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,125
[KOIZUMI] No. But I think
that she's signaling

317
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,375
for a squeeze-play right now.

318
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,416
[KYON] She's signaling
for a three bunt squeeze

319
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,708
with two outs?

320
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,208
Even the most senile
coach in the league

321
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,125
would make better
decisions than that.

322
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,458
[KOIZUMI]
The chances of Miss Asahina

323
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,958
actually hitting the ball

324
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,041
are close to none. However,
if we can catch the Pirates

325
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,583
off-guard by going for a
squeeze-play that normal people

326
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,458
wouldn't think of, there's a
possibility that one of their

327
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,708
infielders might make an error.

328
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,833
Or, maybe she's thinkin'
that somehow, Miss Asahina

329
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,291
might even hit the ball
with the bat for once.

330
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,250
[KYON] Well, it looks like
they figured it out now.

331
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,041
--Huh...?
--[UMPIRE] Strike!

332
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,541
And you're out of there!

333
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,125
Mikuru, get your butt over here

334
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,750
and get ready for
some pain, girl!

335
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,500
Huh?!

336
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,083
Take your punishment!

337
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,791
Let everyone have a good, long
look at that funny little face.

338
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,583
Please stop, it hurts!

339
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,041
[KYON]
Hey, numbskull.

340
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,583
It's all your fault for
giving confusing signals.

341
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,666
Maybe you should've tried

342
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,333
to steal home
yourself or something.

343
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,375
[growls]

344
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,041
[phone rings]

345
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,416
[gasps]

346
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,541
[KOIZUMI] Things aren't
looking so good anymore.

347
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,375
[KYON] I don't wanna
hear it, but go ahead.

348
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,666
[KOIZUMI] A closed space larger
than anything we've seen before

349
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,208
is starting to form.

350
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,958
And it's spreading
at an alarming rate.

351
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,333
[KOIZUMI]
It will continue growing,

352
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,916
and the you-know-what's will

353
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,750
keep tearing things apart till
Miss Suzumiya's mood improves.

354
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,041
And that's happening just
because we're losing?

355
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,791
Oh, man, you've
gotta be kidding me.

356
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,416
You're still talking as if it
has nothing to do with you.

357
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,125
Believe me, you're involved with
what's happening now, Kyon.

358
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,083
Do you remember how we
all had to pick numbers

359
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,500
to determine the batting
order for the day?

360
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,791
As a result, you're
batting cleanup.

361
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,458
I'm not all that happy
about it, you know.

362
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,708
[KOIZUMI] That's not the point.
Miss Suzumiya wished for you

363
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,708
to bat cleanup and you are.
That is not a coincidence.

364
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,583
Because you're not performing
like one would expect

365
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,416
from a cleanup batter, she's
feeling a little disappointed.

366
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,583
Well, excuse me.

367
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,750
[KOIZUMI]
In any case,

368
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,583
we should all try to
play the best we can

369
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,791
so that they don't and
call the game this inning.

370
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,791
Because if the game
ends here, you can say

371
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,791
it's the equivalent of this
world coming to its end.

372
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,791
[HARUHI] Let's go, dammit!
Take your positions!

373
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,375
This inning, we need to hold
them to two runs no matter what.

374
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,000
[KYON] Two outs,
man on first and second,

375
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,916
and we're down by nine.

376
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,958
If they score another run,
this game will be over.

377
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,500
[grunts]

378
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,416
[MIKURU whimpers]

379
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,916
[MIKURU]
It's coming this way!

380
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,125
[KYON]
Gotta catch it...

381
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,583
Gotta catch it!

382
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,125
Wow! Amazing!

383
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,000
[sighs]

384
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,166
--Nice catch!
--[laughing]

385
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,166
[sighs]

386
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,250
Getting back to what we were
talking about earlier...

387
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,791
Little close there. What's up?

388
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,000
The other day when you and
Miss Suzumiya were stuck

389
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,000
in that other world, I was
wondering how you managed

390
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,458
to get yourselves out of it.

391
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,375
Do you have to
remind me of that?

392
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,500
It's just that if you
use that trick again,

393
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,125
maybe everything here
will start getting better.

394
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,291
Forget it.

395
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,916
That's exactly what
I thought you'd say.

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,250
Very well, let's just go
and win this game instead.

397
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,375
After all, she shares
the same concerns we do.

398
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,833
[MIKURU]
Miss Nagato is finally...

399
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,833
What, are you saying there's
something the matter with her?

400
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,041
It looks like she's
casting a spell...

401
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,666
A spell? Wait, what're
you talking about?

402
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's see... That's classified.

403
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,666
A spell, huh?

404
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:28,166
[cheering]

405
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,125
Take it. I changed the
elemental boost information.

406
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,083
Elemental what?

407
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,541
Homing mode.

408
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,833
[gasps]

409
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,083
[KYON]
Wow! It's flying!

410
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,833
I see. Homing mode, huh?

411
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,291
Oh man, there's gotta
be a limit to this.

412
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,333
[KYON]
Hm?

413
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,625
[KYON] This is great,
but if we keep doing this,

414
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,625
things are gonna get ugly...
in all kinds of ways.

415
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,166
Well, that should be enough.

416
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,208
I see.

417
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,625
Strike! Strike! Strike!

418
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,083
[KYON] I had forgotten
about it, but the first round

419
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,833
has a 90-minute limit.

420
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,791
That means this
is the last inning.

421
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,041
If we can keep them
from scoring, we win!

422
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,875
Is it all right for us to win?

423
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,916
It is necessary for us to win.
Thanks to all of our efforts,

424
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,583
the expansion of the closed
space looks like it's stopped,

425
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,958
at least for the time being.

426
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,541
But if they suddenly
make a comeback,

427
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,458
then that'll be the
game right there.

428
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,875
[KYON] It's a waste of time to
think about how Haruhi's mood

429
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,291
will turn if that happens.

430
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,166
[KOIZUMI]
I've got a plan.

431
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,250
Huh?

432
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,416
Are you serious?

433
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,250
Yes, I am dead serious.

434
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,458
It's the only option we have
if we're to get through

435
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,041
this inning without
givin' up too many runs.

436
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,583
[KYON]
Oh, brother...

437
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,875
Foul!

438
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,208
Damn you! Be serious about this!

439
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,166
If you lose, you're buyin'
everyone lunch after the game!

440
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,208
[KYON] I know that. After all,
the fate of the entire world

441
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,125
is resting on my pitching.

442
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,791
I guess the world's
not worth very much...

443
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,166
[KYON]
Thanks to my Mysterious Ball--

444
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,000
I named it myself--it looks like

445
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,166
the world will be spared
from certain annihilation.

446
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,833
St-Strike two!

447
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,791
You're out!

448
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,791
[KYON] In just three pitches,
yet another batter struck out.

449
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,000
And now it seems the last
batter's at the plate

450
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,708
--with two strikes on him.
--Strike two?

451
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,291
Kyon, wrap it up with
the next pitch, okay?!

452
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,500
[KYON] There was no doubt
about that happening.

453
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,125
Sorry about this,
Kamigahara Pirates...

454
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,541
[BATTER]
Yeah!

455
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,333
Pick up the ball, Nagato!

456
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,208
Pick up the ball and throw it!

457
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,708
Hurry! Hurry!

458
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,541
--[HARUHI] Over here!
--[KYON] Second base!

459
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,625
What the--?!

460
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,541
I'm terribly sorry, but you
see, we're not the typical

461
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,708
team of athletes you're
used to playing.

462
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,041
[UMPIRE]
That's game!

463
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,291
[cheering]

464
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,333
[KYON] Thanks to Nagato's
magical cheating,

465
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,333
we were able to win the game.

466
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,708
[KOIZUMI] What're we going
to do about the game

467
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,291
in the next round?

468
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,541
[KYON] I'm gonna feel bad
for the Kamigahara Pirates

469
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,333
if we beat them in the second
round like we just did.

470
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,875
I'm really sorry about this,
but I'm afraid I'll need to go

471
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,625
and help my colleagues
out in a little while.

472
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,541
[KYON] So we're gonna be
short a player then.

473
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,625
How 'bout we forfeit?

474
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,958
Sounds like a good
plan. After today,

475
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,625
it looks as if it's a bad thing
when Miss Suzumiya's bored.

476
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,125
We should probably keep
that in mind during

477
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,625
any future activities.

478
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,541
[KYON]
Had enough fun for today?

479
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,625
Koizumi had to bail on us
because he had something

480
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,333
pop up suddenly, and to
tell you the truth,

481
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,041
my arms and legs are
killing me right now.

482
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,291
I guess if you're all right
with it, then, oh well.

483
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,708
Anyway, I'm hungry. How 'bout
we all go and get some lunch?

484
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,041
[KYON]
You got it.

485
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,500
Thank you, thank you!
I can't thank you enough!

486
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,500
[KYON] No, it's nothing!
See you around!

487
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,166
Wait, you know, that bat...

488
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,416
I never thought about
it, but yeah, man...

489
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,166
I heard so much
about you from...

490
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,583
Eat up, everyone!
Kyon's treating us today!

491
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,708
What a game, huh, guys?!

492
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,208
[KYON]
Oh, well.

493
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,791
Thanks to the Pirates, I gained
a little extra cash today.

494
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,541
Kamigahara Pirates,
I wish you luck.

495
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,791
[yelling]

496
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,291
[HARUHI]
Sorry I'm so late!

497
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,708
So, which one do you
think we should try next?!

498
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,458
Soccer or American Football?!

499
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,166
How many do we
need to play each?!

500
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,875
Is the number of people
we had last time enough?!

501
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,541
[KYON] As I looked over at
Haruhi's brilliant smile,

502
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,083
I was trying to think
about which sport

503
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,166
would require less people.

504
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,333
[KYON] American Football?!
No way! How 'bout bowling?!
