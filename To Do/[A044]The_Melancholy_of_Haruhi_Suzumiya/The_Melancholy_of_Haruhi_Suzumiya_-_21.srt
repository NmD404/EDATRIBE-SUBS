1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,166
Do you want me to do anything?

2
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,166
Nope, not a thing!

3
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,208
You're good to go.

4
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,625
Huh?

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,791
[HARUHI] You can go home now.
We're done for today!

6
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,166
Uh...

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,541
[KYON]
You heard what she said.

8
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:43,083
Our Haruhi-esque activities
are over for the day.

9
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,708
Either through
skilled negotiations

10
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,000
or outright blackmail,

11
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,125
she managed to score
all this stuff.

12
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,416
No money changed hands;
it was 100% free.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,791
There's an old saying:

14
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,958
"There's nothing scarier
than something that's free."

15
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,166
As far as I can tell,
Haruhi isn't afraid of anything.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,666
But if anyone out there knows of
something that would scare her,

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,916
give me a shout.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,666
I wanna know what it is.

19
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,666
[TANIGUCHI]
Whatcha got there?

20
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,916
Presents for all
the good little kids?

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,500
Yeah, what do ya think?

22
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,916
'Course not.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,250
[TANIGUCHI]
Ha-ho!

24
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,958
Model guns, right on.

25
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,416
Didn't know you were into those.

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,041
I'm not, these things
belong to Haruhi.

27
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,000
Ohh... Suzumiya's, huh?

28
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,458
Well, guess it must
be tough for ya.

29
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,583
Huh?

30
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,875
[TANIGUCHI]
That reminds me.

31
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,333
Hm? What's up?

32
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,750
Well, the arts festival
is coming up.

33
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,458
I was just wondering what
you guys were gonna be doing.

34
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,125
What are you asking me for?

35
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,333
Yeah, like I'm definitely
gonna get a serious answer

36
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,875
from Suzumiya.

37
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,833
Nagato doesn't say anything,
so there's no point asking her.

38
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,666
Miss Asahina won't come
anywhere near me,

39
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,750
and the other guy's
kinda creepy, ya know?

40
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,333
I'm outta options,
so that's why I'm asking.

41
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,666
[KYON] Yeah, that's me--
PR guy, nice guy, whatever.

42
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,125
You're definitely
in the latter category.

43
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,375
Huh?

44
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,583
[TANIGUCHI] Well, yeah.
I mean, you're so nice

45
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,125
you'd stick with someone
even if you knew

46
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,708
they were headed straight
for the edge of a cliff.

47
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,416
The typical nice guy.

48
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,916
[KYON growls]

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,708
Okay then,
when I find anything out,

50
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,500
you're gonna be
the last to know.

51
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,125
Hey!

52
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,125
[KYON] I already knew
that Haruhi's latest path

53
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,541
to fun and adventure
was gonna lead nowhere.

54
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,666
I didn't need to be
reminded of that.

55
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,291
The thing is, me and Haruhi
weren't the only ones

56
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,875
walking down that path.

57
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,333
There were three others who were
shuffling right along with us.

58
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,500
Now, I didn't have to worry
about two of them;

59
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,083
they'd be okay on their own.

60
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,125
But Miss Asahina wasn't safe.

61
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,916
I mean, you'd think
if she was from the future,

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,541
she could predict all the crazy
stuff she gets put through.

63
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,250
[KYON]
But, since that's not the case,

64
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,791
it was up to me to protect her.

65
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,750
[KYON]
Mm-hm.

66
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,708
[HARUHI giggles]

67
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:15,250
[clock chimes]

68
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,000
[MIKURU screams]

69
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,333
[HARUHI] What? I'm just
helping you get undressed!

70
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,916
Stop struggling!

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,750
[MIKURU screams]

72
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,708
[HARUHI]
Come on!

73
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,333
[sighs]

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,833
[knocking]

75
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,916
[HARUHI]
Come in!

76
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,541
What the--?!

77
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,333
[MIKURU whimpers]

78
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,416
Well?

79
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,416
[KYON] She looks amazing
in that outfit!

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
I wonder if it's Kyonic.

81
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,583
Hello, everyone!

82
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,208
Oh, pardon me.

83
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,291
Ooh, wow! That looks
wonderful on you, really!

84
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,250
[KYON]
Yeah, guy, no kidding.

85
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,916
I'm having a hard time
understanding

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,625
why we've got a waitress here.

87
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,708
This is a club room, not a cafe.

88
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,125
[HARUHI]
I'll tell you why.

89
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,958
This is the costume
Mikuru's gonna wear

90
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,458
in our awesome movie!

91
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,041
Really?

92
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,291
Won't the maid outfit you make
her put on work just as well?

93
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,375
Of course not!

94
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,583
A maid provides
a more personal service,

95
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,708
usually she's in a
big mansion somewhere.

96
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,416
But waitresses are different.

97
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,125
They work at
restaurants and cafes,

98
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,958
and the services they provide
are for the general public.

99
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,625
Yeah, I know the difference.

100
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,375
But that doesn't explain why
Miss Asahina has to wear that.

101
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,916
Oh, you get so hung up
on the tiny details.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,333
She's dressed like that
because it feels right!

103
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,833
Anyway, I'm cool with it.

104
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,666
[KYON] Okay, but is it
cool with Miss Asahina?

105
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,166
[MIKURU whimpers]

106
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,125
Well, this feels like it might
be a bit too small for me.

107
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,958
I... I can't... I don't...

108
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,125
It's perfect!

109
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,125
The fit's perfect,
you look perfect in it,

110
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,416
everything's perfect!

111
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,041
[KYON]
No use, she's made up her mind.

112
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:48,041
People! This is gonna be the
concept for our awesome movie!

113
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,333
As the director,
I've dedicated myself to

114
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,041
providing quality
entertainment for the masses!

115
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,708
And when the credits roll,
everyone will be on their feet!

116
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,958
I'm talking standing ovation!

117
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:58,583
[KYON sighs]

118
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,708
[door clicks]

119
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,458
Huh?

120
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,541
[gasps]

121
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,708
[GROUP]
Uh... Huh?

122
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,625
Yes! Yuki! You totally
understand, don't you?

123
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,375
Yeah! That's it!

124
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,583
[KYON] Not sure what "it" is,
but that has to be

125
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,750
her costume for her class's
fortune-telling thing.

126
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,250
At least, that's what I could
figure out based on the answers

127
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,833
Nagato gave to Haruhi's
rapid-fire questions.

128
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,041
Either way, I wonder
what she was thinking,

129
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,291
walking all the way over here
from class dressed like that.

130
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,000
That costume couldn't
be more perfect

131
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,666
for the character
I have in mind.

132
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,000
How is that supposed
to be perfect?

133
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,916
[HARUHI]
Look!

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,833
[KYON]
Hm?

135
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,583
--[KYON gasps]
--[MIKURU yelps]

136
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,625
[gasps]

137
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,375
[KYON]
No way! Is this my fault?

138
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,833
[chuckles]

139
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,541
You're right, it's perfect!

140
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,458
But then I shouldn't
be surprised.

141
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,625
I'd expect nothing less
from you, Miss Suzumiya.

142
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,250
It's wonderful casting.

143
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,375
[KYON] Don't smile at me,
I'll turn to stone.

144
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,125
[MIKURU whimpers]

145
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,875
[KYON]
Yeah, I hear ya.

146
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,458
Okay, Kyon. I want those guns

147
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,833
ready for some action
by the end of the day!

148
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,333
We start shooting tomorrow,
so we'll need 'em.

149
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh! And you have to figure out
how to use the camera, too.

150
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,125
Got it?

151
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,625
[KOIZUMI] Do you think there's
going to be trouble?

152
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,708
When have we ever not had any
trouble with her crazy schemes?

153
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,916
Trouble, he says.
Don't make me laugh.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,041
Well, it's not a
laughing matter, per se.

155
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,250
But there's no reason
to worry, either.

156
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,833
How can you be so sure?

157
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,958
The parts she's cast us in are
just characters in her movie.

158
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,333
I seriously doubt Miss Suzumiya
believes I'm a teenage ESPer.

159
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,041
It's just a coincidence.

160
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,583
It's like this:

161
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:46,041
The Itsuki Koizumi in the movie
is just a character I play.

162
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:51,041
The fact that he's an
ESPer, too? Again, coincidence.

163
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,583
And if you're worried about her
putting two and two together,

164
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,958
it's hard to believe
anyone would

165
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,500
confuse an actor
with the role they play.

166
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,958
I'm sure some people might,

167
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,833
but I highly doubt
Miss Suzumiya is one of them.

168
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,791
Yeah well, that still doesn't
make me feel better about it.

169
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,458
There's no guarantee that
what you said is the way it is.

170
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,000
[KOIZUMI]
If she was the kind of person

171
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,458
who'd mix reality and fiction,
then you can be pretty sure

172
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,000
our world would be much more
fantastic than it is.

173
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,208
Consider that for a moment,
and you'll see.

174
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,541
Miss Suzumiya is a rational
human being, after all.

175
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,875
[KYON]
A rational human being, he says.

176
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,500
Well, thanks to her
rational god-like ways,

177
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,500
I've had the pleasure
of being dragged head-first

178
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,791
into some of the weirdest
situations of my young life.

179
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,416
Haruhi doesn't even know
what she's capable of.

180
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,833
Of course, we can't
let Miss Suzumiya

181
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,625
find out who we really are.

182
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,958
I'm sure at some point,
we might very well have to

183
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,125
reveal our true
identities to her.

184
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,666
But now is definitely
not the time for it.

185
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,666
Thankfully, Miss Asahina and
Miss Nagato's respective groups

186
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,458
are in agreement with mine.

187
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,125
To be honest,
I wouldn't mind if things

188
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,833
just stayed they way they were.

189
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,458
Then that makes two of us.

190
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,833
I'm not too crazy about
seeing the world go to pieces.

191
00:08:58,916 --> 00:08:59,833
Huh?

192
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,708
If I might make a suggestion,

193
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,750
you should stop worrying
so much about the world.

194
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,125
You should be more
worried about yourself.

195
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,500
If necessary, there are others

196
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,458
who can replace
Miss Nagato and I.

197
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,375
However, there is
no understudy for you.

198
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,166
[KYON]
Hmm.

199
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,583
Man! All this festival crap
pisses me off!

200
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,166
[KUNIKIDA]
Why?

201
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,208
Every time I turn around, I'm
seeing people having a blast.

202
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,666
I'm like the only one
not having any fun.

203
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,708
And seeing all the
couples is the worst.

204
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,333
I'm gonna kill somebody!

205
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,375
[KYON]
Jealousy rears its ugly head.

206
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,166
[TANIGUCHI]
What does our class wanna do?

207
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,791
A freaking survey!

208
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,500
[scoffs] Lame!

209
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,875
If you've got a better idea,

210
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,583
why didn't you say something
when you had the chance?

211
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,166
[KYON]
If you had, maybe Haruhi

212
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,291
wouldn't have come up
with this movie idea.

213
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,791
Yeah! No thanks!

214
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,583
I don't wanna be in charge
of putting it all together!

215
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,625
[KUNIKIDA] Yeah... I wish
Miss Asakura were still here.

216
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,875
She'd do it.

217
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,000
[TANIGUCHI]
I know.

218
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,083
She was double A+!

219
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,125
It really sucks she had
to transfer out of school.

220
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,958
I wonder if it's too late
for me to change classes.

221
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,333
Which one would you wanna go to?

222
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,375
Are you thinkin' about
Miss Nagato's class?

223
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,958
Hang on, I just remembered!

224
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,625
I saw her walkin' around in some
kinda witch costume yesterday.

225
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,791
What was that about?

226
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,208
Yeah, like I'd know. Sorry, pal.

227
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,375
[TANIGUCHI]
I just remembered! 

228
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,875
That time I walked in
on you and her

229
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,791
all tangled up on
the classroom floor.

230
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,875
That was nothing.

231
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,791
Yeah, I know.
It was just something

232
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,041
Suzumiya cooked up
or something, right?

233
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:30,833
Huh?

234
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,333
Oh... Yeah...

235
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,416
[KYON] Taniguchi's complete
and utter misunderstanding

236
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
of that day gave me some relief.

237
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,791
Thanks, Taniguchi. Your
stupidity will save the world.

238
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,458
[TANIGUCHI]
Man... This is boring...

239
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,250
[HARUHI] Okay, people!
Let's shoot a movie!

240
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,583
This is sudden.

241
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,833
I looked all over the school
for a good location.

242
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,750
But nothing worked, so we'll
have to find some place else.

243
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,041
--Come on, Mikuru! Get ready!
--[MIKURU whimpers]

244
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,208
Um, do I really have to go too?

245
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,541
[HARUHI]
Well, yeah...

246
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,000
We can't shoot anything
without our lead actress!

247
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,708
Uh, okay, but... do I
have to wear this outside?

248
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,041
[HARUHI]
You sure do!

249
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,916
[MIKURU] Can't I at least
wear a jacket over this?

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,541
[HARUHI]
No! The more you think about it,

251
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,500
the more nervous
you're gonna get.

252
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,166
How do you expect
to win the Golden Globe

253
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,708
if you're behaving like this?

254
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,916
[KYON]
I thought we were trying to be

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,708
the #1 event of the
festival or something.

256
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,750
[HARUHI]
Oh, yeah! Yuki!

257
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,416
Here! Hang onto this!

258
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,416
I changed your character
into an evil alien witch.

259
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,625
So, what do you think?

260
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,625
[KYON] She's already
rewriting the script!

261
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:36,250
I guess Nagato's powers could
be considered magical, though.

262
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,208
[HARUHI] Come on, Kyon!
Get the camera ready!

263
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,791
Right! Let's shoot a movie!

264
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,208
Here we go!

265
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,041
[KYON] God help us.
She looks like she's serious.

266
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:50,250
[HARUHI singing]

267
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,000
Huh?! The heck's that?!

268
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,916
Hey, Haruhi, wait a sec.

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,083
[HARUHI]
Hm?

270
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,541
It's just... I don't think
it's a good idea

271
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,416
for these two to get on
the train dressed like this.

272
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't see
anything wrong with it.

273
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,583
There definitely is!

274
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,375
Uh-uh! If they were butt-naked,
then yeah, they'd get arrested,

275
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,333
but they're both
wearing clothes.

276
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,375
Or maybe, you'd prefer
the bunny-girl outfit!

277
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,041
Oh, you shoulda said so earlier.

278
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,250
[KYON]
After going to all the trouble

279
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,500
to find this waitress costume,

280
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,541
I'm shocked to
hear you say that!

281
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,291
Wait, didn't you say
her being a waitress

282
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,791
was part of the concept?

283
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,000
Right now, what's important is

284
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,500
your ability to
adapt to the situation.

285
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,750
Adaptability is how all life on
this planet evolved, right?

286
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,541
And if you don't evolve,
you're gonna get left behind.

287
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,041
[KYON] Then if the
planet were sentient,

288
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,333
it would have chucked Haruhi
way out into space by now.

289
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,375
[train screeches]

290
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,708
[HARUHI]
Look! The train's here!

291
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,708
Come on, Mikuru! Stop stalling!

292
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,583
[MIKURU sobs]

293
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,375
[HARUHI]
Hey, there! We're here!

294
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,083
[SHOPKEEPER]
Oh, and right on time, I see.

295
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,250
Is this the same girl
from yesterday?

296
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,666
I didn't recognize her.

297
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,875
[laughs]

298
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:00,958
[SHOPKEEPER]
Okay then, you better get to it!

299
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,333
Just leave everything to us!

300
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,666
All right, people!

301
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,875
We're gonna have a quick
meeting, so gather 'round.

302
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,666
Here's the deal,
we're gonna shoot a commercial!

303
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:14,875
[ALL]
Huh?

304
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,000
[giggling]

305
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,000
Hi... Um, this store is neat,

306
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,083
and the owner's a really
friendly person, too...

307
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,000
H-He's a really nice guy, too!

308
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,083
And, um, they've been
in business a long time,

309
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,125
ever since Mr. Eijiro's
grandpa opened it.

310
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,416
It's all right here,
from batteries to refrigerators,

311
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,833
they have it all!

312
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,125
And, um... Anyway, come on down
to Ohmori Electronics,

313
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,125
where good deals
are made every day!

314
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,583
[HARUHI]
Okay! Cut it!

315
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,208
I'm just not feeling
the emotion in this scene.

316
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,041
The vibe's all wrong, but I'm
not sure how to tweak it.

317
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,083
[CHILD]
Mama, what's that?

318
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,375
[PASSERBY]
Shh, those are crazy people.

319
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,291
[gasps] I've got it!

320
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,291
[KYON]
Oh, for the love of God,

321
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,875
please don't "get"
anything else!

322
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,041
A waitress doesn't belong
outside an electronics store!

323
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,416
[KYON]
That's what you "got"?!

324
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,000
Gimme that small bag
over there, Koizumi. I need it.

325
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,583
[KOIZUMI]
Right.

326
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,125
[KYON] "Give me a camera
and I'll put a commercial

327
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,041
for your store
in the middle of the movie!"

328
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,375
"Sounds good!"

329
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,750
That's the conversation
Haruhi and the owner had.

330
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,666
Cut down to
five seconds, though.

331
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,333
[HARUHI]
C'mere, Mikuru!

332
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,625
What a relief!

333
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,125
Doesn't look like I'm gonna
get any lines in this today.

334
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,291
[KYON]
Hm?

335
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,333
You see, I'm also
supposed to be acting

336
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,625
in my class's stage production
for the arts festival.

337
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,791
Thing is, I've having a little
trouble remembering my lines.

338
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,375
You don't say...

339
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,291
I'd actually prefer it if the
role I'm playing in the movie

340
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,333
didn't have too much dialogue.

341
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,083
I know! What if you took over
the lead role for me?

342
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,083
Haruhi's the one to talk to
about the casting decisions.

343
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,875
If you want to switch with me,
you should probably talk to her.

344
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,583
Do you honestly think
I'm capable of

345
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,833
doing something so frightening?

346
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,833
After all, these are
Miss Suzumiya's orders.

347
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,333
Imagine the consequences
if I disobeyed her.

348
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,625
That's something
I don't wanna think about.

349
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,250
That makes two of us then.

350
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,875
Now you know why
I'm just standing here,

351
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,000
biting my lip
and running the camera.

352
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,208
[HARUHI]
We're back!

353
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,958
[gasps]

354
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,375
[KYON]
Whoa!

355
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,875
It's the return of Miss
Asahina's greatest costume ever!

356
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,458
The flawless bunny girl!

357
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,791
[sighs]

358
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,000
Last time I saw her
in that was six months ago.

359
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,958
So much has happened since then.

360
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,708
Looking back, they're all
such fond memories now.

361
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,791
Yeah! Like hell they are!

362
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,916
[HARUHI]
Okay! Now that's much better!

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,916
There's nothing like a hot
bunny girl to sell a product!

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,041
Get ready! We're gonna
take it from the top!

365
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,916
Kyon, fire up the camera.

366
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,083
[HARUHI]
Take two's up!

367
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,291
[beep]

368
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,458
[HARUHI giggling]

369
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,041
[KYON] Anyway,
we wrapped the commercial

370
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,916
for the electronics store.

371
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,541
Our day wasn't over though.

372
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,375
If you recall, there was
another sponsor we visited.

373
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,708
We were trudging
over there right now.

374
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,166
[HARUHI]
Okay, Mikuru, you ready?

375
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,541
Do it just like before.

376
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,833
There wasn't anything wrong
with your performance.

377
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,541
[KYON]
Everything was wrong with it!

378
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,000
And... action!

379
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:06,875
[beep]

380
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,875
Ah... I'm standing here in front

381
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,291
of Keiji Yamatsuchi's
Model Shop.

382
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,458
He opened it last year

383
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,333
after quitting his
dead-end corporate job!

384
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,208
And... models were his hobby,

385
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,458
so he figured
why not open a store?

386
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:24,708
Unfortunately, his sales
have been down for a while...

387
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,000
And... compared to last year,

388
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:32,666
his first-half earnings for this
year are down about 80%...

389
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,375
And so, everyone should
come down here

390
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,875
and buy lots of models!

391
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,000
Thank you!

392
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,625
[sighs]

393
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,041
Huh? You want me to hold it?

394
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,083
[MIKURU]
Y-You should never shoot this

395
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,791
while pointing it
at other people.

396
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,375
You should only shoot
empty cans with it.

397
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,541
Huh? You want me to shoot?

398
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,333
--[gunshots]
--[MIKURU wailing]

399
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,083
And... cut it!

400
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,833
[HARUHI] Not too shabby
for a day of shooting.

401
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:08,125
But get ready 'cause tomorrow,
we start on the movie!

402
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,458
We've already got 15 minutes
worth of commercials

403
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,541
in the camera.

404
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,583
How long is this movie
supposed to be?!

405
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,416
We'll just shoot as
much footage as we can,

406
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,291
and then figure it out
when we edit.

407
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,666
Cutting it together on the
computer should be a snap!

408
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,958
[KYON] And who's gonna be
doing all this "snapping"?

409
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,666
I have a feeling "editor"
was one of the jobs

410
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,833
that was listed under my name.

411
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,666
Tomorrow's Saturday
and there's no school,

412
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,041
so I want everyone
to show up on time.

413
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,791
We'll meet at
Kitaguchi Station at 9 am.

414
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,416
Hang on a sec, Haruhi.

415
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,583
Don't you think you should maybe

416
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,000
do something about
Miss Asahina's costume?

417
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,583
There's gotta be something
else should could wear

418
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,333
that's a little more...
appropriate for fighting.

419
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,083
Maybe something like a
plugsuit or a stealth suit.

420
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,541
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

421
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,958
Then there would be no surprise

422
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,958
when she actually
started fighting!

423
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,583
I want the audience to freak out

424
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,166
when this timid little
waitress starts kicking butt!

425
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,791
It gets their attention!

426
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,750
That's what a
concept's all about!

427
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,041
[KYON]
I wonder if she even understands

428
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,375
the meaning of
the word "concept."

429
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,500
Thanks for explaining
what a concept's about.

430
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,666
We all know she's
from the future,

431
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,250
but why's it so
important to the story?

432
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,041
Uh... That is--I--
I mean her character!

433
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,291
Her character doesn't have
to be from the future, does she?

434
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,500
[HARUHI]
Don't worry.

435
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,000
Those are details
we can figure out

436
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,041
when we get to that
point in the story.

437
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,750
And, if we can't
figure something out,

438
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,291
we just ignore it.

439
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,625
As long as it's entertaining,
it's gonna be cool!

440
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,666
[growls]

441
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,958
But for that to work,

442
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,083
it's gotta be entertaining
in the first place!

443
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,166
There's no point in making this

444
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,250
if you're the only
being entertained!

445
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,958
Are you trying to
get a Golden Raspberry

446
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,541
for amateur film-making?!

447
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,500
Are you kidding?

448
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,125
We've only got one goal:

449
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,125
To be the #1 event in
the arts festival this year.

450
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,416
And after that, we're aimin'
for the Golden Globes, too!

451
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,416
Show me the script then.

452
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,791
I wanna see how
it's coming along.

453
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:48,750
[gasps]

454
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,250
Don't worry about that.

455
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,416
I've got all that stuff
right up here.

456
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,083
The script and the
storyboards are done,

457
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,500
and they're all ready to go!

458
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,541
See?

459
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,333
You don't have
to do any thinking!

460
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,666
If that's the way you want it.

461
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,416
[KYON] You don't have
to do any thinking either.

462
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,875
Sit and stare out
the window for all I care.

463
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,500
You could be as cute
as Miss Asahina

464
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,583
if you could just figure out

465
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,416
how to be more
pleasant to deal with.

466
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,916
Hm? What?

467
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,166
It's nothing.

468
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,708
Okay, guys, let's get
fired up for tomorrow!

469
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:19,250
The only way to grab the glory
is to have a positive attitude!

470
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,458
When you free yourself from
the stuff that holds you back,

471
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,541
your hidden strengths
will be revealed!

472
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,791
Then, you'll be able to tap
into unimaginable powers!

473
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,458
[KYON] You sound like
a character in a manga

474
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,291
unleashing a counter-attack.

475
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,666
[CHILD]
Look! It's a balloon!

476
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,416
[KYON]
The next day,

477
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,125
we were about to find
ourselves thrown into

478
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,375
the middle of some totally
bizarre situation that--

479
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,666
Wait, I lost my
train of thought.

480
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,583
What did Haruhi say again?

481
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,916
Something like,
"When you free yourself from

482
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,791
the stuff that's
holding you back,

483
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,291
your hidden strengths
will be revealed,

484
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,791
and you'll tap into
unimaginable powers."

485
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:54,666
[KYON sighs]

486
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,750
Yeah, but Haruhi, you did it.

487
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,333
You have that kind of power.

488
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,208
You just can't ever
find out about it.

489
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,958
You're late again!

490
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,875
It's not even 9:00 yet.

491
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,500
You're the last to show up.

492
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,500
As punishment,
you're gonna pay for lunch!

493
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, whatever.

494
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,666
I have decided to cover
everyone's bus fare.

495
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,625
It's a necessary expense.

496
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,166
[KYON sighs]

497
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,041
Thank you.

498
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,208
Oh, yeah! I need to put this on!

499
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,500
[KYON]
Huh?

500
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,166
You're wearing your
uniform on Saturdays now?

501
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,333
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

502
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,416
She told me yesterday
I had to wear it.

503
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,583
It's for my part.

504
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,958
Since I'm supposed
to be an ESPer

505
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,916
disguised as an ordinary
high school student,

506
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,916
the uniform is essential
to the character.

507
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,708
[KYON]
So you're just playing yourself.

508
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,375
[HARUHI]
There, that should do it.

509
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,583
Okay, guys,
the bus stop's over there!

510
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,166
Come on, Kyon! Hurry up!

511
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:48,916
[sighs]

512
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,750
[chuckles]

513
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,375
[KYON] After half an hour of
rattling around on a bus,

514
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,166
and another half
hour of walking,

515
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,000
we ended up at a location that
could only be described as...

516
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,750
...the place where
no one ever goes.

517
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,500
Man, it's hot. It's hot.

518
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,083
[MIKURU]
Um...

519
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,375
Would you like some?

520
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,041
I hope you don't mind,
I drank out of it first.

521
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,583
Thanks! I'll totally have some!

522
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,125
[gasps]

523
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,125
You can have a
drink later, got it?

524
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,666
That goes for you, too!

525
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,916
You don't have time
to be givin' the PAs a drink

526
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,166
when we've got
so much work to do today!

527
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,458
As soon as the camera
comes out, we shoot!

528
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,250
Get changed!

529
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,541
[whimpers]
But I--

530
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,166
No one's gonna see you...

531
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,458
Just go behind
a tree or something!

532
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,333
Uh, thank you!

533
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,666
Hey, no peeking!

534
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,083
I wouldn't dare.

535
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,291
Ta-da!

536
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,250
It's a colored contact!

537
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,958
It's super important for
any self-respecting heroine

538
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,750
to have different colored eyes.

539
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,833
If one eye's different,

540
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,875
it enhances the
character's mystique!

541
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,750
Besides, it's symbolic,
so there!

542
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,250
It's all about the
secret behind her blue eye!

543
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay... But it wouldn't
really make sense

544
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,125
if her eyes were different
colors for no reason, right?

545
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,166
So, what's the secret?

546
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,708
It's still a secret!

547
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,291
[KYON]
Huh?

548
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,666
Come on, Mikuru. Now's not the
time for you to get cold feet!

549
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,333
[HARUHI]
Oh, come on, Mikuru!

550
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,500
Don't be so shy, keep running!

551
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,583
Get into the character!
Become the heroine!

552
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,083
Let's try it one more time
from the top, okay?

553
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,291
Huh?

554
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,666
[whimpering]

555
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,000
[KYON] So... It looks like this
is our opening sequence, folks.

556
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,291
I was expecting to see a script
or at least a treatment by now.

557
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,916
But Haruhi said
there wasn't gonna be one.

558
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,541
If I wrote it down
and it got leaked,

559
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,500
it would be the
worst thing ever!

560
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,166
[KYON]
That's the reason she gave.

561
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,416
I wonder when this turned
into a Hong Kong production.

562
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,041
Okay! Hit me one more time!

563
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,666
Just like you did in take three!

564
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,250
[MIKURU whines]

565
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,458
[HARUHI] Next up,
we got the fight scene

566
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,708
between Mikuru and Yuki!

567
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,666
Mikuru, empty your clips
into Yuki, okay?

568
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,125
What? But I thought
you weren't supposed to

569
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,541
shoot anyone with these.

570
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,083
No, it's okay!

571
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,541
I doubt that you're even gonna
hit her, so just fire away!

572
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,000
Besides, Yuki can
dodge the pellets

573
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,916
if they get too close to her!

574
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,875
Go on.

575
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:06,916
Shoot me.

576
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,500
[HARUHI]
See? She's cool with it!

577
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:09,666
Light her up!

578
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,500
Oh, but don't fire them
at the same time.

579
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:15,041
Alternate. It's the basic
technique of two-gun shoot-outs!

580
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,083
[MIKURU whimpering]

581
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:24,333
--[pellets firing]
--[MIKURU whimpering]

582
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Yeah, sure,
I guess that'll work.

583
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,125
[KYON sighs]

584
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,458
Can I say something?

585
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,166
This doesn't seem like a movie.

586
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,500
I have no idea
what's going on or anything.

587
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,541
Don't worry.

588
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,791
It'll all come
together in editing

589
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,000
after a little cutting
and pasting, you'll see.

590
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,041
And who's gonna be doing all
this "cutting and pasting," huh?

591
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,666
You could at least put
some dialogue in the movie.

592
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,833
It's okay.
We'll take out the sound

593
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,708
and stick the dialogue in later.

594
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:50,416
I wanna put in some cool sound
effects and music anyway.

595
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,458
Don't think so hard,
just go with the flow.

596
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,125
[sighs]

597
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,375
[KYON] Yeah, well, since
the story's all in your head,

598
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,833
I guess there's nothing
for us to think about...

599
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,708
...even if we wanted to.
