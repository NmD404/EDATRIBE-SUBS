00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:37,791
[chattering]

2
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,791
[KYON] The arts festival and
its chaotic aftermath were over.

3
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,750
The mountains winds are
beginning to whip up,

4
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,458
and you can just hear
the footsteps of winter

5
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,750
drawing ever closer.

6
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,333
December is almost upon us.

7
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,416
Now this old building,

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,625
also known as
the club room wing,

9
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,625
has been here since
the school was built.

10
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,291
And thanks in part
to its thin walls,

11
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,833
even though we were inside,

12
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,000
you could still feel the chill
right down to your bones.

13
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:11,916
[gasps]

14
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,875
[KYON]
The SOS Brigade always seems

15
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,791
to get involved
with strange things.

16
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,125
Well, actually, I'm the one

17
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,166
getting involved
with strange things.

18
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,875
But even so, it's
not something weird

19
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,166
has to happen to us
on a daily basis.

20
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,166
Besides, if life dropped a
crazy bomb on me every day,

21
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,791
my body wouldn't take it.
And it'd just crumble.

22
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,250
It would be even
worse for my mood.

23
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,375
[sighs]

24
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:42,291
[KYON] Still, when Haruhi isn't
around, it's really quiet.

25
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,750
It's kinda nice.

26
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,375
[KYON] Then again,
maybe it's a bit too quiet.

27
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,041
[KYON]
Come to think of it,

28
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,416
it's been six months since

29
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,208
I first met Haruhi,
Miss Asahina, and the others.

30
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,375
[KYON] We've been
through a lot together.

31
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,458
And sure, Haruhi's
provoked a lot of it,

32
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,375
but not necessarily all of it.

33
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,875
Well, either way,
one thing's for sure.

34
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,291
It was always at times like this

35
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,000
when we were just
kicking back and relaxing

36
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,458
that Haruhi would
bust through that door--

37
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,833
Everyone! Listen up!

38
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,750
I've got some really good news!

39
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,458
[KYON]
What? Again?

40
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,750
Whenever Haruhi describes
something as being "good,"

41
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,083
news or otherwise, rarely has
that ever been the case.

42
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,541
And that's especially true
for Miss Asahina and myself.

43
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,958
What is it this time?

44
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,250
I've got everything all
set up to get us a heater

45
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,291
for this ice box of a room.

46
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,291
Oh! Your tea!

47
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,666
You know that appliance store
that sponsored our movie?

48
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,500
Well, I just got the owner
to give us a heater for free!

49
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,625
He called me up and said
he had an extra heater

50
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,500
he wanted to get rid of!
It's a model from last year,

51
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,166
and it's been sitting
in storage so long,

52
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,708
they forgot they had it!

53
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,916
[KYON]
I just can't believe

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
there's an appliance
store owner out there

55
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,458
who's both willing
and kind enough

56
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,708
to call Haruhi and
offer her anything.

57
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,208
I'm sure she must've forced
the deal on him somehow.

58
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,458
Okay, Kyon! I want you
to go to the store

59
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,041
and pick it up for us right now.

60
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,666
Right now? Like now-now?

61
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,125
Right. You, now, right now.

62
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,208
[KYON]
Lemme get this straight:

63
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,625
You want me to go
down the mountain,

64
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,000
the one I have to climb up
and down every morning.

65
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,000
You want me to go down
that thing right now

66
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,208
to an appliance store that is
two whole train stations away,

67
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,250
pick up a heater, and then
lug that thing back here?

68
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,625
That's right!

69
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,625
'Cause if you don't, the guy
might change his mind,

70
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,375
and then we're
out a free heater!

71
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,375
Don't complain,
just hurry up and go!

72
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,166
You're bored anyway, aren't ya?!

73
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,333
[KYON]
Oh, that's great.

74
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,541
Sitting in this room was enough

75
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,458
to label you as
being bored, nice.

76
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,250
Aren't you bored?
Why don't you do it?

77
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,833
I can't!

78
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,625
There's something important I
need to take care of right now.

79
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,125
[laughs]

80
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,166
[MIKURU]
Hm?

81
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,750
[HARUHI]
Koizumi is the deputy chief,

82
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,583
and you're just a
rank and file member.

83
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,583
That's the deal in
every group I know of.

84
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,541
The grunts always
work their butts off.

85
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,041
Naturally, the SOS Brigade
totally supports that policy.

86
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,291
[KYON]
Oh, well...

87
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,041
For once, Haruhi's made
a reasonable request.

88
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,208
I give up.

89
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,250
[KOIZUMI]
Please do be careful out there.

90
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,458
[KYON]
Besides, I was just thinking

91
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,666
how this place could
use a heater anyway.

92
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,208
[KYON] If she's going to force
Miss Asahina or Nagato to go,

93
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,000
then I'll go.

94
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,958
[MIKURU]
Oh...

95
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,291
Hold on!

96
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,333
[KYON gasps]

97
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,500
I heard it's going
to be chilly today!

98
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:21,458
Thank you.

99
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,708
Hurry up and go!

100
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,125
--Go on, get going!
--[MIKURU gasps]

101
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,166
[KYON sighs]

102
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,791
[HARUHI] Well, now that
he's outta the way,

103
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,333
[MIKURU]
Huh?

104
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,916
[HARUHI] Mikuru, I wanna take
a couple of pictures of you.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,250
Do you mind posing?

106
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,416
[MIKURU] Huh?! What are
the pictures gonna be for?

107
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,958
It's for the DVD!

108
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,083
I'm gonna make a DVD of "The
Adventures of Mikuru Asahina."

109
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,708
And I still need to
shoot a sexy cover for it.

110
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,500
Wha... You mean you're really
going to go through with that?

111
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,375
B-But I thought you said
you weren't going to.

112
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,916
[HARUHI] I just said that 'cause
Kyon was naggin' me about it.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,500
But now that I got rid of him,
nothing's gonna stop me.

114
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,083
[MIKURU whimpers]

115
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,125
[KOIZUMI sighs]

116
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,166
[KYON] The first day
I had to climb this hill

117
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,875
to get to school, I hated it.

118
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,500
But after walking up
and down the thing

119
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,375
for the last six months,
I've gotten used to it.

120
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,250
I've gotten used to A.,
hiking to and from school,

121
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,250
and B., the SOS Brigade.

122
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,291
Funny how that works.

123
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,375
[KYON]
Hm...

124
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,291
I wonder what Haruhi's
doing right now,

125
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,166
since I'm not around.

126
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,458
I just hope she's not bored
and treating Miss Asahina

127
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,500
like some kind of
toy or something.

128
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,791
[HARUHI] Koizumi!
Hold the bounce card for me.

129
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,250
[KOIZUMI]
Right, got it.

130
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,875
[HARUHI]
Mikuru, stop spacing out! Pose!

131
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,375
Come on, pose! Pose!

132
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,250
[MIKURU]
Uh... O-Okay...

133
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,583
[HARUHI] Come on, smile like
you're flirting with a cute guy.

134
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,458
More seductive! Come on!

135
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,125
That's not gonna cut
it for the male fans.

Get sultry, girl!

have to take it off anyway.

are even bigger!

confidence in yourself.

We have to finish
shooting this stuff today!

173
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,708
Come on!

174
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,333
[MIKURU whimpering]

175
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,375
[HARUHI sighs]

176
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,791
[KYON sniffles]

177
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,833
[HARUHI]
Put this one on next!

178
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,250
[MIKURU] But this nurse
outfit and that one...

179
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,041
Um... I don't really remember

180
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,625
wearing either one
of them in the movie.

181
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,208
Are these pictures we're taking
really for the cover of the DVD?

182
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,750
[HARUHI]
Yeah! Of course they are!

183
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,125
But I just came up
with another idea!

184
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,875
With all these photos,
we can publish a picture book!

185
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,916
What do you think
about that, Koizumi?

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,916
[KOIZUMI]
I think it's a great idea.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,958
[MIKURU]
Uh...

188
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,208
No! Wait!

189
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,458
The DVD needs a bonus
features section!

190
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,125
We could put these
pictures there!

191
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,708
What do you think about
that idea, Koizumi?

192
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,500
[KOIZUMI]
I think it's a fantastic idea.

193
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,541
[MIKURU cries]

194
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,458
[MIKURU whimpers]

195
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,708
[HARUHI]
Stick your arm in there!

196
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,083
Looks like we might be in for

197
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,833
a little bit of
rain today, doesn't it?

198
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:34,708
[HARUHI]
Nice!

199
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,083
It's the funniest thing ever.

200
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,083
You're kidding!

201
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,708
Well, no, not really.

202
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,750
[GIRLS laugh]

203
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,458
[HARUHI]
Heh, heh, good! Next outfit!

204
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,916
What?! We've got more outfits?

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,416
[HARUHI]
Just gotta find the zipper...

206
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,125
[MIKURU whimpering]

207
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,750
[HARUHI laughs]

208
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,583
[MIKURU screams]

209
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,083
[MIKURU]
No! I-I need that!

210
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,791
[HARUHI] I want a shot of you
flashing some panty at us!

211
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,041
So these have to go! And soon!

212
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:05,833
Ha, ha! This is so fun!
Taking all your clothes off!

213
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,708
[MIKURU screams]

214
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,041
Well, there's the
heater I promised her.

215
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,791
Can you carry it back okay?

216
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,541
Oh, yeah. I think I can manage.

217
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,875
And about the girls,

218
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,875
how are those three cutie
pies doin' these days?

219
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,250
Pretty good. The energetic one's
starting to get on my nerves.

220
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,333
The commercial
help business any?

221
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,541
Honestly, I haven't seen
any difference so far.

222
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,750
[KYON]
Figures.

223
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,166
Putting a commercial
in the middle of a movie

224
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,791
showing at a high
school arts festival

225
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,583
isn't what you'd call a
stroke of marketing genius.

226
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,416
I'm surprised this guy
actually sponsored it.

227
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
That reminds me.

228
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,833
When the energetic
one called today,

229
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,875
she mentioned something
about a sequel.

230
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,083
Is it true? Are you really
going to make another movie?

231
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,916
Well, if she says we're
making another movie,

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,375
we're making another movie.

233
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,958
She asked if I'd
want to sponsor it,

234
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,083
and I told her I'd be
happy to, so... [laughs]

235
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,583
So I guess you can consider
this heater my donation

236
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,625
to your next cinematic wonder.

237
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,666
[KYON]
So that's how she got it.

238
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,958
Guess I'll head back now.

239
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,375
Thank you very much
for the heater.

240
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,333
No worries, take care!

241
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,500
[STUDENTS]
Ameobas are red, a-i-u-e-o!

242
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:18,500
Little shrimp in floating moss,
swimming to and fro!

243
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:22,875
Persimmon tree, chestnut tree,
ka-ki-ku-ke-ko!

244
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,416
A woodpecker pecking at
a dead zelkova tree just so!

245
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,708
Pour some vinegar on cowpeas,
sa-shi-su-se-so!

246
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:38,666
I stabbed a fish in a stream
that was very, very shallow!

247
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,833
We all stand up when the trumpet
blows, ta-chi-tsu-te-to!

248
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,166
[TEACHER] When we stood,
it flew off with a...

249
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,916
[STUDENTS]
Konk-konk-konk-konk-boom!

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,375
A slow crawls very slow,
na-ni-nu-ne-no!

251
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,250
[TEACHER]
Na-ni-nu-ne-no!

252
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:01,000
[STUDENT A]
Aha! So you are the culprit!

253
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,583
[STUDENT B] Oh, the red
player has picked number 14!

254
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,666
Very well, I wonder how that's
going to affect the game today!

255
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,833
Next question!

256
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,875
[STUDENT C]
Amazing! Just by showing up,

257
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,458
she's changed the
atmosphere on the stage!

258
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,750
But she seems completely
different, doesn't she?

259
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,958
She's not the same as
she was a few minutes ago!

260
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,416
What a terrifying little girl!

261
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,625
[STUDENT D]
Tanmen noodle set!

262
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,666
Fried rice set!

263
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,416
Tempura and cold soba set!

264
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,333
[STUDENT E]
Young man, ace!

265
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,083
Middle aged, ace!

266
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,208
Retirement, ace!

267
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,625
Non-promoted, ace!

268
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,583
Next year, ace!

269
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,583
Unfortunate, ace!

270
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,875
I love it after all, ace!

271
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,916
[STUDENT F] Why don't you
do your best to beat me?!

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,541
Bring it on!

273
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,166
What you guys have done
is snappy, crackly,

274
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,708
and totally obvious to us!

275
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,000
He looks like a child!

276
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,875
But he's pretty
subtle on the inside.

277
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,625
A powerful ally all over town!

278
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,583
[STUDENT G]
Now, now, now, now!

279
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,791
Can you not see this
crest that I hold?

280
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:11,791
[STUDENT H] Because...
I... am ze queen of France!

281
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,666
[STUDENT I]
Now that hit a weird spot!

282
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,625
[STUDENT J]
You've still got a way's to go!

283
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:22,583
[Student H singing]

284
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,583
[STUDENT K] Hello! We're
the Arctic Sea ice candies!

285
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,958
[STUDENT L]
Bang.

286
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,083
[STUDENT K] You know, Yuki,
you're as sexy as ever!

287
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,291
[STUDENT L]
Where are you lookin', pervert?

288
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,583
I'm callin' the cops.

289
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,916
[STUDENT K]
Starting with a low blow?

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,166
I feel like I've been accused of

291
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,958
groping people on
a crammed train.

292
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,625
[STUDENT L] Yeah.
By the way, it's winter now.

293
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,625
[STUDENT K]
Right, it's winter.

294
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,666
And speaking of winter--

295
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,833
[STUDENT L]
Baseball's off season.

296
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,041
[STUDENT K]
Cool point there, Yuki.

297
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,625
Why, even the WBC is
shaking in their cleats!

298
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,041
[STUDENT L]
I'm really looking forward to

299
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,416
seeing who gets the pink slip.

300
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,041
[STUDENT K] That's a really
dark way of enjoying it.

301
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,375
But okay!

302
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,708
Well, you know! It's almost
Christmas, isn't it?

303
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,333
[STUDENT L]
I wanna eat a hot pot.

304
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,500
[STUDENT K]
Right!

305
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,125
You can't do without
hot pots in winter!

306
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,916
[STUDENT L]
What do you put in your hot pot?

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,250
[STUDENT K]
Let's see!

308
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,750
Nappa cabbage, chicken,
pork, leeks, natto, tofu!

309
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,083
Well, what about you, Yuki?

310
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,250
[STUDENT L]
Brown bear.

311
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,833
[STUDENT K]
Wow, Yuki! You're a hunter?

312
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,875
Even Masaki would
cry and run away!

313
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,791
[STUDENT L] Yeah, but I think
about how the bear feels.

314
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,416
I feel sorry for it
and lose my appetite.

315
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,166
[STUDENT K] Then don't
put it into your hot pot

316
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,541
to begin with, woman!

317
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,666
[STUDENT L] I'll play
the part of the brown bear.

318
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,750
[STUDENT K]
What? You will?

319
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,958
[STUDENT L]
And you play the pot.

320
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,083
[STUDENT K]
Here it comes, folks!

321
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,625
The worst comedy
skit in history!

322
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,625
Get ready!

323
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,833
[TANIGUCHI]
Hey, Kyon!

324
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,750
What are you lurkin'
around down here for?

325
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,333
It's obvious, isn't it?

326
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,541
I'm carrying stuff around.

327
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,375
Hah! You sure are a hard worker!

328
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,750
You're running errands
for Suzumiya, aren't you?

329
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,208
[KYON] I guess six months was
all it took for my classmates to

330
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,458
fully comprehend the situation
I've gotten myself into.

331
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,541
Are you takin' that
thing back to school?

332
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,166
Oh, wow! You're a hard worker!

333
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,208
You're telling me.

334
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,791
--Well, see ya.
--Yeah.

335
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,750
See ya tomorrow!

336
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,791
[KYON]
Mm.

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,791
Damn!

338
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,208
Now it's gonna start raining!

339
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,416
[KYON]
The weather forecast said

340
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,666
there was only a 10%
chance of rain today.

341
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,041
Yet another thing
that can't be trusted.

342
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,250
I hope it doesn't
turn into a downpour.

343
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,541
[KOIZUMI]
Oh.

344
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,125
Looks like it started raining.

345
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,083
[MIKURU]
I wonder if Kyon's all right.

346
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,208
[KYON] I've never wanted to be
in that room more than I do now.

347
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,750
First thing I'm gonna
do is grab myself

348
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,625
a cup of Miss Asahina's
tea and warm up my body.

349
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,416
Along with my heart.

350
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,500
[TSURUYA]
Yoo-hoo!

351
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,166
Hey, is Mikuru here?

352
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,375
Nagato? Are you
the only one here?

353
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,208
I wanna see if she'll
trade cleaning duties

354
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,583
with me tomorrow.
So I came to ask her.

355
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,458
Do you know where she is?

356
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,291
Oh, she's over there, huh?

357
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,541
Cool, thanks!

358
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,666
[KYON grunts]

359
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,125
[STUDENT M]
To the left!

360
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,916
[STUDENTS] Right, left,
right, left, right, left!

361
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,250
[STUDENT M]
To the right!

362
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,958
[STUDENTS] Right, left,
right, left, right, left!

363
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,333
[STUDENT M]
Stand in place!

364
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,875
[STUDENTS] Right, left,
right, left, right, left!

365
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,333
[STUDENT M]
Side to side!

00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,166
[sighs]

369
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,125
Oh, brother.

370
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,416
[footsteps]

371
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,750
Hey, Kyon! Were you out
running errands again?

372
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,625
Miss Tsuruya!

373
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,583
That's why!

374
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,166
Huh? What do you mean?

375
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,250
[TSURUYA giggles]
Nope, nothing at all!

376
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,000
You hard worker!

377
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,666
Hm... You're soaked to the bone.

378
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,250
Here!

379
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,083
--Thank you.
--Well, see ya!

380
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,666
Just give my
handkerchief to Mikuru

381
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,250
when you return her scarf.

382
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,291
[TSURUYA laughs]

383
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,500
[KYON]
I don't think I'll ever get

384
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,416
what's going on
in that girl's head.

385
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,083
She's a nice person
though, I'll say that.

386
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,750
[KYON grunts]

387
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,500
[KYON]
Oh, Nagato.

388
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,166
You're the only one here?

389
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,416
[KYON grunts]

390
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,666
So, where's Haruhi
and the others?

391
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,000
[MIKURU yelps]

392
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,333
[HARUHI]
Yeah! Now that's how

393
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,833
you're supposed
to land on your butt!

394
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,416
We got it! Moving on!

395
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,208
[MIKURU]
Uh...

396
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,375
[whimpers]

397
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,083
Ouchie!

398
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,250
--[cries]
--[HARUHI laughs]

399
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,833
[HARUHI] I'm in awe
of your clumsiness.

400
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,541
Are you doing this on purpose?

401
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,000
Koizumi! Take over for me.

402
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,208
This is how ya do it, like this.

403
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,416
[KYON]
I'm a little worried about

404
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,541
where the three of them are

405
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,250
and what they're
doing right now.

406
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,041
But schlepping that rotten
heater up that hill

407
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,083
really wore me out.

408
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,750
The worst part is,
I'm gonna have to

409
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,250
go right back down that hill
again when I go home!

410
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,916
How messed up is that?

411
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,708
[KYON]
Come on... Come on, come on.

412
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,375
Man! My hands are so cold.

413
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:24,750
[sighs]

414
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,250
[sighs]

415
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,500
I'm just so tired...

416
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:08,416
[snoring]

417
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,583
[HARUHI gasps]

418
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,958
Oh, Haruhi, it's only you.

419
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,500
Yeah, so?
Is that a problem?

420
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,833
No, I don't have
a problem with it.

421
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,416
You didn't go and
draw something silly

422
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,666
on my face this time, did you?

423
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,708
Of course not! I'm not
a little kid, Kyon!

424
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,500
Hey, where's everybody else?

425
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,916
[HARUHI] It didn't look
like you were gonna wake up

426
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,375
any time soon,
so they all went home.

427
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,333
But... you coulda
just gone home.

428
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,583
Why'd you stay behind?

429
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,916
I couldn't really help it!

430
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,583
You were still sleeping.
Whaddya want me to do?

431
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,375
I gotta lock the door
before I leave.

432
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,666
Besides, it's still
raining out there!

433
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,708
[KYON]
Uh.

434
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,291
[HARUHI]
Okay, hand it over.

435
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:19,875
Huh?

436
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,375
My cardigan!

437
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,833
[KYON]
Uh... Oh.

438
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,375
[KYON] Okay... So that
one belongs to Haruhi.

439
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,958
But... who does this
other sweater belong to?

440
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,541
[KYON] Whoa, that means
that Miss Asahina was

441
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,458
changing clothes right next
to me while I was sleeping!

442
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,750
Dammit! Why did I
have to fall asleep?!

443
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,791
If I pretended to be asleep,
I could've seen--

444
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,208
Well? Everyone left
school a while ago.

445
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,750
Come on, let's get outta here.

446
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,083
Okay.

447
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,583
I'm kinda stuck though.

448
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,083
I didn't bring an
umbrella with me today.

449
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,583
[HARUHI] One'll be
enough for the two of us.

450
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,666
[HARUHI]
Aim that thing over here more.

451
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,958
I'm getting all wet.

452
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,416
But you've got a ton
of umbrella over there.

453
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,625
Uh! Oh, nice one.
This isn't even yours.

454
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,958
This thing's got "faculty"
stenciled on it.

455
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,333
[HARUHI]
It belongs to the school,

456
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,875
so there shouldn't be
anything wrong with

457
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,291
a couple of students
using it, right?

458
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,291
What? You wanna go
home all sopping wet?

459
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,500
Fine! Then I won't
let you use it!

460
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,708
[HARUHI laughs]

461
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,125
[KYON] Geez... I went
to all that trouble

462
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,291
bringing the heater back,

463
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,625
and little miss brigade
leader over there

464
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,375
can't even say, "Thank you."

465
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,000
Typical Haruhi.

466
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,708
Hey, wait up!

467
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:42,916
[laughs]

468
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,958
Unn!
