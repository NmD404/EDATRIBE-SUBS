1
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,708
[KYON] Something's wrong...
That's what it felt like anyway.

2
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,583
[KYON] I didn't care about
the baseball game on TV

3
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,958
because it was between
schools from another town.

4
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,000
But, because I tend to
symphatize with underdogs,

5
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,416
I ended up rooting
for the losing team.

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,833
And it was right about then,

7
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:51,166
that I suddenly got the
feeling Haruhi was gonna call.

8
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,666
[phone rings]

9
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,583
Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

10
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,833
I know; you don't
have to tell me.

11
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,625
[HARUHI]
Hey, you're free, right? Good.

12
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,791
Meet us at 2:00 in front of
the station. And don't be late!

13
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:07,000
[dial tone]

14
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,750
[KYON] I didn't even have
a chance to say anything.

15
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,083
[phone rings]

16
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,000
[KYON]
Now what?

17
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,500
[HARUHI]
I forgot to tell you,

18
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,041
make sure to bring your swim
trunks and some money, too.

19
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,333
Oh, wait, wait. And your bike.
Definitely bring your bike.

20
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,166
That's it. Over and out!

21
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,333
--[dial tone]
--[KYON] Mhm.

22
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,541
That was weird.

23
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,375
It was like I knew what
Haruhi was gonna say

24
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,125
before she even said anything.

25
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,291
Hang on... Actually,
it felt more like

26
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,250
we'd had the exact same
conversation before,

27
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,208
like déjà vu or something.

28
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,375
[COMMENTATOR]
And the pitch...

29
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,250
[metal clink]

30
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,416
[KYON'S SISTER gasps]

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,583
[COMMENTATOR]
It's a big, fat hit!

32
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,458
[KYON]
Summer's almost over...

33
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,541
[HARUHI]
You're late again, Kyon!

34
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,458
Where is your motivation?

35
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,208
[KYON]
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,125
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

37
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,791
No worries. I just
got here, too.

38
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,000
[HARUHI] Now that we're all
present and accounted for,

39
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,333
we can go!

40
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,625
Where to?

41
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,791
To the public swimming pool!
Where do ya think?

42
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,208
[KYON] That figures...
considering the stuff I brought.

43
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,916
We've got lots and lots of
summer vacation-y things

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,541
to do during our summer break!

45
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,333
But, we've only so
much time because

46
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,291
once it's gone,
it's gone for good!

47
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,708
So we're gonna do everything
we can, while we can

48
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,125
during our only summer
as tenth graders!

49
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,208
And for starters, we're riding
the bikes to the pool!

50
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,291
Okay. Did everyone
ride their bikes today?

51
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,791
No... The only bikes
we have to ride over

52
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,375
are the ones you and I brought.

53
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,416
[KYON]
Huh?

54
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:03,125
All right, Kyon! You can't
let Koizumi beat you!

55
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,583
Come on! Full speed ahead!

56
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,625
[KYON]
No ESP allowed!

57
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:11,041
[HARUHI] Come on, guys,
hurry up and park your bikes.

58
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,750
Kyon! We're trying to
have fun, so stop acting tired!

59
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,375
[KYON]
And whose fault is that?!

60
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,875
[HARUHI]
Mmm, can you smell the chlorine?

61
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,125
That really makes
it feel like summer!

62
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,375
[HARUHI gasps]
Hurry and get in!

63
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,916
Come on, the water's warm!
It's perfect!

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,666
[KYON] Can't she see
the "no diving" signs?

65
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,833
They're everywhere!

66
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,583
Well, that looks like fun.
Don't you think?

67
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,541
I mean, seeing her enjoy
the day in a normal fashion.

68
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,208
It's a rather
charming sight, isn't it?

69
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,500
And as long as Miss Suzumiya's
having a good time here,

70
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,625
we don't have to worry about
any earth-shattering events.

71
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,083
[KYON]
I hope you're right.

72
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,041
[KYON]
What's wrong?

73
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,708
Oh, nothing.

74
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,208
It's probably my imagination.

75
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,708
Come on, let's go and
have some fun, too.

76
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,541
[MIKURU giggles]

77
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,375
[KYON] It's so bitter!
May I have another?

78
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,958
[KYON] That's weird. It's like
I've seen this before.

79
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,208
Nagato... sitting all alone,
looking bored...

80
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,458
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

81
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,916
[KYON] Yeah... And then Haruhi
shows up, and she says...

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,416
So, these two guys are
my brigade members.

83
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,666
They do what I say.

84
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,750
So if you want something,
you can ask them!

85
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:51,958
Time for some fun!

86
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,208
Let's play dodgeball
in the pool!

87
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,583
We're coming!

88
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,041
[KYON] Oh, well.
Sometimes déjà vu's happen.

89
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,333
[HARUHI] I've been thinking of
some fun things we could do!

90
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,708
Check it out!

91
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,041
[KYON]
What is that?

92
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,541
It's a schedule of
how we're gonna

93
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,791
spend the rest of
our summer vacation!

94
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,375
I realized something...

95
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,958
We've only got two more weeks
of summer vacation left to go!

96
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,208
That fact totally blew me away.

97
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,208
We've done a lot of cool things
but we've only got so much time,

98
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,000
and there's a bajillion
more things left to do!

99
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,291
So I say, we gotta
pick up the pace!

100
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,125
[KYON] We've got two
weeks to do all that?!

101
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,333
Mikuru, is there anything
else you wanna do?

102
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,666
[MIKURU]
Huh?

103
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,000
Um... I think I'd like to
try goldfish scooping?

104
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,333
[HARUHI] Okay!
Goldfish scooping, it is...

105
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,208
Could I see the list you made?

106
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,833
[KOIZUMI]
Hm.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay, thanks.

108
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,833
[HARUHI]
We'll start the list tomorrow!

109
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,750
Do you guys know if there's a
bon festival happening anywhere?

110
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,625
Or even a firework show?

111
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,958
I could check around for those.
I'll call you if I find one.

112
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,833
Don't forget about
goldfish scooping.

113
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,583
After all, it's Mikuru's
only request.

114
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,833
[KOIZUMI]
Okay, I'll get right on it.

115
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,291
That's it for today! See ya!

116
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,791
I'll be going, too.

117
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,458
[MIKURU]
Me too. Bye!

118
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,791
[KYON]
Nagato!

119
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,916
Hey, sorry, it's nothing
important or anything...

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,166
So, how have you been?
Is everything okay?

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,250
It is.

122
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,916
[KYON]
Oh! Good!

123
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,291
[KYON]
What was that all about?

124
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,333
Why'd I want to talk to her?

125
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,375
[ANNOUNCER] May I have
your attention, please.

126
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,208
We have a lost child...

127
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,750
[KYON]
A bon festival, huh?

128
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,416
Figures it'd be so crowded.

129
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,875
[KYON gasps]

130
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,875
That tower... Those vendors...

131
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,791
I haven't been to a
bon festival in a while,

132
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,125
but it feels like I
just went to one.

133
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,666
[HARUHI]
Mikuru!

134
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,875
They have goldfish scooping over
there, just like you wanted!

135
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,458
Come on, you're gonna
catch a ton!

136
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,708
[MIKURU whimpering]
Okay...

137
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,666
Do you wanna go
scoop some fish, too?

138
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,125
We could have a contest.

139
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,500
Think I'll pass.

140
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,000
How 'bout you, Nagato?
You wanna go get some food?

141
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,791
[KYON] I didn't know you
were into this kinda stuff.

142
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,500
I got it!

143
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,375
[NAGATO]
No.

144
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,375
That one.

145
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,458
[VENDOR]
Sure, 800 yen!

146
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,875
[KYON] I wish she would've
let me buy that for her...

147
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,750
It's the least I could do
after all she's done for us.

148
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,041
[HARUHI]
Thirteen fish!

149
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,458
It's like the most
unbelievable haul ever!

150
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,500
But, I don't have any
place to put 'em all.

151
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,166
So I just kept one, and I
gave another one to Mikuru!

152
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,458
Go ahead and have one,
but only one!

153
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,458
[KYON]
Thanks.

154
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,833
Hey, Yuki, what's up with
the mask you got there?

155
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:01,708
I bought it.

156
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,208
Oh... Okay.

157
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,500
[giggles]

158
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:11,583
[sizzling]

159
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,916
[KYON] It was summer,
and summer vacation.

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,416
I guess that's why I
wanted to forget about it.

161
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,333
Truth was, I couldn't
ignore it any longer.

162
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,583
Haruhi, I don't want
to spoil your fun,

163
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,458
but did you finish
your homework?

164
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,666
Are you kidding?

165
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,208
That stuff's totally easy.

166
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,250
You can finish it
in like three days.

167
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,583
[KYON]
Three days?!

168
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,208
[HARUHI] You have to
get rid of that junk first,

169
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,875
so you can spend the
rest of your summer

170
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,916
having fun and not
worrying about it!

171
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,708
[KYON] Why does she
have to be so smart?

172
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,625
The folks upstairs
weren't terribly fair

173
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,208
when they were divvying
up the stats for us.

174
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,041
You guys! Tomorrow,
we're gonna go catch some bugs!

175
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,208
And the prize for whoever

176
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,250
catches the most
bugs is gonna be...

177
00:09:56,333 --> 00:10:00,083
...um... I know! They get to be
brigade leader for a whole day!

178
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:00,958
[KYON]
No thanks!

179
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,666
That sounds like a lot of fun!

180
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,541
Can we catch just
any random bug?

181
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,541
Um... No... Only cicadas!

182
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,750
In fact, I'm calling it
the SOS Brigade's

183
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,208
cicada catching contest!

184
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,541
[KYON] The next day was
beautiful, sunny, and bright.

185
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,458
In fact, it was the
perfect day for us

186
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,083
to have our SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest.

187
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,791
[KYON yelling]

188
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,916
[KYON]
That's not a cicada.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,791
I-It's a yanbaru
long-armed scarab!

190
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,583
Although everyone caught bugs
the best way they knew how,

191
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,458
the winner of the
contest ended up being...

192
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,375
You guessed it, Haruhi.

193
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,166
It's important to
follow the spirit of

194
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,541
catch and release
with these guys.

195
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,416
You never know,
if we let 'em go now,

196
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,916
they might come back
and return the favor!

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,375
[KYON] What could
a cicada do for me,

198
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,250
even if it did come back?

199
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,666
[HARUHI] Hurry!
Go back to the mountains!

200
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,375
[cicada's chirping]

201
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,416
[KYON]
I sorta feel like Pandora,

202
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,458
when she opened her box.

203
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,250
[MIKURU]
Welcome to our store!

204
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,750
[KYON]
We met the next day,

205
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,750
even though we had absolutely
no idea what was going on.

206
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,958
Our confusion continued

207
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,708
as we stood outside
the local supermarket,

208
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,750
wearing frog costumes
and handing out balloons.

209
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,000
It's a living.

210
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,416
[MIKURU whimpers]

211
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,791
I feel like Unit Zero after
it got hit by that beam.

212
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,250
Hey, guys! Awesome job today!

213
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,416
[KYON] What's with
the special treatment?!

214
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,791
You're the best!

215
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,958
The manager's super grateful
for all the hard work.

216
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,333
[KYON] Who cares how grateful
he is? What about our pay?

217
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,500
There it is!

218
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,125
Huh?!

219
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,916
I've had my eye on this
little guy for a long time now.

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
--[giggles]
--[KYON] We worked in the sun,

221
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,333
sweat pouring down
our foreheads...

222
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,583
...for that?!

223
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,500
We'll keep him in the
club room as a souvenir.

224
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,458
Oh, and Mikuru,
you have my permission

225
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,000
to wear him whenever you want.

226
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,375
Help yourself, okay?

227
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,416
[MIKURU]
Sure! Uh...

228
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,625
[KYON]
Yeah? What?

229
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,833
Oh, it's nothing.

230
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,500
[KYON]
Don't stare at me.

231
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,666
Come on, Mikuru!

232
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,458
You're the cutest
little froggy ever!

233
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,208
Put it back on,
you know you want to!

234
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,250
Watch the popsicle, ladies.

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,875
[phone rings]

236
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,250
[KYON]
Later that night,

237
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,083
my peaceful slumber was
interrupted by a phone call.

238
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,416
[KYON sighs]

239
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,916
[KYON] The number you have
dialed is no longer...

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,750
[MIKURU whimpers]

241
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,375
[KYON screams]
What the heck?!

242
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,416
[MIKURU whimpering]
Kyon...

243
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,250
Miss Asahina, is that you?

244
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,916
[MIKURU sobbing]
Yes... It's me...

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,583
Something... really bad...

246
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:32,375
I don't know... Wha...

247
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,333
What's wrong?

248
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,375
[KOIZUMI]
Hello, it's Koizumi.

249
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,875
How about you tell
me what you're doing

250
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,250
with Miss Asahina in
the middle of the night?

251
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,750
[KOIZUMI]
We have a situation here.

252
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,000
Would it be possible for
you to come meet us now?

253
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,000
Miss Asahina! Is everything
okay? What happened?

254
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,333
[MIKURU sobbing]

255
00:12:55,416 --> 00:13:01,166
Oh, Kyon! I-I-I can't
go back to the future...!

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,166
[KOIZUMI]
I'll explain it the best I can.

257
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,375
Currently, we're stuck in a time
loop that seems to be infinite.

258
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,666
[KYON] It's hard to
believe you're serious

259
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,500
with you sitting there,
smiling like that.

260
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,875
I mean, come on, Koizumi.

261
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,041
Do you have any idea
what you just said?

262
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:22,208
Yes, of course, I do. Much more
than I want to, believe me.

263
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,916
Earlier, I was having a
chat with Miss Asahina.

264
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,125
[KYON] Next time, you guys
are chatting, call me!

265
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,416
And then suddenly, we came
to the conclusion that

266
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,750
there was something a little off
about the current flow of time.

267
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,041
But the truth is,
Miss Asahina discovered it.

268
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,625
Thanks to her, my suspicions
were confirmed.

269
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,291
What suspicions?

270
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,958
[KOIZUMI]
Hm.

271
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,958
We're currently stuck
in a time loop,

272
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,708
re-living the same
period of time,

273
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,041
over and over again.

274
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,958
[KYON]
Yeah, you already said that.

275
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,791
[KOIZUMI] We've been
repeating every day between

276
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,458
August the 17th
through the 31st.

277
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,166
We're in the middle
of what seems to be

278
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,583
an endless summer vacation.

279
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,333
Well, at least it's summer
vacation anyway...

280
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,958
It's a never-ending,
endless summer vacation.

281
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,041
The future doesn't exist
in this world anymore.

282
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,791
Time stops at September the 1st.

283
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,708
And who's gonna
believe such a thing?

284
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,625
Well, for starters,
we were sort of hoping that

285
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,583
you would believe it.

286
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,750
[MIKURU]
Um...

287
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,083
I think I can try to explain it.

288
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,583
Okay, here it goes...

289
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,833
Because I have to
classified information,

290
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:29,458
I used classified information
to get in touch with the future.

291
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,833
The thing is, I haven't gotten
any classified information

292
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,708
for about a week now.

293
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,708
And that's kind of weird.

294
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:42,208
I was so surprised,
I classified information.

295
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,125
I really did.

296
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:48,166
But it was classified
information.

297
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,041
I don't know what to do.

298
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,041
[KYON]
What about those closed spaces

299
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,500
you were talking about before?

300
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,166
Maybe we're trapped
in one of those.

301
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,958
No, it's not one of those.

302
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,250
A section of time has been
torn away from time-space.

303
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:07,583
At exactly midnight on August
the 31st, everything will reset.

304
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,041
Then time reverts straight back

305
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,125
to the morning of
August the 17th.

306
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,833
That's the process.

307
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,708
What about our-- No, wait.

308
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,750
What about the whole
world's memories?

309
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,666
Their memories are reset.

310
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,250
Everyone's memory starts
over from the beginning.

311
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,500
Perfect, another
problem involving time.

312
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,166
I guess that figures when
there's a time traveler around.

313
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,666
No, Miss Asahina didn't
have anything to do with this.

314
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,375
[KYON]
Then, what's causing it?

315
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,416
It's Miss Suzumiya.

316
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,458
[KYON sighs]

317
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,125
I'm sure she doesn't
even realize it.

318
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,958
I think subconsciously,
she wants to

319
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,125
have summer vacation
last forever.

320
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,500
You're kidding!

321
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,541
You're telling me she still
hasn't had enough fun?

322
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,583
Yeah, that's what I think.

323
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,083
[KYON sighs]

324
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,291
[KOIZUMI] Perhaps she feels
there's something else that

325
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,291
needs to happen before
our summer vacation

326
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,958
can really be over.

327
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,583
[KYON sighs] You seem like
you're kind of enjoying this.

328
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,041
Do you wanna tell me why?

329
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,416
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

330
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,000
Please don't take that
the wrong way, it's just...

331
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,250
This explains the feelings
of déjà vu I've been having.

332
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,125
But, now that I think about it,

333
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,833
those feelings were most likely
the residue of my memories

334
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,375
from all the other instances
where time had been reset.

335
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,750
So, are we the only ones?

336
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,083
Or can other people
feel this happening, too?

337
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,916
It doesn't seem that way.

338
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,375
You and I are exceptions
to the rule though.

339
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,250
[KOIZUMI] The only people who
can sense this strangeness

340
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,791
are the ones closest
to Miss Suzumiya.

341
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,333
But, what about Haruhi?

342
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,916
Does she have any idea about
the stuff that's been going on?

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,208
No, I don't think
she knows about it.

344
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,291
Besides, it would be
very bad for us if she did.

345
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,833
But there's someone else who
isn't affected by the time loop,

346
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,833
or the feelings of déjà vu
we've been experiencing.

347
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,833
This person remembers
everything that's happened

348
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,333
since this started.

349
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,791
[KYON gasps]

350
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,541
[KYON]
Is that true?

351
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,666
It is.

352
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,750
[KYON]
Then... you remember everything?

353
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,250
I can.

354
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:03,000
[KYON] Okay then, how many
times has this happened so far?

355
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:08,125
This would be
15,521 times so far.

356
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:12,708
[KYON] Fifteen thousand
five-hundred twenty-one times?

357
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:17,166
Wait... What do you
mean 15,521 times?

358
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,916
And... you're being
completely serious?

359
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,458
I am.

360
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,791
So then, you're saying that
we've done the exact same things

361
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,083
that many times,
every single time?

362
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,000
Not necessarily.

363
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:34,541
Throughout 15,521 repetitions,
we did not attend

364
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:40,875
a bon festival the 2,391st
time and the 11,054th time.

365
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,041
We went to a bon festival
but did not go to

366
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:47,458
a goldfish scooping
booth exactly 437 times.

367
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,083
We obtained part-time
jobs 9,048 times,

368
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,833
and performed six
different types of jobs.

369
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,666
In addition to handing
out balloons,

370
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,083
we worked as movers,
cashiers, we handed out--

371
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,958
[KYON]
Okay! I got it...

372
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,625
[KYON] Fifteen thousand
five-hundred twenty-one times...

373
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,000
That's what Nagato said.

374
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,416
Okay... So... times two weeks...

375
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,625
That's, uh...
about... 595 years.

376
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,791
She's the only one of us who
remembers everything we've done.

377
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:27,041
And she's had to repeat those
same things over and over again.

378
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,583
Nagato...

379
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:32,625
What's it like to re-live the
same things that many times?

380
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,583
That's gotta be the
craziest story ever.

381
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,083
[HARUHI]
I wonder if they're real.

382
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,125
[KYON]
What's real?

383
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,208
[HARUHI]
Martians.

384
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,916
[KYON]
I kind of hope they aren't.

385
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,458
I can't see anyone on
the surface right now,

386
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,375
but I bet they're a
reserved race of beings

387
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,041
who have to live underground.

388
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,333
Whenever us humans are
finally able to land on Mars,

389
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,875
I'm sure the Martians'll pop out
from wherever they're hiding,

390
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,541
and say something like,
"Welcome to Mars!"

391
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,875
[KYON] I don't think
they should pop out.

392
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,500
[HARUHI]
Ugh, this is boring.

393
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,791
I'm gonna look for
some UFOs now.

394
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,166
[KYON]
That night, we went stargazing.

395
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,166
We were on the balcony
of Nagato's apartment,

396
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,041
since her place
had the best view.

397
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,708
Koizumi brought the telescope.

398
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,666
[KYON] I wish I knew what
else she wants to do.

399
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,125
Well, that's
the question, isn't it?

400
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,208
If we knew the answer,
we could solve this thing.

401
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,375
I have an idea we
can try if you want.

402
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,458
What if someone were to suddenly
grab Miss Suzumiya from behind,

403
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,583
and then whispered, "I love
you," right into her ear?

404
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,750
And who's gonna be
doing the whispering?

405
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,750
Is there anyone who could
play that role other than you?

406
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,791
[KYON]
Hmm... Yeah, no thanks.

407
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,250
All right then,
how 'bout if I do it?

408
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,333
Of course, I'm kidding.

409
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,583
I don't think I
could pull that off.

410
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,916
And besides,

411
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,875
it would just confuse
Miss Suzumiya in the end.

412
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,166
[chuckles]

413
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,000
[KYON]
Hey, Nagato.

414
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,458
You knew about this time loop

415
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,833
before Miss Asahina
figured it out, didn't you?

416
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,250
I did.

417
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,583
So then, how come you
didn't say anything about it?

418
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,000
[NAGATO]
My function is to observe.

419
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,375
[KYON]
I see...

420
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,833
[KYON]
We kept chugging along,

421
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,708
doing all kinds of
summer vacation things.

422
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,208
We went to a real firework show,

423
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:32,791
and we even signed up for
a goby fishing tournament.

424
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,375
We went to the batting cages,
we watched some movies,

425
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,000
went to the beach,
bowling, karaoke.

426
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,625
Oh yeah, we were
always doing something.

427
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,708
And the whole time,
all I could think was that

428
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,250
none of it was going to
be enough for Haruhi.

429
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,791
[KYON]
But, what could I do about it?

430
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:47,791
Nothing.

431
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,750
So, I just bit my
lip and watched

432
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:54,083
as the last days of summer...
vacation went by...

433
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,458
[KYON wretches]

434
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:01,375
And then, before I knew it,
August the 30th was here.

435
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:11,708
[HARUHI] That's it. We've done
everything on our list.

436
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,583
Hey! Don't mess that up!

437
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,875
Hmm... But now I'm
wondering if we did enough.

438
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Oh, well. Yeah, I guess
we did do a lot of stuff...

439
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,625
Unless there's something
else you guys wanna do?

440
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,083
[MIKURU whimpers]

441
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,000
[KYON gasping]

442
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,125
Oh! Okay, then.

443
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,291
I guess we did pretty much
everything we set out to do,

444
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,125
so that's good enough.

445
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,833
[KYON]
No, it's not.

446
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,875
You're still not satisfied.

447
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,583
That's it then!
We're all done for today.

448
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,541
I set tomorrow
aside just in case,

449
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,750
but I guess you can go ahead
and take the day off now, okay?

450
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,208
I'll see you guys at the
club room on Monday!

451
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,541
[KYON grunts]

452
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,125
[MIKURU gasps]

453
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,250
[KYON]
Wait, Haruhi.

454
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,250
That's it then!
We're all done for today.

455
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,083
I set tomorrow
aside just in case,

456
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,416
but I guess you can go ahead
and take the day off now, okay?

457
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,875
I'll see you guys at the
club room on Monday!

458
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,083
[KYON]
I can't let Haruhi leave.

459
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,708
[MIKURU gasps]

460
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,541
[KYON]
If I let her walk out that door,

461
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,125
we'll end up re-living
the past two weeks

462
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,916
again and again for a
thousand more times!

463
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,125
That's it then!
We're all done for today.

464
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,041
I set tomorrow
aside just in case,

465
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,291
but I guess you can go ahead
and take the day off now, okay?

466
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,666
I'll see you guys at the
club room on Monday!

467
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,083
[KYON]
What should I do?

468
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,708
What should I say?

469
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,750
[MIKURU gasps]

470
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,375
[KYON] There must have been a
clue in something Haruhi said...

471
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,083
But what was it?

472
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,291
What's she been
saying all this time?

473
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't know...

474
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,083
I can't... remember...

475
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,291
That's it then!
We're all done for today.

476
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,125
I set tomorrow
aside just in case,

477
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:03,416
but I guess you can go ahead
and take the day off now, okay?

478
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,291
I'll see you guys at the
club room on Monday!

479
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,166
[KYON]
Whatever... It doesn't matter.

480
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,541
[KYON]
It's August the 31st.

481
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,333
And I still haven't
touched my homework.

482
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,500
[KYON]
Who cares?

483
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,125
There's no point in doing it.
I mean, we're just gonna keep

484
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,166
re-living the last
couple of weeks.

485
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,916
[KYON] Whatever happens next,
whether tomorrow comes or not,

486
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,500
a different version of me
will have to deal with it.

487
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:39,541
[clock ticking]
