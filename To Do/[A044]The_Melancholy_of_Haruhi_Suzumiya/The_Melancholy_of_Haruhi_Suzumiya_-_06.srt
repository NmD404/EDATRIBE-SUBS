1
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:33,500
[KYON] Self-proclaimed humanoid
interface created by aliens.

2
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:37,083
Self-proclaimed
time travelling girl.

3
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,458
Self-proclaimed
squad of ESPer boys.

4
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,166
They've shown me enough
proof that I may now

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,291
safely remove the words
"self-proclaimed"

6
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,791
from their titles.

7
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,250
The three of them, each for
their own reasons, mind you,

8
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,833
are currently focused
on Haruhi Suzumiya.

9
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,833
Even if I believe
everything I've seen,

10
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,291
I still can't figure
out one thing:

11
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,333
Why me?

12
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,875
An alien? A girl from the
future, and an ESPer boy

13
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,458
all migrated toward Haruhi
because, as Koizumi put it,

14
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,250
that's what she wished for.

15
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,416
What about me?

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,875
Why have I been
dragged feet-first

17
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,500
into all of this
weird stuff anyway?

18
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,958
I mean, I'm a 100%
ordinary high schooler.

19
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:19,250
No special powers
or anything here.

20
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,416
I mean, who wrote this scenario?

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,958
Was it you, Haruhi?

22
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:28,666
Yeah, right. It's not like
it's my problem anyway.

23
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,875
Why do I have to get all
worked up about it?

24
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,500
All of this is Haruhi's fault.
Seriously, she's the one

25
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,833
who should be worried
about all of this

26
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,958
weirdness going on, not me. 

27
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,166
Nagato, Koizumi, Miss Asahina...

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,708
From now on, they should just
go speak to her directly,

29
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,916
and whatever happens after that,
well, that's Haruhi's problem.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,666
I've got nothing to do with it.

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,291
Everyone else can go do
whatever they want

32
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,625
as far as I'm concerned.

33
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,583
Yo.

34
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,625
Hey.

35
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,916
[KYON] Taniguchi, do you think
I'm a normal high schooler?

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,166
[TANIGUCHI]
Huh?

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,666
I don't know. Normal high
schoolers don't go around

38
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,416
pushing girls down
in classrooms,

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,958
know what I'm sayin'?

40
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,166
Especially Yuki Nagato, who,
according to my ranking system,

41
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,750
scores about A-.

42
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,958
[KYON] I shall explain myself.
Taniguchi's memory of the events

43
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:16,000
was a complete fiction;
a fantasy, merely a dream.

44
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,791
Nagato's the victim of Haruhi,
who's turned the Literary Club

45
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,791
into her lair. Upset by
this turn of events,

46
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,125
she merely consulted
me for advice.

47
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,791
I sympathize with the poor girl,

48
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,708
and agreed to help out
as best as I could.

49
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,291
After Haruhi'd gone, we'd
decided to meet in the classroom

50
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,333
so that we could
discuss her options.

51
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,458
That's when Nagato,
an anemic all her life,

52
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,708
suffered a seizure.

53
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,041
She toppled over, and as
I lunged to prevent her

54
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,625
from falling to the
hard, linoleum floor,

55
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,000
you came walking through
the door, Taniguchi.

56
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,166
Once you find out the
truth about something,

57
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,625
ten to one, it's
always gonna turn out

58
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,083
to be something trivial.

59
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,166
You liar.

60
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,458
Tch..

61
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,500
Even if I was dumb enough
to believe that lie,

62
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,500
the fact that Nagato,
who's famous for being

63
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,083
anti-social, mind you,
came to you for advice?

64
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,583
Well, that automatically
makes you not normal, buddy.

65
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,791
I never realized
Nagato's that famous.

66
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,333
[TANIGUCHI] Also, you happen to
be one of Suzumiya's henchman.

67
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,083
So if you think that
you're just a normal,

68
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,166
male high school student,

69
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,208
then I'm about as normal
as a water flea.

70
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,916
Hey, Taniguchi, you don't have
any supernatural powers, do you?

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,291
Huh?

72
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,958
I knew it. You've finally
become poisoned by Suzumiya's

73
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,375
extreme brand of
nuttiness, haven't you?

74
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,708
Don't get too
close to me, buddy,

75
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,041
or I'll catch the Suzumiya bug.

76
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,041
[laughs]

77
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,833
Why didn't you change
outta your gym clothes?

78
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,583
Because it's hot.

79
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,000
[KYON]
Hm.

80
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,125
[HARUHI] Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna change again

81
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,916
when we get to the clubroom

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,708
Besides, I've got cleaning
duty and it's easier

83
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,291
for me to move around in this.

84
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,833
[KYON] Yeah, well,
can't argue with that.

85
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,250
[HARUHI]
I was thinking, what do you want

86
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,000
Mikuru's next costume to be?

87
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,958
[KYON] Hm... We've had
the bunny girl, the maid...

88
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,250
I guess she could--

89
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,833
Wait, what do you mean next?!

90
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:01,166
[HARUHI] Kitty cat ears? Or a
nurse? Or maybe a dominatrix...

91
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,583
[KYON] Kitty cat ears... Nurse's
outfit... Maybe a dominatrix...

92
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,916
What an idiot.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,083
[KYON] Hey, you're the
one who brought it up.

94
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,750
[HARUHI]
Oh man... I'm so bored...

95
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,125
[KYON]
I see... There it is.

96
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,500
[MIKURU] You working
on anything important?

97
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,625
[KYON]
No, nothing.

98
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,708
Really? Hey, what's this?

99
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,541
[KYON gasps]
I'm screwed!

100
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,250
Why does that folder
have my name on it, huh?

101
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,708
Come on, let me see,
let me see, let me see!

102
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,791
[KYON] Oh, this? Well,
yeah, I warned her.

103
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,041
It's probably nothing
to worry about, though.

104
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,583
[MIKURU]
That sounds like a lie.

105
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,000
[KYON] Miss Asahina, could you
step back a little, please?

106
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,916
Please let me look. Can't I see?

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,500
Let me look!

108
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,750
--Come on, please?
--[door opens]

109
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,541
[HARUHI] What do you
two think you're doing?

110
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,250
Uh...

111
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,333
[HARUHI] So, you're into
maid outfits, huh?

112
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,375
What're you talking about?

113
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,708
We're gonna change.

114
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,583
Sure, fine with me.

115
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,375
I said we're changing now!

116
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,500
So what?

117
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,416
[growls] Get out now!

118
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,791
[KYON yells]

119
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,791
[KYON]
What's with her?

120
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,666
She never cares if people
see her when she's changing

121
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,708
in our homeroom...

122
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,458
Well, now my arms
and shoulders are cool,

123
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,708
but the rest of this crummy
outfit doesn't breathe at all!

124
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,708
[KOIZUMI]
Hello?

125
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,458
So I guess today's the
day of the costume party?

126
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,250
[KYON] Don't make this
story more complicated.

127
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,333
[HARUHI]
Mikuru.

128
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,291
Come here. Have a seat.

129
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,791
[whimpers]

130
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,125
They're like a
couple of sisters.

131
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,833
[KYON] She just wants to
make a maid with braids.

132
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,833
[KYON]
In the end, it was actually

133
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,666
a pretty normal day at the club.

134
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,083
[MIKURU whimpers]

135
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,750
[KYON] There wasn't really
anything we wanted to do.

136
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,083
Actually, we didn't
know what we should do.

137
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,208
It was like a
moratorium on life:

138
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,791
As time flowed by, the life
we took for granted,

139
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,500
an ordinary life.

140
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,000
And despite feeling dissatisfied
about the overwhelming lack

141
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,375
of things to do, you keep
thinking about the next day.

142
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,833
You keep telling yourself
you still got lots of time.

143
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,875
[KYON sighs] But that was
unusual in and of itself.

144
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,041
And it really wasn't
a bad thing at all.

145
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,500
Almost getting killed by a
classmate, or perhaps meeting

146
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,541
a monster tearing up a deserted
world with gray skies.

147
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,166
Now, those things don't
happen every day.

148
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,291
It's true, I wished that days
like this would last forever,

149
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,416
and wouldn't you
think that way, too?

150
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,833
But there was someone
that didn't think so.

151
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,208
And, of course,
it was Haruhi Suzumiya.

152
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:04,416
--[door opens]
--[KYON'S SISTER hums]

153
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,583
What d'you think you're doing?

154
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,541
Scissors! I need 'em
for art class.

155
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,750
Well, okay, I guess,

156
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,583
but just ask for 'em
next time, all right?

157
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,125
[KYON] She knew that she
could get away with it.

158
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,458
[KYON] By the way, do you what
makes people have dreams?

159
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,083
There are two kinds
of sleep: REM sleep,

160
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,166
and then there's non-REM sleep.

161
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,958
The two repeat in intervals
throughout the sleep cycle.

162
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,708
During REM, when the body's
asleep, but the brain is still

163
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,958
somewhat active, that's
when we have dreams.

164
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,166
--[HARUHI] Kyon. Kyon!

165
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,833

gone off yet, has it?

167

No way.

[HARUHI]
I'm telling you to wake up!

00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,375
Do you know where
we are right now?

171
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,916
[HARUHI]
I thought I woke up,

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,458
and then I found
myself in this place

173
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,916
with you lying there,
passed out next to me.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,083
What's going on?
And why did we wake up

175
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,791
outside our school like this?

176
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,166
[KYON]
A closed space.

177
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,166
I thought I was sleeping
in my bed at home,

178
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,291
so how did we end up
in this place?

179
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,541
The sky, it's weird.

180
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,000
Have you seen Koizumi?

181
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,250
No, why? Is he here?

182
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,375
No, just a hunch I had.

183
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,500
[KYON grunts]

184
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,416
First off, let's get
out of the school.

185
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,416
We might be able to find
someone somewhere else.

186
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,750
You don't seem very surprised
by all of this somehow.

187
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,500
[KYON]
Oh, I'm surprised all right.

188
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,166
Especially at the fact
that you're here.

189
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,166
[BOTH grunt]

190
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,041
What is this?

191
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,250
[KYON grunts]

192
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,750
This thing runs all around
the perimeter of the school.

193
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,083
Does that mean we
can't get out of here?

194
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,041
Well, if you're scared,
just go ahead and grab my arm,

195
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,916
why don'tcha? I'm sure it
will help get me in the mood.

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Jerk.

197
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,041
I can't get a dial tone.

198
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,250
[KYON]
Yeah, that's what I figured.

199
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,458
Hey, Kyon, look.

200
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,583
[HARUHI]
Where are we...?

201
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,791
It's really weird...

202
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,166
You thirsty?

203
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,166
[HARUHI]
No thanks.

204
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,666
[HARUHI]
What's going on? What is this?

205
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,500
I don't get it at all.

206
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,583
Where are we? And why
am I here anyway?

207
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:01,083
And on top of all that,
why am I alone with you?

208
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,208
[KYON]
How should I know?

209
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,291
I'm gonna look around.

210
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,041
You stay here, got it?

211
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,791
I'll be right back.

212
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,625
[door creaks]

213
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,750
[KYON]
Typical Haruhi behavior.

214
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,625
Koizumi, that you?

215
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,666
[KOIZUMI]
Well, hello there.

216
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,083
Took you long enough to show up.

217
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,041
Although I guess I was sort
of expecting to see you

218
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,583
looking a little more normal.

219
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,375
[KOIZUMI] Yeah, that. I need to
talk to you about something.

220
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,291
Frankly speaking, this is what
I'd call an emergency situation.

221
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,625
Normally, I can get into closed
space without too much trouble,

222
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,916
but this time, even with some
extra power from my colleagues,

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,625
it was all I could do to show up
in this incomplete form,

224
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,666
and I'm not gonna
last too long either.

225
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,666
Looks like our ESPer
powers are fading.

226
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,666
They could disappear
any minute now.

227
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,000
Then, do you know
what's going on?

228
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,250
And are Haruhi and I the
only ones stuck in here?

229
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,208
[KOIZUMI] That's it, the
thing we've been afraid of

230
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,708
happening all along is
starting to happen right now.

231
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,083
It seems Miss Suzumiya's finally
given up on the real world.

232
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,291
She's decided to
create a new one now.

233
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,125
In other words, this is
the end of the world.

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,583
[KYON]
What was that?!

235
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,208
[KOIZUMI] The top brass
at the organization

236
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,416
is seriously panicked right now.

237
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,416
Nobody knows what will
happen to the real world

238
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,041
now that we've lost our deity.

239
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,625
If Miss Suzumiya's feeling
merciful, we might get to keep

240
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,500
living on this
side of the bubble.

241
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,541
But it might disappear into
nothing the next minute, too.

242
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,083
[KYON]
Wait, now why's this--

243
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,916
[KOIZUMI] Who knows? In any
case, both you and Miss Suzumiya

244
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,750
have completely disappeared
from our world.

245
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,375
You two aren't in an
ordinary closed space.

246
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,291
It's a new dimension that
Miss Suzumiya's created.

247
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,375
I dunno. Maybe all the other
closed spaces were practice

248
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,666
for the one you're in right now.

249
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,250
[KOIZUMI] The space that
you're in right now

250
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,416
is probably the world

251
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,750
that Miss Suzumiya
wishes she was in.

252
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,041
I don't really know what
she wants, so, I'm at a loss

253
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,291
as to what could happen next.

254
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,875
Do you have any idea why
I'm the one in here with her?

255
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,708
[KOIZUMI]
You honestly have no idea why?

256
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,708
You were chosen
by Miss Suzumiya.

257
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,000
You were the one and only
person from the other world

258
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,750
that Miss Suzumiya
really wanted to be with.

259
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,541
I thought you'd have
realized that by now.

260
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,916
[KOIZUMI] Looks like
I'm almost out of time.

261
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,125
Way things are going,
I don't think

262
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,333
we'll be seeing
each other again.

263
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,583
So you're telling me that's it?
I gotta live all alone here

264
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,375
with Haruhi in this
dull world of gray?

265
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,916
[KOIZUMI]
You're the new Adam and Eve. 

266
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,750
Go on, procreate and
increase the population.

267
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,458
[KYON]
I'll punch you for that.

268
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,708
[KOIZUMI] Just joking. It's
only a theory, but I think

269
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,958
in a little while,

270
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,833
this place will start
looking more familiar.

271
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,750
However, it's not going to be
exactly the same as over here.

272
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,583
Well, if I ever get
reincarnated on your side,

273
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,833
be sure to say hi for me.

274
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,250
So we can never go back
to that side ever again?

275
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,500
[KOIZUMI]
Only if Miss Suzumiya wishes it.

276
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,625
Although I hate to say it, the
chances of that are pretty slim.

277
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,875
I'm gonna miss you guys a lot;
I would've liked to get to know

278
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,666
both of you better.

279
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,125
The whole thing fills me
with a bit of regret.

280
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,125
Oh! Almost forgot. I've got
messages for you from

281
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,833
Mikuru Asahina and Yuki Nagato.

282
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,583
Miss Asahina told me to
deliver an apology to you.

283
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,666
"I'm sorry, it's all my fault."

284
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,791
And Yuki Nagato told me to tell
you, "Turn on the computer."

285
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,250
Goodbye...

286
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:32,250
What kind of joke
is this anyway...?

287
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,625
[gasps]

288
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,333
[gasps]

289
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,625
[KYON]
'Course I can see it.

290
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,125
[KYON]
What should I do?

291
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,666
[KYON]
That what?

292
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,750
Nagato!

293
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,666
What do you want me to do...?

294
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,875
Nagato... Koizumi...

295
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,250
[rumbling]

296
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,083
Kyon! Something's here!

297
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:24,166
What is it?! A monster?!
It's not an illusion, is it?!

298
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,666
Maybe it's an alien?!

299
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,833
Or is it some kind of
super weapon that a race

300
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,416
of ancient people created that's
been awakened in our world?!

301
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,166
[HARUHI]
What're you doing?!

302
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,583
[HARUHI screams]

303
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,791
That thing's not trying
to attack us, is it?

304
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,458
What're we running
away from it for?

305
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,666
I don't think it's
evil or anything.

306
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,291
Who knows? 

307
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,041
[crashing]

308
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,875
[HARUHI]
Do you know what's happening?

309
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,208
This weird world,
and that giant...

310
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,333
[KYON] Don't you wanna go back
to the world we used to be in?

311
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,708
Huh...?

312
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,000
[KYON] We can't stay in a
place like this forever.

313
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,916
I mean, if we get hungry,
there aren't any places

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,166
to eat here.

315
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,916
[HARUHI] It's strange,
but I have a feeling

316
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,791
we'll get by somehow.

317
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:20,708
I'm having fun right now.
I wonder why...?

318
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,875
[KYON] What're you going
to do with the SOS Brigade?

319
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,333
You created it. Are you
just gonna throw it away?

320
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,750
[HARUHI]
It doesn't matter anymore.

321
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,208
I'm having the strangest,

322
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,083
most wonderful experience
I've ever dreamed of having!

323
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,833
I don't need to search for it
when it's happening right here.

324
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,416
But I wanna go back!

325
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,708
[gasps]

326
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,541
[KYON] It took something like
this to make me realize:

327
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,875
Even though I complain a lot,
I really liked my life

328
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,500
up till now. Kunikida,
and that idiot Taniguchi...

329
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,041
Koizumi, Nagato, Miss Asahina...

330
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,583
And that Asakura girl
who disappeared,

331
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,541
you could put her
on the list, too.

332
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,458
What're you talking about?

333
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,375
I wanna go back and
see all of them again.

334
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,166
I don't know, I feel like
I've still got so many things

335
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,291
that I wanna talk to them about.

336
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,791
You'll see them again.
It's not like this place

337
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,750
is gonna be covered by a big,
gloomy shadow forever.

338
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,541
Once tomorrow comes
around, I'm positive

339
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,875
the sun's gonna shine again.
I know it will, I can tell!

340
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,833
That's not it. I'm not talking
about seeing them in here,

341
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,583
I wanna see everybody
from the old world

342
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,333
in the old world.

343
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,666
I don't understand you...

344
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,500
Weren't you sick and tired
of the boring world

345
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,958
we were living in?!

346
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,833
Didn't you want something
really weird and interesting

347
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,041
to happen like I did?!

348
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,583
[KYON]
I used to.

349
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,416
You know something, Haruhi?

350
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,791
For the last couple days, I've
had all these strange things

351
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,458
happening around me.

352
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,875
You had no way of knowing this, 
but I guess you could say

353
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,041
the world's been
revolving around you.

354
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,500
You've been completely
unaware of it,

355
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,250
but actually, everything
in the world was getting

356
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,666
more and more weird
and interesting.

357
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,416
[crashing]

358
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,333
[KYON] Nagato said she was
the potential for evolution.

359
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,166
Miss Asahina called her a
distortion in space time.

360
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,541
And Koizumi treated
her like a god.

361
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,833
Then, what about me?

362
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,458
What does Haruhi Suzumiya
mean to someone like me?

363
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,000
Haruhi is Haruhi,
nothing else but Haruhi.

364
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,791
Great, using tautology
to dodge the question.

365
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,791
I can't help it, I just don't
have a definite answer for it.

366
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,208
I mean, think about it.

367
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,333
If somebody pointed at a
classmate of yours and asked you

368
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,916
what that person meant to you,
how would you answer?

369
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,125
What would you say?

370
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,083
Sorry, I'm dodging
the question again.

371
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,166
But to me, Haruhi
isn't just a classmate,

372
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,333
and of course, she's not
the potential for evolution,

373
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,916
a time distortion,
or a god either.

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,791
That's impossible!

375
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,458
[MIKURU] Do you know
the story of Snow White?

376
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,583
What's wrong?

377
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,416
I've sorta got a thing
for girls with ponytails.

378
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
What?

379
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,583
I don't remember when it was,

380
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,125
but you had your
hair in a ponytail,

381
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,041
and it looked so good
on you, it was criminal.

382
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,000
Huh?

383
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,500
What're you, an idiot?

384
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,708
[gasps]

385
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,250
[grunts]

386
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,208
What kinda dream was that?!

387
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,083
Sigmund Freud's gotta
be laughing at me!

388
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,791
[yelping]

389
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,000
[KYON] I never had a dream
that was so realistic before...

390
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,083
[yawns]

391
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,208
[KYON] Or maybe... Maybe this
isn't the old world anymore.

392
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,791
Maybe this world is a new
one that Haruhi created.

393
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,500
And if that's the case,
how would I go about

394
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,208
confirming it?

395
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:21,791
[KYON]
Yo.

396
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:22,708
How you doin'?

397
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,916
[HARUHI]
I dunno, not so good.

398
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,791
I had a nightmare last night.

399
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,333
Really?

400
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,416
[HARUHI] Yeah, I couldn't really
get any sleep because of it.

401
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,083
I've never wanted to ditch
school so badly like today.

402
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,666
Is that so?

403
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,041
Haruhi.

404
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,125
Yeah, what?

405
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,833
Looks good on you.

406
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,708
[KOIZUMI] I believe I should
be thanking you right now.

407
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,750
Looks like I get to
keep my part-time job

408
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,250
a little while longer.

409
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,791
Well, I don't think we can
deny the distinct possibility

410
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,875
that the world we're in
now was freshly created

411
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,375
by her last night. In any case,

412
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,333
it is an honor to see you
and Miss Suzumiya again.

413
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,375
Be seeing you after class.

414
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,208
You and Haruhi Suzumiya
disappeared from this world

415
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,041
for two hours and 30 minutes.

416
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,208
[KYON] So, tell me,
how many more of your kind

417
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,291
are out there anyway?

418
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,791
A lot.

419
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,666
[KYON] And, is somebody like
Asakura going to come around

420
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,208
and try and kill me again?

421
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,791
Don't worry.

422
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,583
I won't let that happen.

423
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,458
--Huh...?
--[gasps]

424
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,625
[whimpers]

425
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,458
Kyon, you're back!

426
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,416
[MIKURU sobs]
I'm so glad to see you again.

427
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I thought... that you'd...
never make it back...

428
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,083
[KYON]
Miss Asahina...

429
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,375
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

430
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,416
If Miss Suzumiya
saw this, it'll be like

431
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,000
birds of a feather repeating
their mistakes again!

432
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,750
I don't have any idea
what you're saying.

433
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,708
Oh, by the way, Miss Asahina,
I believe you've got a

434
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,125
star-shaped mole on your chest
right about here, am I right?

435
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,916
[MIKURU gasps]

436
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,208
H-How did you know that...?

437
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,375
I-I didn't even know it
was shaped like a star

438
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,166
till just now.

439
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,000
W-W-When did you realize it?

440
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,208
[HARUHI]
And what are you two doing?

441
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,958
Mikuru. I bet you're bored
with the maid outfit, so...

442
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,291
I gotcha a new one.

443
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,333
--[MIKURU] What? No!
--[HARUHI] Stop squirming!

444
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,750
[HARUHI]
Resistance is futile!

445
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,416
This time it's a nurse's outfit!

446
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,083
Or should I say doctor's aid?

447
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,375
Oh, whatever you
call 'em, it's cute!

448
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,416
[KYON] Now, let me tell you
about what happened afterwards.

449
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,958
The SOS Brigade
finally submitted

450
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,333
all the necessary paperwork

451
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,250
to register as an
extra-curricular group

452
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,833
within the school.

453
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,250
I was sure that the name
"Spreading Excitement All Over

454
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,791
the World With Haruhi Suzumiya
Brigade" would've been

455
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:00,958
rejected outright.

456
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,791
So we changed it at
the last minute to:

457
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,333
"Spreading Cheer to Our
Student Body Brigade."

458
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:09,083
And we still patrol the town
for strange phenomena.

459
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,583
Today's our second tour of duty.

460
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,666
By some strange
coincidence, Miss Asahina,

461
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,250
Nagato, and Koizumi

462
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:19,875
all had errands to run, so I'm
waiting for Haruhi by myself.

463
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,583
I made sure to arrive an hour
before we had agreed to meet.

464
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,958
Remember, we had a rule that
regardless of whether or not

465
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:28,416
you were late, the last person
to show up gets a penalty.

466
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,750
I'm not quite sure
why she's scowling.

467
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,625
Perhaps it's a reaction to
the low attendance rate today.

468
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,916
Or could it be regret
that she's shown up last?

469
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,458
I dunno. 

470
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,291
But I'll have lots
of time to find out...

471
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,666
...when she's buying
me lunch at the café.

472
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,000
And when we sit down, 

473
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,958
I'd like to talk to her
about all sorts of things.

474
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:49,458
About how the SOS Brigade is
going to operate from now on,

475
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:53,791
my wishlist for Miss Asahina's
cosplay, etc., etc.

476
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,208
But I digress.
I already know exactly

477
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,583
what I wanna talk
to her about first.

478
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,250
Yeah, that's right.
For starters,

479
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,750
I'm thinkin' I'd
like to talk to her

480
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:07,250
a little bit about aliens,
time travelers, and... ESPers.
