1
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,666
[KYON] Something's wrong...
That's what it felt like anyway.

2
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,666
[KYON] I didn't care about
the baseball game on TV,

3
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,375
but I ended up
watching it anyway.

4
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,708
And right about then,

5
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,583
I suddenly got the feeling
Haruhi was gonna call.

6
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,625
Hm?

7
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,875
[COMMENTATOR]
The bleachers behind third

8
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,833
are going nuts out there.

9
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,791
[phone rings, buzzes]

10
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,416
Hey Kyon, your cell
phone's ringing.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,666
Yeah I know; you don't
have to tell me.

12
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,000
[HARUHI] Hey, Kyon!
You're free today, right?

13
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,416
[KYON grunts]

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,458
[HARUHI] Good. Meet us at 2:00
in front of the station.

15
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,041
And don't be late!

16
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,125
[dial tone]

17
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,125
[KYON] I didn't even have
a chance to say anything.

18
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,000
--[phone rings]
--[KYON gasps]

19
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,791
[sighs]

20
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:17,875
Now what?

21
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,416
[HARUHI]
I forgot to tell you something.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,916
Make sure and bring your swim
trunks and some money, too.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,333
Oh, and don't forget to bring--

24
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,666
Don't forget to
bring my bike, I know.

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,333
[HARUHI]
Uh... Right! Yeah, bring it.

26
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,583
And if you're late,
you're buying lunch!

27
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,375
[dial tone]

28
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,583
[KYON]
Huh?

29
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,625
How did I know about
the bike just now?

30
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,125
--[metal clink]
--[KYON gasps]

31
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,458
[COMMENTATOR] What a shot!
It's a big, fat hit!

32
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,125
[KYON'S SISTER] Look! I think
that one's gonna make it over!

33
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,166
[KYON'S SISTER]
I knew it!

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,625
[KYON] I wonder where
I put my swim trunks.

35
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,291
Summer's almost over.

36
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,083
[HARUHI]
You're late, Kyon!

37
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,583
[KYON]
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,708
I'm sorry if I kept
you guys waiting.

39
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,791
No worries. I just
got here, too.

40
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,333
You have absolutely no
motivation whatsoever.

41
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,333
Now that we're all present
and accounted for, we can go!

42
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,666
Where are we going today?

43
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,500
To the public swimming pool!
Where do you think?

44
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:46,500
[KYON] That figures...
considering the stuff I brought.

45
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,125
But, we've only got
so much time because

46
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,291
once it's gone,
it's gone for good!

47
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,208
So we're going to
do everything we can

48
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,250
during our only summer
as tenth graders.

49
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey, Kyon? Are you listening?

50
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,583
Uh... Yeah.

51
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,458
For starters, we're gonna ride
the bikes over to the pool!

52
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,375
Okay. Did everyone
ride their bikes today?

53
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,833
Well, actually...

54
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,958
The only bikes we have are
the ones you and I brought.

55
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,000
Huh?

56
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,000
[KYON]
In other words, you mean... 

57
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,333
You gotta be kidding!

58
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,583
All right, Kyon, you can't
let Koizumi beat you!

59
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,041
Come on! Full speed ahead!

60
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,666
[KYON]
You demon! You fiend!

61
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,291
[KYON panting]

62
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,625
What are you doing?

63
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,833
We're trying to have fun,
so stop acting tired!

64
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,708
[KYON]
And whose fault is that?!

65
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,583
[HARUHI]
Wow! Look at all the people!

66
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,958
And can you smell the chlorine?

67
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,166
That really makes
it feel like summer!

68
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,583
Come on, guys, it's perfect!

69
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,375
Let's find a place to dump
our stuff and go swimming!

70
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,000
[KYON]
Okay.

71
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:37,708
[HARUHI laughs]

72
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,875
Hey! Wait a se...cond...

73
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,541
Can't she see the "no diving"
signs? They're everywhere.

74
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,208
[HARUHI laughs]

75
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,375
Come on! The water's
warm! It's perfect!

76
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,750
Mikuru! Yuki!
Don't just stand there!

77
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,375
Guess you better go have fun.

78
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,541
We're never gonna hear
the end of it, if you don't.

79
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,541
Oh! Okay!

80
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,000
Miss Suzumiya!
Wait up, we're coming!

81
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,291
[HARUHI]
Slow poke!

82
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,250
In... you... go!

83
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,875
[MIKURU screams]

84
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:09,416
[laughs] It's such a
peaceful scene, isn't it?

85
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,458
What?

86
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,541
I was talkin' about
Miss Suzumiya.

87
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,875
She's enjoying herself
in a normal way.

88
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,083
It's rather charming,
don't you think?

89
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,458
She called me and
told me what to bring.

90
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,083
And then, she ordered
me to meet her

91
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,791
without telling me
what was going on.

92
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,375
--That's not charming or normal.
--[KOIZUMI chuckles]

93
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,583
[KOIZUMI] If you ask me,
none of what you mentioned

94
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,750
is anything to make a fuss over.

95
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,583
As long as Miss Suzumiya's
having a good time,

96
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,625
we don't have to worry about
any earth-shattering events.

97
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,041
[KYON]
I hope you're right.

98
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:38,916
[KOIZUMI]
Hmm?

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,625
[KYON]
Hm? Something wrong?

100
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,875
Nothing...

101
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,625
I guess it's just
my imagination.

102
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,833
With everything that's
happened since we met,

103
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,791
you could say I've
become slightly paranoid.

104
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,458
[KYON]
Him too? Weird.

105
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,791
[HARUHI, CHILDREN laughing]

106
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,750
[KYON] Now I know why they call
it a "public" swimming pool.

107
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,000
Seems like everyone
in town's here today.

108
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,083
Hm?

109
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,208
She's been over
there this whole time?

110
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,791
Why's she sitting
over there by herself?

111
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,458
What the...?

112
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,833
That's so weird!

113
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,666
It's like... I've seen
this happen before.

114
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,083
Nagato... all alone...

115
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:35,916
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,750
[KYON gasps]

117
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,750
[KYON]
Haruhi... 

118
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,916
Yeah... That's right...

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,708
She shows up and says...

120
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,791
"These two guys are my brigade
members. They do what I say.

121
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,250
So if you want something..."

122
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,416
[HARUHI]
...you can ask them!

123
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,291
[KYON gasps]

124
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,833
It's time for some water soccer.

125
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,708
I need everyone in the pool!

126
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,041
Yuki!

127
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,625
[KYON] Have I become like
a psychic or something?

128
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,958
[HARUHI]
Heads up, Kyon!

129
00:06:59,041 --> 00:06:59,958
[KYON]
Ugh!

130
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,208
...or not.

131
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,833
[KYON] Oh, well. I guess
déjà vu's happen sometimes.

132
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,333
That's all it was.

133
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,791
I've been thinking of
some fun things to do!

134
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:14,875
What's that for?

135
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,375
I came up with this schedule of

136
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,750
how we're gonna spend the
rest of our summer vacation!

137
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,750
We've only got two weeks...

138
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,708
[KYON]
Two weeks to do all that?!

139
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,916
[HARUHI] Is there anything
you wanna do, Mikuru?

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,208
[MIKURU]
Um... Maybe goldfish scooping?

141
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,375
[HARUHI]
Okay! Goldfish scooping, it is.

142
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,458
[writing]

143
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,833
Um... Could I see
that for a moment?

144
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,083
Hm.

145
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,083
[chuckles]

146
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,958
[KOIZUMI]
Thank you.

147
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,833
[HARUHI]
We'll start the list tomorrow!

148
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,791
Does anyone know if there's a
bon festival happening close by?

149
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,416
Or a firework show?

150
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
[KOIZUMI]
I can check around for them.

151
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,958
I'll give you a call
if I find anything.

152
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,125
[HARUHI] Don't forget
about the goldfish scooping.

153
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,833
After all, it's Mikuru's
only request.

154
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,666
[KYON]
I got stuck with the bill again.

155
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,083
[HARUHI] Yeah, well, that's
what happens when you're late!

156
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:05,000
That's it for today, guys!
Okay? I'll see you tomorrow!

157
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,333
Well, I'm off, too.

158
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,541
I'll see you later!

159
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,791
Okay!

160
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,208
[KYON gasps]

161
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,916
[KYON]
Nagato!

162
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,750
I... I was... It's nothing
important or anything...

163
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,416
[KYON]
So, uh... How have you been?

164
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,333
Is everything going
okay with you?

165
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,166
[NAGATO]
It is.

166
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,791
[KYON] Okay, then.
I guess that's a good thing.

167
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:39,583
[NAGATO]
Yes.

168
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,000
[gasps]

169
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,708
Ah! Well, uh, that's all
I was wondering.

170
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,583
So yeah, I'm, uh...
sorry to keep you.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,958
[KYON]
What the heck?

172
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,083
What was that?

173
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,750
Why'd I talk to her?

174
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,916
[KYON] The next morning,
I got another call from Haruhi.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,583
They found a bon festival.

176
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,583
It was happening
at a park tonight.

177
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,333
[footsteps]

178
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,250
[HARUHI]
Sorry, guys! 

179
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,333
[KYON]
Well, it's about time--

180
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,958
[KYON stutters]

181
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,916
[KOIZUMI] The three of
you look wonderful in those!

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,291
Well, of course we do!

183
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,208
I picked 'em out myself, y'know.

184
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,375
Especially Mikuru's!
You're so cute! I'm a genius!

185
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,875
[KYON]
Oh, Miss Asahina! Yes! Yes!

186
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,750
[chattering]

187
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,166
[MIKURU]
Oh!

188
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,875
There's a lot goin on here,

189
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,250
but I wonder where all the
things we wanna do are.

190
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,375
[KYON]
What the...?!

191
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,375
It feels like I was just here!

192
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,916
That tower... Those vendors...
I remember them.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,083
[HARUHI]
Look! Mikuru!

194
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,666
[gasps]

195
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,833
[HARUHI] See? They have goldfish
scooping, just like you wanted!

196
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,000
We're gonna catch a whole bunch!

197
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,250
[MIKURU whimpering] Miss
Suzumiya, don't pull so hard!

198
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,166
Do you wanna go
scoop some fish, too?

199
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,125
Nah, I think I'll pass.

200
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,333
So how 'bout you, Nagato?

201
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,583
You wanna go grab
some food or somethin'?

202
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,625
Huh?

203
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,375
[KYON]
Hm?

204
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,750
Are you actually
into that stuff?

205
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,333
Okay! I got it!

206
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,291
No.

207
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,208
But--

208
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,416
That one.

209
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
[VENDOR]
It's yours for 800 yen!

210
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,958
[KYON] I wish she would've
let me buy that for her...

211
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,625
It's the least I could do
after all she's done for us.

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,458
[HARUHI]
I caught thirteen!

213
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,250
But, I don't have enough
room for all of 'em.

214
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,666
That's way too many fish.

215
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,625
So I kept one, and gave
one to Mikuru!

216
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,125
Here! Go ahead and have one!

217
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,541
But only one, okay?

218
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,291
Okay. Thanks.

219
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,208
Woah! Hey, Yuki? What's the
deal with the mask?

220
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,500
I bought it.

221
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,500
Oh! Okay...

222
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,500
Let's shoot off
some fireworks next.

223
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,375
It'll be a great
way to end the day!

224
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,416
[KYON grunts]

225
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,125
[KYON] It was summer,
and summer vacation.

226
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,583
I guess that's why I
wanted to forget about it.

227
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,000
Truth was, I couldn't
ignore it any longer.

228
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,208
[HARUHI] Tomorrow,
we're gonna catch bugs!

229
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,375
Hey, Haruhi?

230
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,291
Yeah? What?

231
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,583
I don't wanna spoil your fun,

232
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,500
but have you finished
your homework?

233
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,291
Finish my homework?

234
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,750
Aw, that stuff's easy. You can
finish it in like three days.

235
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,291
[gasps]

236
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,625
You have to get rid of it first,
so you can spend your summer

237
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,583
having fun and not
worrying about it!

238
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,791
That, is how you get the
most out of your vacation!

239
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,000
[KYON grunts]
The gods can be so cruel...

240
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,833
So tomorrow, we're all
gonna go bug catching!

241
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,250
But only cicadas.

242
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm calling it the SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest!

243
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,166
[KYON]
The next day was

244
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,583
unbelievably beautiful,
sunny, and bright.

245
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,166
Perfect for the SOS Brigade's
cicada catching contest,

246
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,625
which was currently underway.

247
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,583
And although everyone caught
bugs the best way they knew how,

248
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,708
the winner of the
contest ended up being...

249
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,583
Surprise! Haruhi...

250
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,458
[HARUHI] It's important
to follow the spirit of

251
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,458
catch and release
with these guys.

252
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,875
I mean, if we let 'em go now,

253
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,250
they might return
the favor some time.

254
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,041
[KYON] Now, what could a
cicada possibly do for me?

255
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,750
[cicada's chirping]

256
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,000
[KYON] I sorta feel like
Pandora, opening her box.

257
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,291
[KYON]
We met the next day,

258
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,750
even though we had no
idea what was going on.

259
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,416
Then, we had to
wear frog costumes

260
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,666
and hand balloons out
in front of the supermarket.

261
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,208
This was our part-time job.

262
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,083
[GROUP sighs]

263
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,500
[MIKURU whimpers]

264
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,750
I feel like the Gundam Virtue
after it pops its armor.

265
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,625
[door opens]

266
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,500
[HARUHI]
Good work, you guys!

267
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,541
[KYON] What's with
the special treatment?

268
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,916
You're the best!

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,458
The manager's super
grateful for all the hard work.

270
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,458
Who cares how grateful he is?
Where's our pay?

271
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,583
That's it!

272
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,916
Huh?

273
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,250
[HARUHI] I've had my
eye on him for a while now.

274
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,875
The manager said we
could have it 'cause

275
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,833
Mikuru looks so cute in it!

276
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,791
[MIKURU laughs nervously]

277
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,791
[KYON]
We were working,

278
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,875
sweat pouring down
our foreheads...

279
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,333
...for that?!

280
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,583
[HARUHI] We'll keep him in
the club room as a souvenir.

281
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,375
Mikuru, you have my permission
to wear him whenever you want.

282
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,916
Isn't he the greatest?!

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,791
--[KYON gasps]
--[MIKURU] Uh... Okay...

284
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,666
Um... Thank you, I guess...?

285
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,125
--[phone rings]
--[KYON] Later that night,

286
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,916
my peaceful slumber was
interrupted by a phone call.

287
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,166
[KYON grumbles]
Shut up...

288
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,000
[phone beeps]

289
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,625
[KYON sighs]

290
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,583
[phone rings]

291
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,291
[KYON]
Shut up!

292
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,333
Ugh, dammit...

293
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,958
Hello?

294
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:35,250
[MIKURU whimpering]
Kyon...

295
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,958
Miss Asahina?

296
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,333
[MIKURU]
Yes... It's me...

297
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,583
[sobbing]
Something... really bad...

298
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,500
I don't know...

299
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,791
At this rate... I--I...

300
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,791
What's wrong?

301
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,291
[KOIZUMI]
Hello, it's Koizumi.

302
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,833
[KYON growls]

303
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,500
What are you doing
with Miss Asahina

304
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,000
in the middle of the night?

305
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,916
[KOIZUMI]
We have a situation here.

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,375
Is it possible for
you to come meet us?

307
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,708
[KYON]
Oh, absolutely!

308
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,458
[bike rattles]

309
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,333
[KYON]
Miss Asahina!

310
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:08,875
--What happened? Are you okay?
--[MIKURU sobbing]

311
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,791
Oh, Kyon! I can't... Future...

312
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,958
[KYON]
Future? W-What?

313
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,833
I can't go back to the future!

314
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:17,875
[KYON]
Huh?

315
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,375
[KOIZUMI]
I'll explain it the best I can.

316
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:27,041
We're currently stuck in a time
loop that seems to have no end.

317
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,625
[KYON] It's hard to
believe you're serious

318
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,000
with that smile on your face.

319
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,291
Come on, Koizumi. Do you have
any idea what you just said?

320
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,375
[KOIZUMI]
Of course, I do.

321
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,541
Much more than
I want to, believe me.

322
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,833
Anyway, I was having a chat
with Miss Asahina earlier.

323
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,583
[KYON] Next time, call me
when you have a chat with her!

324
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,250
[KOIZUMI]
And that's when the two of us

325
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,541
realized that something
seemed a little off about

326
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,375
the current flow of time.

327
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,583
Actually, Miss Asahina
discovered it.

328
00:14:56,666 --> 00:15:00,458
Thanks to her,
my suspicions were confirmed.

329
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,125
What kind of suspicions?

330
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,333
[KOIZUMI]
That we've been re-living

331
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,250
the same period of time,
over and over again.

332
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,500
Yeah, you already said that.

333
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,250
[KOIZUMI] We've been
repeating every day between

334
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,333
August the 17th
through the 31st.

335
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,791
We've become stuck
in the middle of

336
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,750
what seems to be an
endless summer vacation.

337
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,583
[KYON] Well, at least
it's summer vacation...

338
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:24,125
[KOIZUMI] A never-ending,
endless summer vacation.

339
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,000
The future doesn't exist
in this world anymore.

340
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,291
Time stops at September the 1st.

341
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,500
That's the reason Miss Asahina
can't travel to the future.

342
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,166
It's only natural.

343
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,000
There's nothing natural
about not having a future.

344
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,375
Who's gonna
believe such a thing?

345
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,166
[MIKURU sobs]

346
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,125
Well, for starters, I guess
we were sort of hoping that

347
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,500
you would believe it.

348
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,166
Maybe it's one of
those closed spaces

349
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,375
you were talking about before.

350
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,250
Could we be trapped in
one of those things?

351
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,458
That's not it.
This time, it's different.

352
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,500
A specific section of
time has been torn away.

353
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,750
At exactly midnight
on August the 31st,

354
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,208
everything resets.

355
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,791
Time reverts to the
morning of August the 17th.

356
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,416
That's the process.

357
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,250
Perfect, another
problem involving time.

358
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,083
But I guess I
shouldn't be surprised,

359
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,458
considering there's a time
traveler hanging out with us.

360
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,166
[KOIZUMI]
No...

361
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,750
[KYON]
Hm?

362
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,458
[KOIZUMI] Miss Asahina didn't
have anything to do with this.

363
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,458
Okay... Then what's causing it?

364
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,250
[KOIZUMI]
Miss Suzumiya.

365
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,125
[sighs]

366
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,791
[KOIZUMI] Somewhere
inside her, there's a desire

367
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,708
to have summer
vacation last forever.

368
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,125
I'm sure she
doesn't even realize it.

369
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,083
[KYON] You mean she still
hasn't had enough fun?

370
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,833
[KOIZUMI]
That's what I think anyway.

371
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,416
Perhaps she feels
there's something else

372
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,958
that needs to happen before our
summer vacation can truly end.

373
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,541
[KYON growls]

374
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,750
All right, what do you
want me to do about it?

375
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,791
If I knew that, we'd have
this problem solved by now.

376
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,875
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

377
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,041
You seem like
you're enjoying this.

378
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,166
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

379
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,750
Please don't take
that the wrong way,

380
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,791
but this explains
the feelings of déjà vu

381
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,083
we've both been having.

382
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,625
[KYON]
Are... we the only ones?

383
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,375
Or can other people feel
this happening, too?

384
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,291
[KOIZUMI]
It doesn't seem like it.

385
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,375
But then, you and I are
exceptions to the rule.

386
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,791
The only people who can sense
these strange feelings happening

387
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,833
are the ones who are
closest to Miss Suzumiya.

388
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,375
But, what about Haruhi?

389
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,416
Doesn't she get that
weird feeling, too?

390
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,666
[KOIZUMI]
No, I don't think she does.

391
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,541
Besides, it would be
very bad for us if she did.

392
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,958
[KOIZUMI]
But...

393
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,875
...there is someone else.

394
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,583
Someone who isn't
affected by the time loop,

395
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,958
or the feelings of
déjà vu we've had.

396
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,500
She remembers it all.

397
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,333
I can't imagine what that
would be like for someone.

398
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,125
Okay then, who is it?

399
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,666
You already know. Don't you?

400
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,125
[KYON]
Hmm.

401
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,750
[KOIZUMI] The thought entity
transcends time and space,

402
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,416
and so does she.

403
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,083
Nagato, is that true?

404
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,125
It is.

405
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,166
So, then you can
remember everything?

406
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,041
I can.

407
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,875
Okay then, how many times did we

408
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,541
re-live the last two
weeks up till now?

409
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,666
This would be 15, 513 times.

410
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,125
[gasps]

411
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,250
[KYON] Fifteen thousand
five-hundred thirteen times?

412
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,833
What do you mean 15,513 times?

413
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,500
Nagato, do you know
what you just said?

414
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,833
[KYON] And... you're being
completely serious?

415
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,416
[NAGATO]
Yes.

416
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,125
[KYON] So, you're saying that
we've done the exact same things

417
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,708
every single time,
that many times?

418
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,875
[NAGATO]
Not necessarily.

419
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:35,583
[KYON]
Huh?

420
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,416
What do you mean?

421
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,583
[NAGATO] Throughout 15,513
repetitions, we did not attend

422
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:46,833
a bon festival the 2,391st
time and the 11,054th time.

423
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,083
[KYON]
Uh--

424
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,500
[NAGATO] We went to a
bon festival but did not

425
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,750
go to a goldfish
scooping booth 437 times.

426
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,166
We obtained part-time
jobs 9,031 times

427
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,666
--and worked six different jobs.
--[MIKURU whimpers]

428
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,666
In addition to handing
out balloons,

429
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,000
we worked as movers, cashiers--

430
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,041
[KYON]
Got it. I got it.

431
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,666
[KYON] Fifteen thousand
five-hundred thirteen times...

432
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,750
That's what she said.

433
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,708
Times two weeks...

434
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:27,708
That's, uh...
about... 594 years.

435
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,208
She's the only one of us who
remembers everything we did.

436
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:35,125
And she's had to repeat them
over and over and over again.

437
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,375
[KYON]
Nagato...

438
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,041
What's it like to re-live the
same things that many times?

439
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,333
[chuckles]

440
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,791
[HARUHI]
I wonder if they're real.

441
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:50,666
[KYON]
Who?

442
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,000
[HARUHI]
Martians.

443
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,333
[KYON]
I kind of hope they aren't.

444
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,250
[HARUHI] I bet they're
a noble race of beings

445
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,291
who have to live underground.

446
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,583
They're probably friendly, too.

447
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,708
[KYON]
Yeah, dream on.

448
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,875
[HARUHI]
This is boring... I know!

449
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,125
I'm gonna look for UFOs now.

450
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,208
[KYON] You know, I wish I knew
what else she wanted to do.

451
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,125
[KOIZUMI]
Yes, what indeed.

452
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,416
If we knew that, we'd be on our
way to solving this problem.

453
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,375
[KOIZUMI] I know!
Why don't we try this out?

454
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,833
[KYON]
What?

455
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,875
What if someone were to grab
Miss Suzumiya from behind?

456
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,000
And then they whisper, "I love
you," right into her ear?

457
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,125
And who's gonna be
doing the whispering?

458
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,333
Can you think of anyone

459
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,083
better suited to play
that role than you?

460
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,291
I'm exercising my right to veto!

461
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,583
I won't do it.

462
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,291
If that's how you feel...

463
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,541
All right, then I'll
give it a shot.

464
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,416
[KOIZUMI grunts]
Just kidding.

465
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
That role requires a certain
something which I lack.

466
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,750
Besides, it would just
confuse Miss Suzumiya,

467
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,416
and we wouldn't want that.

468
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,958
[KYON sighs]

469
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,083
[HARUHI grunts]

470
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,541
Hey, Nagato.

471
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,875
You knew about this time
loop thing we're stuck in

472
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,500
way before Miss Asahina
figured it out, didn't you?

473
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,750
Yes.

474
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,166
So, how come you didn't
say anything about it?

475
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,458
My function is to observe.

476
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,791
--Understood.
--[HARUHI grunts]

477
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:13,666
[HARUHI]
All right!

478
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,750
[KYON]
Hm?

479
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,000
I did it! Look! I got
a home run! Yay!

480
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,500
[KYON]
We were always doing something,

481
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,125
always on the move.

482
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,833
We went to a real firework show,

483
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,708
and we even signed up for
a goby fishing tournament.

484
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:29,083
We did the test of courage,
went to the beach, went bowling,

485
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,833
did some karaoke,
and went to the movies.

486
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,875
And the whole time,
all I could think was that

487
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,791
none of it was going to
be enough for Haruhi.

488
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,458
But, what could I do about it?

489
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,333
Nothing.

490
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,083
So, I just bit my
lip and watched

491
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:46,500
as the last days of our
summer vacation went by.

492
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,958
And then, before I
knew it, it was August the 30th.

493
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,291
[HARUHI] That's it. We've done
everything on our list.

494
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,666
[sighs]

495
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,208
But, now I wonder
if we did enough.

496
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,625
Hmm, oh well... Yeah...
I guess we did a lot.

497
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,291
Unless... does anyone else
have anything they wanna do?

498
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, okay then.

499
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,541
We pretty much did everything
we set out to do this summer,

500
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,166
so I guess that's good enough.

501
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,958
[KYON]
No, it's not.

502
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,041
You're still not satisfied.

503
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,625
Okay, then.
We're done for today!

504
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,666
[MIKURU gasps]

505
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,083
I set tomorrow
aside just in case,

506
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,416
but I guess you can
all take the day off now.

507
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,083
I'll see you guys at the
club room on Monday, okay?

508
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,833
[KYON]
Wait.

509
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,958
Haruhi, wait.

510
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,250
Don't go.

511
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,875
Wait, come back.

512
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,000
If I let her walk out that door,

we're gonna have to re-live
the past two weeks

514
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,291
over and over again,

515
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,166
maybe for a thousand more times.

516
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,375
[KYON]
But... what should I do?

517
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,500
What should I say?

518
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:07,083
There must have been a clue in
something Haruhi said, but...

519
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,041
...what was it?

520
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,291
What's she been
saying all this time?

521
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,125
[KYON]
I... I don't know.

522
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,666
Wait...

523
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,750
Stop...

524
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,583
Haruhi...

525
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,583
[gasps]

526
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,458
[SERVER]
Thank you! Come again!

527
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,750
[KYON]
It's August the 31st.

528
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,666
I haven't touched my homework.

529
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,375
[sighs] Whatever...
It doesn't matter anymore.

530
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,333
There isn't any
point in doing it.

531
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,291
We're just gonna keep re-living
the last couple weeks anyway.

532
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:52,708
[KYON] Whatever happens next,
whether tomorrow comes or not,

533
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,375
a different version of me
will have to deal with it.

534
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,125
[KYON sighs]
