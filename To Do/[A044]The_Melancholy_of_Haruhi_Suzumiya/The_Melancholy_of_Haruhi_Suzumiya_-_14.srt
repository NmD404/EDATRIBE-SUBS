1
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,791
[KYON]
Something's... wrong.

2
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,791
That's what it felt like anyway.

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,583
[KYON] The game on TV
was between schools from

4
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,000
another town. Now, I had nothing
to do with either school,

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,250
but because I tend to
sympathize with underdogs,

6
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,708
I found myself routing
for the losing team.

7
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,875
And right about then,
I suddenly got the feeling

8
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,875
Haruhi was gonna call.

9
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,500
[phone ringing]

10
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,541
[KYON groans]

11
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,041
Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

12
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,750
[KYON]
I know, I know.

13
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:02,125
[phone ringing]

14
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,541
[HARUHI]
Hey, you're free, right?

15
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,583
Good, meet us at 2:00 o'clock
in front of the station.

16
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,791
Don't be late!

17
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,291
[dial tone]

18
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,291
[KYON] I didn't even have
the chance to say anything.

19
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,291
[phone ringing]

20
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,375
[KYON]
Hm?

21
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,333
[KYON'S SISTER]
It's your phone again.

22
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,166
[KYON]
Yeah, I know.

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,375
Now what?

24
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,583
[HARUHI] I forgot to
tell you, make sure to

25
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,333
bring your swim trunks,
and some money, too.

26
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,791
And your bike.

27
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,541
Definitely bring your bike.
That's it! Over and out!

28
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,666
[dial tone]

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,708
Huh?

30
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,875
[KYON] It was like I knew
what Haruhi was gonna say

31
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,541
before she said it.

32
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,041
Yeah, no.

33
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,833
Actually, it felt like
we had the exact

34
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:40,916
same conversation before.
Like déjà vu or something.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,375
[COMMENTATOR]
...straight for left field.

36
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,958
And it's over the fence.
Another home run.

37
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,208
That makes is eight for Jyonan.

38
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,916
Well, you're late, Kyon!
Where's your motivation, huh?

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,916
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry
if I kept you waiting.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No worries, I just got here too.

41
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,083
And now that we're all present
and accounted for, we can go!

42
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,125
[KYON]
Where?

43
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,250
The public pool!
Where do you think?

44
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,625
[KYON]
Yeah, that figures.

45
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,541
[HARUHI] We've got lots and lots
of summer vacationy things to do

46
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,791
during our break,
we've only so much time,

47
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,000
and once it's gone,
it's gone for good.

48
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,750
So we're gonna do everything
we can while we can

49
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:35,000
during our only summer
as tenth graders.

50
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:39,041
And for starters, we're gonna
ride the bikes to the pool.

51
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,708
[KYON] Did everyone
ride their bikes today?

52
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,583
No. The only bikes we have
are the ones you and I brought.

53
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,750
Okay, you guys. Are you ready?

54
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,375
Is anyone ever ready?

55
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,958
I'm good to go.

56
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,208
Don't let Koizumi
beat you, okay, Kyon?

57
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,916
Full speed ahead!

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,958
[KYON grunts]
Damn it!

59
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:32,916
[KYON panting]

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,250
[HARUHI]
Kyon.

61
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,625
We're trying to have fun,
so stop acting tired.

62
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,250
You're such a slacker.

63
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,291
[KYON]
And whose fault is that, huh?

64
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,458
[HARUHI]
Ah. Can you smell the chlorine?

65
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,208
That really makes
it feel like summer.

66
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,458
Come on, it's time
for a swim! I'll race ya!

67
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
[CHILDREN yelping]

68
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,125
[KYON] Can't you see
the no diving sign?

69
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,666
Hurry up and get in!

70
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,375
Come on! The water's
all warm and perfect!

71
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,958
[KYON groans]

72
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,625
Well, you have to admit, that
certainly does look like fun.

73
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,458
I mean, seeing Miss Suzumiya
enjoy herself in a normal way,

74
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,958
it's rather charming,
don't you think?

75
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,708
As long as Miss
Suzumiya's laughing

76
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,625
and just havin' a good time,

77
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,666
we don't have to worry about any
earth-shattering events, do we?

78
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,333
[KYON]
Hm. I hope you're right.

79
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,958
Is something wrong?

80
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,625
Hey, Koizumi.

81
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,625
Don't know. Maybe it's
just my imagination.

82
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,083
But with everything that's
happened since we met,

83
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,625
you could say that I've
become slightly paranoid.

84
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,666
Come on, let's go for a swim.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,958
Hey!

86
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,291
[KYON]
Hey!

87
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,458
[HARUHI]
Take that!

88
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,583
[HARUHI giggling]

89
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,833
[HARUHI]
Come back!

90
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,958
[KYON] Jeez. Now I know
why they call it a "public"

91
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,750
swimming pool. Seems like
everyone in town's here today.

92
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,208
[KYON]
Hm? Uh.

93
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,500
[KYON gasps]

94
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,500
That's weird.

95
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,666
It's like I've seen
this happen once before.

96
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,708
With Nagato looking
kind of bored like that.

97
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,416
And then...

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,875
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

99
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,500
[KYON] Uh-huh. And then
Haruhi shows up and she says...

100
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,250
[HARUHI] These two guys
are my brigade members,

101
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,291
they do what I say,

102
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,208
so if you want
something, ask them.

103
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,708
[HARUHI]
It's time to have some fun!

104
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:40,166
Come on! Let's go
play water soccer!

105
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,541
[KYON] Oh well.
Sometimes déjà vu's happen.

106
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,125
[HARUHI]
Here I go, Mikuru!

107
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,583
[MIKURU]
Okay!

108
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,833
--[HARUHI grunts]
--[MIKURU yelps]

109
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,791
[HARUHI]
Sorry!

110
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,541
[KYON]
What's that for?

111
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,500
[HARUHI] I got thinking
about some of the fun things

112
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,375
we could be doing. So I
came up with this schedule

113
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,708
of how we're going to spend
the rest of our vacation.

114
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,958
Just think about it, 

115
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,333
we've only got two more
weeks before it's over.

116
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,291
And even though we've
done a lot up till now,

117
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,500
it still feels like
we've got a lot to do.

118
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,375
Since we've only got a
little bit of time left,

119
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,541
I made this list so we
could pick up the pace.

120
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,083
Is there anything you
want to do, Mikuru?

121
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,916
[MIKURU] Umm... I'd like
to try goldfish scooping.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,500
[HARUHI]
Okay! Goldfish scooping.

123
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,375
[KOIZUMU]
Could I see that?

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,958
[KOIZUMU]
Thank you.

125
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,125
[HARUHI] Does anyone know
if there's a bon festival

126
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,541
happening close by?
Or a firework show?

127
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,625
[KOIZUMU] I can check and
see if there's anything.

128
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,958
[HARUHI] Oh! Don't foget
about the goldfish scooping.

129
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,875
It's Mikuru's only request.

130
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll get right on it, then.

131
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,041
Okay, Kyon! We're
starting tomorrow!

132
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,250
[phone ringing]

133
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,041
[KYON] The next morning, I was
waken from my peaceful slumber

134
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,083
by a call from Haruhi.

135
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,208
[KYON] She said they
found a bon festival.

136
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,833
It was happening tonight
at a park... somewhere.

137
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,416
[HARUHI] Mikuru and Yuki
say they don't have yukatas.

138
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,166
So I decided we're gonna go
out and buy some to wear

139
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,333
for tonight. I don't
have one either,

140
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,791
but I found a place in town

141
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,541
that sells them in
sets for really cheap.

142
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,333
And you guys get
to come with us!

143
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,416
[KYON groans]

144
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,416
[KYON] So, we went
to a clothing outlet.

145
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,583
Haruhi picked out yukatas
for Miss Asahina and Nagato.

146
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,000
Then, marched them straight
into the changing rooms.

147
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,500
After making us wait about an
hour or so, insert yawn here,

148
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,000
they finally emerged.

149
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,750
[gasps]

150
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,000
[KYON]
Excellent.

151
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,416
The three of you look
wonderful in those.

152
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,208
Of course we do! I
picked 'em out myself.

153
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,916
Especially Mikuru's.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,250
[HARUHI squeals]

155
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,083
Look at you. You're so
cute. I'm a genius.

156
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,250
Uh... Uh, thanks.

157
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,916
[KYON]
Miss Asahina, you look awesome!

158
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,416
[KYON sighs]
It figures it'd be so crowded.

159
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,750
Huh?

160
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,000
[gasps]

161
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,291
There it is again. That feeling.

162
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,375
I haven't been to a
bon festival in a while,

163
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,458
but it feels like I
just went to one.

164
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,583
That tower.

165
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,000
Those vendors.

166
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,416
Weird.

167
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,250
[HARUHI]
Mikuru!

168
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,625
Come on! Look!

169
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,958
They've got goldfish
scooping just like you wanted!

170
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,083
Over here!

171
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,208
[MIKURU]
Oh, uh, okay!

172
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,000
How 'bout it, wanna
scoop some fish?

173
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,041
No, I think I'll pass.

174
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,833
Don't tell me you're actually
into this kinda stuff.

175
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,208
Which one? It's on me.

176
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,875
No.

177
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,625
That.

178
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,666
Righty-o!

179
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,125
[KYON] I wish she would've
let me buy that for her.

180
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,000
It's the least I could do
after all she's done for us.

181
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,875
[HARUHI]
I caught 13 fish!

182
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,333
It's like the most
unbelievable haul ever!

183
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,250
But I don't have any
place to keep 'em all,

184
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,250
so I kept one and gave
the other to Mikuru.

185
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:18,500
Oh? Yuki? What's up?
What's with the mask?

186
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,125
[NAGATO]
I bought it.

187
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,166
Okay.

188
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,375
[KYON]
Hm?

189
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,750
[HARUHI]
I need your back for a second.

190
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,583
[KYON]
Why?

191
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,291
[HARUHI]
Just turn around.

192
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,416
Hey, don't!

193
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,833
[HARUHI] Fireworks!
That's what we're gonna do next!

194
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,958
We'll have a firework
show to end the day!

195
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,000
[KYON]
Do you even understand

196
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,458
the meaning of the
word moderation?

197
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,666
[KYON] It was summer,
and summer vacation.

198
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,125
And I guess that's why I
wanted to forget about it.

199
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,000
But the truth was, I couldn't
ignore it any longer.

200
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,583
Okay, everyone. Tomorrow,
we're gonna go catch some bugs.

201
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,583
It's the SOS Brigade
cicada catching contest!

202
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,166
And whoever catches the
most bugs tomorrow in gonna

203
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,333
get to be brigade
leader for one whole day!

204
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,291
Haruhi, I don't
wanna spoil your fun,

205
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,208
but have you finished
your homework yet?

206
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,000
[HARUHI]
Huh?

207
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,666
You're kidding me, right?
That stuff's totally easy.

208
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,583
You can finish it
in like three days.

209
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,416
You have to get
rid of that junk first

210
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,708
so you can spend the rest
of your summer having fun

211
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,416
and not worrying about it.
That's the only way

212
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,541
to really get the most
out of your vacation.

213
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,166
[MIKURU]
Wow.

214
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,416
[KYON] Why does she
have to be so smart?

215
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,125
[KYON] The next day was
beautiful, sunny and bright.

216
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,833
In fact, it was the perfect day

217
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:40,125
to have our SOS Brigade
cicada catching contest.

218
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,125
And although everyone caught
bugs the best way they knew how,

219
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,375
the winner of the contest ended
up being, you guessed it,

220
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,416
Haruhi.

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,166
[KYON]
We met the next day,

222
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,500
even though we had no
idea what was going on.

223
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,958
Our cluelessness continued as we
were made to wear frog costumes

224
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,000
and hand balloons out in front
of the local supermarket.

225
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,291
Welcome to our part-time job.

226
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,666
[KYON grunts]

227
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,500
Is everything okay down there?

228
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,166
I thought I was gonna die!

229
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,208
[HARUHI] Thanks for all the hard
work, especially in this heat.

230
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,708
The manager's super
grateful for everything.

231
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:17,291
Who the hell cares how grateful
he is. What about our pay?

232
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,541
This is it.

233
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,083
I've had my eye on
this guy for a while.

234
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,250
The manager gave it to us,

235
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,083
'cause Mikuru looked
so darn cute in it.

236
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,583
[KYON] That's what
we worked so hard for?

237
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:31,125
Mikuru, you have my permission
to wear 'em whenever you want.

238
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,125
Isn't he awesome?

239
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,125
[KYON]
Ribbit.

240
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:41,833
[phone ringing]

241
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,625
[KYON]
Later that night,

242
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:49,000
my peaceful slumber was
interrupted by a phone call.

243
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,166
[KYON]
Ugh, damn it.

244
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,875
[phone ringing]

245
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,750
[KYON]
Hello.

246
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:55,875
[MIKURU crying]

247
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,500
[KYON yelping]

248
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,750
[MIKURU]
Kyon...

249
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,833
Is that you, Miss Asahina?

250
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,750
[MIKURU]
Yes, it's me.

251
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:13,583
Something really bad...
I don't know...

252
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,541
What's wr--?

253
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,083
[KOIZUMU]
Hello. It's Koizumi.

254
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,500
Why are you with Miss Asahina
in the middle of the night?!

255
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,500
[KOIZUMU]
We have a situation here.

256
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,708
Is it possible for you to
come meet us right now?

257
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,958
[KYON]
Of course! I'll be right over!

258
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,375
[KYON grunting]

259
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,250
[MIKURU crying]

260
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,291
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

261
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,833
[KYON]
Miss Asahina, what happened?

262
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,208
It's terrible, Kyon.

263
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,750
I can't go back to
the future anymore!

264
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,166
[MIKURU crying]

265
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,625
You can't go back?

266
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,875
But you're...
What are you saying?

267
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,791
I'll explain it the best I can.

268
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,500
We're currently
stuck in a time loop

269
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,791
that seems to have no end to it.

270
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,541
[KYON]
Huh? A what?

271
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,208
We're currently
stuck in a time loop

272
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,125
that seems to have no end to it.

273
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,166
[KYON]
Uh.

274
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,291
We're currently
stuck in a time loop

275
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,291
that seems to have no end--

276
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,708
[KYON]
Come on, Koizumi.

277
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,541
Do you realize
what you just said?

278
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,208
Yes, of course I do.

279
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,500
And much more than I
want to, believe me.

280
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,208
Earlier, I was having a
word with Miss Asahina.

281
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,458
[KYON]
Call me, next time.

282
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,041
[KOIZUMU] And that was
when we both realized

283
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,041
something seemed a little off
about the current flow of time.

284
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,416
Actually, Miss Asahina was
the one discovered it first.

285
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,958
Thanks to her, my suspicions
were confirmed.

286
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,208
Suspicions?

287
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,375
We've been reliving the
same period of time

288
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,250
over and over again, stuck in an

289
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,166
infinite time loop without
any way of getting unstuck.

290
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,916
I know, you already said that.

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,833
We've been repeating
every single day

292
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,750
between August the
17th through the 31st,

293
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,541
and have become stuck
right in the middle

294
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,166
of what seems to be an
endless summer vacation.

295
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,958
Well, we're definitely in
the middle of something.

296
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,041
It's a never-ending, endless
summer to be precise.

297
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,916
The future doesn't exist
in this world any longer.

298
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,458
All time stops at
September the 1st.

299
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,500
And that's the
reason Miss Asahina

300
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,500
can't travel back to the future.

301
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,000
It's only natural that she
can't return to a future

302
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,750
that no longer exists.

303
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,291
Are you kidding me?

304
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,166
There's nothing natural
about a concept like that.

305
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,208
Who's gonna believe
such nonsense?

306
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:28,250
For starters, we were
sort of hoping you would.

307
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,791
Hey, guys.

308
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,250
I think I can try to explain it.

309
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,791
Here I go...

310
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,208
Because I have to
classify information,

311
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:42,458
I used classified information
to get in touch with the future.

312
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,541
The thing is,

313
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,791
I haven't gotten any classified
information for a week.

314
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,958
So we started to think
how weird that was.

315
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,375
I was so surprised.

316
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,166
I classified information,
I really did...

317
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,833
[KYON]
Oh, Miss Asahina.

318
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,083
Are the classified information
things you're talking about

319
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,333
Stuff you can't say on TV?

320
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,416
So, what about
those closed spaces

321
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,791
you were talking about before?

322
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,208
Is it possible we're trapped
in something like that?

323
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,000
No, it's not one of those.

324
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,250
A specific section of
time has been torn away.

325
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:21,041
At exactly midnight on August
the 31st, everything resets,

326
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,541
and then time
reverts straight back

327
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,666
to the morning
of August the 17th.

328
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,333
That's the process.

329
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,708
What about our...?

330
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,500
Wait, what about the
whole world's memories?

331
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,666
Their memory resets as well.

332
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,666
Everyone's memory starts
over from the beginning again.

333
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,875
Perfect. It's another
problem involving time.

334
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,541
[KYON sighs]

335
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,000
Well, I guess I shouldn't
be surprised about that.

336
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,375
No, Miss Asahina doesn't
have anything to do with it.

337
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,250
Okay. What does?

338
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,333
Miss Suzumiya does.

339
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,583
[KYON groans]

340
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,750
Somewhere deep down inside her, 

341
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,583
there's a desire to have
summer vacation last forever,

342
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,625
and I'm sure she
doesn't even realize it.

343
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,875
No way.

344
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,708
Are you saying she still
hasn't had enough fun?

345
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,541
That's what it looks like to me.
Perhaps she feels there's

346
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,916
something else
that needs to happen

347
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,541
before our summer
vacation can really be over.

348
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,166
[KYON sighs]
Oh man.

349
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,625
The trouble she gets us into
is always galactic in scale.

350
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,000
You know, you're acting
like you're enjoying this

351
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,291
an awful lot, you
wanna tell me why?

352
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,208
Please don't take
that the wrong way,

353
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,208
but this explains the feelings
of déjà vu I've been having.

354
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,625
And looking back on it now,

355
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,916
they were most likely the
residue of my memories

356
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,958
whenever time had been reset.

357
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,125
You've been feeling
them too, haven't you?

358
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,958
Are we the only ones, or
can other people feel it, too?

359
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,625
[KOIZUMU]
Mh-hm.

360
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,666
It looks like you and I are
exceptions to the rule.

361
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,333
The only people who can
sense this strange feeling

362
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,000
would be the ones who are
the closest to Miss Suzumiya.

363
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,250
Then what about Haruhi?

364
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,041
Does she even know this
stuff's even happening?

365
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,250
No, I don't think
she really does.

366
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,208
Besides, I think
it would be very,

367
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,416
very bad for us if she did.

368
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,166
But... there's someone else.

369
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,208
Someone who isn't
affected by the time loop

370
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,041
or the feelings of déjà vu
we've been experiencing.

371
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,375
They remember it all.

372
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,791
Really? And who
would that person be?

373
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,750
I think you know who it is.

374
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,875
[KYON gasps]

375
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,166
Nagato. Is that the truth?

376
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,041
It is.

377
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,916
And you can remember everything?

378
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,958
I can.

379
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,875
Then, can you tell me how many
times this has happened so far?

380
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,833
This would be 15,499 times.

381
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,541
[KYON gasps]

382
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,625
[KYON] Fifteen thousand,
four-hundred ninety-nine?

383
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,958
What do you mean 15,499?

384
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,958
What are you saying, Nagato?

385
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,916
Okay, are you being
totally serious?

386
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,375
[NAGATO]
Yes.

387
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,750
So, what you're saying we've
done the exact same things

388
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,375
every time that many times?

389
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,875
[NAGATO]
Not necessarily.

390
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,125
Throughout 15,499 repetitions,

391
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:03,041
we did not attend a bon
festival the 2,391st time

392
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,291
and the 11,054th time.

393
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,500
We went to a bon
festival but did not go

394
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,791
to a fish scooping
booth 437 times.

395
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,166
We obtained part-time
jobs 9,026 times

396
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,125
and worked six different jobs.

397
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,125
In addition to
handing out balloons,

398
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,875
we worked as movers, cashiers, 

399
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,625
we handed out flowers,
worked as--

400
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,875
I got it. That's enough.

401
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,541
[KYON] Fifteen thousand,
four-hundred ninety-nine times.

402
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:42,958
That's what she said. Times two
weeks. That's... 594 years.

403
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,916
She's the only one who
remembers everything we did.

404
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,708
And she's had to repeat
them over and over again.

405
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,416
Nagato.

406
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,291
What's it like to relive the
same things that many times?

407
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,666
That's gotta be the
craziest story ever.

408
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,250
[KYON] The next night,
we went stargazing.

409
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,583
We were on the balcony
of Nagato's apartment

410
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,125
and Koizumi brought
the telescope.

411
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,666
[HARUHI groans]
I'm getting bored.

412
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,625
I'm gonna look for UFOs now.

413
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,166
[KYON] Uh! Hey! Haruhi,
you'll break it! Wait! Stop!

414
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,041
Don't spin it like that!

415
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,375
[KYON] I wish I knew
what else she wants to do.

416
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,375
[KOIZUMI] Well now, that's
the all-important question,

417
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:36,833
isn't it? If we knew the answer,
we could solve this problem.

418
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,500
I've got an idea,
how 'bout we try this?

419
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,291
What if someone were to suddenly
grab Miss Suzumiya from behind

420
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,375
and then they whispered,
"I love you" right into her ear.

421
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,041
And who's going
to be doing this?

422
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,416
Who else could play
that role other than you?

423
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,291
Well, you can count me out then!

424
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,166
All right. How 'bout
if I give it a try?

425
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,583
[chuckles]
No, I'm just kidding.

426
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,250
I really don't think I
can pull it off anyway.

427
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,458
And besides, it would just end
up confusing Miss Suzumiya.

428
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,458
[KYON sighs]

429
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,833
[KYON]
We kept chugging along,

430
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,166
doing all kinds of
summer vacation things.

431
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,125
We went to the batting cages,

432
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,833
to a real firework show,

433
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,875
and we even signed up for
a goby fishing tournament.

434
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,666
We did the "test of courage."

435
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,416
Watched some movies,
went to the beach,

436
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,750
bowling, and karaoke.

437
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,000
Yup, we were always
doing somethin'.

438
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,333
[KYON] And the whole time,
all I could think was that

439
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,916
none of it was going
to be enough for Haruhi.

440
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,625
But what could I do
about it? Nothing.

441
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,208
So, I just bit my lip

442
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,708
and watched as the last days of
our summer vacation went by.

443
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,375
And then, before I knew it,
August the 30th was here.

444
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,416
Again.

445
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,833
[HARUHI] That's it, we've done
everything on our list.

446
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,125
[HARUHI sighs]

447
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,958
But now I'm wonder
if we did enough.

448
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,416
Eh, oh well, I guess
we got to do a lot.

449
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,666
Hey, does anyone wanna
do anything else?

450
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,583
Oh, okay.

451
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,333
I guess we did everything that
we set out to do this summer,

452
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,000
so that's good enough.

453
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,708
[KYON]
No, it's not, Haruhi.

454
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,208
Not by a long shot.

455
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,791
You're still not satisfied.

456
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,041
--[HARUHI chuckles]
--[KYON gasps]

457
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,958
Okay, guys, we're
done for today.

458
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,833
I set tomorrow
aside just in case,

459
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,541
but I guess you can
take the day off now.

460
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,791
I'll see you all at the
club room on Monday.

461
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,041
[KYON gasps]

462
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,500
[KYON]
Wait, Haruhi!

463
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,458
There's that feeling again.

464
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,541
And it's way stronger
than all the others.

465
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,291
I can't let Haruhi leave.

466
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,166
If I let her walk out that door,

467
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,750
we'll end up reliving the past
two weeks again and again

468
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,416
for a thousand more times.

469
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,000
But... what should I do?

470
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,666
What should I say?

471
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,958
There must've been a clue
in something Haruhi said,

472
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:02,291
but what was it?

473
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,541
What's she been
saying all this time?

474
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,041
[KYON]
I don't know...

475
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,083
Can't remember.

476
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,375
[KYON]
It's August the 31st.

477
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,333
I haven't touched my homework.

478
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:36,875
[KYON sighs]
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

479
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,500
There isn't any
point in doing it.

480
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,666
We're just gonna keep reliving

481
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,750
the last couple of
weeks over again.

482
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,791
[yawns]

483
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,250
[KYON] Whatever happens next,
whether tomorrow comes or not,

484
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,708
a different version of me
will have to deal with it.
