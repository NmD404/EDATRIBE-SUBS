1
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,333
We're movin' on
to the next scene!

2
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,625
In this one, Yuki,
I want you to use your magic

3
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,833
to zap the heck outta Mikuru!

4
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,458
[KYON]
Your answer should be, "No!

5
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,875
There's absolutely
no way I'd let you

6
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,416
hurt Miss Asahina
with your powers!"

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,666
Look at her...

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,833
[KYON]
She's so terrified,

9
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,291
she's turning blue
and shaking like crazy!

10
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,916
Oh, well...

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,458
I guess we'll have to use
CG effects in this scene.

12
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,125
Hey, Kyon, don't forget to

13
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:06,291
make a couple of beams come out
of Yuki's wand, okay?

14
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,375
[KYON]
How am I supposed to know

15
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,708
how to make a
visual effect like that?

16
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,041
[HARUHI] Okay, Mikuru!
I want you to scream,

17
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,458
and then fall down
like you're in pain!

18
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,958
[MIKURU]
Ahhhh...

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,791
Ahh...

20
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,250
[HARUHI]
Hmm...

21
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,125
We need a scene with pigeons.

22
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:58,916
[KYON]
What?

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,250
There's a shrine nearby.

24
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,875
We're going there next.

25
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,458
I wanna shoot Mikuru
walking heroically

26
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,333
as pigeons fly all around her.

27
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,333
[HARUHI] It would be so awesome
if the pigeons were all white.

28
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,083
But I guess it doesn't matter
what color they are.

29
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,166
[KYON]
Can't you read Japanese?!

30
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,375
[whimpers]

31
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,541
[KYON] What am I
supposed to be shooting?

32
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,291
[HARUHI]
Hwah!

33
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,625
[yelps]

34
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,250
Kyon! That's the shot!
Hurry up, roll the camera!

35
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,333
Don't just sit there,
look heroic!

36
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,125
[PRIEST] Hey!
Whaddya think you're doing?!

37
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,416
[GROUP screams]

38
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,666
Yah!

39
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,208
[KYON]
Uh-oh!

40
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,333
[MONK grunting]

41
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,583
[HARUHI]
Retreat!

42
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:46,041
--[KYON panting]
--[MIKURU whimpering]

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,458
[sobs]

44
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,791
[HARUHI]
Oh, Mikuru...

45
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,750
You don't eat much, do you?

46
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,083
You'll never get any bigger
if you don't eat more.

47
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,666
If your boobs are
the only things growing,

48
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,791
you'll only appeal
to a small fanbase.

49
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,375
You need to get taller.

50
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,958
[KYON]
She'll grow up, all right.

51
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,541
I dunno how many years it'll
take, but Miss Asahina is

52
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,416
gonna grow up to have
a face and body so fine,

53
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,541
she could be a contender
for the Miss Universe pageant.

54
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,541
But I doubt she knows that yet.

55
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,458
[KYON] Hey, Haruhi.
What are you gonna do

56
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,958
if that priest decides to file
a complaint with our school?

57
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,666
Koizumi's wearing
his uniform today,

58
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,541
and that's pretty much
a dead giveaway.

59
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,708
Aw, don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

60
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,916
Besides, jackets
like that are common.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,916
If the priest says something,
we'll just play dumb.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,583
[KYON] Once we show
this movie to everyone,

63
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,333
our cover's gonna be blown.

64
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,750
I mean, I seriously doubt
there are that many waitresses

65
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,041
coming out to the shrine

66
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,166
just so they can run around
with the pigeons.

67
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,791
Anyway, what next?
Where are we shooting?

68
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,541
I'm thinkin' we go back to
the park and shoot some more.

69
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,833
I just realized that we

70
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,500
didn't get enough footage
for the fight scene.

71
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,291
I wanna get Mikuru running for
her life through the forest,

72
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,041
with Yuki chasing her!

73
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,666
Then, we could have Mikuru
fall off a cliff!

74
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,708
But Koizumi just happens
to be walking by

75
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,333
and saves her
at the last minute!

76
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,625
[KYON] What a slap-dash way
to come up with a story.

77
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,208
Wait, what if she really does

78
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,916
make Miss Asahina
fall off a cliff?

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,916
You should fall off instead!

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,625
Why don't you wear her costume
and be her stunt double?

81
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,458
You're not as busty
as Miss Asahina, but still.

82
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,583
Hey, what are you
thinking about?

83
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,708
If you think I'm gonna
put on her waitress outfit,

84
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,625
you've got another think comin'!

85
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,875
[KYON]
She's a mind reader?

86
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,375
Is anyone else going
to be in the movie,

87
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,500
or just the three of us?

88
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,208
[KYON]
Don't ask stupid questions!

89
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,375
You've got a point.

90
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,833
Three characters
might not be enough.

91
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,458
Thanks for the
head's up, Koizumi!

92
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,166
I almost missed that one!

93
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,291
You just got more screen time!

94
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,375
Oh, wow! Thank you!

95
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,958
[KYON]
Serves you right.

96
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,500
You go stirring up a hornets'
nest, you get what you deserve.

97
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,416
Notice I didn't say anything.

98
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,000
Before the boss can be defeated,

99
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,250
the good guys have to beat up
a buncha minions first.

100
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,416
Are minions gonna work, though?

101
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,375
[KYON]
Minions are good.

102
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,041
I know, right?

103
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,625
[KYON]
Taniguchi and Kunikida,

104
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,416
the perfect
supporting characters.

105
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,833
Ultimate minions.

106
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,916
[HARUHI]
A lot of bad stuff

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,250
has to happen to Mikuru
in this movie.

108
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,625
After all, the theme
of the story

109
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,958
depends on how hard she suffers.

110
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,833
She has to overcome
horrible odds

111
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,041
before she can have
a happy ending.

112
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,500
And the more we can make
Mikuru suffer in the movie,

113
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,750
the bigger the pay off
is gonna be in the end!

114
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,000
[MIKURU sobbing]

115
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,916
[KYON] What's with that
look she just gave me?

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,500
Does she really think I'm
gonna let this happen to her?

117
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,875
[KYON] Later, we returned to the
park and the woods for more fun.

118
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,541
We're not gonna use the
guns in the next scene.

119
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,875
I was hoping for something
cooler and flashier,

120
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,500
but ours don't
shoot smoke or flames.

121
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,250
They're just not
realistic enough.

122
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,208
Mikuru, you stand here.

123
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,083
Yuki, you're over here.

124
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,500
[MIKURU whimpers]

125
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,958
[HARUHI]
Don't move from your marks.

126
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,708
I wanna shoot you guys staring
each other down, okay?

127
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,041
[HARUHI] Grab the reflector
board, Koizumi.

128
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,166
And, action!

129
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,791
[KYON]
What the--?!

130
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,541
[MIKURU whimpers]

131
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,708
[KYON]
Action?

132
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,625
All you did was
tell them to stand there.

133
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,750
What kind of action were you
expecting out of them anyway?

134
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,875
[MIKURU]
Hah!

135
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,166
Uh...

136
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,416
[HARUHI]
Oh, come on!

137
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,291
You call this a battle scene?!

138
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,125
[KYON]
What do you expect?

139
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,166
They're just standing there.

140
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,708
[MIKURU]
Huh?

141
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,333
[yelps]

142
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,625
What is your problem?

143
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,125
Just because you're cute

144
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,000
doesn't mean you have the
right to slack off, you know!

145
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,208
There are lots of other
girls who are just as cute

146
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,208
who'd kill for your spot!

147
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,875
If you don't get
with the program,

148
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,166
you're gonna be left in the dust

149
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,458
by someone even
younger and cuter!

150
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,875
[KYON]
What's she talking about?

151
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,541
Do something, Mikuru!

152
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,875
At least try shooting
a beam out of your eye!

153
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,541
Huh?

154
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,875
I can't do that!

155
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,541
That's the whole point
of your left eye

156
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,083
being a different color!

157
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,583
I didn't just make it
blue for no reason!

158
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,250
There's incredible power
hidden inside that eye.

159
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,083
That's what the
beam's all about!

160
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,458
It's the Mikuru Beam,
so start firing it!

161
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,416
I can't!

162
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,583
Get into it! Fire it!

163
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,541
--[MIKURU] You're hurting--
--[KYON] You idiot!

164
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,833
Hey! Cut it out!

165
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:23,708
[HARUHI]
What are you doing?!

166
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,958
[KYON]
I said, cut it out!

167
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,541
--[HARUHI] Let go!
--[KYON] Stop! Calm down!

[BOTH grunting]

169
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,083
[KYON]
What, are you crazy?!

170
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,750
People can't fire beams
from their eyes!

171
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,791
[HARUHI]
Hmph. I know that.

172
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,166
All I was trying to do
was get her to act like

173
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,125
she could really shoot a beam.

174
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,625
It's hard to believe
she's the hero

175
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,375
when she's
not that into it.

176
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,416
You never get it
when I'm joking around.

177
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,125
[KYON] That's because your jokes
never turn out to be jokes!

178
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,083
What if Miss Asahina
actually does shoot a beam

179
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,333
out of her eye?
What happens then, huh?!

180
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,500
You... can't, can you?

181
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,041
Huh?

182
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,916
If I might make a suggestion,
maybe after we shoot the scene,

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
we could figure out the CG part.

184
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,541
Thank you.

185
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,916
[KYON]
And who's gonna do that?

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,083
[HARUHI] That's what
I was gonna do anyway.

187
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,875
[HARUHI]
I didn't like that last take.

188
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,708
So we're gonna do it again.

189
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,833
When you strike this pose,

190
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,291
you're gonna shout,
"Mikuru Beam!"

191
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,208
Uh... Is this right?

192
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,666
No, it's like this.

193
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,208
And you gotta shut
your right eye, like this.

194
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,000
[HARUHI]
Okay, Mikuru, go for it!

195
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,333
[MIKURU]
Mi-Mikuru Beam!

196
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,208
[HARUHI] Ugh, you gotta
do it louder than that!

197
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,791
[MIKURU]
Mikuru Beam!

198
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,625
[HARUHI]
Don't be shy! Louder!

199
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,250
[MIKURU]
Uh... Mi-Mi-Mikuru Beam!

200
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,208
[HARUHI]
Project from the diaphragm!

201
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,166
[KYON] The stares from
the families watching us

202
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,750
are starting to hurt.

203
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,625
[HARUHI] Okay, good!
Let's do this for real!

204
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,000
[MIKURU whimpers]

205
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,333
Unleash the beam!

206
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,250
Mi-Mi-Mikuru Beam!

207
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,291
[KYON]
Wha--?!

208
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,333
[gasps]

209
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,375
Huh?

210
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,750
What's up, Yuki?

211
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,041
How'd you end up back there?

212
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,708
You're off your mark.

213
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,750
[gasps]

214
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,333
[MIKURU whimpering]

215
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,250
[HARUHI]
Wait! Stop! Cut!

216
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,541
[MIKURU]
Miss Nagato!

217
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,375
[HARUHI]
What are you doing, Yuki?! Stop!

218
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,291
Nagato! What are you doing?!
Come on, get off her!

219
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,166
[MIKURU sobbing]

220
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,083
[KYON]
Are you all right?

221
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,291
Huh?

222
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,166
Ugh, what do you guys
think you're doing?

223
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,791
If it's not in the script,
then knock it off.

224
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,000
Huh?

225
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,458
Mikuru, what happened
to the contact lens?

226
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,625
Huh? It's not there?

227
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,666
[KYON] At times like this,
you ask the person

228
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,250
who looks like they
know what's going on.

229
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,333
Nagato, do you know what
happened to the contact

230
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,875
Miss Asahina was wearing?

231
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:21,750
I do not.

232
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,166
[KYON]
Liar.

233
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,625
[HARUHI] Maybe it fell out when
you two were struggling.

234
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,250
Oh, it's gotta be
around here somewhere.

235
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,541
[KYON]
You could at least help us look.

236
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,291
It's so light, it could've
been blown away by the wind.

237
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,541
That's what I think.

238
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,541
[HARUHI]
What happened?

239
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,000
Did it break?

240
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,666
That's weird.
It must have been cheap.

241
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,583
Huh. Oh, well. It's the photo
club's equipment, so go figure.

242
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,541
Just tape up the back, Koizumi.

243
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,958
That should fix it for now.

244
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,375
[KOIZUMI]
You got it.

245
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,250
If you don't have
the contact lens,

246
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,166
then the shots aren't
going to match up.

247
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,083
What'll we do now?

248
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,625
I've got an idea!

249
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,000
We could have her
eye color change

250
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,083
right after
she transforms!

251
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,333
Tr-Transform?

252
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,833
[HARUHI]
Of course!

253
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,916
It's not realistic if you're
always in the same costume!

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,125
You need an alter ego!

255
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,333
[KYON]
There's something unreal about

256
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,666
people who want realism
in their fiction.

257
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,125
I think that's a wonderful idea!

258
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:20,000
I'd really like to wear some
normal clothes for a change!

259
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:20,875
That's what we'll do!

260
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:21,916
When you're in normal mode,

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,583
you'll wear the
bunny girl outfit!

262
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,333
[MIKURU]
What?! Wh-Wh-Why?!

263
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,541
Well, because that's the only
other outfit I brought along.

264
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,208
Besides, if you wore
your normal clothes,

265
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,708
it wouldn't look as cool
on the big screen.

266
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,875
Wait! Hold that thought!
I just got another idea!

267
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,875
Mikuru's alter ego
is a bunny girl

268
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,250
who's got
a job at the mall,

269
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,875
getting customers to come in
and shop at the stores.

270
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,583
And she only transforms
when she senses danger.

271
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,208
That's when she changes
into a battling waitress!

272
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,791
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

273
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,333
[KYON] What about the realism
you were talking about before?

274
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,708
[HARUHI]
Come on, let's go!

275
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,708
[MIKURU whimpering]

276
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,458
[KYON]
Your efforts... are appreciated.

277
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,791
Okay, you wanna explain the deal
with all the ad-libbing?

278
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,416
[NAGATO]
Here.

279
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,375
[KYON]
So you were the one who took it.

280
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,500
A laser.

281
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,000
[KYON]
Huh?

282
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,250
[KYON]
Hey, Nagato,

283
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,958
your explanations
tend to be a bit short.

284
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,708
D'you think you could try
maybe talking for at least,

285
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,250
oh I don't know, ten seconds?

286
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,666
It's a narrow, spatially
coherent beam of light

287
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,291
invisible to the eye.

288
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,583
[KYON]
Got it.

289
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,125
A narrow, spatially
coherent beam-y thingy...

290
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,916
Sorry, I'm even
more confused now.

291
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,916
A laser?

292
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,625
[NAGATO]
Yes.

293
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,791
Well, that's unexpected.

294
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:41,916
May I?

295
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,125
There's nothing unsual
about this contact lens.

296
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,750
[KYON]
What are you looking for?

297
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,125
Would you please show me
the palm of your right hand?

298
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,916
[KYON]
Huh?

299
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,375
Sorry, I didn't mean you.

300
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,125
I meant Miss Nagato.

301
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,708
[NAGATO]
It broke through my shield.

302
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,041
[KYON]
You act like it's no big deal!

303
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,958
Just looking at it hurts!

304
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,000
[NAGATO] It was strong;
I had to act fast.

305
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,875
Did the laser beam
that damaged your hand

306
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,000
come from Miss Asahina's
left eye?

307
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,083
[NAGATO]
Yes.

308
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,875
[KYON]
"Yes?" That's it?!

309
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,041
[NAGATO]
It will repair itself.

310
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,458
[KYON gasps]

311
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,291
You gotta be kidding!

312
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,625
Miss Asahina was just shooting
particle beams out of her eye!

313
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,541
It wasn't a particle beam.

314
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,958
Cohesive beam.

315
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,333
[KYON] Laser, mazer,
marker-like fop?! Whatever!

316
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,166
They're all the same
to us normals.

317
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,750
[KYON] The thing I'm having
trouble with is that

318
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,791
she has the ability
to fire heat rays.

319
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,166
It's not a heat ray.

320
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,750
Photon laser.

321
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,166
[KYON] Again, we don't need to
get all scientific about it!

322
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,458
Do you think Miss Asahina's
always had the power

323
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,250
to do something like this?

324
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:03,333
[NAGATO] No. Currently, Mikuru
Asahina is a normal human being.

325
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,166
She is no different
from anyone else.

326
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,375
Could there be some sort
of tiny mechanism inside?

327
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,916
[NAGATO] It is a simple
cosmetic accessory.

328
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,666
This is amazing.

329
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,666
[KYON] If Nagato hadn't
stepped up when she did

330
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,291
and blocked the laser beam
Miss Asahina shot at us,

331
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,500
it would've gone right
through the camera lens.

332
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,791
Then... it would've
gone through my eye,

333
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,416
cook some stuff and then
come out the back of my head!

334
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,875
Not a pretty picture.

335
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,208
[KOIZUMI] Miss Suzumiya
was the one who caused it.

336
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,291
She wanted to have a
Mikuru Beam in her movie,

337
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,208
so reality changed
and provided one for her.

338
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,375
Very interesting.

339
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,833
Wait a second!
Nobody cast a magic spell

340
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,250
on that contact lens!

341
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,875
So even if Haruhi wished for it,

342
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,500
how can a killer beam
come out of it?

343
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,083
That's easy.

344
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,750
Miss Suzumiya doesn't need magic
spells or strange technology.

345
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,375
All she has to do is believe
something exists, and it will.

346
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,166
Yeah, but she wouldn't
really expect a beam

347
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,958
to come shooting out of her eye!

348
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,541
Yes, that's true.

349
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,166
Miss Suzumiya has enough common
sense to know fact from fiction.

350
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,041
However, it's also true that
the common sense of this world

351
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,833
doesn't really apply to her.

352
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,916
Today's incident is
most likely the result

353
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,875
of a phenomenon of some sort.

354
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,041
I think tha--Uh-oh,
she's on her way back now.

355
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,541
We'll have to continue this
discussion a little later.

356
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,750
[HARUHI] Would you stop
complaining?! Geez!

357
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,291
Act like an actress!

358
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,625
To get on the fast track
to a Blue Ribbon award,

359
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,125
you can't be so shy
about stripping!

360
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,666
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

361
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,208
[KYON panting]

362
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,333
[KYON]
Zoom... in!

363
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,541
Confirmation obtained.

364
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,083
It's the real Miss Asahina.

365
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,708
What're you doing?!

366
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,083
Hmph.

367
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,750
You're not supposed
to be shooting anything

368
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,250
unless I tell you!

369
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,666
[KYON]
Yeah, I know...

370
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,000
I didn't press
the record button,

371
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:54,041
I was just...
focusing the camera.

372
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,583
Okay, okay, everyone!
Listen up now!

373
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,333
Let's make this happen!

374
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,583
[KYON] I shot footage
that was supposed to be

375
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,666
"day in the life of
Mikuru Asahina" stuff,

376
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,541
but I'm still not sure
what kind of life

377
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,500
she's supposed to have.

378
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:23,583
And after making Poor Miss
Asahina run this way and that...

379
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,083
[HARUHI]
Hmm...

380
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,166
I'm not feelin' the whole

381
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,708
mountain-in-the-background
thing.

382
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,625
We're gonna go into town!

383
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
[KYON]
Oh, geez!

384
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,291
[KYON]
So...

385
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,333
Miss Asahina wore her bunny girl
outfit until the sun went down.

386
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,375
[KYON] In fact, all
she ever did that day was

387
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,333
walk around in that costume.

388
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,208
Not that I'm complaining.

389
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,333
[KYON]
Asking for permission to film

390
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,458
was a foreign concept to Haruhi.

391
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,916
In her mind,
she was free to shoot

392
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,958
wherever and whatever
she wanted.

393
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,416
But then, her notion of
what "free" actually was

394
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,416
was similar to the
domination of the papacy

395
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,333
during the age of
Pope Innocent III or something.

396
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,833
[KYON] She doesn't get
what "free" means.

397
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,958
[HARUHI]
Hmm...

398
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,333
Yeah! That's good for today.

399
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,083
[GROUP sighs]

400
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,083
[KYON]
That was a long day.

401
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,583
But tomorrow's Sunday,
so I get to chill out.

402
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,041
Okay! See ya tomorrow!

403
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,125
You know the drill--

404
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,875
Same place, same time,
same everything!

405
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,958
[KYON]
She said, like it's no big deal.

406
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,083
I hope she gives us time
to change our clothes.

407
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,375
What was that?
We're on a tight schedule.

408
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,750
We can't take it easy
for even a second!

409
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,583
You're gonna have plenty
of time to kick back

410
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,500
once the arts festival is over.

411
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,916
Consider your calendars booked

412
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,916
until we get
this thing finished!

413
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,291
Here.

414
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,708
We're gonna do our best
to make this movie awesome!

415
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,791
Actually, since I'm
the one directing it,

416
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,875
this movie's awesomeness
is practically guaranteed!

417
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,708
Everthing else depends
on how hard you guys work!

418
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,333
Make sure you're
on time tomorrow.

419
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,333
If anyone shows up late,
I'm gonna bust some heads!

420
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:08,083
[HARUHI humming]

421
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,541
Don't worry, I'll take care
of telling Miss Asahina, okay?

422
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,583
Now what are you talking about?

423
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,583
[KOIZUMI]
The laser, of course!

424
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,958
Beams won't shoot out her eye
if she doesn't change the color.

425
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,375
On second thought,

426
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,541
perhaps we should take
further precautions against it.

427
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,333
I'm sure she'll
cooperate with us.

428
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,458
[chuckles] After all,
beams are dangerous things.

429
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,291
[KYON sighs]

430
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,833
Oh, man...

431
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,958
Nagato keeps jumping
in and saving my life.

432
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,250
You totally lied!

433
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,833
What's the deal, Kyon?!

434
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,750
Where's Miss Asahina, huh?!

435
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,833
The only reason I came is 'cause
you said she was gonna be here!

436
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,291
I don't see her, do you?!

437
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,583
I want my eye candy, bro!
Where is she?!

438
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,125
Thirty percent of
this picture's success

439
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,166
is riding on you
and that bunny tail!

440
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,708
[TANIGUCHI] Yeah, all I'm
seeing is Suzumiya's angry face.

441
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,041
It's a scam, man!

442
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,000
What the hell?!

443
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,708
[KYON]
Then stare at Nagato.

444
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,291
Just die already.

445
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,833
I kinda think that costume looks
pretty cool on Miss Nagato.

446
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,458
Hey, Kyon!

447
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,666
So what's up with Mikuru?

448
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,208
[KYON] It looks like Miss
Tsuruya's been tricked

449
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,083
into being an extra, too.

450
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,250
What are we supposed
to be doing today, huh?

451
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,375
I was told to show up
if I wasn't doing anything!

452
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,166
Hey, so what's it say on
Miss Suzumiya's arm band?

453
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,458
Ooh! What's the
video camera for?

454
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey, what's up with
Yuki's crazy outfit?

455
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,083
Koizumi's looking
super hot today! Whoa!

456
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,458
[KYON]
What a spaz.

457
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,875
What did you just say?!

458
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,416
Your stomach hurts?!

459
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,583
Idiot! Seriously, what are you,

460
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,750
still in junior high school
or something?!

461
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,125
You've got 30 seconds
to get over here!

462
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,916
[KYON] Miss Asahina
appears to be suffering

463
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
from a sudden bout
of shut-in syndrome.

464
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,125
[HARUHI growls]

465
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,833
I'm gonna have to go get her.

466
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,541
Where is that bag?

467
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,541
[tires screeching]

468
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,958
I think I can understand
Miss Asahina's apprehension.

469
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,458
It looks like she
might actually become

470
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,791
a real-life version of the
transforming heroine she plays.

471
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:26,208
The laser beam shooting out of
her eye is a bit much, though.

472
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,125
Anyway, not to worry.

473
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,333
It's safe to say
we won't have to

474
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,708
deal with any
strange beams again.

475
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,375
And why is that?

476
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,041
[KOIZUMI] Miss Nagato
gave us a hand with it.

477
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,458
What did you guys do
to Miss Asahina?

478
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,875
She neutralized the laser beam.

479
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,208
I'm not sure how, though.

480
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,166
Unlike some of the other
TFEI terminals out there,

481
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,166
Miss Nagato isn't
very talkative.

482
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,833
Okay... What's a TFEI?

483
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,708
Just an acronym my
organization assigned to them.

484
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,000
Its meaning isn't
anything important, though.

485
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,291
But as far as
Miss Nagato's concerned,

486
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,750
I have to admit,
she's most unusual.

487
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,250
Compared to the other TFEIs,
that is.

488
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,375
--[KYON grunts]
--[KOIZUMI chuckles]

489
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,458
[TANIGUCHI] Anyway, it was
pretty dark that night.

490
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,916
I was on the way home
from the store,

491
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,166
and I passed this taxi
parked by the curb.

492
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,250
[KUNIKIDA]
Oh yeah?

493
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,375
[TANIGUCHI]
So, I'm lookin' at it,

494
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:23,625
and you know that
light that tells you

495
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,250
if it's available or not?

496
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,625
I coulda sworn it said "love."

497
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,583
You don't see that every day.

498
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,583
Before I could take a
closer look at the thing,

499
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,000
it drove away.

500
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,750
So I'm standing there, right?

501
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,958
And then, I realized
the sign didn't say "love."

502
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,416
Love's what's missing
from my life!

503
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,875
Well, you never know. Maybe the
sign really did say "love."

504
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,916
Maybe it was a private taxi.

505
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,916
[KYON] I never thought we'd have
to rely on these two Einsteins.

506
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,541
Unbelievable.

507
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,041
[GROUP]
Huh?

508
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,458
[HARUHI]
Pretending to be sick!

509
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,125
You outta be
ashamed of yourself!

510
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,250
You're shooting today, period!

511
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,083
[TSURUYA]
Hiya, Mikuru!

512
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:03,166
Wow, you're looking
super sexy in that dress!

513
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,750
I'm sorry I'm so late!

514
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,000
[KYON]
Oh, that's okay. I don't mind.

515
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,916
[TSURUYA]
Hiya, Miss Suzumiya!

516
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,958
Sorry about yesterday.

517
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,291
I don't know what happened;

518
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,750
I just started firing lasers
all over the place.

519
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,666
Oh, don't worry,
it didn't hit me or anything.

520
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,708
Hm?

521
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,291
I was bitten.

522
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,666
[KYON]
Really? By what?

523
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,875
Miss Nagato.

524
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,625
She injected some
nanomachines into me.

525
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,708
And now, nothing's gonna
come out of my eye anymore.

526
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,125
Thank goodness.

527
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,166
[KYON]
What did she inject you with?

528
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,583
Nanomachines!

529
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,833
Last night, her and
Koizumi came over--

530
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,541
[TSURUYA]
Whatcha whisperin' about, huh?!

531
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,166
Ooh, you're so cute, Mikuru!

532
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,166
I wanna keep you as my pet!

533
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,166
[KYON] Don't stare.
You'll wither her cuteness.

534
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,125
[HARUHI]
I've got our location for today.

535
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,083
There's a big lake
by Koizumi's house

536
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,083
that's perfect
for the next scene!

537
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:59,166
Come on, everyone! There's a
ton of movie left to shoot.

538
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,041
