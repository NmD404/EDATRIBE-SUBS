1
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,208
[KYON]
Walking home after school,

2
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,875
side by side with a girl.

3
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,958
Sure, that sounds like a typical
scene out of some show

4
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,416
about teenage adolescence,
but I'd be lying

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,291
if I said I never
dreamed of doing that.

6
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,916
And right now, it looks like
I'm making that dream a reality.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah, so why am I
not happy about it?

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,250
[HARUHI]
That way.

9
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,708
Did you say something?

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,833
Um, no. Nothing.

11
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,500
[sighs]

12
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,833
[KYON] Pretty soon, we'll be
in front of Nagato's condo.

13
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,916
[HARUHI] Apparently, Asakura
lived here in number 505!

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
[KYON]
I see.

15
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,500
What're you talkin' about?
See what?

16
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,000
Uh, no, it's nothing.

17
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,250
And by the way, how do you
plan on getting in there?

18
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,250
You got the code for
the door or something?

19
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,208
No, I don't. But I'm sure if we
just wait around long enough--

20
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,250
[gasps]

21
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,500
[gasps]

22
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,875
Well, what're you waiting for?!

23
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,666
I'm telling you, it's strange.

24
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,625
Transferring to Canada
out of nowhere.

25
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,250
And they didn't even tell
anybody their new address.

26
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,875
I know, I heard you already.

27
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,041
Well hang on, 'cause
it gets even stranger.

28
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,708
Asakura didn't go to the junior
high schools in this city

29
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,333
before starting North High.

30
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,875
[KYON]
Well, of course she didn't.

31
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,208
I snooped around and found out
that she came to our school

32
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,250
from a city outside
our school zone.

33
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,833
That's totally suspicious!

34
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,000
It's not like North High's
a famous prep school,

35
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,625
it's just a plain old public
school you can find anywhere.

36
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,750
So why would she wanna
go to our school?

37
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,291
Dunno.

38
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,041
I can't believe it. She lived
really close to the school,

39
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,708
and she lived in a condo.

40
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,916
It's not a monthly deal
like an apartment;

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,166
this location's nice
so it's not cheap.

42
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,625
Did she commute from here to
junior high in another city?

43
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,875
[KYON]
I said I don't know.

44
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,583
[HARUHI] It looks like
we have to investigate

45
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,750
how long Asakura's
lived here, too.

46
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,291
What're you doing?
The place is empty.

47
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,666
It's not gonna open.

48
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,541
[KYON] I really think we're
wasting our time here...

49
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,750
[yawns]

50
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,583
Then we're going to
the manager's office.

51
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,416
Do you honestly think they're
just gonna hand over the keys?

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,125
No, I'm gonna ask
the manager how long

53
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,916
Asakura lived here. Come on!

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,666
Let's just give up and go home.

55
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,875
Even if we find out,

56
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,083
there's nothing we can
really do about it.

57
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,541
Move it!

58
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,500
We're both friends of Miss
Ryoko Asakura who lived here

59
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,041
and we heard she moved
away suddenly.

60
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,208
And we're wondering if you
could help us with something.

61
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,666
We need to get ahold of her,

62
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,375
but she didn't leave
us her address.

63
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,500
Did she happen to tell you
where she was moving?

64
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,916
Also, I was wondering if you
could tell us if you knew

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,750
how long Miss
Asakura's lived here.

66
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,375
[KYON] Wow. I wasn't really
expecting her to be so lucid.

67
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,125
[MANAGER]
Hmm... Huuuh?!

68
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,291
[HARUHI] We want to know what
Miss Ryoko Asakura's new address

69
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,625
is, and we want to know
how long she lived here!

70
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:38,041
Ah, that's right! You mean
Miss Asakura in number 505.

71
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,416
Funny thing about that,
I don't recall seeing

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,625
any moving van out front,
but the place was emptied out.

73
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,291
That really surprised me.

74
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,416
Wow, that's strange.
No moving van?

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,625
[MANAGER] Don't know
where she moved to either.

76
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,500
I don't know where to forward
any of their mail or packages

77
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,958
that might show up.
It's all bit troubling.

78
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,791
Do you know how long she
lived in number 505?

79
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,375
I'm thinkin' maybe
since three years ago?

80
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,833
Heh, I remember well, because
a pretty young girl came by

81
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,875
with a box of old-fashioned
sweets for me.

82
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,208
[HARUHI] What about her parents?
Did both of them work?

83
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,041
Do you happen to know what
her mother and father

84
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,416
did for a living?

85
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,250
Not a clue. Come to think,

86
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,041
I only saw the girl
every now and again.

87
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,458
And I never saw her parents,
never even said hello to 'em.

88
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,583
The condos here are pretty
expensive, aren't they?

89
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,333
I doubt that anyone would take
out a loan for a place like this

90
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,625
just for their daughter
to live all by herself.

91
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,291
They paid cash. They paid
for the whole thing

92
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,375
up front in cold, hard cash.

93
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,708
I always thought the family
was filthy rich.

94
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,333
[KYON]
Maybe she should be a detective.

95
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,666
She sure knows how
to get answers.

96
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,541
At least I wish I coulda
said goodbye to her.

97
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,583
It's a shame, you know?

98
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,375
By the way, heh, heh,
you're quite a looker,

99
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,833
if you don't mind me sayin' so.

100
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:52,708
[HARUHI] Thank you very much
for all of your time, sir.

101
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,916
[MANAGER]
Hey, boy.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,458
[KYON]
Hm?

103
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,083
[chuckles] That one's gonna
grow up to be a heck of a catch.

104
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,333
Don't you let her get
away now, y'hear?

105
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,375
Yuki?

106
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,375
[KYON]
Hmm?

107
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,625
[KYON]
Wow, she actually eats food.

108
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:15,041
I had no idea you lived in this
building. What a coincidence.

109
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,000
[KYON] I really doubt
it's a coincidence.

110
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,625
Have you heard anything about
what happened to Asakura?

111
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,625
You know she transferred
out today, right?

112
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,833
I see. Well, if you find
anything out, let me know.

113
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,333
You got it?

114
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,083
What happened to your glasses?

115
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,500
[KYON] Don't look at me.
I don't know what to say.

116
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,916
Be careful.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,291
[KYON]
Hm...?

118
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,625
[KYON] Great. What do I
have to be careful of now?

119
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,416
[HARUHI]
Let's go!

120
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Uh.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,166
[sighs]

122
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,333
So, what's next? Where are
you planning on going now?

123
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,541
I dunno.

124
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,208
[KYON]
Okay...

125
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,916
Uh, hey. Is it cool
if I go home now?

126
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,541
You know, Kyon, have you
ever realized just how

127
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,750
insignificant your existence
on this planet really is?

128
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,666
[KYON]
Now what is she talking about?

129
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,541
It happened to me,
and I'll never forget it.

130
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,375
Back when I was in the sixth
grade, my whole family

131
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,000
went out to go watch a baseball
game at the stadium.

132
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,750
I didn't really care about
baseball, but I was surprised

133
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,125
by what I saw when we got there.

134
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,458
Everywhere I looked,
I saw people.

135
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,791
On the other side of the
stadium, the people looked

136
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,958
so small, like little
moving grains of rice.

137
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,875
It was so crowded, I thought
that everyone in Japan

138
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,500
had to be packed in there.

139
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,791
So I turned to my
dad and asked him,

140
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,208
"Do you know how many people
are here right now?"

141
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:01,125
He said since the stadium
was full, probably 50,000.

142
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,083
After the game, the street
was filled with people

143
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,750
and I was really shocked
to see that, too.

144
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,458
To me, it seemed like there
was a ton of people there.

145
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,041
But then, I realized it could
only be a tiny fraction

146
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,958
of all the people in Japan.

147
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,583
When I got home,
I pulled out my calculator.

148
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,666
In Social Studies, I'd learned
the population of Japan

149
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,333
was a hundred-some odd million.

150
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,583
So I divided that by 50,000.

151
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,833
The answer was
one-two-thousandth.

152
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,250
That shocked me even more.
I was only one little person

153
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,291
in that big, crowded stadium
filled with people.

154
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,958
And, believe me, there were
so many people there.

155
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,916
But it was just a handful
of the entire population.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,666
Up till then, I always thought
that I was... I don't know...

157
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,708
...kind of a... special person.

158
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:47,541
It was fun to be with my family.
I had fun with my classmates.

159
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,083
And the school that
I was going to,

160
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:53,000
it had just about the most
interesting people anywhere.

161
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,083
But that night,
I realized it wasn't true.

162
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,666
All the stuff we did during
class that I thought was so fun

163
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,375
and cool was probably happening
just like that in classes

164
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,583
in other schools all over Japan.

165
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:08,375
There was nothing special
about my school at all.

166
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,291
When I realized that,
it suddenly felt like the

167
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:16,375
whole world around me started
to fade into a dull, gray void.

168
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,166
Brushing my teeth and
going to sleep at night,

169
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,875
waking up and eating
breakfast in the morning,

170
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,541
that stuff happened
all over the place.

171
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,625
They were everyday things
that everybody was doing.

172
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,958
When I thought about it like
that, everything became boring.

173
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,333
If there's really that
many people in the world,

174
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,125
then there had to be someone
who wasn't ordinary.

175
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,166
There had to be someone who was
living an interesting life.

176
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,708
There just had to be.

177
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,250
But why wasn't I that person?

178
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,916
So, that's how I felt till
I finished elementary school.

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,125
And then I had
another realization.

180
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,125
I realized fun things
wouldn't come my way

181
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,875
just by waiting for them.

182
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,000
I thought when I got into
junior high, it was time

183
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,458
for me to make a change.

184
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,041
I'd let the world know
I wasn't a girl

185
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,083
who wasn't happy sitting
around waiting,

186
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,541
and I've done my best
to become that person.

187
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,583
But in the end,
nothing happened.

188
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,708
More time went by,
and before I knew it,

189
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,541
I was in high school.

190
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,208
I thought that something
would change.

191
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,125
[KYON] The passing train
gave me a moment

192
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,916
to think about my response.

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,166
Should I voice an
opposing view point?

194
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,958
Maybe I should wax
philosophical about her dilemma.

195
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,208
I see...

196
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,583
[KYON]
I must be getting melancholic

197
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,958
if that's the best I
could come up with.

198
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,416
[HARUHI]
I'm going home.

199
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,666
[KYON] The truth is, I'd get
home faster if I went that way,

200
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,208
too. But the way Haruhi was
walking, well, it was like

201
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,833
her back was telling me
not to follow her.

202
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,958
I had no other choice but
to stand there all by myself

203
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,541
until I couldn't see
Haruhi's back anymore.

204
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,500
I wonder what the
hell I'm doing?

205
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,250
[KOIZUMI]
Hello there.

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,541
I was thinkin' that
perhaps today I'd

207
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,041
make good on that
promise I made you.

208
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,375
So I've just been hangin' around
out here until you got home.

209
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,666
You're sounding a little
bit like you know

210
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,791
where I've been all day.

211
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,291
Would you mind explaining
that to me.

212
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,250
[KOIZUMI] If it's possible,
do you think you might have

213
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,500
a little time to spare
for me right now?

214
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,291
Is it something to
do with Suzumiya?

215
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,583
It's somethin' to do
with Miss Suzumiya.

216
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,041
[KYON] It's pretty amazing
that this taxi showed up

217
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,375
just when you needed it.

218
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,833
Yeah. Weird.

219
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,833
So the other day, you asked
me to show you some proof

220
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,125
that I'm an ESPer.
You still wanna see it?

221
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,041
That perfect opportunity I was
talkin' about's popped up,

222
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,750
so I thought I'd
have you join me.

223
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,375
Why do we need to go so far
out of town to do this?

224
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,541
We're gonna have to drive a
little ways if you wanna see

225
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,541
my abilities as an ESPer.
It's timing, really.

226
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,083
A certain place,
the right conditions...

227
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,625
So now we're heading out
towards just such a location

228
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,750
and it meets all
the requirements

229
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,333
in exactly the right ways.

230
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,125
Do you still think that Haruhi's
some kind of god or something?

231
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,458
Let me ask you this:

232
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,583
Do you know what the
anthropic principle is?

233
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,083
[KYON]
Nope, never heard of it.

234
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay then, here it goes.

235
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,041
Basically, this is the theory
that the universe is

236
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,958
the way it is right
now simply because

237
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,958
human beings could
observe it and determine

238
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,791
that it was the way it is.
So, did you get all that?

239
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,458
I didn't get any of it

240
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:24,041
How about, I observe,
therefore the universe is.

241
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,875
Or something along those lines.

242
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,708
In other words, on
this particular world,

243
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,958
there are sentient beings
that are called "humans."

244
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,000
Now then, by discovering the
laws of physics in constants,

245
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,416
human beings can observe
the fact that the universe

246
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
actually exists at all. When
that happens, the existence

247
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,166
of the universe
becomes apparent.

248
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,125
Therefore, we can say if
the human beings who observe

249
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,958
the universe hadn't actually
evolved as far as they did,

250
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,708
then there wouldn't be any
observations, and the universe

251
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,416
wouldn't have anyone to
acknowledge its existence.

252
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,541
So it wouldn't really matter
if the universe existed or not.

253
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,708
The universe is because
human beings know it is.

254
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,416
Anyway, that's the reasoning
from the human perspective.

255
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,625
[KYON]
You're kidding, right?

256
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,875
I mean, with or without humans,

257
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,791
the universe is still
the universe.

258
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,333
Well, that's also correct.

259
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,625
Therefore, the anthropic
principle isn't anything more

260
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,125
than a speculative theory.

261
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,083
However, this theory does bring
up an interesting dilemma.

262
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,875
Why was the universe created
in such a way that human beings

263
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,166
could survive in it?

264
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,625
It would only take a slight
change in the gravitational

265
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,875
constant or particle mass ratio
for the universe to not allow

266
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,791
a planet like
the Earth to exist.

267
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,333
Okay, you sound like one of
those pamphlets from some

268
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,666
kooky religion that's into
science and technology.

269
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,125
Actually, I don't really believe
that humans were created

270
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,541
by a god or some
omnipotent being.

271
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,333
With all I've seen, something
like that doesn't make sense.

272
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,250
I say that, but I
still have doubts.

273
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,833
About what?

274
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,500
Sometimes I get the feeling that
we're all just a bunch of clowns

275
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:49,041
standing on our tiptoes at
the edge of a great abyss.

276
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,166
[chuckles] No, I'm just kidding.

277
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,125
[KYON] Look, I don't understand
a thing you just said.

278
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,625
The reason I went into the whole
anthropic principle thing

279
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,125
was to draw a comparison.

280
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,458
I haven't even gotten
to Miss Suzumiya yet.

281
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,541
And that's another thing.
Why are you and Nagato

282
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,291
and Miss Asahina all
so obsessed with Haruhi?

283
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,666
Well, I can't speak
for the others,

284
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,250
but I think she's charming.

285
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,250
Anyway, let's get
back to business.

286
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,458
I was wondering if you
remember the stuff I once

287
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,833
explained to you about how
the world may have in fact

288
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,625
been created by Miss Suzumiya.

289
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,833
Although it's annoying as hell,

290
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,625
yeah, I do remember
you saying that.

291
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,958
She has the power to turn
anything she wishes for

292
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,333
into a reality.

293
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,666
Oh, come on, you can't seriously
believe that's true.

294
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,583
Miss Suzumiya was positive
that aliens existed,

295
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,916
and then she wished that
there was such a thing.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,666
That's why Yuki Nagato's here.

297
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,333
She wanted to meet people
from the future,

298
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,666
so she wished for that, too.

299
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,375
And that's why Mikuru
Asahina showed up here.

300
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,458
And as for myself, she wished
for ESPers to be a reality,

301
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,166
and, lo and behold,
here I am at your service, sir.

302
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,708
Like I said, how do you
know all this anyway?

303
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,000
[KOIZUMI]
Well, about three years ago--

304
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,875
[KYON] I'm a little sick of
hearing about this

305
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,208
three years ago crap.

306
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,208
Three years ago, and
without any warning,

307
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,458
I just knew I had these
powers and I also knew

308
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,791
how I should use them.

309
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,041
And I wasn't alone.
There were other people

310
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,916
who had the same experience
as me at the same time.

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,583
And get this, all of us
knew that Haruhi Suzumiya

312
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,083
was the reason for it.

313
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,500
I can't explain why.

314
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,666
It was just something
that all of us knew.

315
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,750
All right, I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt,

316
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,333
but I really can't see Haruhi
doing that kind of stuff.

317
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,875
[KOIZUMI] At first, we couldn't
believe it ourselves either.

318
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,125
No one could wrap their heads
around the possibility

319
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,750
that, thanks to one girl,
the whole universe changed

320
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,375
or maybe it was created.

321
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,208
And on top of all that, it's
like there's nothing here

322
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,625
that's special enough
to hold her interest.

323
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,416
That's the scary thing about it.

324
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,583
Why scary?

325
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,000
[KOIZUMI]
I told you.

326
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,166
If you had the power to create
the universe at will,

327
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,666
you'd also have the power
to destroy this world.

328
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,125
Then you could rebuild it
into whatever you wanted.

329
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,083
If that really happened,
it would mean the end

330
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,708
of everything as we know it.

331
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,375
Although if it does happen,
and we'd have no way

332
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,500
of knowing it even
happened, then again,

333
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,791
maybe something like that
has happened before.

334
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,125
You never know.

335
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,291
Perhaps the universe has
been destroyed and rebuilt

336
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,833
lots of times already.

337
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,500
[KYON] Look, why don't you tell
Haruhi what you really are.

338
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,625
I'm sure if she found out
that ESPers were real,

339
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,125
she'd be ecstatic.

340
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,250
Then maybe she wouldn't think
about changing the world.

341
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,333
[KOIZUMI] Well, there's
a problem with that.

342
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,791
If Miss Suzumiya finds
out about us ESPers

343
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,625
and then starts thinkin'
our powers are like

344
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,916
some common occurrence,
the world would be

345
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,250
knee deep in ESPers.

346
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,958
Every law of physics
would get twisted up

347
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,291
like a garden hose.

348
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,791
The entire universe would
fall into chaos.

349
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,208
[KYON] If you guys exist
because Haruhi wished it,

350
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,625
why isn't she aware of it?

351
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,750
I mean, don't you
think that's strange?

352
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:26,916
[KOIZUMI]
Not really.

353
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,166
There's the part of
her that wished for

354
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,833
aliens, ESPers, and time
travelers to be real,

355
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,583
but she's also got a practical
side that thinks

356
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,333
those things are impossible.

357
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,333
She's conflicted
between the two.

358
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,500
Yes, she does and says
things that are eccentric,

359
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,250
but in reality, Miss Suzumiya's
just an ordinary human

360
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,166
with a good sense of what's
real and what's not.

361
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,083
In junior high, her energy
was like a sandstorm,

362
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,000
but in the past few months,
it's started to calm down.

363
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,250
I'd prefer it if
she stayed calm.

364
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,333
But now, we need to face
the fact that she's

365
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,041
creating a new tornado.

366
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,208
[KYON]
What d'you mean?

367
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,000
Hate to say it,
but it's your fault.

368
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,458
What do I have to do with this?

369
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,916
What're you talkin' about?
You're the one

370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,291
that gave her the idea to
form this strange club.

371
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,208
Because of the conversation
she had with you,

372
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,958
Haruhi decided that
she'd create a club

373
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,375
filled with all sorts of
weird people, didn't she?

374
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,666
Therefore, you are
responsible for this.

375
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,458
And because of that,
a member from each of

376
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,166
the three groups that
are interested in what

377
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,500
Haruhi Suzumiya is doing are
now conveniently gathered

378
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,500
together in one place.

379
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,208
[KYON]
So I'm the scapegoat.

380
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,625
[KOIZUMI] Well, actually,
there's more to it than that.

381
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,000
[KOIZUMI] I hate to say
this after draggin' you

382
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,333
all the way out here, but
if you'd prefer to go back,

383
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,291
it's not too late.

384
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,041
[KYON]
You gotta be kidding me.

385
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,958
All right then, so could you do
me a favor and close your eyes?

386
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,791
It'll only take a
couple of seconds.

387
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,083
[KYON]
Hmm?

388
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,041
[gasps]

389
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,166
[KYON]
Do you have to hold my hand?

390
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,416
[KOIZUMI]
Okay, open 'em.

391
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,333
[KOIZUMI]
The gap between dimensions.

392
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:18,166
Separate from the world we know,
completely closed space.

393
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,666
And in the middle
of this crosswalk

394
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,125
is the wall for
this closed space.

395
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,625
It's about five kilometers wide,
and normally there isn't any

396
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,458
physical way of
entering this space.

397
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,791
But that's one of
the powers I have.

398
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,333
That is, when the
conditions are right.

399
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,166
If you can picture a dome
that's been plopped down

400
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,500
over the city, well,
we're standing in it.

401
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,208
As we're in here, talking,
life goes on as normal

402
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,416
in the world outside the space.

403
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,916
And normal folks wandering
in here, well,

404
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,291
that doesn't happen too often.

405
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,541
Now, closed spaces created
completely at random.

406
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,791
Sometimes they pop up
every other day.

407
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,541
And sometimes you won't see
one for a couple of months.

408
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,875
One things for sure though,
whenever Miss Suzumiya

409
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,750
gets emotionally unstable,

410
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,666
it creates a space
like this somewhere.

411
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,916
I can sense when closed
space is created,

412
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,500
and I know where to go to
find the door to get in.

413
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,583
My powers aren't limited
to finding these things

414
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,625
and getting into them.

415
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,125
You could say that my power
somehow reflect upon the things

416
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,958
within Miss Suzumiya's
consciousness.

417
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,041
So if this closed place
is a pimple that appears

418
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,791
on Miss Suzumiya's spirit, we
ESPers are the acne medication.

419
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,083
You know, your metaphors
are hard to understand.

420
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,041
[KOIZUMI sighs]
Yeah, I get that a lot.

421
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,875
But then, you sure
are something.

422
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,500
I mean, here you are,
seeing all this,

423
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,833
but you don't seem surprised.

424
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,875
I've seen a lot of strange
things already.

425
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,416
Well, it looks like
it's starting.

426
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,833
Please, take a look behind you.

427
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,500
[KYON]
Hmm?

428
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,541
[gasps]

429
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,208
[gasps]

430
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,250
[KOIZUMI] When Miss Suzumiya's
irritation level

431
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,500
gets to a certain point,
these giants suddenly appear.

432
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,583
I think it's a form of
stress relief for her

433
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,500
with those things acting
out on her behalf

434
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,125
and destroying stuff.

435
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,750
I mean, she can't
go causing riots

436
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,458
or anything in the real world,

437
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,500
so she creates a closed
space and she's free

438
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,750
to unleash her fury inside it.

439
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,791
Don't you think that's logical?

440
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,458
I mean, that thing
shouldn't be able

441
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,791
to support its own weight.

442
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,875
It seems to transcend the
laws of physics, doesn't it?

443
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,625
Even if you brought in an army
unit in to fire rockets at it,

444
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,208
it still wouldn't
stop that thing.

445
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,583
So you mean that thing just
keeps tearing stuff up?!

446
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,666
Not quite.
Have a look over there.

447
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,625
[KOIZUMI]
Other ESPers.

448
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,250
They're just like me, people
that hunt down the giants

449
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,500
created and powered
by Miss Suzumiya.

450
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,833
Stay here. It's time
for me to go help out.

451
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:39,916
[KYON grunts]

452
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,666
[KYON] I can't believe
this is happening.

453
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,791
Sorry to make you wait.

454
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,750
Oh, there's something
else I wanna show you.

455
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,625
Last thing, I promise.

456
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,083
I don't think anything's
gonna top that.

457
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,625
Once us ESPers get
rid of the giant,

458
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,375
the bubble of closed
space disintegrates,

459
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,791
and it's quite the spectacle.

460
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,000
[car horn honks]

461
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,416
[KOIZUMI]
So, now do you understand?

462
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,583
[KYON]
Uh... no.

463
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,666
We have a name for
that giant you saw.

464
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,541
We call them "Shinjin,"
a man that's made by god.

465
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,291
The Shinjin are linked to
Miss Suzumiya's metal state

466
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,375
and so are we. Stop me if
this starts to get confusing.

467
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,000
When a closed space is created,
the Shinjin rise up

468
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,375
and take the form of giants.
That's when I get to unleash

469
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,291
my supernatural powers.
However, I can only use them

470
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,541
within the confines
of the closed space.

471
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:02,208
Right now, sitting in this cab,
I don't have any powers at all.

472
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,916
You're probably wondering
why I've been given

473
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,333
these powers, right?

474
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,583
I guess it would've been okay
for anybody to have 'em.

475
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,625
I just happened to
be the one chosen.

476
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,416
And as for the Shinjin,
we can't leave them alone

477
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,208
to do what they want. The
reason is, that the more stuff

478
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,625
the Shinjin get to destroy, the
bigger the closed space becomes.

479
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,250
That space we were just in?

480
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,541
Believe it or not, that was
one of the smaller ones.

481
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,875
If we left it alone,
it'd keep on growing,

482
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,000
getting bigger and bigger
until it covered the world.

483
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,333
If that happens, the world ends.

484
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,250
The gray void of the closed
space would replace

485
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,875
the world we live in now.

486
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,166
But how do you know it
would happen like that?

487
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,333
I don't know how I know,

488
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,250
I just know that
I know, you know?

489
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,708
And the same goes
for everyone else

490
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,708
that belongs to
the organization.

491
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,583
If we don't do something
about all this,

492
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,625
the world doesn't stand
a chance at all.

493
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:51,000
It's such a bother.

494
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,958
So please, keep an eye on
Miss Suzumiya's behavior.

495
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,375
Her mental state's been stable
for a while, but it looks

496
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,208
like it's starting
to get active again.

497
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:01,041
Things like today haven't
happened in a long time.

498
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,791
Even if I do keep
an eye on Haruhi,

499
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,708
don't you think I'm a little
out of my league here?

500
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,750
Hey now, don't sell
yourself so short.

501
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,041
If it were up to me, I'd let
you handle all the stuff

502
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,916
by yourself, 'cause if there's
anyone that I trust,

503
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,208
it'd be you.

504
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,708
But, there's many different
opinions among us,

505
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,416
and things are definitely
complicated.

506
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,791
[KYON] Koizumi tells me to keep
an eye on Haruhi's behavior,

507
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,166
and for some reason, Nagato
tells me to be careful.

508
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,416
Even though both
of them warned me,

509
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,208
I really didn't think anything
would happen right away.

510
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,291
If I could see into the future
and know that the very next day

511
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,500
I'd be in the middle of one
of the hairiest situations

512
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,666
ever in my life,

513
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,416
I'm sure I wouldn't
have been as calm

514
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,041
as I was right then.
