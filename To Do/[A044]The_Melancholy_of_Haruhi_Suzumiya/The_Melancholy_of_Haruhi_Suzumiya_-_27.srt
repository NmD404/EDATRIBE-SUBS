1
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:33,458
[KOIZUMI] Lord Suzumiya, we have
report from the scout fleet.

2
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,500
The enemy ships
have been located.

3
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,458
[NAGATO] Enemy fleet at altitude
eight minutes, twenty seconds.

4
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,708
Distance to our location
is 6.3 astronomical units

5
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,375
at 60% light speed.

6
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,541
The enemy's fleet consists of
approximately 15,000 ships.

7
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,000
They're here!
We're gonna annihilate 'em!

8
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,041
All ships to battle stations!

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,083
Aye, aye, ma'am.

10
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,583
[KOIZUMI]
All ships to battle stations!

11
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,958
Set all reactors
to combat output.

12
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,250
Set all thrusters to
first stage speeds.

13
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,583
3... 2... 1... Ignition!

14
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,958
[MIKURU]
L-Loading all cannons

15
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,708
with super
gravitational torpedoes!

16
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:13,458
And um... L-Load the
super proton cannon, too.

17
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,666
Um... All cannons
stand by to fire!

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,166
[NAGATO]
Maximum boosters.

19
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,000
Initiate electronic warfare.

20
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,875
ECM, ECCMs are
fully operational.

21
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:23,708
[HARUHI]
Excellent!

22
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,833
All ships, full speed ahead!

23
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,666
Hey, Haruhi, don't you
think it'd be better

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,333
if you pulled your
ships back a little bit?

25
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,458
Your fleet shouldn't
be so far in front of us.

26
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,875
[HARUHI]
What are you talking about?!

27
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,583
I wanna shoot beams and
missiles at the enemy, too!

28
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,666
[KYON] Look, when you're
playing shogi or chess,

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,375
the king isn't the one who
charges into enemy territory.

30
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,583
Oh, yeah... Good thinking.

31
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,208
Okay, Kyon. You guys
take care of it.

32
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,541
Go find the enemy leader,

33
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,750
and give him a good
pummeling with your cannons!

34
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,166
And make sure you win!

35
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,458
I want you to take those fools
from the Computer Club,

36
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,708
and beat the living daylights
out of those geek boys!

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,916
[KYON] Wouldn't it better if we
just raised the white flag now?

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,208
Well, I guess that's not
gonna be an option today.

39
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,041
[electronic gunfire]

40
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,416
[KYON] It is autumn now.
And the arts festival ended

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,291
several days ago
without incident.

42
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,625
Peace and quiet had
returned to the campus.

43
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,250
You could say, it was just
another ordinary day.

44
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,083
Then again, I shouldn't be so
quick to label an afternoon

45
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,916
spent at the SOS Brigade
headquarters as "ordinary."

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,541
I mean, every day,
I hang out with

47
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,000
an alien, a time traveler,
and an ESPer.

48
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,541
And I'm still as sane
and objective as ever.

49
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,791
[KYON]
Hmm...

50
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,666
I wonder if that makes
me special or something.

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,041
I'm sure Lacan's dying
to have a word with me.

52
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,416
[KOIZUMI]
You seem worried.

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,625
Is something wrong?

54
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,666
[KYON]
Nope.

55
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,500
[KYON] I was just thinking
about how awesome I am

56
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,208
for being able to cope
with this absurd situation.

57
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,500
And if you ask me, I think
I'm due for a little praise.

58
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,083
[KOIZUMI]
You're right.

59
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,458
Well? Would you like me to give
you some words of praise then?

60
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,666
[KYON] You praising me
won't make me any happier.

61
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,041
All it'll do is make me think

62
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,750
you've got something
up your sleeve.

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,500
[KOIZUMI laughs]
True enough.

64
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,375
[MIKURU]
I'm sorry this took so long.

65
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,958
I bought this stem
tea called karigane.

66
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,458
It's the first time
I've ever made it,

67
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,333
so I hope I brewed it well!

68
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,583
[KYON]
Nonsense.

69
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,458
If the divine hands of
Miss Asahina touched it,

70
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,833
even tap water would
taste better than

71
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,208
melted snow from the Alps!

72
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,125
[MIKURU giggles]

73
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,083
I hope you like the flavor!

74
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,041
By the way, where's
Miss Suzumiya?

75
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,500
She's got cleanup duty.

76
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,333
[KYON] Sure is peaceful when
she's not around, isn't it?

77
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,208
[KYON sighs]

78
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,875
[knocking]

79
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,000
[MIKURU]
Yes! I'm coming!

80
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,291
[door clicks]

81
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,458
[MIKURU gasps]

82
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,125
It's the president of
the Computer Club.

83
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,875
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT] Hm?
Isn't your leader here today?

84
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,583
You guys want something?

85
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:20,458
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT chuckles]
First, I want you to take this.

86
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,083
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT] You'll find
some game software on that disc.

87
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,416
Yeah, it's an original game
that we designed and developed.

88
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,833
We had it on display
at the arts festival.

89
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,458
Maybe you saw it?

90
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,125
I don't remember.

91
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,500
[KYON] The only memory I want
to retain from the arts festival

92
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:38,250
is the image of Miss Asahina
wearing that maid outfit!

93
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,583
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Really?

94
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,708
Perhaps we were exhibiting
it in the wrong place?

95
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:42,875
[KYON]
So what did you guys want?

96
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,750
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT gasps]
That's right!

97
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,500
We've come here to challenge
you and your brigade thing.

98
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,375
[KYON]
Huh?

99
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,250
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
A duel!

100
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,166
We fight a duel using our game!

101
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,458
Really, a duel!

102
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,708
We wanna duel against you guys!

103
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,125
[KYON]
I beg you...

104
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,541
Please stop repeating the
word "duel" over and over!

105
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,333
If Haruhi's ultra-sharp
ears could hear you,

106
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,166
you'd be as godd as--

107
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,500
[HARUHI yells]

108
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,708
[GROUP]
Chief!

109
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,500
So, you want a duel?
Who are you guys anyway?

110
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,541
A-ha, I bet you creeps are
some kinda secret syndicate

111
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,125
trying to muscle my
SOS Brigade outta the way.

112
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,625
I won't let that happen!

113
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,208
Annihilating evil and
shining light upon darkness

114
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,833
is the sworn duty
of a hero of justice!

115
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,291
[KYON]
Haruhi? You should listen to

116
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,083
what people have to
say before you kick them.

117
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,708
[HARUHI] Kyon, a duel is a
duel from the very moment

118
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,125
the word is mentioned!

119
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,625
Anything the loser says
after that is just an excuse.

120
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,458
Huh?

121
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,208
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT groans]

122
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,708
[HARUHI]
It's you guys?

123
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,416
Why are the Computer Club
geeks pickin' a fight with us?

124
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,333
[KYON] That's exactly what they
were about to explain to us

125
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,625
before you took 'em out.

126
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,250
[HARUHI]
Oh? They were, huh?

127
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,416
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Ugh, rotten SOS Brigade.

128
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Whatever!

129
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,958
We, the members of
the Computer Club,

130
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,541
hereby challenge the
SOS Brigade to a duel!

131
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,875
[HARUHI]
A duel, huh?

132
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,000
--[HARUHI growls]
--[COMPUTER PRESIDENT grunts]

133
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,041
[GROUP]
Chief!

134
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,458
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT whimpers]

135
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,458
[KYON] Come on, guys. It's time
to move the story along.

136
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,458
Well? What's this all about?

137
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,500
We made a game, and we
wanna fight you guys in it.

138
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,916
And if we win, you have
to return "it" to us.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,916
[HARUHI]
What do you mean? Return what?

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,833
If you're not using it,
give back our computer!

141
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,875
But, I use this
thing all the time!

142
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,250
A coupla days ago,
we cut our movie on it.

143
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,666
[KYON]
Actually, I did that.

144
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,500
[HARUHI] And we made
our homepage with it.

145
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,833
[KYON]
Yep, did that, too.

146
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,083
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
What are you talking about?!

147
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,833
You barely even
update your homepage!

148
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,625
[KYON] Ah-hah, so he's the guy
who's always visiting our site.

149
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,458
That explains the camel cricket.

150
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,250
Wait a second, when I
went over there,

151
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,958
and I said I wanted it,
you said you'd give it to me!

152
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,041
You remember it, too.
Don't you, Kyon?

153
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,041
You sure about that?

154
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,083
The deal is off!

155
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,041
And besides,
you bullied me into it!

156
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,583
In fact, I'm even willing to
forget the mental trauma

157
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,625
you inflicted upon me when
you abducted my computer.

158
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:43,708
Yes, I want to forget it.
We should both forget it.

159
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,583
Anyway, whatever! We wanna
fight you, you got it?!

160
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,166
Sure, you got it.

161
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,125
If you wanna fight us so bad,
then we accept your challenge!

162
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,875
Now then, what do you
guys give us if we win?

163
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,041
Well, let's see...

164
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,458
How about four
brand new laptops?

165
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,541
That's one laptop
for each member.

166
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,541
[HARUHI]
Are you serious?!

167
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,500
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Oh, yes.

168
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,041
[HARUHI]
Really?

169
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,833
I'm not gonna let you call it
off if you change your mind.

170
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,208
You understand?

171
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,000
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Don't worry. You have my word.

172
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,083
You're pretty confident,
aren't you? All right.

173
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,291
Now that I think about it,

174
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,291
you guys don't have
any girls in your club.

175
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,833
If you guys beat us,
we'll give her to you.

176
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:18,916
How 'bout that?

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,250
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Huh?!

178
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,291
I'm sure you guys can
find a good use for Yuki!

179
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,625
Since you're putting up four
computers against the one

180
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,958
we have, Yuki helps to
even out the stakes!

181
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,166
--Yeah! Well, I-I--
--[KYON] No.

182
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,291
There's a big
difference between

183
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,500
the specs of four
laptops and Nagato.

184
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,125
But you wouldn't know that.

185
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,416
Really? Then do you
want Mikuru instead?

186
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,666
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT gasps]

187
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,958
[KYON]
Why don't you be the prize?

188
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,208
If you're gonna bet anything,

189
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,750
how 'bout you go ahead
and bet your own body?

190
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,666
Stop being so selfish for once.

191
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,083
What are you talking about?!

192
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,666
Are you forgetting
that I'm the divine

193
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,875
and sacred figurehead
of the SOS Brigade?!

194
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,541
I'm your leader, dummy!

195
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,208
I will never give
up this position

196
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,833
except to the person I
feel is the chosen one.

197
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,083
[KYON] You mean
you're gonna stay here

198
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,541
even after you graduate?!

199
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,708
What's it gonna be?
Who do you prefer?

200
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,625
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Well-- I-- Uh...

201
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,541
I see, so that's
how it's gonna be.

202
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,250
If you insist, you can have me.

203
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,750
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
No! No! Absolutely no. No way.

204
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,958
[HARUHI]
Hm?

205
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,291
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
The game is an online

206
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,125
space battle simulator.
Five players versus five.

207
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,250
The battle will begin at 4:00,
one week from today.

208
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,833
Until then, you should
brush up on your skills.

209
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,208
We'll be disappointed
if you're too weak.

210
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,041
[KYON] He's acting
like he's already won.

211
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,958
How generous of you to give
us our prizes in advance!

212
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,541
Mm-hmm!

213
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,125
After all, each brigade member
should have their own computer!

214
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,375
[KYON] And she's acting
the exact same way.

215
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,458
[KYON]
About this duel coming up,

216
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,125
let's just try not
to cheat, okay?

217
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,625
[KOIZUMI]
Cheat? Us?

218
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,041
Yeah, this time around,

219
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,500
all alien, futuristic, and ESPer
methods of cheating are

220
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,416
100% completely
off-limits. You got that?

221
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,333
We will fight fairly and
accept the outcome,

222
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,000
whatever that may be.
That is the best way.

223
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,416
Then you won't mind if we
just happen to lose the game.

224
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
That's right. The only
thing we're gonna lose

225
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,416
is that computer
we stole from them.

226
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,750
And I guess that's
not such a big deal.

227
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,500
[KYON]
Although, if that does happen,

228
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,166
I'm gonna need to relocate
the Asahina gallery.

229
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,208
Oh, I'm not talkin'
about the computer.

230
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,958
Miss Suzumiya doesn't like
to lose at anything, ever.

231
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,416
Remember?

232
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,250
[KOIZUMI] Whenever she feels
like she's going to lose,

233
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,000
she creates closed space.

234
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,583
And then, she lets those
you-know-what's loose.

235
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,916
You'll be okay with that?

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,500
I don't really care.

237
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,166
Besides, it's about damn time
that girl learned her lesson.

238
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,208
--KOIZUMI chuckles]
--[KYON] Hm?

239
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,875
What's up?
You're creeping me out.

240
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,583
No, sorry. I just got
a bit jealous, is all.

241
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,000
I admit, I'm a little envious
of the invisible trust

242
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,791
that exists between Miss
Suzumiya and yourself.

243
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,041
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

244
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,250
Let's say we lose the game

245
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,708
against the Computer
Club next week,

246
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,208
and based on what you've
already seen with your own eyes,

247
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,041
you're choosing to
believe that Miss Suzumiya

248
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,500
won't create a closed
space this time.

249
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,208
Well? That's because
you trust her.

250
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,916
Then, there's Miss Suzumiya.
She believes you're the one

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,833
who's goin' to lead
our team to victory.

252
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,750
So, she trusts you.

253
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,583
She's so confident
she's going to win

254
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,291
that she'd risk losing her
own members in the wager.

255
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,125
That, is trust.

256
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,666
[KOIZUMI] Although she'd never
come right out and say it,

257
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,916
the truth of the matter is
that between the two of you,

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,541
there is the most ideal
bond of trust I've ever seen.

259
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,958
[electronic gunfire]

260
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,916
[KOIZUMI] "The Day of
Sagittarius Part Three," huh?

261
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,666
So there was a part one and
part two before this version?

262
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,166
[HARUHI]
Lame.

263
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,708
Sounds like they were going
for something cool sounding.

264
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,458
Doesn't make any sense, though.

265
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,875
[KYON]
What're you talking about?

266
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,958
Is the "SOS Brigade" any better?

267
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,208
Well, at least the game
looks simple enough to play.

268
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,083
Each of the five players
is given a fleet of

269
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,708
15,000 space ships,

270
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,041
which they're able to command
from their own computer.

271
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,208
You win the game by destorying
all the enemy ships

272
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,583
or by blowing up the
enemy leader's flagship.

273
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,208
What's with this bright spot?

274
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,916
[KOIZUMI]
That's your line of sight.

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,333
You can see enemy and obstacles

276
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,291
only when they're
inside that bubble.

277
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,666
In order to play,

278
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,708
you'll have to send out
scout ships from your fleet

279
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,541
to increase your
field of vision.

280
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,416
Basically, in order
to win this thing,

281
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,750
it looks like you need to find
out where your enemy is,

282
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,583
and take 'em out
as fast as you can.

283
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,458
[MIKURU] So you can't see
the enemy in the beginning?

284
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,500
Um, Kyon? I, uh... I'm not
really good at stuff like this.

285
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,333
I don't think I
understand it at all.

286
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,625
Hey, don't worry.

287
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,333
Just take your time,
get used to the controls,

288
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,791
and try and have
some fun with it.

289
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,291
This is not supposed to be fun!

290
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,166
We're gonna crush the
Computer Club so hard,

291
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,958
they won't be able to stand up!

292
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,875
Now let's get some
training happening!

293
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,916
Naturally, I'll be
commanding this outfit.

294
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,291
Now hop to it! Battle positions!

295
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,041
[KYON] At least we've
got Nagato on our side.

296
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,750
I take it back. We're dead!

297
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,250
[HARUHI]
All ships, attack!

298
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,625
[explosions]

299
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,916
[GROUP]
Aww!

300
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,166
[HARUHI]
All ships, attack!

301
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,833
[explosions]

302
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,041
[GROUP]
Aww!

303
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,375
[HARUHI]
All ships, attack!

304
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,375
[explosions]

305
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,583
[GROUP]
Aww!

306
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,958
[HARUHI]
All ships, attack!

307
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,500
--[explosions]
--[GROUP] Aww!

308
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,500
[HARUHI growls]
We got beat again!

309
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,083
Killing in this rotten
game's irritating me!

310
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,916
It's because you
keep rushing in!

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,041
You don't just charge into
battle in the beginning.

312
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,500
Geez! This thing is such a drag!

313
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,875
I'd much rather play something
easier to understand.

314
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:07,916
[KYON groans]

315
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,583
Is it just me or are you
having fun over there?

316
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,083
I meant what I said before,

317
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,750
There's absolutely no
cheating this time, okay?

318
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,791
[HARUHI] Today, the skies are
clear and the waves are high.

319
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,541
This battle will decide
the destiny of the empire!

320
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,125
And believe me, this is
just the beginning.

321
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,500
We'll vaporize anything
that gets in our way.

322
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,333
The SOS Brigade will
make its name known

323
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,916
to the ends of the universe!

324
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
One day, I'll talk to the
Board of Education about

325
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,500
creating branches of the SOS
Brigade in every public school!

326
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,875
Obviously, we're going to win,

327
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,250
but I still won't
allow any slacking!

328
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,875
Now, pulverize 'em!

329
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,333
[KYON sighs]

330
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,916
[KYON] Whatever gives her
that confidence, I want it.

331
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,666
Even if it's only
two miligrams, I want it.

332
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,791
Oh, really?

333
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:59,958
Do you want me to
pump some into you?

334
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,416
[HARUHI giggles]
There! Bet that did the trick!

335
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,041
What good does it
do to stare at me

336
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,416
and make me uncomfortable?

337
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,833
[HARUHI] I charged my glare
with a bunch of energy

338
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,375
and sent it to you!

339
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,750
You probably felt something
like your body getting warmer.

340
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,250
Maybe you're starting to sweat!

341
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,333
You feel it, don't you?
You feel it?

342
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,708
[KYON] No, I felt like
my life was in danger.

343
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,750
Looks like the
game's about to begin.

344
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:28,791
[countdown beeping]

345
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,083
[beep]

346
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,708
All ships, ahead!

347
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,791
[KYON]
Well, the game's begun.

348
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,916
And as luck would have it,

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
we've just run
across an enemy fleet.

350
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,000
Thanks to Nagato,

351
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,583
we 've somehow managed to figure
out the enemy's movements.

352
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,250
She scouts and fights
the enemy simultaneously.

353
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,375
Talk about bravery.

354
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,458
[MIKURU screaming]

355
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,875
[KYON]
Miss Asahina, the gamig novice,

356
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,666
and Haruhi, the charging idiot,
are completely useless.

357
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,833
It's five against three, and
we're the ones outnumbered.

358
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,375
The enemy's usin' a "V"
formation to try to lure us

359
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,791
into their firing range.

360
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,416
I think we should counter
with a defensive strategy.

361
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,166
Sounds like a great plan.

362
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,541
But what would Haruhi say
about this strategy of yours?

363
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,458
--[explosion]
--[KYON groans]

364
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,833
What the--?!

365
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,625
[KYON] We're being attacked
by another enemy fleet?

366
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,291
Where'd these guys come from?!

367
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,250
They're goin'
after my fleet, too!

368
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,500
How did they figure
out where we were?

369
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,458
What're you doing?! Hurry up
and start retaliating!

370
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,666
I didn't need you
to tell me that.

371
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,750
Starboard, 90 degrees.
Open all cannons.

372
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,083
[KOIZUMI] It sounds like
someone's getting serious

373
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,625
about this game.

374
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,083
[KYON]
Enemy fleet in range!

375
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:33,291
Beam cannons, open fire!
Wait, hang on!

376
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,583
Damn, they got away.

377
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,041
Same over here. They
unloaded on us for a bit,

378
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,958
then they vanished
into thin air.

379
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,041
The old hit-and-run tactic, huh?

380
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,375
[KOIZUMI]
Whoa! They're back. Other side.

381
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,791
[KYON]
They're just picking us off.

382
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,125
[HARUHI]
What are you doing, slow poke?!

383
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,625
They're getting away!

384
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,625
[KYON] I know! But I can't
do anything to stop them!

385
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,625
Those jerks are hitting
us from both sides!

386
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,041
[HARUHI]
It's time to launch the ---dams.

387
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,500
[KYON]
Here I go! Wait!

388
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,416
[whimpering]
Um...

389
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,250
Can someone please tell
me where I am right now?

390
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,958
[HARUHI]
Ugh! I can't take this anymore!

391
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,250
Attention, fleets!
Full speed ahead!

392
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,666
I'm gonna find the enemy leader
and pummel him to bits!

393
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,291
[KYON]
What're you doing? Pull back!

394
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,875
[KOIZUMI]
He's right; leave this to us!

395
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,208
[HARUHI]
Out of my way!

396
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,500
The leaders are gonna
duke this out, one on one!

397
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,541
[KYON] Fall back! We don't
even know where he is!

398
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,500
[HARUHI] Then leave it
to me! I'll find him!

399
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,958
[KYON]
I'm telling you, fall back!

400
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,625
[KOIZUMI] Let's calm down.
The enemy's shooting at us.

401
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,375
[MIKURU] Hey, guys!
Where did everyone go?

402
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,291
[HARUHI]
Move!

403
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,708
[KYON]
I can't! I'm stuck here!

404
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,500
We're gonna lose
this thing. Huh?

405
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,291
[KYON gasps]
What the...?!

406
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,291
[KOIZUMI]
Wow, she split up her fleet.

407
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,750
You can do that?

408
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,916
I remember reading about it
in the back of the manual.

409
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,541
Apparently, you can split your
fleet up into 20 squadrons

410
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,791
and control them separately.

411
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,416
The thing is, it isn't
humanly possible to control

412
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,541
so many squadrons
at the same time.

413
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,583
So, nobody was doing it.

414
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,666
[KYON]
Isn't humanly possible, huh?

415
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,375
[MIKURU]
Um... Uh...

416
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,333
Aren't you afraid
you'll break the keyboard

417
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,666
hitting it that hard?

418
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,458
[HARUHI] Anyone accepting
defeat will be punished

419
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,625
by running ten laps
around the school!

420
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,708
Naked!

421
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,333
And you'll have to yell,
"Green martians

422
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,500
are chasing me!" for
the whole ten laps!

423
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,416
Uh... You know... Hm?

424
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,541
[KYON]
Um, Miss Nagato? Yeah, hi.

425
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,583
What exactly are
you doing right now?

426
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:17,958
Hey, Nagato.

427
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:18,791
[NAGATO]
What?

428
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,875
I thought I told you before

429
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,416
that we weren't
gonna cheat this time.

430
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,958
[NAGATO]
I am not.

431
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,000
Currently, I am not engaged
in manipulating special data.

432
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,333
I am adhering to
the rules of the game.

433
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,000
Uh-- You're serious?

434
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,291
[NAGATO]
I am serious.

435
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,500
The Computer Club is
the one that is cheating.

436
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,666
They are? Then, what
are they doing?

437
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,833
[NAGATO] They've deactivated
their scouting mode.

438
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,250
Since the beginning of the game,

439
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,625
everything on the map,
including our positions,

440
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,000
has been visible.

441
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,375
It's amazing! I understood
what you just said.

442
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,666
They've got it fixed so that we
can't see where they're hiding,

443
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,583
but they can see where we are.

444
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,083
It's no wonder
they're killing us.

445
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:53,875
Yes.

446
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,958
Since we started playing,

447
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,125
we never had any
option except losing.

448
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,000
I want to change that.

449
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,375
[KYON sighs]

450
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,833
Okay, they've been cheating,
I understand that.

451
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,791
However, if we start using
magic to cheat back at them,

452
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,083
at the end of the day,
we're no better than they are!

453
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,333
You get where I'm coming from?

454
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,250
In fact, we'd be
worse than them.

455
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,333
I repeat, I am not
disobeying your orders.

456
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,250
I would like to modify
the program in a matter

457
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,458
that is consistent with the
current levels of earth

458
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,916
technology. ensuring equal
playing conditions.

459
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,166
May I?

460
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,041
[KYON gasps]

461
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:38,000
Are you doing this
because you want to win?

462
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,250
[KYON]
Uh...

463
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,583
[chuckles]

464
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,625
Okay! Let's do it then!

465
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,333
Done.

466
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,833
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Nice! Very Nice!

467
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:50,916
I was a little worried there

468
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,333
when they fired up
the squadron mode,

469
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,250
but we've still got
the advantage.

470
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,208
We see them,
but they can't see us.

471
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,250
Time to wrap this up.
Destroy them!

472
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,500
Annihilate the SOS Brigade!

473
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,500
Wha...?!

474
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:10,875
[MEMBER A] Chief! Scouting
mode has been activated!

475
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,041
[MEMBER B] They're
attacking our blind spot!

476
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,250
[MEMBER C] We can't
figure out their movements!

477
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,708
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
What're you idiots doing?!

478
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,125
Deactivate scouting mode!
Turn it off!

479
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,541
[MEMBER A] We can't
change it! It's denying access!

480
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,125
We're locked out!

481
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,666
That's... Impossible!

482
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,750
I gotcha!

483
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:30,958
Fire, fire, fire!

484
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:31,958
Say good night!

485
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:32,875
[HARUHI]
Damn you, Kyon!

486
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,250
That's my enemy!

487
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,833
We've managed to destroy
two of the enemy's fleets.

488
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,333
And the otherse are
lookin' a bit confused.

489
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,791
Thanks to Miss Nagato's
squadrons, it looks like the

490
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,375
tides of war have finally
turned in our favor.

491
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,583
[KYON] Yeah, but the enemy
leader's still out there.

492
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,166
So how're we gonna take him out?

493
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,083
[NAGATO]
No problem.

494
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,791
I'll force him your way.

495
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT yelps]
Dammit!

496
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,333
Wow, he's driving his
fleet right into our sights!

497
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,083
Just like a mouse
caught in a trap.

498
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,666
Um... Am I supposed
to shoot this thing?

499
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,708
I don't get what just happened,
but great job, guys!

500
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,416
All ships, open fire!

501
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,041
Go out there and
burn the enemy leader

502
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,916
with all the fires of hell!

503
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,125
He's getting away!

504
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,291
This can't be happening!
Glory to the Computer Club!

505
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,458
[HARUHI giggles]

506
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,750
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
I lost... We were beaten...

507
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,958
I'll apologize now.
I admit it, I'm sorry.

508
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,041
But I can't believe... I--

509
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,041
I just can't believe the program
was rewritten during gameplay!

510
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,416
That's impossible!

511
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,958
[HARUHI]
What are you mumbling about?

512
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,625
Whatever. You do remember
your promise, right?

513
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,625
These laptops belong
to the SOS Brigade now,

514
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,750
and I won't let
you back out of it.

515
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,000
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Hey... Um...

516
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:05,916
[KYON]
Hm?

517
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,958
Tell me, I wanna
know who did it.

518
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,958
Wheover cracked that program has
to be some kinda super hacker.

519
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,416
Nevermind, I think
I know who it was.

520
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,083
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Uh...

521
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,333
If you ever have free time,

522
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,041
I was wondering
if you'd consider

523
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:25,000
participating in Computer
Club activities. Please?

524
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,583
[KYON] Great, he's trying
to recruit Yuki.

525
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,625
Whoa! Hang on! You can't just
rent Yuki without my permission!

526
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,041
Got it!?

527
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,541
She's the silent character in
the SOS Brigade line-up!

528
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,208
And besides, I saw
her first, so there!

529
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,250
Hang on.

530
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,083
[KYON] I think that even
someone like Nagato

531
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,000
has to have other interests.

532
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,500
Now, I can't be sure,

533
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,583
but it looked to me like
she was having fun,

534
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,208
pounding away on that keyboard.

535
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,083
Besides, I'll bet
she gets tired of

536
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,208
observing Haruhi all
the time. I know I would.

537
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,125
I mean, even a
humanoid interface

538
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,125
designed for contact
with organic life forms

539
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,166
needs a break
every now and then.

540
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,708
Just do what you want, okay?

541
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,958
If you feel like
going next door,

542
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,541
and playing around
on their computers,

543
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,208
it's totally cool.

544
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,041
Oh.

545
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,750
Perhaps I will.

546
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,708
--[HARUHI gasps]
--Seriously?!

547
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,125
Oh, thank you!

548
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,333
There you go.

549
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,083
I guess it's okay if
Yuki's fine with it.

550
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,166
Oh, by the way...

551
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,041
[COMPUTER PRESIDENT]
Eh?

552
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,750
The Computer Club lost the game!

553
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,125
And as the losers,

554
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,166
you have to do whatever
the winners tell you to do!

555
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,083
What?!

556
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,125
[HARUHI]
All you need to do is

557
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,916
swear your absolute
loyalty to me.

558
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh, don't worry.
I'll treat you nice.

559
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,083
[sighs]

560
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,541
[HARUHI]
And if you guys work real hard,

561
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,375
I just might let you become
a member of the brigade!

562
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,458
Koizumi! Draw up a
contract for him to sign!

563
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,333
[KOIZUMI]
As you wish, Your Highness.
